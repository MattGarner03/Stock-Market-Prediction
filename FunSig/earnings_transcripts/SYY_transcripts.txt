Kevin Hourican: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Q3 was a difficult quarter for the industry, that began with wildfires in California, which significantly impacted our important Southern California region, and included historic winter storms throughout the country in January and February. Besides these events as having an approximately 150 basis points negative impact on sales trends for food distributors in the quarter. Poor traffic to restaurants during the quarter reflected these challenges. With January down 1.3%, February down 5.7%, and March down 2.3%. The quarter overall was down 3.1% which represented a 150 basis points deceleration versus Q2's traffic level of down 1.6%. In addition to the effects of adverse weather in the quarter, consumer confidence has been shaken by the recent trade policy and tariff negotiations. As you are aware, closely followed Michigan Consumer Confidence Survey recently highlighted that consumers are expressing one of the lowest levels of confidence in approximately 20 years. The decline in confidence levels gives us concern for the full year ahead. Speak more about tariffs and their impact on the industry a few moments. As a reminder, Kenny and I communicated on our Q2 call that we had anticipated nominal improvement in the business macro environment going from the first half into the second half of our fiscal year. Unfortunately, at this time, we have experienced the opposite macro effect and Sysco Corporation's business performance for Q3 reflects the industry traffic deceleration. We are disappointed with the quarter but it is important to note two things. Sysco Corporation's USFS volume trends for the quarter trended in line with the industry traffic deceleration. And more importantly, business performance in March strengthened over the course of the month. And while it is unusual for us to comment about the first month of a quarter, given the uncertainties in the macro backdrop and given our softer than expected Q3 we felt it was important to highlight our April performance was stronger than March. For the month of April, industry traffic adjusted for calendar shifts has trended slightly better than March. The Easter shift in the period complicates year over year comparisons However, even when adjusting for the Easter calendar shift, April has produced stronger volume growth rates versus March, and versus Q3. We are pleased to see the relatively stronger start to where Q4 but we are cautiously planning our business for the remainder of 2025 given the aforementioned tariff uncertainties in consumer confidence data. Given that macro backdrop I will now pivot to Sysco Corporation's results for the quarter where as you can see on slide number four, we delivered sales results of $19.6 billion up 1.1% on a reported basis up 1.8% to last year when excluding the divestiture of Mexico. We delivered adjusted operating income of $773 million down 3.3% to last year and adjusted EPS of $0.96 flat to last year. We converted negative 3.1% foot traffic to restaurants into positive sales by winning new business and successfully passing through approximately 2.1% inflation for the quarter. Importantly, we are making solid progress on our $100 million profit improvement efforts that Kenny discussed last quarter. With a positive contribution in the period from our strategic sourcing and inbound logistics efficiency improvements. Those efforts will have an increased positive impact on our Q4. Our international segment posted another compelling quarter with profit growth of double digits This is the sixth consecutive quarter of double digit profit growth from our international segment. Within USFS, our national sales business delivered flat volume growth for the quarter and sales growth of 2.3%. Both figures were below our expectations. Driven by softness in the national restaurant sector. Within national sales, our non commercial business continues to perform with strength in food service management, education, travel and leisure. Our local business delivered negative 3.5% volume growth for the quarter. This was a step down versus our Q2 performance. But the step down was consistent with the traffic change to the industry on a quarter over quarter basis. Lastly, our Sigma segment delivered sales growth of 9.5% for the quarter driven by strong customer wins versus prior year. The sales and volume growth in Sigma will begin to reduce in coming quarters as we begin to lap large customer wins within the last year. Sigma is having a very strong year growing top line 9% and bottom line 17% year to date. We are disappointed with the overall financial performance in the quarter as we had expected a stronger macro backdrop. With that said, important initiatives to improve our local business are beginning to deliver results. It is unfortunate that our self help improvement is coming at the same time that the industry backdrop softened. However, we remain 100% focused on accelerating our progress. We anticipate that we will increase our progress on these important initiatives in the coming quarters. That I have covered the general backdrop of the industry, and Sysco Corporation's sales, volume and profit performance, would like to provide an update on specific initiatives are driving to improve our performance results. First, I'd like to discuss the state of our sales consultant work I am pleased to report that our 2025 hiring cohorts are progressing nice up their productivity curve. Each of our hiring classes are on target to achieve their sales and volume targets. Importantly, I can also report today that our sales consultant retention has significantly improved versus the first half of the year. Etsy turnover was a headwind for Sysco Corporation in the first half of fiscal 2025 and we expect it will become a tailwind in 2026. As we lap those colleague departures, and our new hires increase their productivity. Regarding colleague retention, we just completed our annual employment engagement survey and our sales colleague job satisfaction was up solidly year over year. Colleague engagement drives retention, colleague retention drives positive customer engagement. Given questions we have received on recent investor calls, would like to explain the net net impact of colleague turnover in a bit more detail that you have clarity on what we are experiencing. During the first half of 2025, we experienced elevated colleague turnover that peaked in September. The negative impact of SC departures is immediate as we need to reassign customer locations to other Sysco Corporation colleagues. During that customer realignment, select customer attrition occurs. As such, departing colleague has an immediate negative headwind impact on our business and that headwind can persist for a full 12 months until you lap the customer departure. In contrast to the immediate impact of a departure a colleague hiring has the opposite time horizon. New colleague hiring has a slow and gradual positive impact on the New colleagues start with a small book of business and grow that business over time as they expand their territory. The length of time to become productive for a new sales consultant is approximately 12 to 18 months. On average. As it can be quicker or slower depending upon the level of sales experience of the new hire. Putting it all together, as a result of these two factors, fiscal 2025 has experienced a net headwind from our colleague population. Given that we have stabilized our retention figures, and that our new hires are performing, we expect the scales of this equation to dip from negative to positive as we enter fiscal 2026. The second local topic I would like to highlight today is colleague compensation and performance management. Our sales consultants are embracing our compensation model. They are driving the right selling behaviors and they are on average making more money than prior year. These actions are most notable in the winning of new business, where we have opened more new accounts in March than any prior period outside of COVID snapback. We have work to do in order to improve customer retention, as industry churn across distributors is currently above its historical average. As a result, have a company wide effort on improving local customer retention, to complement the success we are having with new account wins. The hyperfocus on service and retention will be a stronger positive vector in fiscal 2026 versus 2025. The third topic for today is our fulfillment capacity expansion. We We previously spoke to opening a new facility in Allentown, PA earlier this year. That new DC is focused on winning new business, in the population dense northeast corridor. I recently visited our next new site just outside Tampa will support the growing Florida market. The new facility in Tampa will open this summer and will increase our ability to win net new business in the Florida region by expanding our storage and throughput capacity, especially to support the peak winter months. Internationally, are on track to open new facilities in Sweden and Ireland in the summer, Each of these projects will support expanded storage and throughput capacity capacity that we believe will enable us to profitably grow our business and target rich international geographies. Lastly, would like to speak to our work to improve our pricing agility. At the CAGNY conference in February, Sysco Corporation introduced a new local sales initiative that is currently in pilot mode in select As I said at CAGNY, are pleased with our margin discipline and overall price competitiveness utilizing our current pricing system and architecture. With that said, it is a competitive marketplace. And competition will occasionally offer our customers savings on select items. Today our sales reps need to seek approval in order to match a given competitor price on a given item. The time delay of that approval process can sometimes result in a lost sale or even a lost customer. We're working to speed up this process and provide our frontline colleagues with decision making authority leveraging our pricing tools. Our sales professionals will be able to respond to the customer in the spot moment enabling incremental opportunities to potentially save a sale, all while maintaining strong margin discipline. This increased speed to action will improve case volume and customer retention. Most importantly, our underlying pricing will be leveraged to underpin the agility process. We will roll out the new model once the pilot results are matching our intended outcomes and as we prepare and train our colleagues new and experienced, to sell in this model. As I wrap up the update on local sales, I want to congratulate our international team for another outstanding quarter. International local volume increased 4.5% Even more impressively, adjusted operating income increased 17.4% Particular strength was delivered from our Canada, Great Britain and Ireland businesses. We expect the continuation of these strong results from our international segment in Q4 and into fiscal 2026. As I wrap up the business review section of my prepared remarks, I would like to make a few comments on some additional important topics. First off, I would like to address what we are seeing with tariffs. And their potential impact on the food distributor landscape. It is important to note that Sysco Corporation purchases greater than 90% of our products within country in each country that we operate. Food is inherently local. And our sourcing teams greatly leverage local food suppliers. As a result, our tariff exposure is much less than most industries. For those products that we cannot source locally, like avocados from Mexico, we are working efficiently to understand the impact of tariffs on our costs. At this time produce from Mexico and Canada is exempt through USMCA. With that said, we recently learned that tomatoes will in fact be taxed and tariffed. When imported. To manage these complexities, we have stood up a tariff management task force that meets daily. The focus of the task force work is the following, Number one, ensure we have products in stock and available for our customers. Number two, defend against price increases from suppliers and do everything possible possible to minimize their impact on potential cost increases for our customers. Number three, find alternative sources of product if and when a cost increase is excessive. Number four, work with our customers to find menu alternatives and product choice alternatives that can reduce the potential negative cost increase impact. All told, Sysco Corporation is in a better position than anyone in the food service distribution space to manage this dynamic situation. Given our size, scale, and global procurement division. Our global leadership gives us a strategic advantage to understand the supplier community in hundreds of countries. Have the ability to leverage that knowledge and those relationships in our procurement efforts. As you have heard from other company CEOs, our main concern with tariffs is not product cost inflation, Our main concern is the negative impact that tariff noise and volatility is clearly having on end consumer confidence and sentiment. The Michigan Consumer Confidence Survey data I referenced earlier present a clear reflection of that concern. We are hopeful and that the economy doesn't dip into a recession. With that said, we are making preparations for a more challenging environment and we will be appropriately cautious in our outlook. To help offset softness that may be created by the macro economy, Kenny and our entire leadership team are focused on disciplined cost management and contingency planning. Sysco Corporation's industry leading balance sheet is a major source of strength in times like these. As we are able to continue investing in our business when others will need to pull back. This can take the form of winning new customers, building inventory to support new business, and even pursuing M&A if we find the right target opportunity at the right price. Sysco Corporation is in a position of strength in times of greatest uncertainty. My last topic for today is the introduction of a pilot program at Sysco Corporation whereby we will open two cash and carry store locations within the Houston community. As you can see on Slide seven, the store concept is called Sysco to Go. We are interested in cash and carry for the following reasons. It is the fastest growing part of the food away from home space. In a business where we have 0% market share today. Cash and Carry customers are looking for a, value, b, convenience, and c, oftentimes the ability to pay cash. This is a customer that Sysco Corporation is not adequately serving today through our delivery model. By having the customer pick up the product themselves, at our store location, we eliminate the most expensive part of the supply chain final mile delivery. That cost elimination enables Sysco Corporation to offer our world class products at lower prices than when we deliver to the restaurant. This enables us to meet the needs of the value seeking customer more effective. I wanna be very clear. Is a two store pilot. The future of the initiative will be determined by the outcomes we produce in these test locations. It is important to note are supported from Sysco Corporation's existing supply chain. Leveraging our own product assortment. As a result, we have a strong command of the projected cost to run the stores. Leveraging our existing supply chain is a major strength of the format given both stores are in close proximity to our Houston DC. We are excited to open the two stores in Houston soon, and welcome value seeking restaurant customers into this compelling shopping environment. I'll now turn it over to Kenny will provide a detailed review of Q3 performance and select fiscal year 2025 guidance commentary. Kenny, over to you.
Kenny Cheung: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'm gonna start with high level thoughts on our performance, detail our Q3 financials, and then dive into full year 2025 guidance. To start, financial results this quarter included sales growth, with stable adjusted EPS performance. It's a context of all of the challenging macro headlines over the past few months growing sales as the industry leader or retaining best in class profit margins and rewarding our shareholders with our balanced capital allocation is noteworthy. However, this quarter missed expectations. Kevin highlighted, the challenging macro and continuation of negative industry traffic directly impacted results. In this dynamic backdrop, we will remain agile in our management of the business as we also heightened our focus on the controllables. Our strong business fundamentals industry leading balance sheets, and strong cash flow generation are competitive advantages, especially in a challenging macro environment. As part of our balanced approach to capital allocation, we remain positioned to generate robust free cash flow that enables us both invest in long term growth while also rewarding our shareholders. Specific to this last point, we have repurchased $700 million in shares and paid out $752 million in dividends year to date including repurchasing $400 million in shares this quarter. Further, we recently increased our planned quarterly cash dividend by three cents fifty four cents per share. This represents a 6% increase year over year and sets FY 2026 up to year of delivering dividend growth. Looking ahead, we expect our dividend to continue growing commensurate with our adjusted EPS growth. In Now let's discuss our performance and financial driver for the quarter. Starting on Slide eleven. For the third quarter, our enterprise sales grew 1.1% on an as reported basis driven by US food service and Sigma. Excluding the impact of our now divested Mexico business, sales grew 1.8%. With respect to volume, stable volumes across the enterprise included total US food service volume, decreasing 2% and local volume decreasing 3.5% for Our national business remains stable, highlighting the strength of the recession resilient sectors which we operate such as food service management, travel and leisure, and education. The local volume performance compares to down 1.9% in Q2 2025. The sequential deceleration was consistent with the industry traffic deceleration, but also included headwinds from the carryover impact of sales colleague, Turnover, from earlier in the year. Going forward, we expect stronger contributions from nearest sales professionals that continue to work up the productivity curve and benefits from the stabilization of colleague retention that Kevin mentioned earlier. International segment results excluding Mexico, this quarter demonstrated steady top momentum and double digit operating income growth. This reflects continued momentum from successfully applying the Sysco Corporation playbook The ongoing success is highlighted by local volumes growing 4.5% and broad based operating income growth across our international portfolio. We produced $3.6 billion in gross profit down 0.8% and gross margin of 18.3% with improved gross profit per case performance. The decline in gross profit dollars for the quarter was primarily driven by negative volumes as well as mix. Volume was impacted by the macro and negative traffic partially offset by continued growth in our more recession resilient businesses. Second, mix remained pressured from the continued impact of our national business outpacing our local performance as well as negative mix from lower Sysco Corporation brand penetration rates. In addition, the industry challenging traffic backdrop drove delays as compared to our expected timelines which resulted in fewer than expected strategic sourcing deals being finalized this quarter. That said, we we remain confident around the overarching opportunity in our line of sight on benefits to Q4 from recently completed deals. Going forward, we expect improving gross margins driven by incremental benefits from strategic sourcing initiatives as part of our cost savings program and an improvement from mix. Product inflation came in at 2.1% for the total enterprise, consistent with our expectations. This is the average across all of our major product categories with our teams regularly managing through pockets of fluctuation. Overall, adjusted operating expenses were $2.8 billion for the quarter or 14.3% of sales, a 17 basis point improvement from the prior year. We continue to experience improved retention rates and productivity with our supply chain colleagues. This is resulting in strong NPS anchor by our highest service levels of the year for on time deliveries helping offset elevated supply chain labor rate and funding long term growth consistent with our ROIC framework. This includes investment in higher growth areas of the business with fleets building expansion and sales headcount. Lower annual bonus incentives compensation in our USFS segment and global support center also impacted expenses. For Q3. We remain disciplined with our corporate expenses, down 16.8% from the prior year on adjusted basis, which also included accretive productivity cost out along with efficiency work we deployed net by 24. These benefits are included in our $100 million cost savings program. Building off Kevin's point around tariffs, we are focused on leveraging our size, and scale advantages by buying better, to sell better. Our customer mix is a strategic advantage. We have efficient pass through with national customers and spot pricing from existing and growing local base. Our inventory turnover of approximately 14 times per year also enables us to work through inflation, deflation quickly relative to other industries. Overall, adjusted operating income was $773 million for the quarter reflecting strong growth our international segment and expense management and global support center offset by declines in our USFS segment. For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA of $969 million was down 0.8% versus the prior year. Let's now turn to our balance sheet and cash flow, a compelling competitive advantage. As I have explained before, our balance sheet affords us the financial tools and flexibility to make the right position both for the short and long term as we seek to grow our business while driving industry leading returns on invested capital. Our balance sheet remains robust and reflects a healthy financial profile. This includes flexibility and optionality from approximately $4.4 billion in total liquidity well above our minimum threshold. We ended the quarter at a 2.8 times net debt leverage ratio. Turning to our cash flow, we generated approximately $1.3 billion in operating cash flow and $954 million in free cash flow year to date. Free cash flow was driven by strong quality of earnings and prudent management of working capital. This quarter marked our strongest conversion rate of the year. For the full year, we continue to expect strong conversion rates from adjusted EBITDA to operating cash flow approximately 70% and free cash flow at approximately 50%. As noted earlier, our strong financial position enabled us to return approximately $649 million to shareholders this quarter. Now I would like to share with you our updated expectations for Q4 and FY 2025. Given the uncertain environment, and general concerns regarding consumer confidence, we are lowering our full year guidance for FY 2025 as seen on slide seventeen. During FY 2025, we now expect reported net sales growth of approximately 3%. Slightly down from the prior target of 4 to 5%. This is largely driven by lower than expected volume growth driven by the market. Our assumptions inflation of approximately 2% and contributions from M&A remain unchanged. We now expect full year 2025 adjusted EPS growth of at least 1%. For Q4, this implies adjusted EPS to be at least flat. The revision to guidance reflects that the current uncertain macro environment and its outside impact the second half of the year, which historically is more profitable. This upcoming quarter, also includes our planned strategic investments related to refreshing our fleet and building capacity coming online. This updated guidance assumes no further degradation of the restaurant trapping environment and a slight improvement to our volume performance. Importantly, we believe this guide is achievable based on our strong exit velocity for March, and continued momentum into April. And Q4 including higher contributions from cost out. We remain confident in delivering our run rate cost savings target of approximately $100 million which we expect to benefit Q4 in the first half of 2026 helping offset the current macro environment. Plan to remain focused on operational discipline tightening the belts as necessary and investing long term growth. So We remain target to reward our shareholders through the distribution of essentially all of our annual free cash flow with over $1 billion in dividends and $1.25 billion in share repurchases. Assumes fourth quarter share repurchase of $550 million and dividends of $250 million. For the year, we expect to operate within our stated target of 2.5 times or 2.75 times net leverage ratio and maintain our investment grade balance sheet. Now turning to a few other modeling items. For Q4, we expect a tax rate of approximately 24% and adjusted depreciation and amortization of approximately $200 million Interest expense is now expected at approximately $170 million. Looking ahead and as we have proven over time, we will leverage our position as the market leader to drive disciplined growth as we remain focused on unlocking value that will reward our shareholders. With that, will turn the call back to Kevin closing remarks.
Kevin Hourican: Thank you, Kenny. Q3 did not live up to our expectations on the top or bottom line. The macro softness directly impacted our volume trends within the important local and national restaurant business sectors. Our trade down in volume during the quarter is directly linear with the widely communicated traffic decline experienced by the industry over the same period. With that said, we can see progress that we are making on our activities within our local business. Colleague retention has stabilized. New customer win rate is accelerating, As I mentioned, we are still working through the headwind of prior quarter's colleague resignation but that impact will reduce in magnitude each quarter. As we head into fiscal 2026, the net net of colleague retention and new colleague hiring will become a tailwind Why? Our new hires are performing. And they are responding to the updated compensation model. They are opening new business. They are hitting their sales targets. Additionally, our new distribution centers will increase our ability to win profitable new business. Important geographies both domestically and globally. The most compelling proof point to highlight the self help progress we are making in our local business is the percentage of new business we are opening weekly. March was a very strong month for opening new business, and the progress has continued into April. Combined with our efforts efforts and customer retention, through pricing agility and improved service levels from our supply chain, we are confident we can grow our customer account in 2026. From a business perspective, March local volume improved 270 basis points versus February. And local volume during the first weeks of April improved further versus March. We are pleased to see the stronger April and we are cautiously planning our coming months to the tariff uncertainty. I'm confident Sysco Corporation will make progress our improvement initiatives in the coming periods. The external environment and breakthroughs in the year to go and we are prepared to margins, rock solid balance sheet and fiscal responsibility will be strength points as we navigate this volatile environment. I am confident in our ability to win versus the overall market Just like we successfully grew our business, during the COVID disruptions. At times like these, our higher than industry profit margins and strong balance sheet cannot be overstated. We also expect our international division, which has been less impacted by the volatility to continue to be a strong point for the company. Having the diversified business, will be a strength point ahead. With that operator, we're now ready for questions.
Operator: Again, that is star one if you like to ask a question. Our first question will come from Alex Slagle with Jefferies.
Alex Slagle: Thanks for the question. Good morning. A question on the the local business. You could kinda talk about the sales headcount investments you've been making, where we are with that, and I guess any evidence these investments are really moving the needle You provided a couple interesting tidbits on the acceleration in the in the March and April, but any other sort of pockets of your business where you can point out you know, where you're seeing the initiatives deliver positive organic growth or or clear market share gain, something that really gives you confidence that the drivers are are in place and working as hooked.
Kevin Hourican: Good morning, Alex. It's Kevin. Thank you for the question. I'll start with your first part of your question, which is sales consultant headcount. We expect to end the year at approximately 4% growth Approximately 4% growth year over year at the conclusion of Q4. It's an estimate it'll be at least 4% gross. That's answer to that question. As it relates to signals of progress as I said in my prepared remarks, we have several proof points that we can share. March being stronger than Q3 in total, April being stronger than Q3, nose up, if you will, on the controllables. Evidenced by new customer win rate in the month of March, we opened more new customers at any point in time other than the snapback recovery from COVID. Proof point number two, is the quality and productivity of the training cohorts. As you know, we hire people in classes. Those classes graduate, and we track them every single month on their performance versus where we expect them to be And I can definitively communicate that our hiring cohorts are producing growing their productivity at the rate we expect and anticipate, as I said in my prepared remarks, why that's not evident and visible in market share gains slash volume growth that we're proud of in year to date is the offset to these things, which was the increased colleague turnover that experienced during the first half of the year. As I said in my prepared remarks that peaked in September It improved in Q2, but we're still carrying that headwind of the colleague separation because when they depart, there's some customer loss that goes along with that. We anticipate the scales of that equation, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, to tip to positive Q1 of fiscal 2026 that would be lapping that increased separation. So Kenny anything to add?
Kenny Cheung: Yeah. Hey, Alex. It's Kenny here. On a couple of things here. One piece is we are encouraged by seeing select geographies already hitting our growth expectations, driven by the SC ads improved retention, as well as the new comp model that we talked about. And then that's carrying into Q4 as well. So that's one proof point. Thanks for your question. The second thing I would say is that as you think about our book of besties right now, the ones that that are on our books, you know, literally, most were higher in the back half of FY 2024 and the first half of FY 2025. With each passing month, the SCs become more productive, and we're seeing that with our cohorts that Kevin just referred to. The improvement is not binary, meaning each month, each day, each quarter, becoming more productive. And the interesting factor is that we are we will be experiencing a missing amount of folks entering that 12 to 18 months time frame now. And based on our own internal tracking data, there is a step level function change up to the good, once we hit that. So you'll see some of that in Q4, and that's the reason why we do expect Q4 local volume to improve, versus, Q3. The last thing I would say around your question around sales and account investment, agree with Kevin, will be around over four four percent in increase year on year. We are committed on growing our local sales professional headcount, and we'll be disciplined on pacing the volume to expectations and market conditions. We'll be very deliberate on when and where we at. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Mark Carden with UBS.
Mark Carden: Great. Good morning and thanks so much for taking the questions. So so I wanted to ask another one on local, more from an industry wide perspective. How has the local restaurant industry backdrop held up relative to to national restaurants And then within that, are you seeing any regional challenges and how has that fluctuated over the past few months?
Kevin Hourican: Good morning, Mark. It's Kevin. Thank you for the question. National Restaurants had a really tough quarter. That's the headline. That's the punchline. It was soft consistent with the local numbers that obviously we disclosed in report. When you look at our national case volume number, you have to keep in mind, yes, there are national restaurants in that mix. But it's offset by real strong strength in food service management, travel and entertainment, Education has held up strong, and we have a very stable health care business. So national for us was stronger than local, if you unpack within national and look at this national restaurant, it was a tough tough quarter. National restaurants. Obviously, there are individual select names that are doing incredibly well. You know who they are, but in aggregate, you know, really tough quarter. For National. And it was exacerbated in February kinda going back to one of Alex's questions. You know, we're seeing strength while we're adding headcount. Kenny hit that point very, very well. But the pain in Q3 the weather was everywhere. You know, I happen to live in the south. We had four inches of snow in Houston. That never happens. Really adverse weather in the mid parts of the country, the temperate zone, and obviously the north had back to back to back weeks. Of really, you know, adverse weather. So the the headwind was pretty much geographic geographically throughout the United States. You know, interestingly, our international division, one of the reasons it's continuing to perform, we're not experiencing some of these you know, headwinds from an external factor perspective. The tariff and tax thing is not negatively at this time impacting our international division, and it's one of the reasons. Along with our strong business performance that we're doing well in that regard.
Mark Carden: Thanks so much. Goodbye.
Kevin Hourican: Thank you, Mark.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much. I had one clarification on a comment you made earlier. Then a question. The clarification is just on that local case growth know you said you're directionally similar to the industry in terms of easing. Just wondering you think any of it is self inflicted whether you see industry data gives you confidence you're not underperforming peers. That was my clarification. Otherwise, the question is just on the fiscal twenty five guidance. Feel like the past couple of quarters, you were confident that even if the macro were to pressure the top line, you had levers to accelerate cost and efficiency savings to still hit that six to seven percent EPS growth. So does look like you lowered the top line by one percent or so. One to two percent, actually, but you took down the EPS guidance by five percent plus Just wondering how you see that playing out, whether or not there's less low hanging fruit or you just decide you don't wanna damage the long term infrastructure for short term earnings. Any thoughts on that between top and bottom line? Thank you.
Kevin Hourican: Very, very questions. It's Kevin. I'll start, and Kenny will clean up as it relates to your appropriate question regarding the the full year your guide. Back to local, we are confident that in Q3 our performance relative to the market was consistent. In fact, it's almost to the penny. If you track the traffic change from Q2 to Q3 to our local case growth performance Q2 to Q3. We were consistent with the industry. We are confident we did not erode in our performance relative to the overall market. We are pleased with the start of Q4. As I said, April was stronger than March. March was stronger than Q3. We're beginning to see some positive separation in our performance relative to the market as we begin Q4. And it's this timing thing that I'm talking about relative to colleagues separation, the new cohorts, that are hitting their twelve month anniversary date in Q4 as Kenny already communicated. And even more of them will have that twelve month anniversary as we roll into fiscal 2026. Need to display separation in our performance versus the market in a positive way and we are seeing the green shoots to progress, Jeff. Are going to enable that outcome. We'll talk about that more in August, obviously, as we provide guidance for fiscal 2026. As it relates to Q3, we understand to your question, one thing I would point to is this the steepness of the drop off in February was meaningfully unanticipated. I said in my prepared remarks, the traffic down 5.7%. It went it was like a light switch. When that happens, it's really difficult to get that type of cost out of your system that fast especially when March rebounded quite solidly versus February. We don't wanna furlough drivers don't wanna cut costs that you end up having to reverse later. That is really painful. The other thing relative to adverse weather of that nature is it drives operating expenses up. So think about the number of facilities we have snow removal at our large parking lots, then when you're doing deliveries, in that type of environment, a lot of those trucks are coming back half full. Meaning, we load the truck for twenty stops. It comes back three hours into the route. And you have to put all that inventory back to stock. Some of that inventory has to be disposed because it's perishable. So these things add cost. So, yes, it's a volume headwind when traffic drops like that, but it's also cost headwind because of some of the examples that I just provided. So why don't we transition from that into how we're thinking about our guide for Q4, our general outlook in general and I'll pass that to Kenny over to you Kenny.
Kenny Cheung: Yeah. Hey, Jeff. Thanks, Kevin. Just one comment on Q3 before we head into the full year. Guide and the confidence around that number. If you take a step back on Q3, did miss EPS consensus by six cents. Now if you unpack that, in simple fashion, roughly five cents is driven by volumes. As Kevin talked about in his prepared remarks, we assumed nominal improvement in foot traffic while foot traffic actually fell quarter over quarter by 150 bps. Right? So, again, that's a nickel or eighty five percent of the miss, and the other fifteen percent, we'll call it a penny, driven by timing shifts from strategic sourcing deals. Given the backdrop in which we operate in, the good news is we had deals closed between post quarter and today. Therefore, that's the vote of confidence for our $100 million impact, the end wise. $100 million impact in in Q4. In terms of the guidance, Jeff, you know, I think the question behind your question is how confident are you in the number and any any context there? So I'll I'll answer it you know, with two points here. Just a recap, you're you're correct. The full year is 3% sales growth and then, EPS at least 1% growth. The two reasons why we are confident first, what Kevin just talked about, momentum. We have momentum. We continue to see it. Not just the market standpoint, but a lot of our self help initiatives are working as well. Let alone, you know, the momentum market. Meaning, our sales professionals are are becoming more productive, climbing up to look at the productivity curve, as well as our expense productivity items in the $100 million all of that is on pace and on target. Therefore, momentum is there across the p and l. And and and just double click more on this helps help. You know, we have begun realization of stages in Q3. It's heavier weighted towards Q4. And, again, it goes back to leverage having our p and l. Retention is the gift that keeps on giving. We're seeing retention in our SDs as well as inter sub play chain colleagues. Fun fact here, supply chain has the highest activity here today right now. So again, with all of these combined, we are very confident with our current guide. Kevin?
Kevin Hourican: Yeah. Just we don't like to do three part answers, but this question is very, very important as we think about the full year guide that we updated today. We're very pleased with the start of Q4 from a volume improvement perspective versus March. You may be asking, well, so then why know, the Q4 guide? We're being very cautious is the point. Given the tariff uncertainty, the volatility in the market, the Michigan Consumer Confidence Survey results that I referenced, we're being very cautious. We're being thoughtful about the management of expenses management of the discipline of the p and l, We're pleased with the self help activities that I referenced on today's call. And therefore the prudence, if you will, of the guide that we put out for Q4. Thank you. Thanks, Jeff.
Operator: Thank you. We'll move next to Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo.
Edward Kelly: Yes. Hi. Good morning, everybody. Kevin, I wanted to I wanted to just zero in on know, Salesforce and the opportunity that you see ahead of you. I mean, you talked about 4% growth in the sales force by the end of 2025. You've talked historically about, you know, adding about 450 people, you know, annually. So that growth, if if you're still gonna achieve that in 2026, should be higher If you do the math you know, on this normalizing turnover and the sales force growth, you know, it's not hard to look at local case volumes and say that there's a three, five hundred basis point opportunity for you to improve that business. But my question is, is it that simple? Meaning, like, you know, are there other issues preventing that map from working? The pricing tool has been something that's been talked about that I think maybe is creating some friction There's maybe some lag on the customer loss. Right? It salespeople are leaving. In a year, they come off noncompete, and do you continue to have some issue there? I'm just curious as to how you see the magnitude of the self help opportunity and the cadence of the benefit that you may get in 2026. Because I think where the stock is trading today, you know, the the stock is saying that that the market doesn't see that benefit coming. So, you know, if you could give us know, some color there, I think it'd be helpful.
Kevin Hourican: Ed, good morning. Thank you for the question. Appreciate the question. We need to prove it through our outcomes and that is what we will do. And we understand that as management team and as the leaders of this company, we need to prove it through our outcomes. What gives us confidence and we're not gonna provide guidance for 2026 today because that's how I would need to answer your question, we have confidence is the following factors. And I just have to, you know, repeat some of the key messages because the math is indelibly clear. We need to retain the colleagues we have at a historically strong rate, and fiscal 2025 was a meaningful headwind in that regard. I want to reiterate, though, it was intentional. Needed to make a change to our comp model It was structural. It was required. It was necessary, and it's been challenging. And it's been difficult to work our way through that change If we could go back in time, we would still make the change to the comp model that we made, We could have improved our execution of that change obviously, given some of the accelerated turnover, but the change to the comp model was necessary. So that specific headwind of the increased turnover negatively impacted this year. And we can see in our current outcomes we have absolutely stabilized retention. I'd like to do better than that. I'd like to have our retention be higher than it has ever been. We have a concerted effort across all elements of our organization to improve improve even further, not to stabilize it, but make it be at highest levels. That's who we hire. That's how we train them. That's how they're treated when they're out on the road doing their job. It's their direct supervisor being in car with them going on ride alongs helping them from the skills development perspective. Ed, net net, I'm confident that the turnover challenge will be a net tailwind in 2026. I heard your point on rolling the twelve months of the noncompete Loud and clear, we understand that and we have a plan to help offset that. Offsetting that headwind is the tailwind, and we were intentionally very clear today on how long it takes for our colleagues to get productive. It's on average twelve to eighteen months. Kenny was very clear that in this Q4, the Q4 we're now in, have more people hitting that twelve month mark obviously, than we have in any prior quarter, and that will increase now from here. I've used before the metaphor of turning on water in a pipe. It has to go from one end of the pipe to the other, but once it gets to the other end of the pipe, now the water keeps flowing. We are just now in our Q4 getting to the first quarter where water is now flowing through that pipe. In a consistent way. As it relates to the you know, previously, we've quoted a headcount growth number for, you know, four to five hundred colleagues. Today, we updated that to reflect that this year, we anticipate to end at approximately plus four. Be very disciplined about that. We know that there are geographies that can absolutely take significantly increased headcount. See Florida. We're about to open a net new brand new building in Florida. We'll be hiring up in Florida to support that new building. And to win meaningfully from a share perspective. In that state. Excuse me, as an example only. So those are my thoughts on Salesforce. I am confident in 2026. Salesforce will be a tailwind, not a headwind. And it is absolutely fact that it was a headwind in fiscal 2025. What else is going on with the second part of your question? There's a lot going on. It's a dynamic environment. The pricing environment and the needs of the end customer are clear. They are seeking value given the pressure on the restaurant's P and L. Their labor costs are up. For many of them, their rent cost is up, and they've experienced 30 to 40% food inflation over the past five years. So customers are value seeking. We need to be thoughtful and we need to be agile how we meet the customer where they are. That's related to like the product offering that we have the pricing that we have, and as I mentioned on the call today, the rollout of price agility It's something we need to manage extremely well. That's why I said in my prepared remarks, the change management and the training plan on how to put that tool out in the market is critical. We have to execute with excellence when we roll that program out. To ensure that we can match pricing agility, with margin rate discipline that is why we haven't gone nationwide yet. We're working on that change management plan, that training plan, pricing in the marketplace is one of the variables. You go beyond those two excuse me, variables, and the industry is experiencing a bit higher rate of customer churn than what is normal. And that's side to point two, which is the customer seeking value. This is not a unique point to Sysco Corporation. Just churn in aggregate at a higher level. We're gonna talk more in the future about improving the service level experience that we provide to our best customers and end to end program that can help reduce customer churn. So those would be the top three. Salesforce productivity, pricing agility, and improving customer churn. Aggregate those three we're confident that we can grow local volume have an attractive p and l, and we'll talk more in August about guide for 2026. Kenny and and yes. Yeah. And add to your specific question around the math. Right? Your math is correct. Right now, you're seeing our expenses outside count four to five percent. So I think you're question is there's a spread between, obviously, the return. As we as Kevin spoke about, As our SCs climb the productivity curve, as initiatives kick in, we should expect that spread to reduce, and, you know, meaning sales growing closer in with our expense expense base, and that's me. You are correct. That is an opportunity for our company.
Edward Kelly: Thanks, guys.
Kevin Hourican: Thank you, Ed.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Jake Bartlett with Truist.
Jake Bartlett: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I want to start with just a clear Salesforce initiatives and the InMed comp changes to to move to positive in fiscal 2026. I wanna make sure I understand, you know, your expectations for when that that could happen. You know, September was the was the peak of the of the increased turnover. Is is the September time frame the right way to think about it? Or or really, you know, is it is it possible that we could see that inflection in the first quarter? Sounded like like maybe that was possible, you know, given the given the improvements that you're seeing now. And then my my real question is about is about your your capital allocation. The dividend increase was the largest it's been in a in a few years. And maybe if you can talk about why, you know, you're you're kind of leaning into the to the dividend increase you know, so much after pretty modest increases for the last two. And and your your kind of approach to I know we've had elevated share buybacks in in 2025, but, you know, is is that something that you expect would continue beyond 2025?
Kevin Hourican: Good morning, Jake. Thank you for the question. As it relates to the sales force inflection, definitively it will inflect to a positive in fiscal 2026. When we provide our guidance for 2026, we'll provide more color how you should think about the full year and how you should think about the first half of the second half. That's the most I can say today. The second point though from a green shoots of progress in color April, we are seeing a stronger performance versus March. And we are seeing some separation of our performance versus the overall market from a positive share gain perspective. So it is not a light switch. It does not go from off to on. The separate part of my cough, forgive me, The separation impact negative is immediate as I mentioned on my prepared remarks. The improvement that comes from the new colleague is gradual over time. Think about a slope of two curves when they intersect intersect and how that then shows up as a net tailwind. It will be a net tailwind in fiscal 2026, and we are doing everything we can to improve the productivity of our new colleagues and as I mentioned, improve colleague retention. As I mentioned in answering of Ed's question, I'm not satisfied with getting retention back to work historically was. Want it to be even better. It historically was to turn the head count in our sales colleague population into a ongoing and permanent point of strength for the company. As it relates to the dividend, I'll just get started and then toss to Kenny. We we are dividend aristocrat. We've raised our dividend now 56 consecutive years in a row. There are very few companies that can say that. In my closing remarks, I talked about there's no better company to work for and or from a balance sheet perspective to invest in than a company like Sysco Corporation in times like these are industry leading income statement from a profit as a percent of sales and our rock solid balance sheet affords us the opportunity to return value to shareholders even in challenging and difficult times. We raised our dividend even during the COVID period, which is a meaningful point of strength. So, Kenny, why don't you answer the Yeah. Specifics of how we thought about the increase for next year?
Kenny Cheung: Absolutely. So let's start just quickly covering cap allocation. We'll first and foremost invest our business and anything accessed will be returned back to shareholders. Given where our cash and liquidity position sits, which is over $4 billion a quarter, we have the luxury to do both. Invest in our business and reward our shareholders. So to your exact question, speaking to rewarding the shareholders, as Kevin talked about, we're very proud of the that we're raising our dividends 6%. Again, as I said before, we expect dividend raised be commensurate with future EPS growth for our business. You know, taking a giant step back, as CFO, I'm proud of the fact that we were able to maintain our $1.25 billion of share repo this year and raise dividend by 6%, especially given the market backdrop historically impacts our proper profile reason being, and this is your second question. Right? How do we think through it? It's because we have a strong investment grade balance sheet. Solid business fundamentals, and the fact that we are confident in the business today and on the forward. So that's the rationale of how Cam and I thought about the dividend raise. Thank you.
Jake Bartlett: Thank you, Jake. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Heinbockel, Guggenheim.
John Heinbockel: Hey, Kevin. Can you talk to this elevated churn across the industry? I think you sort of suggested maybe it's price oriented. think is driving that? You also Right? Is that wrong? You know, what what you know, suggested you have some ideas about how to eat into that. And then just when I think about the magnitude you know, maybe what what is a good level of churn for the industry What has it stepped up to? It seems like may maybe it's stepped up, you know, a hundred basis points or more. But I'd be curious how that's changed.
Kevin Hourican: Good morning, John. Thank you for the question. Yeah. Churn has increased, you know, as an industry overall You know, I'll say there's a couple of drivers behind it. Number one is customers are value seeking as I mentioned their labor costs are up, rent is up, food costs are up. They're seeking ways to help their profitability and food cost is one of those mechanisms. Price visibility has increased as you know as more customers are placing their orders online. Net net in aggregate, that's a good thing. So more customers placing their orders online is a good thing because they see more of our catalog, They are inspired to buy things they didn't buy before. We can prompt them to do swap and save, to alternative products that help them save money. We can suggest items that they can buy that they're not buying. Net net conversion to online is a good thing. With that said, the conversion to online increases price transparency, not just at Sysco Corporation, but across all distributors. So more customers are enabled to seek value by the online visibility to pricing. These are environmental conditions. John, I am confident given Sysco Corporation's size and scale, can be very competitive and successful that environment. So our profit rate as a percent of sales and our purchasing scale afford Sysco Corporation to be to buy goods, we call it buy better to sell better and provide value to our customers in that price visible online way. We can lean in with suppliers and do programs together with them to provide savings to customers, to entice them to buy from Sysco Corporation. So that's point number one relative to the churn. Point number two is supply chain resiliency. This goes back to COVID. Prior to COVID, the percentage of a customer's business that that customer gave to one distributor was higher than it is today. And when product shortages occurred everywhere in the industry, customers couldn't get everything they needed from their primary distributor, they signed up a second, a third, a fourth. Distributor. As you know, there's always been backups in account, but what we see in the industry is a higher percentage of purchases happening with quote unquote the backup because customers don't wanna find themselves in a position where they can't. Get what they need. Be clear, we've done that with our supplier population. We buy more food in the food away from home space than anyone else. We have preferred partner suppliers but we've had to add backups and sometimes tertiary suppliers to cover our needs and when our primary supplier can't get us what we need. So, John, that too is a part of the equation. As it relates to actionable forward facing 2026 activities There's a reasonably small percentage of our customer base that drives a significantly disproportionate portion of our profit pool, and we are gonna lean in hard with those best customers And I'm gonna talk more about that at future investment engagement opportunities A reboot and a significant focus on our best customer retention and best customer penetration and we believe that will be another tailwind for our fiscal 2026. Thank you.
John Heinbockel: Thank you, John.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude the time we have for questions. Thank you for joining Sysco Corporation's third quarter fiscal year 2025 conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2025 Q2  (2025-01-28 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to Sysco's Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2025 Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. We will begin with opening remarks and introductions. I would now like to turn the call over to Kevin Kim, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Kevin Kim: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Sysco's second quarter fiscal year 2025 earnings call.

To ensure we have sufficient time to answer all questions, we'd like to ask each participant to limit their time to one question. If you have a follow-up question, we ask that you re-enter the queue. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Hourican.
Kevin Hourican: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our financial results this quarter delivered improved performance and positive momentum with stronger top- and bottom-line year-over-year growth rates as it compared to our first quarter. Sysco is delivering value over the short term with disciplined P&L management and remains well positioned to advance our business strategy while delivering upon our financial commitments presented at our recent Investor Day. Importantly, we expect the positive momentum from our Q1 into Q2 to accelerate in the second half of the year as we benefit from sales and operations improvement initiatives, investments in our business, and the potential for stronger foot traffic to restaurants as we begin to lap last year's negative 4% in late spring. Our leadership team is 100% focused upon executing with excellence with a strong plan in place to deliver our full year 2025 guidance. Turning to Sysco's performance during the quarter on Slide number 5. I'm pleased to report that Sysco delivered over $20 billion of total revenue. a growth of 4.5% versus fiscal 2024 and a sequential improvement from Q1 growth rates. The revenue growth was driven by U.S. Foodservice volume growth of 1.4% and moderate inflation of 2.1%. From a volume perspective, we generated 4.3% national volume growth, 3% volume growth in our International segment and a decline of 0.9% in our U.S. FS local case business. Our national sales business continues to perform at an exceptionally high level with strong customer retention, and we continue to onboard high-quality net new national business. Our International segment posted very compelling results with adjusted operating income up 26.5%. The strong profit growth was generated in part by local case growth of plus 4.7% year-over-year. We continue to advance the Sysco playbook in our international geographies, expanding our assortments, introducing Sysco-branded products and increasing boots on the street sales head count to win new local business. I will discuss our International business in more detail in a few moments. In the U.S. FS business, we are making solid progress on our top priorities across our multiple business units. Local case performance this quarter, excluding the impact of our DON business, was down 1.9%. It was a choppy quarter with hurricane impacts at the beginning of the quarter and holiday shifts that negatively impacted the end of the quarter. The year-over-year comparison was also impacted by strong growth rates from the prior year. Specific to our local business, we are seeing progress in our internal measures of success, and we remain confident that our efforts will help deliver improvements in the second half of fiscal 2025. More on this in a few moments. Lastly, our top line growth included strong contributions from SYGMA where sales were up 10.6%. Now that we have summarized Sysco's top line performance, let's briefly discuss the external market. Food traffic to restaurants in the U.S. was down approximately 2% for the second quarter, which represents a moderate improvement from Q1. We expect to see continued improvement in traffic trends as we head into the second half of the year. Inflation for the industry has maintained at approximately 2%, which is within the normal range when we look at cost of goods sold inflation over the course of decades. From a bottom-line perspective, Sysco delivered adjusted EPS of $0.93, a growth rate of 4.5% versus prior year, consistent with our expectations. The EPS growth was driven in part by the aforementioned volume growth, disciplined margin management and an organization-wide focus around efficiency improvement. Margin management will remain a point of strength for the full year. As we stated on our Q1 call, we anticipate that our strategic sourcing efforts will pick up momentum as the year progresses. As a result, we expect the positive momentum in gross profit from Q1 to Q2 to step up in the second half of the year as we have a direct line of sight to the actions that will deliver our full year margin performance. On the expense side of the ledger, we anticipate continued improvements in our supply chain efficiency, driven by improving colleague retention statistics and improved transportation route optimization. These routing efforts will reduce miles driven, lowering our cost, while simultaneously improving our ability to deliver on time and in full to our customers, a win-win. Now I'd like to provide a brief update on our main business units, starting with international, where we grew our top line 3.6% for the quarter, and we grew adjusted operating income by an impressive 26.5%. Our strong profit growth is being driven by continued operational improvements increased procurement synergies and a strong customer mix. Local case growth in our International segment is up 4.7% year-over-year. Adding to our international success is a strong strategic sourcing program that is expanding globally and the successful growth of our Sysco Urawa local sales program. Lastly, we are deploying enterprise technology that is improving efficiency. In short, our International segment is running the Sysco playbook. It's working, and we expect the positive momentum with international to continue into the second half of the year. Our national sales business continues to deliver compelling top and bottom-line results. For the quarter, national volume was up 4.3%, as our supply chain solutions domestically and internationally resonate with our largest customers. Sysco has the assortment breadth supply chain footprint and technology solutions to be a one-stop shop for large customers. We make it easy to do business with Sysco with dedicated account teams that help enable customer growth, support their business expansion and oftentimes support the customers' international expansion. The success we are having in national sales is flowing through from top to the bottom-line as these customers help improve our route density, cover our fixed costs, increase our procurement synergies with key suppliers. We expect our national sales business to continue to deliver strong results due to high customer retention and continued new customer wins. Lastly, I'd like to provide an update on our local business. As I mentioned a few moments ago, we expect an improvement in our local performance in the second half of the year. We are making progress with our sales team hiring and training, and our sales compensation program is motivating the right behaviors. We see clear signs of progress on important drivers of the business. As an example, our new customer win rate has ramped up significantly over the last quarter. The increased new customer win rate is attributed to our new compensation program and the increased sales professional head count we are onboarding. New customers typically start by providing a portion of their business to Sysco. And as we work to, what we call sell around the room and penetrate additional product categories with these newer customers, the positive contribution from them will grow over time. The new customers we are winning today are going to be the strong, mature penetration customers of tomorrow. We expect our customer win rate progress to carry into our second half and into fiscal 2026. A second proof point is the progress that we are making with sales colleague headcount. Our sales consultant retention has substantially improved from Q1 to Q2 as the change management associated with our new compensation model has taken root and colleagues are experiencing the benefits of the new program. Additionally, we are making solid progress against our 2025 hiring goals with quality hires from the industry. Another proof point within our local segment is the improvement that we are making with our service proposition. Over the past quarter, we improved our service offering to our customers with increased customer-facing fill rates and improved on-time delivery performance. Our supply chain continues to make strong progress month-over-month, and that is evidenced by our Net Promoter Score, which improved solidly on a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis. We expect continued improvement in service levels in our second half of fiscal 2025. Historically, NPS improvement has a strong correlation to business growth in future quarters. The sales and volume growth comes from increased customer retention and by winning new lines from existing customers. Lastly, we increased our distribution capacity over the past quarter with new and expanded facilities to support our business. I am most bullish on our Italian platform expansion. Over the past six months, we have entered new geographies with our Greco Italian platform, and we will continue to expand to new geographies in the coming calendar year. The winning formula is clear, have the right Italian products at the right price sold by colleagues at our full-time Italian cuisine experts. Our success has been replicated in each new Greco market we have entered. I expect compelling results from the Italian platform in the second half of fiscal 2025 and for years to come as we advance our Greco expansion efforts. We have substantial white space to be filled in the coming years. As I wrap up my comments this morning, I will summarize with the following. We made progress from Q1 to Q2 in top- and bottom-line results. We delivered upon our financial expectations for the quarter and we have posted progress on important strategic initiatives. The progress on key initiatives like sales professional hiring and increasing our new customer win rate will fuel our improvement in the second half of fiscal 2025. When combined with the very compelling business performance, we are already delivering from national sales business, our International segment and our SYGMA segment, we have the confidence to reiterate our full year financial guidance. I am pleased with the progress that we are making in our supply chain from a service and cost perspective and our merchandising ranks from a gross margin management perspective and with our sales team from a skills development perspective. The combination of the progress across the three vectors will build over time. I want to personally thank Sysco's 76,000 plus colleagues and our entire leadership team for their continued focus in energy. We have the best team in the industry, and I'm proud to work with them every day serving Sysco's global customers. I also want to thank our supplier partners who have helped Sysco improve service levels to our customers over the past quarter. I'll now turn it over to Kenny, who will provide a detailed review of Q2 performance and select fiscal year 2025 guidance commentary. Kenny, over to you.
Kenny Cheung: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. As Kevin highlighted, our results for the quarter were driven by improvements across the core financial drivers. Sales, gross profit and operating expense. Our success in Q2 was broad-based across business segments in our product portfolio. We generated positive operating leverage and sequential improvements to gross profit, while continued operating expense management rendered adjusted operating margin expansion. Here at Sysco, we have levers across our P&L and our actions are driving structural improvements to the business. We believe the table is set for continued improvement in the second half of our fiscal year. For example, this was on full display in our International segment this quarter. The positive momentum over the past few years continued into Q2 with sales growth of 4%, gross profit growth of 7% and adjusted operating income growth of 26.5%. The Sysco playbook is delivering across all geographies, driven primarily by our size and scale advantages in these markets along with M&A contributions from the recent specialty additions to the portfolio, which are performing well. We expect our positive momentum in International to step up further in the second half of the year. In addition to improved P&L results this quarter, I would be remiss if I did not highlight the compelling competitive advantage that our strong balance sheet and robust cash flow generation provides. On that note, I am pleased to announce the upsizing of our share repurchase plan. For this fiscal year, we now expect to buy back $1.25 billion of shares, up from our prior plan of $1 billion. The full year amount has the potential to flex up further depending on M&A activity for the remainder of the year. Further, we take both our role as a dividend aristocrat and our track record of dividend growth seriously as we are one of only four consumer staples company that have grown dividends for the past 25-plus years. This year, we expect to distribute to shareholders $1 billion in dividend payments. In total, we are now on target to return over $2.25 billion to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends in FY '25. Our balance sheet affords us the financial tools and flexibility to make the right decisions, both for the short term and long term, as we seek to grow our business while driving industry-leading returns on invested capital and generating a double-digit TSR for our investors. Now turning to a summary of our reported results for the quarter, starting on Slide 14. For the second quarter, our enterprise sales grew 4.5%, in line with our guidance in the financial algorithm we shared during Investor Day. Our sales results were driven by U.S. Foodservice growing 4.1%, International growing 3.6% and SYGMA growing 10.6%. With respect to volume, total U.S. Foodservice volume increased 1.4% and local volume decreased 0.9%. DON positively impacted U.S. Foodservice volumes by 1.6% and local volumes by 1%. National volume growth in the quarter also included margin expansion. Local results were lapping the highest rates of growth in the prior year as well as headwinds from weather disruptions and unfavorable holiday timing impact on a year-over-year basis this year. We produced $3.7 billion in gross profit, up 3.9% and gross margin of 18.1%. On a dollar basis, we are encouraged by the expanding gross profit dollar per case trend and continued opportunities around our strategic sourcing efforts. Looking to the second half, we expect to execute on secured actions to expand the depth and breadth of our strategic sourcing to buy better, to sell better. This includes working with existing suppliers, looking for incremental win-win opportunities, often adding items to existing contracts and scoping out work with new suppliers. Additionally, continual improvements in sourcing will come, allowing us to lever the scale of our North America presence, which includes our $6 billion Canadian business. As I mentioned earlier, strategic sourcing is one example of structural improvements we expect to enhance gross profit in the second half of our fiscal year. Our gross profit dollar growth reflected our ability to continue to effectively manage product inflation, which came in at 2.1% for the total enterprise, consistent with our expectations. This is the average across all of our major product categories with our teams regularly managing through pocket of fluctuations. We are doing an excellent job managing our corporate expenses with continued progress year-over-year. We have been extremely disciplined and reduced corporate expenses by 1.3% from the prior year on an adjusted basis, driven by efficiency work that we deployed in FY '24 and incremental actions during the quarter. We are making continued progress with our financial algorithm target of lowering corporate expenses to 1% of sales. Overall, adjusted operating expenses were $2.9 billion for the quarter or 14.2% of sales, a 13 basis point improvement from the prior year, reflecting supply chain and corporate expense efficiencies. Our supply chain operations remain fully staffed. We continue to improve colleague retention year-over-year, and we are building on productivity gains with piece per labor hour improvements compared to the prior year. Our outbound fill rates to our customers also improved during the quarter, which will help drive increased NPS and sales in the coming quarters. Turning to fuel expenses. We remained disciplined around the pacing of our sales professional hires, and we'll continue to focus on the quality of return on investments of our new hires as a continued decline of the productivity curve. These deliberate investments are well levered with this year's hires expected to start driving financial contributions next year and thereafter. Overall, adjusted operating income was $783 million for the quarter. Positive momentum continued in our International segment with adjusted operating income growing 26.5% during the quarter. Our teams are successfully applying the Sysco playbook to drive continued growth and margin expansion. Adjusted operating income growth also benefited from SYGMA contributing 11.8% profit growth as our focus on operational excellence resulted in improved profits from higher productivity alongside growth of new customers. For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA increased to $969 million or up 4.4%. Our balance sheet remains robust and reflects the organization's healthy financial profile. We ended the quarter at a 2.76x net debt leverage ratio. We ended the quarter with $11.8 billion in net debt and approximately $3.1 billion in total liquidity, which is substantially above our minimum threshold. Turning to our cash flow, we generated approximately $498 million in operating cash flow and $331 million in free cash flow for the first half with the year-over-year variance driven by timing related to working capital which also includes the opportunistic purchase of inventory with solid economics. For the full year, we continue to expect strong conversion rates from adjusted EBITDA, operating cash flow at approximately 70% and free cash flow at approximately 50%. Our strong financial position enabled us to return approximately $444 million to shareholders this quarter. We remain confident in growing both top line and bottom-line results in FY '25, in line with our financial algorithm. Importantly, we are reiterating our 2025 guidance metrics as seen on Slide 20. During FY '25, we expect net sales growth of 4% to 5%. Net sales growth includes continued inflation of approximately 2%, positive volume growth of low single digits and contributions from M&A during the year. All in, we are guiding to adjusted EPS growth of 6% to 7% in line with our financial algorithm range. We continue to believe the second half will improve from investments in the sales professionals and other growth initiatives. Additionally, we expect margin benefits as we leverage our unique scale advantages to expand strategic sourcing efforts to include a wider basket of categories, more efficiently harness our global buying power and improve inbound freight logistics to minimize touch points across our networks. Combined with recent actions around our organizational optimization at our GSE we expect over $100 million of annualized savings to benefit gross profit dollars and operating expenses starting in the second half. This figure highlights our ability to be disciplined with expenses and offset macro industry environment headwinds in the first half and fund business investments this year. This is consistent with our focus on driving continual business improvements, and we plan to explore additional actions going forward. In addition to these self-help initiatives, which we expect to drive the majority of our second half lift, we continue to expect a stronger macro and modest industry traffic improvements. All in, we expect a stronger rate of adjusted EPS growth in the second half of the year, growing at a positive high single-digit growth rate with similar rates of growth across Q3 and Q4. Consistent with our ROIC focus, we divested our joint venture in Mexico in mid-December. This is expected to impact international sales by approximately $500 million on an annualized basis and be immaterial from a profit standpoint. From a modeling perspective, international top line results will be negatively impacted from an as-reported perspective for the next year as Mexico will be out of the number starting next quarter, but accretive to international margins. We do not plan to recast prior year numbers. However, we do plan to provide additional context to aid in modeling this segment until we lap its sale at the end of this calendar year. In the upcoming quarters, we will provide growth comparisons with and without Mexico in an effort to add clarity around operating trends and enhance year-over-year comparability. Further, we plan to continue our practice rewarding our shareholders through the distribution of essentially all of our annual free cash flow with over $1 billion in dividends. And as outlined earlier, $1.25 billion in share repurchases. This is another signal of continued confidence in our business. Specific to share repurchase, we note that this figure can flex up depending on M&A activity. For the year, we expect to operate within our stated target of 2.5x to 2.75x net leverage and maintain our investment-grade balance sheet. The adjusted tax rate for FY '25 is now expected to range from 24.5% to 25%, slightly lower than our initial view. Adjusted depreciation and amortization remains unchanged at approximately $800 million for the year. In closing, I'm confident in our FY '25 guidance and our ability to deliver on our long-term financial algorithm with levers across the business. We believe we are taking the right steps for long-term benefit of the business and unlocking value that we reward our shareholders. I look forward to our progress ahead as Sysco is positioned to win. With that, I will turn the call back to Kevin for closing remarks.
Kevin Hourican: Thank you, Kenny. I appreciate all you are doing for Sysco. The disciplined leadership that you and your team display are a real strength for our company. Before we turn it over to questions, I want to reiterate the following key points. We are extremely pleased with our national sales, international and SYGMA business results. We believe these businesses are positioned to continue delivering compelling performance in the quarters and years to come. Our local business is in the midst of a business improvement phase. We have the right actions in place, and we are showing clear signs of progress by increasing our new customer win rate and improving Net Promoter Scores. That improvement trend has given us the confidence to reiterate our full year guidance and to equally iterate our overarching financial algorithm. Our solid balance sheet affords us the opportunity to return value to our shareholders while we are profitably growing our business. The announcement today of raising our share repurchase target for the year is just one example of the discipline we will deploy to ensure that our shareholders benefit along our journey. More to come as we have additional announcements in the future. Our future is bright as we expand our competitive moats, leveraging our size, our scale and our talented people. With that, operator, we're now ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Mark Carden with UBS. Please go ahead.
Mark Carden: So, you talked about some expected tailwinds in the second half of the fiscal year. How have January sales trended to date, just especially when considering some of the headwinds like the Southern Winter storms and Los Angeles Area wildfires? And then would you expect this to have an outsized impact on either your local or national businesses in 3Q?
Kevin Hourican: Mark, it's good to hear from you. It's Kevin. Just let me start with tailwinds and reasons for confidence in the second half. I'll briefly talk about January, turn Kenny for additional thoughts. Why we have confidence in our second half is the following. As I said in our prepared remarks, the businesses that are doing extremely well, international, national and SYGMA have clear momentum, building momentum. We expect for continued extremely strong performance from each of those three business segments. Within our local business, as I talked about on the call, we have internal lines of measurement that are clearly showing progress, new customer win rate, NPS improvement the colleague hiring and training that we're doing, which will result in forward-facing increased momentum again on that new customer win rate and then DC capacity expansions that occurred over the last six months that there was buildings enabled increased throughput, increased customer ability to serve, et cetera, et cetera. So, when we put all that together, we have a clear path towards delivering the outcomes that we expect to deliver will then allow us to deliver the financial guidance that we have put forward. Specific to January, just one reminder, January is the lowest volume month of the year, and that's the case for the entire industry. Every year, you're absolutely right with the California wildfires had an impact on Southern California. The even bigger topic is the Southern storm that impacted a large portion of the United States. We live and work in Houston, and it was quite the event in Houston this last week. We're working through it. Our goal is to serve our customers doing those periods of time. We're proud of is we're the first distributor to be out on the road delivering to customers, getting them back on their feet, working through that progress with our customers as they reopen and grow their business. As it relates to does it impact national or local more impacts them equally. So, we're not concerned about that, Jenny -- excuse me, Kenny, any additional comments on January.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Sure. Taking a step back, overall, in terms of industry foot traffic in terms of what we're seeing in Q2 improved from Q1. Q1 was down 4% and Q2 was down 2%. But that said, as Kevin mentioned, January was a bit choppy with weather and other disruptions. And one thing to note, if we had to choose a month to have uncontrollable disruptions, it would be January given the majority of our Q3 OI and EPS lands in February and March. Now we are encouraged by the fact that in select geographies, we've already seen nice progress made based on our investments in SC additions as well as our new comp model. And then one thing that kind of called out, most of our comments are usually U.S.-based, but for international, strong momentum there. We saw a strong push on Christmas, holiday year-end on both local and national volume and that momentum is carrying into January. So, the bottom-line is, we are confident we can operate in any environment as proven in prior periods, which supports our confidence in our FY '25 guide.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Lauren Silberman with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Lauren Silberman: So, I wanted to follow up on the prior one related to the U.S. Foodservice case growth. Organic volumes fairly flat quarter-over-quarter. Industry traffic, I think, improved almost 200 basis points quarter-over-quarter. So can you help us understand what you're seeing in terms of underlying dynamics and any market share dynamics during the quarter? And then, Kenny, I think you mentioned $100 million in annualized savings to help GP dollars in the back half. Just can you expand a bit on some of the drivers of that?
Kevin Hourican: Lauren, it's Kevin. I'll start. I'll talk about Q2 versus Q1, and Kenny will add on to that and then he'll directly address your $100 million question. It's an important and good one. for us to be very clear on the drivers there. Q2 performed as we expected. That's the punch line, and that's the headline. It was a choppy quarter. That's the word I used in my prepared remarks. The beginning of the quarter had a substantial hurricane impacting our Florida market and up into the Carolinas, which you know all about. And then the exit of that quarter was significantly impacted by holiday shift, which impacted the entire industry. So, you've read about that through all of the retail names that are out there, but one last week between Christmas -- excuse me, Thanksgiving and Christmas, that does have an impact to the restaurant industry and an unfavorable calendar shift as it relates to that. And then the ball around that is we had a very strong volume growth in Q2 last year. So, we're lapping strong numbers from a year ago, but that's because of that calendar component that I just we talked about the prior year was very favorable from a calendar perspective. So, when we put all that together, and I know it's choppy, and there's a lot to be normalized there. When you normalize for those things, you do is solid versus Q1 from an underlying performance perspective. And the more important point is we have the direct line of sight towards why it will be even stronger in the year to go. The direct line of sight towards the hiring we're doing the new customer win rate, which is building momentum, the Net Promoter Score momentum that we're driving, which will forward view add to customer retention and increased penetration. So, we put all that together, we do have confidence in our ability to improve local and the success that we're driving in the other three segments is notable and repeatable. Kenny, your comments to that and then turn it over to you.
Kenny Cheung: Yes. So let me add on to Kevin's comments on the confidence in local. We do expect to see improved sequential performance of local case growth in the second half of the fiscal year. So, let's be clear about that. And why is that? If you look at the underlying themes of our business, most of our incremental sales professionals were higher at the end of FY '24 and beginning of this year. So, with each month, these sales professionals are more productive, therefore, attributing more on the sales side. The comp model is working very well. We're tracking it very closely and it does two things just to remind everybody. incentivizes for growth and to grow profitably, and we're seeing both right now through our new customer acquisition count that Kevin referenced in his prepared remarks. And then last but not least, as we approach the second half of the year. Kevin talked about this for the Q2, most of our lift is driven by self-help and we will be lapping a more favorable comp in the second half of the year, which yields our confidence that we talked about in the prepared remarks. And Lauren, in terms of the $100 million annualized savings, as you heard as part of our guide, we are expecting a second half of the year step up on EPS growth. So, to put it to some real numbers, the first half is roughly, call it, 3.5% EPS. Growth and the back half will be a high single-digit growth rate. And I'll go slow on this part. One of the key drivers is that we have line of sight to $100 million of annualized savings to benefit both the gross profit line and the operating expense line. So to your second part of the question, what are some of the details and examples that we can talk about. So, there's a few buckets. The first bucket is strategic sourcing. The second bucket is supply chain efficiencies, i.e., inbound logistics that we spoke about prior. And then last but not least, organizational optimization, which has been implemented recently already. So that's been done for the quarter. So, the good news is we are starting to see savings from this month, meeting in January, and we will continue to execute on the other actions, which we have a strong line of sight to by the end of this quarter. We expect these savings to obviously materialize this year. But because they're structural, they will also continue into the first half of 2026 as well. These savings highlight our ability to be disciplined with expenses and offset any macro or industry environment headwinds from the first half and allows us to reinvest in the business as well. Now we're not stopping here. We plan to explore additional actions going forward. These benefits are already in the current guide, and it's another proof point that our ability to grow EPS by high single digits in the second half of the year. Again, the indexing of the benefit we gear towards GP. I hope that's helpful.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.
John Heinbockel: Kevin, I have a sort of multipart on the sales force. So just remind us, I think you've got cohorts coming out of training every six to eight weeks or something like that. Do you -- is it -- when I think about the number of people that are going to come off a noncompete -- so how do you think about that? And then I think you guys seated these salespeople with five accounts, and they have to double that over six months. So. when I try to think about all of this cadence-wise, right? And when you return to positive territory on local case growth, and I recognize you're down whatever, 1% to 2% today, is that possible toward the end of this fiscal year or is that really a fiscal '26 dynamic?
Kevin Hourican: John, thank you for the question. I'll start with your cohorts in the cadence. We track it in exactly the way that you're describing. So, we hire in waves, we train in waves. We deploy them out to geographies, as Kenny has said many times, targeted geographies. There are growth geographies. There are market share capture opportunities. We have Italian platform expansion opportunities and the like. So, we're being very surgical about where we deploy. Each cohort is tracked longitudinally over time to how they're performing and where they need to be performing. The headline without disclosing confidential internal information is each of the cohorts is where we need them to be on their maturity curve. We're pleased with the performance from the 2024 hiring, as Kenny said, which was mostly Q4. And we're pleased with the initial performance of the hires that we have done this fiscal year. They are onboarding new customers. That's the primary go-get for the new hires. We give them a small little territory, as you quoted, and now they got to be out on the street knocking on doors, and we're pleased with their performance. You're right, for competitive buyers. There's a non-solicit window, and we honor that. We are extremely respectful of that. So, to the point you're making, roughly, on average, 12 months after they onboard, there's a second wave of growth that can come from those new hires as those restrictive agreements expire, and we anticipate benefit in 2026 for that behalf. So, the headline is we are pleased with the hiring. We're pleased with the quality of the staff we've onboarded and we're pleased with the trajectory of their new customer performance. I see in my prepared remarks, notable increase in our new customer performance in Q2. As it relates to when to return to positive growth, here's what I can say today. We are confident in our ability to show and display progress quarter-over-quarter, and we anticipate that we will show you numerically that progress on a quarter-over-quarter basis due to the reasons that we said in answering Lauren and Mark's question that I'd prefer not to repeat because we're the length of the call and the number of questions that we anticipate. But it's a combination of the colleague hiring, the improvement in service we're delivering, the progress we're making on the new customer win rate and the expansion of our D2C capacity. You put all that together, we're confident in displaying numerically progress as this year progresses on a quarter-over-quarter basis.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Great. Just one clarification on your last comment and then a question. Just the assumed continued improvement that you're talking about. Can you share any color in terms of the case growth that you're assuming for the back half of the year, relative to, I guess, I think you said the industry was most recently down 2%, I'm just wondering what your assumption is for your business versus perhaps the industry in the back half of the year? And then separately, just wondering if you can comment on the Sysco Brand sales. I know, as a percentage of total sales, it seems like the U.S. broadline and the logo both have been easing. Just wondering your confidence in your ability to accelerate that mix it would seem like compelling offering and a challenged macro where the consumers are looking to -- or the restaurant customers are looking to save. So just wondering your thoughts on those Sysco-branded sales?
Kevin Hourican: Yes, certainly, Jeff. Let me just clarify the minus 2% that you mentioned there, that was food traffic to restaurants in Q2. That wasn't a Sysco performance number. So, the minus two is for traffic. We're expecting moderate aka slight improvement in that as we enter our second half, mostly in that spring -- late spring time frame, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we were going to be lapping it down 4% input traffic. We don't anticipate that the industry will experience a minus 3% or minus 4% on top of what last year is minus 3%, minus 4% from a traffic perspective. So, there'll be some natural gravity-based improvement tied to foot traffic. With that said, Kenny says this all the time, we don't need for that to occur in order to deliver our numbers. We are prepared to have the ability to deliver our financial algorithm despite economic external conditions. We have plenty of self-help activities in place that can move the needle for Sysco. So, the traffic improvement in the macro is reasonably immaterial to the overall year-to-go performance. It's the $100 million of economic improvement that Kenny talked about. That's actually the primary driver of first half EPS growth versus second half EPS growth. That's a meaningful and big deal. And as he said, direct line of sight with most of those actions or many of those actions already completed, and that will have wrap value into next year. So again, it's progress in local over time, and I have to emphasize this work profitably. We could easily move the needle from a volume perspective if we wanted to by being irrational on price. And we're just simply not going to do that. We are going to be disciplined. We are going to be consistent. We're going to run the Sysco play on the street. And the primary way we need to show the progress is by incremental sales headcount, which we talked a lot about, and we are where we need to be in that forward-facing progress. So, we need to show it to you in the outcomes, and we're going to do that as this year progresses. To the second part of your question, which was Sysco Brand. Sysco Brand is performing as we expected it would for the quarter, and we do not have concerns with Sysco Brand. It's fortress for us. It is an incredible program. You know the stats, 46% of our cases in the local sector have a Sysco Brand on the truck and we're pleased with our performance. The primary causal is national suppliers really struggled during the past couple of years during that period of time when supplier inbound fill rate to us was declining, Sysco Brand, we were doing a really good job of being in stock on the Sysco branded product, and there was some shift towards Sysco Brand, and there's a little bit of a return to the mean in that regard. With that said, we are confident over the longer time horizon that we can and will grow Sysco Brand. We're constantly introducing new items. We're constantly partnering with the supplier community to bring innovation forward through Sysco Brand. And as you said, when consumers are looking for value and customers are looking for value, Sysco Brand is a great alternative. So again, the main cause for the year-over-year decline is the natural impact of suppliers of national branded products, improving their fill rate, which net-net for the industry is a good thing. We know select customers really want national brand, and we're in stock on those products, we obviously give that customer choice. So, Jeff, that's the answer to the second part of your question.
Kenny Cheung: Jeff. Just one thing to add on the local piece of it. Kevin and I usually speak a lot about U.S., but international is doing really well on local case growth. For the quarter, local case growth for international grew 5%. And every market and our international business grew local cases were there wasn't just one region or one area. So, a big example, Canada, our biggest market grew 5%, GB second biggest market and international grew 8%. And the Sysco Brand, Kevin's right. But one thing to put things in perspective. It is still at over $22 billion business, and it's still growing profitably as well with strong penetration across our business and we do expect penetration rates to start to stabilize as we improve our local performance on the forward. And I think one thing to note as well is it's important to call out that as we talked about the $100 million, especially around strategic sourcing, that impacts fiscal brand and also non-Sysco brand as well, which is one of the reasons why we're expecting leverage in the second half of the year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
John Ivankoe: I hope you saw these numbers are more or less apples-to-apples, but certainly correct me if I'm wrong. Earlier in the call, you talked about Sysco local case volumes that were down 1.9% excluding DON. And in your presentation that the overall restaurant industry was down 1.6%. So, I just did want to get kind of a sense of that underperformance, maybe real pockets of opportunity that you may see that might be based on customer type, maybe there's a specific geography that's really been lagging for you that we're not aware of, if it's a share per account issue or if new customers have been entering the industry that perhaps you've just been having a tracking. So, are there really any major pockets of underperformance that you see nationally or even locally that you can kind of come and say, "Hey, we fix these couple of things and then we go from underperformance to outperformance?”
Kevin Hourican: Appreciate the question. Yes, the traffic to restaurants down 2% is what we quoted in our prepared remarks. For the quarter. And again, there's three months in the quarter, but for the three months in its entirety traffic down to, you're right, on the local number, DON down 1.9%. Again, when you strip out all the noise, and I don't like talking about the noise, but I'm going to -- because you asked the question, it's a choppy quarter. A major hurricane that impacts the beginning end of the quarter, a huge calendar shift that occurs at the end of the quarter vis-a-vis the holidays, net-net, you put that all together, we can do that math and strip out those variables and say our Q2 was actually strong versus Q1. I know externally when you look at the numbers and you don't have all the internal details, it looks like the deceleration and it was not a deceleration in local Q2 to Q1. It's a solid performance. It performed in line with what we expected. The more important is we are confident we will step up that local performance as we head into Q3 and as we head into Q4. Now to the second part of your question, specific region, that's actually what gives us the confidence, where we are not seeing meaningful year-over-year weather, Kenny talked about this vis-à-vis January, we're doing well in January. We're stepping up in January versus Q2 in those geographies that haven't been impacted by the wildfires or the weather. Where we have deployed the incremental head count surgically, we are seeing those regions be very successful from performance perspective. And we're a large company, John, as you know. And of course, we have select-regions that are underperforming versus our company average, we're very clear on what is happening in those geographies and what we need to do to improve. But there's no common theme with those geographies. There's no unique thing happening from a competitive dynamic perspective or an industry perspective, a large company with lots of regions, you always have a bottom x percent that you're working to improve, and we're deeply committed to doing that. So, net-net in aggregate, we are confident in our year to go. I've talked a lot about the comp program today, but the compensation program change that caused a lot of disruption at Sysco in Q1. That change disruption is now behind us. Our sales reps are benefiting from the new comp program. They are making more than they were making previously because they are changing their behaviors and doing the things we want them to be doing out on the sales cycle, which will benefit Sysco and clearly will benefit our colleagues as well. So, we anticipate that will gain momentum as the year progresses along with the incremental hiring that we've been doing along the way. Kenny, anything to add to that?
Kenny Cheung: Yes. So just a couple of things to add. We are seeing a strong correlation between headcount adds and also volume growth at the market. So, it's working -- and this will provide some color on Kevin's last comment around the comp model. We're seeing total new customer acquisition count go up. Again, I think Kevin said it. Today's new customers are tomorrow's penetration opportunities for us. That's great. And remember, the comp model also rewards for margin-accretive activities. So total team selling, a great one for us. It's really leveraging our broad line scale and specialty assortment. We're seeing that continue to increase as well this quarter. So overall, the comp model's working for us. It's a win-win for our colleagues as well as for our company.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Jake Bartlett with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.
Jake Bartlett: Mine was on the product cost inflation, reiteration of the 2%. I want to dig in and just see how maybe conservative that might be. We're seeing food PPI inflation really spike in the last couple of months. It seems to have a pretty good correlation with U.S. product cost inflation. So, I think I'd expect maybe a little bit of an increase there. So, the question is, do you expect that? And maybe there's some offsets in international or maybe SYGMA? That's the kind of forward question. Also, in the quarter itself, if you could just help us with what the inflation was by segment for the product costs, that would be helpful.
Kevin Hourican: It's Kevin. I'll start with comments about how we're viewing inflation. We have a lot of data as a global company. We have 13 attribute groups or 13 categories that we closely monitor and we blend them together to come forward with our inflation forecast. It's usually more accurate in the next 90 days than it is when you're looking further out than that because dynamic conditions can change variables. But where we're seeing increased inflation from a COGS perspective is mostly in the dairy and protein categories, avian flu. Flu influenza for birds is having a negative impact on supply, which is, therefore, increasing costs, specifically eggs, which has been very much in the media as of late, and we don't anticipate that pressure easing in the near term. We expect for that to continue. We expect for dairy and then specifically eggs to be inflationary because of AI, avian influenza. When we look at the protein categories, again, it's the same root cause. It's about a shortfall of product availability versus true demand, which tends to drive up prices. We all know supply and demand equation. And we don't anticipate in the main protein categories that's changing either. So, we would anticipate center plate inflation to be higher than normal over the next 90 days to six months. Where we're seeing offsets, which is what brings the total book down is in the commodities space, and that's increased product availability that's things we do to lower price through competitive sourcing and when we can lower price inbound to Sysco, we can pass on and share that value with our end consumers. So mostly in commodities, we're actually seeing and some of them deflation on a year-over-year basis. And it's the entire book of business that put to that forecast too. It's -- I'd say if it's going to miss versus our forecast, it probably misses on the higher end, but that's not something that we're forecasting as of today. Kenny, anything to add to the inflation question?
Kenny Cheung: Yes. So, I would just say right now, we're operating in a normalized inflationary environment. So, to your question, Jake, in terms of what we're seeing by segment, for the total company, it's roughly 2.1%. For U.S. business, it's pretty consistent, right? U.S. business, U.S. operations 2.7 and then our European business is roughly 2.9. So, to Kevin's point, if we were to miss, there will be some upside given the fact that we are currently trending slightly higher, driven by the center-of-plate dynamics that Kevin talked about. I think the other point that is important to note for Sysco is, we have a diverse set of product categories. And the good news is we don't over-index or exposed to any single category from a basket standpoint. So long story short, we are operating a normalized inflation environment, which bodes well for the industry.
Kevin Hourican: And it's one plus, I'm sorry for the three-part answer. Everything we're talking about is excluding the potential impact of tariffs. We can't anticipate exactly what will occur. Nobody knows exactly what will occur. The quote that we put out for the 2% excludes any impact of tariffs.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Edward Kelly: Kevin, I wanted to ask you about sales force and local case performance. You mentioned from a sales force perspective, could you just maybe take a step back and talk a little bit about where things stand today? I think you said the sales comp issues behind you, what does that mean? And then stepping back, big picture, the growth of your -- growth -- the gap between local case growth and national case growth is pretty large right now. Is that okay longer term for you to achieve the multiyear goals that you want to achieve?
Kevin Hourican: Ed, I'll start with your question about sales force and the comp and the change that has occurred there and then Kenny, I'll ask you to answer the question on the algorithm that we put out back at our Investor Day and how local and national contribute that work. So, what I meant by the comment of the impact of the comp changes behind us, let me just take a giant step back and say the comp change we made was the change we made because we wanted to listening to our sales colleagues, listening to our customers, looking at our P&L, putting all that together. Our best sales colleagues wanted a commission structure or a comp structure that provided them more upside to their outcomes. That's what our best people want. And then on the lower performer side, we had too many people that were living off their base pay and not doing the behaviors that we needed and frankly, not their book of business. And so therefore, the change we put forward on July 1 rewarded the top performers at a higher rate, and it held accountable the folks that weren't performing to change their behavior, step up their performance, be out on the street, opening new business, penetrating further categories. As Kenny said, selling more margin-rich products because they get rewarded for that in the comp model. So, what happened in July is there was a subgroup of our population that didn't like to change. Those people were almost exclusively our underperformers, and we had some exits from the Company back in Q1 that created a bit of a disruption during that period of time. How do I measure that, Ed, I think that's your question? Colleague retention, that's how we measure it. So, we saw an increase in our turnover in Q1. In Q2, here's the headline. Our retention has completely stabilized. We are back to healthy levels and run rate levels of retention and our colleagues are making more money in the new comp program than they were making previously, which is exactly what we want. We want for them to be driving the behaviors that are good for the Sysco P&L. It's an uncapped earnings potential program where the more they sell, the more they earn, and that's exactly, again, what our best performers wanted. And that is a topic that will have legs. It will have momentum that builds over time because see the second point, which is we're onboarding a healthy number of new colleagues who will be able to win new business and grow our business and succeed from themselves from a comp program tied to how we reward them for opening new business. So, the Q2 headline retention was solid in our colleague population, and we expect for that to continue in the go forward. Kenny, I pass to you for the second part of its question?
Kenny Cheung: Yes. The answer is for us is quite simple. We have to grow both, right? But the answer is to grow both. And just -- but I don't want to dismiss the success of CMU. CMU, our national customers business is doing really well. We are winning in the space, and we're winning profitably as well. That's really important. And I do understand with CMU and national customers growing faster, it just dilute the margin rates, I understand that. And with that said, the reason why you need both is because of the fact that our national business provides route density for us, right, really skills and covers our fixed costs in the local business since the truck is going there anyway, taxed on with additional case on the route itself and also the higher-margin business. So, when Kevin and I worked with our management team day in and day out, it's not just simply, let's grow local, it's how can we grow the entire portfolio and elevate us to drive margin expansion and top line growth from both sides of the house for us.
Kevin Hourican: That’s a plus at the end of Kenny's point there. We are extremely pleased with our national business and our international business and our SYGMA business, extremely pleased. We expect for and desire for those businesses to continue to perform at that level and I want to eliminate what may be a concern. And there are no supply chain constraints that are impacting negatively local because of the success we're having with national. We're not running out of slots in the warehouse. We don't have issues with hiring colleagues in the supply chain. Our trucks have capacity to support growth. What we need to see and what we're going to see is improvement in local. So, we need to continue to drive that significant and visible success in the three business sectors that are killing it and we'll continue to do so, and we expect and we will show progress in local -- in the go forward.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question will come from Alex Slagle with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Alex Slagle: I wanted to ask more about the international margin opportunity? Just you finished up '24, well above where you were in the years leading up to the pandemic and then a really good start here in the first half of '25. So just trying to think about what we should look for, for the margin? Is it a gradual grind higher here? Or do you think there's some point where you see a flattening out or maybe more of an inflection. Just kind of thinking about the cadence of initiatives rolling out and the degree that there are OpEx investments near term are anything else to think about on that? And I did have one follow-up on the adjusted earnings, whether there's that sale leaseback gain in there and if you have any comment on the magnitude?
Kevin Hourican: Okay, Alex. Thank you for the question. It's Kevin. I'll start with international. The headline, we are extremely pleased with our international business, leadership team, the business progress that's being made, the initiatives that we are driving that is helping deliver that business progress. It's certainly not coming from the macro economy in these countries. We are winning because we're taking share we're taking share profitably, and we're growing our business. So just shout out to our international leadership team for the great job that they are doing. And you're right that the EBIT as a percent of sales today within our international segment is lower than the total company book of business. which, therefore, is what gives us the direct confidence that we're not slowing down in international anytime soon. International will be the growth engine within the Company for years to come tied to our ability to grow the top line. And as importantly or even more importantly, improve the EBIT as a percent of sales. There are no structural barriers in any of the international countries that we compete in that puts a false ceiling on our profit rate. So, I'm not going to quote a percentage of EBIT to sales by a certain timeframe. That's more fodder for an Investor Day type conversation. But there's no wall coming anytime soon, we expect outsized top and bottom-line growth from international -- the programs, Sysco Your Way expansion. We're expanding our category assortment. We're introducing Sysco Brand. We're putting more sales boots on the ground headcount. We are putting in technology to make the business more efficient. We're expanding our supply chain in most of, if not all, of our international countries from a new buildings perspective. And there's the opportunity for M&A activity in both Ireland and GB within the past calendar year, we've built it on specialty capabilities, one in produce, one in protein. Guess what, that's exactly what we've done in the United States. And we have tremendous white space within those bolt-on specialty businesses in the countries that we currently operate within. And just really proud of our international business and the great work that they're doing. Kenny, I'll talk to you for any additional comments and then Alex’s second question.
Kenny Cheung: Yes, sure. The only comment I would add on international is, we've been able to replicate our size scale from U.S. to international. And the good news is not one market, every market is sitting in Europe, for example, in all international segment was up double digit in OI. Three numbers, top line 4%, GPV 7%, and then lastly, OI up 27%. So, it is working for basically across all markets, not just one market. Alex, to your question about sale leaseback. And let me walk through how Kevin and I and the team think through this one, right? How -- what's our view point? So consistent with our ROIC focus, we continue to look for opportunities to redeploy capital through buying and selling both on the business side and the asset side. So, as an example, on the business side, we divested our JV in Mexico, and we were able to redeploy that capital to fuel international growth, and we're seeing it. It's working, ROIC accretive, check. This same concept applies to assets, i.e., for example, facilities that we own. These actions help provide capital to fund new facility projects and higher more ROIC-accretive areas. So, I'll give you a good example. The more recent transactions that we've done, we were able to reallocate capital to a high-growth market, a market that has rising, for example, rents for us like Hawaii, for example, and we were able to take that and buy that asset down and redeploy the capital from a less accretive asset. Again, that's all part of asset management and trying to drive growth from an ROA standpoint. The other thing I would say is that the proceeds from the sale leaseback also enabled us to expand as well as to add more locations supporting our online business, our rectal platform that Kevin talked about as well as our new facility in the U.S. and international as well. So, the way I want to fund this one up is, overall, Sysco is a growth company sitting in a growth vector. We want to continuously and proactively to look at our portfolio, and we do the -- great companies do this, by the way, every single day, our portfolio, and to ensure that we are positioned ourselves from a footprint standpoint to have for a profitable growth and maximize our return on assets.

Operator: Welcome to Sysco's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2025 Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. We will begin with opening remarks and introductions. I would now like to turn the call over to Kevin Kim, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Kevin Kim: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Sysco's first quarter fiscal year 2025 earnings call. On today's call, we have Kevin Hourican, our Chair of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Kenny Cheung, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, please note that statements made during this presentation that state the Company's or management's intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, and actual results could differ in a material manner. Additional information about factors that could cause results to differ in a material manner. Additional information about factors that could cause results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the Company's SEC filings. This includes, but is not limited to, risk factors contained in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 29th, 2024, subsequent SEC filings and in the news release issued earlier this morning. A copy of these materials can be found in the Investors section at sysco.com. Non-GAAP financial measures are included in our comments today and in our presentation slides. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures is included at the end of the presentation slides and can be found in the Investors section of our website. During the discussion today, unless otherwise stated, all results are compared to the same quarter in the prior year. To ensure we have sufficient time to answer all questions, we'd like to ask each participant to limit their time today to one question. If you have a follow-up question, we ask that you re-enter the queue. At this time, we'd like to call -- to turn the call over to Kevin Hourican.
Kevin Hourican: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. During our call this morning, I'll provide an update on general marketplace conditions, highlight Sysco's specific performance results, provide some color on select priority initiatives, and reconfirm Sysco's previously issued full-year guidance. Let's get started with a brief update on the overall food away from home marketplace. Food traffic to restaurants was down 3.6% for the first quarter, grew roughly 100 basis point erosion from the fourth quarter. With that said, traffic trends improved throughout the quarter, with July down 5%, August down 4%, and September down 3%. The traffic data just referenced includes the impact from significant hurricanes that occurred in the beginning and ending of the quarter. We are cautiously optimistic that recent actions by the Federal Reserve, lower general gas prices, and getting past the election will positively impact food away from home traffic in the second half of our fiscal year. Notably, the improvement in Q1 food traffic data was evident across all restaurant types. To help matters, we see restaurant owners taking actions on menu pricing to improve their value proposition. This is a positive for the industry overall. Sysco can help restaurant operators achieve lower menu prices through our Sysco brand assortment and through value-added products that help save restaurants time and money. An example of this is our FreshPoint business that provides pre-cut products that help remove prep work from the kitchen. Turning to the non-restaurant sectors, we are seeing strong performance across the board with particular strength coming from the business and industry sector as more companies are encouraging work from the office. As Kenny has said many times, these non-commercial sectors tend to be more resilient to overall economic conditions, and we are seeing that in our current results. Turning from macro industry trends to Sysco's specific performance, we delivered the following results within our first quarter. Total revenue of $20.5 billion, a growth of 4.4%. The revenue growth was fueled by U.S. Foodservice volume growth of 2.7% plus moderate inflation. Our volume growth was generated by 5.5% national volume growth and 0.2% local volume growth. Adjusted operating income grew 2.2% for the period, supported by disciplined expense control. We delivered an adjusted earnings per share of $1.09, a growth of 1.9% to prior year. Most importantly, our first quarter results have Sysco on track for our full-year guidance, and we are reconfirming our full-year guidance on today's call. While we are pleased with many aspects of the quarter, we see opportunities for improvement within our performance. I'll start first with the strength points of the quarter. I am particularly pleased with our international business segment. We grew our international top line 3% for the quarter and grew adjusted operating income an impressive 12%. Our strong profit growth is being generated by expanding Sysco brand presence, operational improvements in the business, and the introduction of higher margin categories into select international geographies. Adding to the success is the strong strategic sourcing programs that are now running globally in the expansion of our Sysco your way [ph] local sales program. In addition to the success in international, our national sales business is performing at a very high level. We continue to on-board high quality, net new national business with strong margin profiles across restaurants and the non-commercial sectors. These new customer wins will continue our strong track record of performance in the national business sector. As we have said many times, national sales customers help us leverage our fixed costs, increase our purchasing scale with suppliers and improve our delivery route density as these deliveries are interspersed with our local deliveries. Our SYGMA segment had an extremely strong quarter, growing sales 7.3% and operating income 38.5%. It is great to see our SYGMA business return to sales and volume growth after resetting our customer base to a more appropriate business mix. We are confident that SYGMA will continue to deliver strong results over the remainder of the year. Our specialty platform continues to win in the marketplace with our total team selling program picking up pace and momentum. We are introducing our produce and protein specialty businesses to more Sysco Broadline customers, increasing our ability to serve customer needs, retain their business and grow our profit contribution. We expect total team selling to accelerate and help move Sysco towards our longer term goal of a $20 billion specialty portfolio. As we discussed at our Investor Day in May, the growth comes from a simple equation. When a Sysco Broadline customer buys from one Sysco specialty business, their total purchases are three times higher than if they buy from just Broadline. Today, we have thousands of Sysco customers that only buy from our Broadline business. We intend to change that overtime and have made this work a top priority for our sales organization. We will be adding our Edward Don business to the total team selling mix as we advance integration efforts. To that end, we are very pleased with the status of our Edward Don business. We have a compelling opportunity to introduce our equipment and supplies offering to Sysco customers, large and small. Over time, we believe we have international opportunities with this platform as well. With those business wins in context, there are elements of our business that need to strengthen. I'd like to start with local case growth. As I stated in my introduction, our local business was up 0.2% for the quarter. We are growing our local business despite negative 3.6% foot traffic. However, we know we can take share and drive higher volume properly. To reiterate what I mentioned in our last quarterly call, we have a focused plan to drive increased local case growth. I'd like to provide a brief update on our status of those efforts. Most importantly, in the last quarter, we introduced a new sales consultant compensation model. This was a needed change that went live on the 1st of July. We remixed our sales consultant compensation, reducing base pay by approximately a $1 and adding $1.50 to earnings incentives. Net-net, every single Sysco sales colleague has the opportunity to make more money in this new program, but their pay will have a higher correlation to their performance. Notably, our top performing colleagues are excited by this change and are indeed making more money as they continue to grow their broker business profitably. We are very confident that the new model is the right structure and possesses the right constructs to motivate all Sysco colleagues to actively engage our customers in selling and support activities. During our Q1, we experienced some short-term transitional issues as we work through the change management of the new program. We expect a positive impact of the comp change will be felt as we transition into the second-half of this fiscal year. Topic two regarding local sales is the status of our incremental sales headcount. We're very focused on upscaling our 2024 cohort of new colleagues to enable their success. Our 2024 hiring cohort continues to receive product training and selling skills training to help them advance their book of business. Our 2025 hiring cohorts will be metered across the year to balance the hiring with the pace and the health of the P&L. We will not go too fast or too slow. We will be firmly at the wheel of the hiring pace throughout the year. And we continue to have strong success in filling our job requisitions with high quality candidates from competition and from the industry overall. We're seeing initial progress with our U.S. Broadline local business results, as our exit velocity for the quarter was stronger than our entry point. We have modeled our improvement trajectory for the remainder of the year, and we have confidence that our improvement will support our ability to deliver our full year P&L. To that end, we have proof points with select geographies already hitting our growth expectations. These regions are ahead of the curve in regards to implementing change and are succeeding in running our go-to-market selling program. They give us the proof points and the confidence that the total company can and will achieve the outcomes that we expect. The last thing I'd like to discuss today regarding our business outcomes is our margin performance for the quarter. We delivered a gross profit margin of 18.3% for the quarter, 27 basis points below 2024. There are three primary causes of that year-on-year performance. A, customer mix, B, strategic sourcing timing, and C, Sysco brand penetration. Starting with customer mix, our strong relative growth in national sales has a downward rotation on margin percentage. We expect the gap between national and local sales volumes to compress as the year progresses, which will decrease this mix impact. Secondly, as it relates to our strategic sourcing efforts, we saw a lower contribution from vendor negotiations in the first quarter on a year-on-year basis. I want to be very clear that this is a timing-only topic that is unique to the first half of 2025. We have full confidence that our strategic sourcing efforts in 2025 will enable delivery of our margin targets for the full year. The strategic sourcing program will have a strong contribution year to go. Lastly, our Sysco brand penetration is down nominally year-over-year. This is mostly due to customer mix shifts with a small percentage impact from improved bill rates from national brand suppliers. Sysco brand remains a compelling strength point for the company, with approximately 50% of our cases sold to local street customers being a Sysco brand product. In total, we have full confidence that margin management will be a strength point for the full year. And therefore, we have full confidence in reiterating our full-year profit guidance. As I transition out of the business results, I have a few miscellaneous topics that I'd like to cover today. At an Investor Conference in September, we announced our intention to sell our share of our Mexico JV partnership. The business is not material to our top or bottom-line. Exiting the Mexico market is a display of ROIC decision-making framework in action. By exiting Mexico, we are focusing our capital, technology investments, and human capital leadership to higher yield priorities across the globe. We will buy and sell assets, as appropriate, to maximize our business value creation. To that end, we recently acquired Campbells Prime Meat a specialty meat business within the UK. The Scotland-based business is the number one specialty meat company in the region. By integrating Campbells compelling product offerings and custom-cut capabilities with our Sysco Great Britain Broadline business, we will enable total team selling in the geography. We will continue to look for high-quality assets that complement our business offerings. As I wrap up my remarks this morning, I will summarize with the following. Sysco has delivered strong business outcomes in our international segment, our national sales business, and our SYGMA segment. We expect that these businesses will continue their success in the year to go, if not pick up further momentum. We have a strong plan in place to drive improvement in our local business, and we are beginning to see the initial progress with our broadline efforts, with the exit velocity of our quarter being stronger than the entry point, and we have confidence in our improvement actions due to the strong results being delivered by regions that are ahead of the change curve. Margin management will be a strength point for the full year. We have a direct line of sight to the actions that will deliver our full year of margin performance. The combination of these factors gives me and Ken the full confidence to reiterate our guidance for the full year. We’re three quarters to go in the year we have our leadership team extremely focused on our top priorities. I thank all of those leaders and our entire 76,000-plus colleagues for their work focus. They're the best team in the industry, and I'm proud to work with them every day, serving Sysco's 100,000-plus global customers. Our future is bright, and I'm excited for what lies ahead. I'll now turn it over to Kenny, who will provide a detailed review of Q1 performance and select fiscal year ‘25 guidance commentary. Kenny, over to you.
Kenny Cheung: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Our performance this quarter included sales growth and improved profitability, in addition to returning meaningful cash back to shareholders. As Kevin mentioned earlier, restaurant foot traffic was down 4% during Q1. Traffic levels also improved throughout the quarter, an important positive signal for the industry. Here at Sysco, we are focused on executing on the things that we can control as the market leader by growing share profitably. This includes continued improvements to the core business to better align expenses with volume growth, improving supply chain productivity and corporate expenses, all while delivering world-class customer service. We exited the quarter with stronger year-over-year top and bottom-line growth rates during the month of September, adding to our confidence in our full-year guidance. While traffic is an important proxy for industry health, Sysco has proven our ability to grow in any environment. Looking back at the past 12 months, we've seen on average 600 basis points positive spread between our growth in industry traffic to accrete leverage on our P&L. We believe the current macro and industry challenges are transitory, and as volumes improve, we believe we are well-positioned to fully leverage our size and skill advantages. Additionally, our strong investment-grade balance sheet coupled with our robust operating cash flow allows us to invest in business and reward our shareholders. We remain on target to return $2 billion back to shareholders this fiscal year through share repurchase and dividends. Looking ahead to the remainder of the year, we continue to expect a more normal rate of top-line growth, in particular from local, in the second-half of the year. The second half is expected to deliver mixed benefits as well as other P&L benefits from our actions across operations. This includes our plan to escalate strategic sourcing efforts this year, which we expect will positively impact gross profit dollars and margins in the second half. This will be coupled with continued supply chain expense rigor, which we expect to progress over the course of the year. Additionally, we are optimizing our portfolio with an ROIC lens by announcing the planned divestment, our JV in Mexico, which will enable us to re-deploy and resources on higher margin, higher growth international markets. We are confident that our incremental actions will deliver positive operating leverage as we progress into FY ‘25 and beyond. Now turning to a summary of our reported results for the quarter, starting on slide 14. For the first quarter, our enterprise sales grew 4.4%, driven by U.S. Foodservice growing 4.6%, International growing 3%, and SYGMA growing 7.3%. This sales growth is within our guidance and the algorithm which we shared during Investor Day. With respect to volume, total U.S. Foodservice volume increased 2.7% and local volume increased 0.2%. Don positively impacted U.S. Foodservice volume by 2.6% and local volumes by 1.6%. National volume growth in the quarter also included margin expansion driven by contract renewals with existing customers and new customer wins. We produced $3.8 billion in gross profit of 2.9% and gross margin of 18.3% was down 27 basis points due to national mix increase, decrease in fiscal brand penetration, and timing of benefits from strategic sourcing. Kevin spoke to the updated sales compensation model rollout at the start of Q1, resulting in a sequential improvement in new customer acquisitions, an important step to drive future penetration related to growing share of wallets. Second-half gross margins are expected to expand from growing local, improving Sysco brand penetration, and driving strategic sourcing benefits to the bottom line. Our gross profit dollar improvement reflected our ability to continue to effectively manage product inflation which came in at 2.2% of the total enterprise consistent with our expectations. Specific to Sysco brand, penetration rates decreased by 59 basis points to 36.5% in U.S. Broadline and 55 basis points to 47% in U.S. local results. We continue to improve with local customers with single units, despite pressure from local businesses with multiple units, we tend to utilize more national brand products. As Kevin mentioned, our national brand suppliers have improved fill rates as of late. We have a strong history of growing Sysco brand penetration, and we have trade management actions to improve the mix and penetration over the course of the year. We continued to improve corporate expenses, which were down 14.5% from the prior year, on adjusted basis, driven by efficiency work that was deployed in FY ’24 and incremental actions during the quarter. Overall, adjusted operating expenses were $2.9 billion for the quarter, or 14.1% of sales and 18 basis points improvement from the prior year, reflecting supply chain and corporate expense efficiencies. Our supply chain remains fully stacked. We continue to improve colleague retention year-over-year, with retention more than doubling, and we are building on productivity gains with pieces per labor hour up low to mid-single digits year-over-year. Turning to field expenses, we remain disciplined around the pacing of our sales professional hires, and we'll focus on the quality and return on investments of the new hires. We are deliberate and disciplined on when and where we add. These investments are well-laddered, with this year's hires starting to drive financial contributions next year and thereafter. Looking at it from a different angle, approximately 50% of the year-over-year increase in adjusted operating expenses was driven by our investments in higher selling expenses, which includes sales professional hires and depreciation expenses related to new facilities. Two examples would be our net new distribution centers in Allentown, Pennsylvania, Sysco Broadline, and Los Angeles for our Restaurant business. The return of these investments will not be in the period, but several quarters later as we bring new customers into the fold driven by the capacity available from these new buildings. These actions will help contribute to positive operating leverage for the year. Overall, adjusted operating income was $873 million for the quarter. Our international segment continued to deliver substantial growth, demonstrating positive operating leverage and margin expansion. This included a 12.1% increase in adjusted operating income, with our teams successfully executing the Sysco playbook and growing substantially across Canada and Europe. Adjusted operating income growth also benefited from SYGMA contributing 38.5% profit growth as we continue to focus on profit enhancement and growth of the additions of new customers. We were able to prune our portfolio by exiting customers last year that did not meet our profit threshold and bringing in new customers at healthier margin profile. For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA increased to $1.1 billion or up 4.4%. The health of our balance sheet remains a source of competitive advantage and is industry leading. We ended the quarter at a 2.7 times net debt leverage ratio, which is within our target. We ended the quarter with $11.6 billion in net debt and approximately $3.3 billion in total liquidity, which is substantially above our minimum threshold. Our debt has wall-laddered without any maturities over $1 billion until FY ‘27. Turning to our cash flow, we generated approximately $53 million in operating cash flow and increased our free cash flow for the quarter by $81 million. Our first quarter is typically our lowest cash flow quarter of the year due to seasonality, with the improvement this quarter showing strong quality of earnings and prudent management of working capital. Our strong financial position enabled us to return more than $359 million to shareholders this quarter. We remain confident in growing both top and bottom-line results in FY ‘25 in line with our financial algorithm range. We continue to be confident as we believe this algorithm is achievable and one we can deliver on a consistent basis. Importantly, we are reiterating our 2025 guidance metrics as seen on slide 20. During FY ‘25, we expect net sales growth of 4% to 5%. Net sales growth includes inflation of approximately 2% which we are seeing now, and positive volume growth of low single-digits for the year. We also anticipate benefits from M&A during the year. All in, we are guiding to adjusted EPS growth of 6% to 7% in line with our financial algorithm range. Regarding phasing for the year, the second quarter will include benefits from an improved traffic environment relative to Q1. Q2 will also include significant comparisons, lapping the highest level of local case growth of 2024, and over 11% adjusted EPS growth. All in for the quarter, we currently expect a slight sequential improvement in the rates of adjusted EPS growth year-over-year relative to Q1, with the growth rate turning more positive in the second half. We continue to believe the second half will benefit from a stronger macro, modest industry traffic improvement, and benefits from investments in sales professionals and other growth initiatives. Additionally, we expect second half margins to benefit from our sourcing efforts, leveraging our unique skill advantages. This is essentially an expansion of strategic sourcing benefits to include a wider basket of categories, and further leveraging our geographic buying power, as well as improving inbound freight to further optimize COGS, minimizing touch points across our network. All in, we expect a stronger rate of adjusted EPS growth in the second half of the year. Consistent with our ROIC focus, we plan to divest our JV in Mexico. And this is expected to impact international sales on an annualized basis by approximately $500 million, and will be immaterial from a profit standpoint. Turning to expenses, we remain on target to deliver positive operating leverage based on our sales professionals moving up the productivity curve, and a continuation of cost improvement from FY’24 across our supply chain and corporate expenses. For example, supply chain productivity was the strongest in September, critically important as expense improvements essentially flow through to the bottom line. As I mentioned before, there is multiple memory across the organization, and our year-to-go actions will help develop a stronger operating model that positions us to grow share profitably. We continue to expect strong conversion rates from adjusted EBITDA to operating and free cash flow for FY ‘25, and we plan to reward our shareholders by distributing essentially all our annual free cash flow with over $1 billion in dividends and $1 billion in share repurchases, which can flex up depending on M&A activity. We also expect to operate within our stated target of 2.5 times to 2.75 times net leverage for the year. The adjusted tax rate for FY ‘25 is expected to remain at approximately 25% driven by the implementation of the global minimum tax. We continue to evaluate additional actions to offset this impact. Our adjusted Q1 tax rate included timing benefits and planning initiatives. In closing, I'm confident in our FY ‘25 guidance and our ability to deliver on our long-term financial algorithm. We believe we are taking the right steps for the long-term benefit of the business and unlocking value that we award our shareholders. I look forward to our progress ahead. We are positioned to win. Thank you for your time today. I'll now pass the call back to Kevin.
Kevin Hourican: Thank you, Kenny. Before turning it over to questions, I want to acknowledge the recent passing of Ed Shirley, our former Chairman of the Board. Ed had a tremendous impact on Sysco over his eight years of dedicated service. His mentorship, wisdom, experience, and joy for life will be missed. Our thoughts are with Ed's family. With that, operator, we're now ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. We will go first to Kelly Bania with BMO Capital. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Kelly Bania: Good morning. Thanks for taking our questions. Just wanted to maybe start off with a quick one about the stronger exit trends in September. Can you just maybe drill down and elaborate on what is driving that? And are you willing to comment about where you're tracking in October? And then just in terms of bigger picture question, you remain quite positive on the impact from the compensation change into the second half? And can you just help us understand what gives you that confidence, quantify the effect that, that change had on local case growth in the quarter? And if low single digit is still the target for fiscal '25?
Kenny Cheung: Kelly, Good morning. This is Kenny. So let me talk about Q2 to start off and then I'll address your question around September and October. So for Q2, we expect the EPS growth rate to be slightly higher than Q1, and that growth rate will step up in the back half of the year. Again, we're confident in the full year guidance. As it relates to October, the October month-to-date industry traffic we're seeing is similar compared to September, and we're seeing the same here at Sysco as well. But we're encouraged by the following. First is the last two weeks of October is stronger than the first two weeks, given weather-related events. The second thing we're charged by is select geographies are already hitting a local growth expectations driven by the SC additions as well as the new compensation model. As it relates to Q2, keep in mind, in Q2, we do have a tougher comp year-on-year. We are lapping the highest local case built in 2024 and an EPS growth of last year this time of 11%. All in for the quarter, we currently expect a slight uptick on EPS growth rate for Q2 with the growth rate turning more positive in the second half of the fiscal year. Kevin?
Kevin Hourican : Kelly, it's Kevin. I'll take the second half of the question tied to the SC comp. For those on the call, we announced in June the comp change went live July 1. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, there was a transitory impact of that new comp model in our Q1 as it relates to select people leaving the organization with that change. That's now behind us. We have fully stabilized the retention of our sales colleagues. Specifically, to your question about what gives us the confidence. We've remixed base to bonus, putting more emphasis on paper performance and we can see the elements of the comp program that we're focusing our colleagues on beginning to bear fruit. So what are those things? Increasing new customer count that is a very important component of the comp model. We are increasing our customer count and the progress that we made throughout Q1 is stepping up each month of that quarter, and we expect for that to continue. So that's proof point number one, we've increased our customer count and we expect that to continue in to be a tailwind into the second half. Second is total team selling, which is the bringing of our specialty businesses into a current Broadline account. We have made that a comp element for our Broadline sales colleagues. They are rewarded for that activity. So therefore, we are now seeing more of that team selling taking place. And the third is just overall performance of our colleagues, we call it grow on the grid. As they grow their business profitably, they earn more and Sysco benefits and improves. And as we're now 90 days plus into the new comp model, our leaders are helping our sales colleagues with moving up that growth on the grid, their success equals our success, and we're making progress month-over-month, and that's what gives us confidence for the full year.
Operator: We'll go next to Alex Slagle with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Alex Slagle : Thank you. I just wanted to dig into the U.S. gross margin, I guess, which is facing headwinds related to the product, customer mix dynamics. And I know you have several initiatives in place to redirect the momentum here with a lot of it seemingly being self-help opportunity and the pieces kind of coming together in the back half. But are there external dynamics that have gotten any tougher, whether it's the competitive dynamics in the industry or if there's any evidence of product trade down within customers toward alternative proteins or elsewhere? Anything here to the degree that impacts your gross margins and the outlook?
Kevin Hourican : Alex, it's Kevin. I appreciate the question. I'll start, and then Kenny can add anything he would like to add. I'll just go back to some of my prepared remarks. There are three drivers of the gross margin nominal decline from a percent basis year-over-year. The first is customer mix. We're growing our national business faster than our local business at present time. We expect that to decline as an impact over the year as we improve our local case performance. So particular headwind compresses or decreases as the year goes on. Second point, and it's the biggest of the point, is our strategic sourcing efforts. As I said in my prepared remarks, this is a timing-only issue. We are fully confident that the full year value that will come from our strategic sourcing will enable us to deliver our gross margin rates for the full year. It's just on a year-over-year basis, Q1 this year versus Q1 last year, the contribution from that program was lower. And it's a timing issue relative to the work we do in that program, and we have full confidence in the GP value creation that will come from strategic sourcing as the year goes on and we deliver the full year requirements. The last of the three is Sysco brand penetration percent. It's down slightly year-over-year. It's interesting to unpack that one. For local mom-and-pop street customers, our penetration is actually up year-over-year. It's our -- what we call LCC, which is the small chains, 10 to 100 doors in that range, that size customer, we're seeing a decrease in Sysco brand purchases year-over-year. To your question on macro, that's mostly tied to our national brand suppliers improving fill rate. With net-net is a good thing for the industries. Our customers don't like substitutions for those types of products. But Sysco brand fill rate tends to be better than national brand fill rate. And while national brand suppliers were having some challenges over the past couple of years that resulted in higher Sysco brand penetration. With that said, what can we do about that? We're putting what we call trade management deals in front of those customers, putting value in front of them specific to Sysco brand, and we are confident that we can improve the penetration of Sysco brand within that small chain concept division. Kenny, anything to add on margin?
Kenny Cheung: Sure. Alex. If we take a step back for the quarter, overall, GP grew 3% and GP dollars per case expanded by 1%. I agree with Kevin's points around the drivers that put pressure on GP in Q1. And we have acted in place, as you heard from Kevin. A couple of other things I would say is that we also have other actions that drive GP. It's not just those three things in our company. We have other levers in our company that can drive GP as well. Let me give you a couple of examples, specialty -- growing specialty, right, that has a higher margin attachment rate. Total team selling, which gives us both top line and margin calories. As we go international, in particular, local customers, inbound logistics optimization, where we minimize touch points in terms of supply chain and on and on. So there are other things that our company is working on as well that would drive accretion to our P&L. And the majority of the benefit, as Kevin said, will be in the back half of the year. So in the back half, to summarize your question around phasing, we expect total GP, GP dollars per case and margins to grow in the second half of the fiscal year. And that's the big reason why you see the elevated run rate on EPS growth in the back half as well, coupled with local case growth. So to your question about controllable or the market itself, I would say it this way, most of the lift on margins and growth in the back half is from our own actions versus market lift. So definitely, it's more controllable, and that's the reason why we are confident in the full year.
Alex Slagle: Got it. Thank you. That’s helpful.
Operator: We'll go next to John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
John Ivankoe : Thank you. The question is on the sales force compensation change. You mentioned the word transition or transitory in relation to the first quarter. And it does sound like at least some of that may have been unexpected or unanticipated at least to a minor degree. So can we kind of drill a little bit more in terms of what type of transitory impact did we see? Did we see more kind of underperformers or performers in line leave? Did we keep all the kind of the best people that you really want to keep? Or was there any unanticipated type of turnover? And as we think about growing the sales force 20% over the next couple of years, as you've kind of seen some behavioral changes based on this new comp model, do we still think that 20% number is still the right target from here? Or can we get basically more out of existing people as they're compensated to do so?
Kevin Hourican : John, it's Kevin. I'll start. Kenny can comment to the tail end of the question about the economics of the new SE hires, but let me address the first part of your question, which is the why we made this change, the impact that we've had, and again, the overall thought process behind it. This is a change we wanted to do. Our base space were too high as a percentage of the total earnings potential for our colleagues. Reminder, pre-COVID this was a job population that was 100% commission. So we implemented a base plus bonus program during the COVID years, and it’s time to unwind some of that, putting more of their pay at risk so that we have a pay-for-performance culture. Their outcomes and their output will determine their earnings and their success equals Sysco success. To answer your question on top performers versus underperformers our people performing below average. Our top performers, John, they love this program. they want more earnings potential in every Sysco sales colleague has the opportunity to earn more money in this program than in the old program. So our top performers are very pleased with this program. They're earning more money this year versus last year in our Q1. We did see an increase in colleague turnover in July. We did actually anticipate that. What we've said to our own internal leadership is one of two things has to change with this program. Behavior and outcomes need to change and therefore they earn more money or some of the individuals themselves will most likely rotate out. We did see that activity in July, an increase in our turnover that is stabilized. We have returned to our normal rates of SC retention. Our top colleagues are with us. Our top colleagues are earning more money and we're having no challenges with hiring new colleagues from competitors and from the industry to fill our inbound SE hiring needs. So we've made this change because we want to do. We made this change for the long term benefit of Sysco. We are confident that for the year to go, this SC comp change will be a tailwind to our performance, not a headwind and the change curve, if you will, is behind us vis-a-vis Q1. Kenny, anything to add on the P&L impact on the year-to-go hiring?
Kenny Cheung: Sure. John. Three things I'll say. First is most of the year-over-year incremental sales professionals on our post today were higher in the back half of '24 and the new compensation program was rolled in early July. So the benefits we expect to see will mostly happen in the second half of the year. From an ROI standpoint, to your question around adding headcount. We are committed to growing our local sales professional head count. And we will be disciplined on facing some volume expectations and market conditions. As Kevin said in his prepared remarks, we will not go too fast, and we will not go too slow will be deliberate on when and where we add, meaning investing high-growth markets to ensure an optimal return on investments. And by the way, we are seeing a high correlation between head count adds and volume growth by market. The last thing I would say is that international had a good quarter for us. The local growth was 3%, which was contributing to a 12% OI increase. And the good news is it's not just one market, every region within our international portfolio grew local sales.
John Ivankoe: Thank you very much.
Operator: We will go next to Mark Carden with UBS. Please go ahead.
Mark Carden : Good morning. And thanks so much for taking the questions. So another one on some of the salesperson compensation shifts with the adjustments to the new model, you guys have done some territory reductions in rebaselining. How is the sales force adapting to some of these changes so far? And are you seeing the kinds of team-based selling lifts you were anticipating?
Kevin Hourican : Thank you for the question. To be clear on where the head count adds are occurring, it's not a shocker on approach of spreading them evenly across the United States. We're adding the head count to high-growth opportunity markets for Sysco. We won't specifically, on this call, tell everyone where those activities are happening, but the incremental headcount is going to places where our business is robust, strong, growing, and we're going to make that fast source run even faster by fueling those geographies with incremental headcount. So these are population growth corridors in the United States and other areas where we do see tremendous potential for Sysco to win market share and to win market share profitably. So it's not every colleague that is impacted by this. In fact, it's a reasonably small percentage of our current colleagues are impacted by a new person coming in. And as Kenny has said many times, when a new person joins, we give them a small starter book of business of roughly five accounts. So that means five other SEs have donated one customer account. So the impact is reasonably negligible to current colleagues. Why we're doing this is we want to grow our customer count. We want to grow our book of business and by adding the SE headcount. It allows us to make that growth occur without increasing our territory size beyond the red zone for existing colleagues. So we're really pleased with the work that's happened with the placement of those colleagues and the total team selling component of your question, we're on track with total team selling. What it starts with first is who are the customer prospects to who is the customer that's buying from currently Sysco Broadline, and we know through our data, they're buying produce or protein from a specialty entity. I want to be clear, this is not trying to take business from a Broadline competitor. They're buying produce from a local specialty produce entity or they're buying their specialty cut meat from a specialty meat shop. That's the good news for Sysco. We identified that customer who's already buying from us and they're not buying specialty. We are seeing the behavior that we need to see with our colleagues collaborating, going to that account together and introducing Sysco's specialty capability and just bringing you back to the May Investor Day when just one of those specialty businesses is put into that account, our business goes up 3x with that given customer. And the why, as Kenny talked about, we're adding that higher calories margin specialty business, but we're also kicking out a competitor that is selling some Broadline products, and let me be clear about that. Those specialty entities can't make enough money on selling just produce. So then they start selling things like chemicals and disposables and dairy. And when you get that specialty produce entity out of the account, those other things they were buying from them, they buy from Sysco. So our Broadline business improves as well, and that's been one of the unlocks for our sales organization. When we proved that map to them and to see my comments earlier about the new sales consultant comp model, they benefit as a Broadline sales colleague when they bring one of their specialty friends into their account.
Operator: We will go next to John Heinbockel with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.
John Heinbockel : Kevin, can you talk to -- if you think about the maturation, right, of the new sales cohorts, start with five accounts. Where are they in six months or a year? What's the path, right, to get to sort of full book of business, number one? And then when you think about the proof points that you're seeing, right, in the geographies, what are the corollaries? Why are those geographies succeeding particularly? And then just the quick last one is just -- I know you talked about specialty. Is it possible that 20% of your accounts are not buying specialty from you? Could it be that high or higher or no?
Kevin Hourican : Okay. Just on the first part. Thank you, John, for the questions. On the first part of your question, which is how are they performing? As Kenny said, we hired colleagues as cohorts throughout the year classes if you will. The majority of that hiring did take place in the second half of the year. We are tracking each of those cohorts versus what week are they in. So 12 weeks unless they should be at a certain level. 12 to 24, they should be at a certain level. The news to report on today's call is each of the cohorts is moving up the productivity curve at the rate that we expect. We actually added sales trainers as a part of these efforts to ensure that they're being provided. It's mostly product knowledge skills training. So that they can, in fact, sell Sysco brand, as an example. So what I can share on today's call is, we're pleased with the performance of the 2024 hiring cohorts. They're maturing up their productivity curve at the rate that we expect their growth comes from winning net new business. We are increasing our customer count as Sysco month-over-month in our Q1, and we expect for that to continue, in fact, pick up pace as the year progresses along. Kenny, anything you want to add to that? John, the second part of your question?
John Heinbockel: What was the second part?
Kevin Hourican : Yes, please.
John Heinbockel: Well, the second part was the proof points, right, they're succeeding. I'm just curious, is there any commonality to that in terms of size of the cohort geography growth, how you're attacking that? And then the last piece was just your specialty opportunity.
Kevin Hourican : Yes, very good. On the proof points, we can very clearly see in the geographies where we're adding head count that we're performing better in those geographies from a market share growth perspective and in the geographies where we have not. And that reinforces even more the point in the importance of where and why and how we need to be deploying the headcount talent and it gives us that strong confidence that we keep forward with the hiring pace and hiring plan. Think about metro. I won't name a metro market, but where you know from our history, we've under-indexed from a market share perspective in those metro markets. Head count growth is happening in those metro markets, and we're seeing our market share growth capture. As it relates to the percentage of our customers that have the opportunity for total team selling, it's high. We're not going to quote the exact percentage, but it will be north of the number you quoted. It's a substantial number of customers who are currently buying from Broadline only.
John Heinbockel: Thank you.
Operator: We will go next to Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Edward Kelly : Hi. Good morning, guys. Kevin, you talked about -- it sounded like this is about the sales force hires, but about an emphasis on a balanced, maybe measured sort of pace of sales hires in '25. Can you maybe elaborate on that? I mean you've had some initial turnover issues, which you're over now, but does that impact your ability to grow the sales force by the 450 hires this year. So I'm curious, is that a target that still applies? Does that impact '26? I'm just kind of curious, like, are you rethinking like the pace of the sales hires, the magnitude of the sales hires? Any color around all of that, that you can provide?
Kenny Cheung: Yes, it's Kenny. So I can start off. So we are committed on growing our local sales professional head count and for this year and many periods ago. But we'll be disciplined on the pacing types of volume expectations, the market essentially ensuring that we still have leverage in the P&L and to ensure we still have margin expansion as well. As Kevin said, we'll pace it appropriately by market, not one night that’s all. It's ensuring that we are smart and disciplined on where we add. As Kevin said, there's a strong correlation now between ads and market growth rates. Kevin?
Kevin Hourican : Yes, I think that's -- we're committed to hitting the hiring target, but we'll be very responsible based that we have the net leverage flow-through throughout the year that we're looking for. Just one additional comment. We're having no difficulty at all hiring people. When we put out our job rec, we call them cohorts, we're getting attractive candidates from competition, and we're getting attractive candidates from the industry AKA from restaurants and from existing customers.
Edward Kelly: Great. Thanks guys.
Operator: We will go next to Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Brian Harbour : Yes, thanks. Good morning, guys. Can you just talk about your confidence in sort of private label penetration, right? Based on your comments, it sounded like maybe it had been running higher just due to the environment. So what specific actions and what kind of time do you think it will take to continue to push that higher?
Kevin Hourican : Yes. Great, Brian. Thank you for the question. To answer this one with sincerity and earnest is to break it down into the three different customer types we have. So we have the mom-and-pop local customers, street customers. We have that small chains that I mentioned earlier and then big chains. Our penetration percent is very different with those three customer types. For local mom-and-pop customers, the street customers, our penetration actually increased year-over-year in the first quarter and it's continued to run the play. We're doing extremely well there. Within the small chains, the growing concepts, slight dilution year-over-year, mostly driven by national brand suppliers increasing their fill rates, which net-net for the overall industry is a positive. What we need to do to make progress with that customer type is what we call trade management deals in front of them, product cuttings, let them taste our brand product, share some of the value creation to Sysco when we win that case, with the customer. That's what a trade management deal is. The Sysco brand case is substantially more profitable than a national brand case, and we can invest some of that favorability with that customer in order to be able to have them be able to make a shift with Sysco, and that's what we're working on. There are multiples of examples of new product introductions a year ago that give us the progress, confidence that we will be able to make there. And then the third is with the largest national chain customers. It's a similar concept. Mostly, this is not restaurants. This would be health care entities. This would be education entities. Think about those as behind the counter, back kitchen conversions, we have an opportunity to put more trade management deals in front of those noncommercial customer types to show them the value of Sysco brand, invest in some of our favorability with those customers to encourage them to make a shift. So Sysco brand penetration, we have confidence over the long term, this will continue to be a growth story for Sysco and the margin tailwind. The bigger story for margin, though, for the year to go, if you look at Q1 versus prior year, it's the strategic sourcing component that I talked about during my prepared remarks. It's a timing-only issue, Kenny and I are fully confident that the full year, we will deliver our margin profile, margin target. The value creation will just be more second half. These are strategic sourcing, competitive bids, there RFPs, they just take time, and we're fully confident in the full year value creation. Kenny, anything to add?
Kenny Cheung: Yes. Brian. So keep in mind, the Sysco brand portfolio is $2.2 billion portfolio, and it's still growing quarter after quarter. And we have strong existing penetration, i.e., think about local customers, about 50% penetration of global customers. As Kevin said, we're excited about the product promotions as well as product innovation. I also think it's important to call out, as Kevin talked about, strategic sourcing. Strategic sourcing, the benefit we'll get is not only Sysco brand, but also non-Sysco brand as well, and that's a reason why we're confident that we expect leverage -- other leverage in the P&L in the back half.
Operator: We'll go next to Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Jeffrey Bernstein : Great. Thank you very much. Two related questions just on sales growth as we think about the rest of this year. The first one, I guess, local case growth was 20 basis points in this quarter. I think you said Edward Don at 160. So I guess without that, it was maybe down 140 basis points, but you guys seem very confident in the acceleration. I get the feeling most of it is about the ramp in hiring and the compensation changes. So I'm just curious, what's the greatest risk to this assumed acceleration, if in a quarter or 2, for some reason, it doesn't play out as expected. And my follow-up is just more broadly, I guess, just on fiscal '25. Your slide deck shows 4% to 5% sales, I think you said a couple of points of inflation. So we're talking about maybe 2% to 3% case growth. Just wondering how you think about the case growth between the chains and the independents whether presumably that gap meaningfully narrows I guess more broadly, just asking your confidence in the fiscal '25 guidance, both the top and the bottom line?
Kevin Hourican : Jeff, it's Kevin. I think it's a great question, and we're putting this up there and this is a good capstone question. So I'm actually going to start second part of your question, which is overall confidence. In the process of answering that question, I will directly address your volume growth question, and then toss to Kenny for final words. So what gives Kenny and I the confidence in the full year is the following, three main levers in the P&L. Volume growth, gross margin, expense management, and we have direct line of sight for each of the three of the progress that we're making and then therefore, the impact of that progress on our full year. So let's start with volume. As mentioned earlier, key regions are already hitting our volume growth targets. Those regions are ahead of the change curve. They give full confidence that as we get the rest of our country performing at that level, that success is highly realizable. We're making month-over-month progress in our Q1, which we will carry into the remainder of the year. The comp change was actually more of a headwind in Q1 than a tailwind, and that completely flips here to go as it becomes a tailwind. The headcount has, Kenny said, they happened mostly in the second half of fiscal 2024, these folks are still coming out of training classes. They're still coming out of their product knowledge training class. They're now hitting the street. We're growing our customer count that customer count growth will continue as the year goes on. Total team selling, this is new muscle for Sysco. We are getting better at the team-based selling. We have crystal clarity on who the customer targets are. We're doing a better job of getting the specialists into the account. Our close rate when we do that is exceptional and continues to hit our targets. We just need to continue to increase the number of what we call at that per period. When you put all that together, it's not a light switch from off to on. It's a sequential steady progress throughout the year. We have a line of sight for where and how that progress will come from, and we have confidence that we can deliver our volume expectations. The process of doing that will tighten that gap that currently exists between local and national that you were just asking about. So that's topic on volume. Topic 2, which is gross margin. As I said, the slight dilution year-over-year in Q1 is a timing issue. We have full confidence in our ability to deliver our gross margin expectations for the year. It is a strength point of Sysco, and we will deliver our gross margin expectations. Last but not least, in the expense area, our supply chain continues to strengthen and improve. Retention up substantially year-over-year. Productivity improving year-over-year. Kenny talked about the opportunity to improve our inbound transportation modeling and economics. We have the opportunity to update routing outbound or customers to reduce miles on the road, and we're working on all of these things. So our expense improvement will continue through the year. And when you put all those things together, that's what gives us the confidence. Most importantly, though, we're also playing the long game. We continue to invest with the success of Sysco for the long term. We opened a brand-new facility in Allentown within the last quarter. We opened a brand-new facility for Greco, our Italian business out in L.A. in the last quarter. We will continue to make investments that enable Sysco to be a leader in this industry for the long term, and that's the strength of our balance sheet in action. We can deliver the current year profit expectations while continuing to invest in a competitive moat that's defensible for decades to come. Kenny, over to you, for anything you'd like to add.
Kenny Cheung: Yes. Jeff, a couple of things to add. So the headline news is, we are very confident in our financial guidance for the year. Three things as some sort of Kevin said, exit rates, point number one, right, September was our strongest month of the quarter, both top and bottom line. Next and is continuing into this quarter. Number 2 is the levers we have in our P&L. So think about what Kevin talked about between GDP, supply chain and also corporate expenses. I won't repeat the first two, but corporate expenses -- we were down 50% year-on-year, and we still have a robust pipeline for year to ago as well. So to your question around if things were different, what can we do? We can flex our expenses. It is a muscle reflex before, and we know how to flex on the floor. And the last but not least, our confidence also guided by the fact how we managed last year, right? Think about last year. It was dynamic. We had disinflation, deflation, we have a softer macro backdrop and we were able to overcome that and come in higher than the midpoint of our guide. So as Kevin said, fantastically. We are managing the company, and we are playing the long game. Yes, we have some purposeful decisions such as compensation model and new facilities roll out in the quarter. But it's the right thing to do for our company. Overall, we are confident we can achieve our full year guide of both top line and bottom line.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.

===== 2024 Q4  (2024-07-30 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to Sysco's Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. We will begin with opening remarks and introductions. I would like to turn the call over to Kevin Kim, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Hourican.
Kevin Hourican: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. During our call this morning, we will cover the following key topics. Food away from home volume trends, including foot traffic to restaurants, Sysco's performance for the quarter and the year relative to the overall market, and status updates on key topics of interest, including inflation, local case growth, supply chain productivity, and finally, Kenny will cover the financial details of our Q4 2024 as well as provide our fiscal 2025 guidance. Let's get started with key highlights of the business on Slide number 5. I'm pleased to report that Sysco delivered $79 billion of top-line revenue for the year, a growth of 3.3% versus fiscal 2023. The revenue growth was driven by USFS volume growth of 3.1% and USFS inflation of 0.5%. Sysco profitably took market share in fiscal 2024. I will speak more to this in a moment. Importantly, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $1.39 for the quarter and $4.31 for the year. The full year performance was $0.01 higher than the midpoint of the guidance that we provided at the beginning of fiscal 2024. Kenny calls this our say-do ratio. And I'm pleased that we delivered above the midpoint of our initial guide for the year, despite a softer economic environment in the second half of the fiscal year. During our Q4, our team once again displayed agility and accountability, enabling a strong financial performance despite negative year-over-year foot traffic to restaurants. As I said in my intro, I would like to start by providing an update on the health of the food away from home industry. Traffic to restaurants was down approximately 3% year-over-year for the quarter. This is consistent with what you have heard from many restaurant names over the past couple of days and weeks. Sysco was successfully able to grow our volume 3.5% for the quarter, despite the decline in year-over-year foot traffic. We did this by taking market share versus the overall market. In fact, for the full year, we grew our business more than 1.75 times the market. That performance was above our stated goal for the year of 1.5 times market growth. Sysco's performance versus the market is calibrated via multiple external sources and the performances versus the total industry overall. The strong 1.75 times growth was a result of several important factors, as seen on Slides 6 and 7. The largest distributors in the industry are taking share versus the overall foodservice market. Sysco specifically is winning with our specialty platforms, including FreshPoint and our specialty meat businesses, as well as our recent acquisitions like Greco and Edward Don. The combination of our industry-leading broadline business with our expanding specialty portfolio is winning in the marketplace. Lastly, our national sales business is winning versus the total market, with notable wins in the foodservice management space and hospitality. We are pleased with our overall performance versus the total market. And with that said, we are not satisfied with our growth in the important local segment. As we covered at our Investor Day, we are confident that we can improve our local case performance in fiscal 2025. I'll speak more to those plans in a moment. For the fourth quarter, Sysco delivered the following performance. Continued and compelling profitable case growth within national accounts. Local case growth of positive 0.7% to last year. Importantly, our local cases in international grew 5% for the period. SYGMA cases grew 5% from Q3 to Q4, with a June exit velocity of positive year-over-year growth. This is a reversal of recent negative volume trends within SYGMA, as we have last week 52 of a customer exit and we have signed new profitable business that had start ship dates during our fourth quarter. We expect SYGMA to be a volume and profit growth business in fiscal 2025. Sysco has a well-balanced business with strong market share in the non-restaurant space. Many of the non-restaurant sectors, like healthcare and foodservice management, are less impacted by consumer confidence in restaurant foot traffic. At times like these, our well-balanced business portfolio is a strong asset for Sysco, including our international segment. Our gross profit rate for the quarter was strong, with GP growing 4.2% year-over-year and GP per case growing 1.3% versus prior year. Our merchant team continues to do an excellent job with strategic sourcing and product innovation. Overall expense management continues to improve year-over-year, with operating expenses increasing slower than our top-line. Most notably, our corporate expenses were down 10% for the quarter on a year-over-year basis. The corporate expense reduction was a result of the efficiency work that we deployed in Q3 of this year. Benefits from those expense reductions will continue into 2025, and Kenny will speak to that in more detail. All told, these factors resulted in a 6.4% increase in our operating income year-over-year, enabling us to exceed the midpoint of our full year adjusted EPS guidance. Now that I have highlighted our financial performance for the quarter, I would like to continue the theme of our Investor Day and provide you a bit more color on two of the biggest levers within our P&L: local volume growth and supply chain productivity improvement. Let's get started with volume growth. Specifically, I'll highlight progress we are making on the actions to deliver increased profitable local case volume in fiscal 2025 on Slide number 9. First, let me start with hiring status. In full year fiscal 2024, we successfully hired 450 net incremental sales professionals. The colleague hiring ramped throughout the year, with many of them being hired in the second half. The new colleague cohorts hired in 2024 will begin positively impacting our P&L throughout fiscal 2025, as they grow their new territories and become more knowledgeable about our product offerings. As we mentioned on our Investor Day, we plan to hire an additional net 450 sales professionals in fiscal 2025, with those new cohorts expected to positively impact our fiscal 2026 results. We are confident in our ability to hire and train these new colleagues. In fact, we are supplementing our industry-leading training program by hiring more sales trainers in sales administrative staff. One of our top priorities as a company is to ensure that these new colleagues get the training that they deserve and ramp up the productivity curve in an efficient manner. Our executive leadership team is taking personal ownership to ensure we track the new trainees cohort by cohort to ensure that they are maturing on schedule and that they are provided the support and resources they need to be successful. Our strong supplier community will be assisting in the ever-important product training that goes along with new colleague hiring. We greatly appreciate our supplier community for their support. On the first day of our new fiscal year, we introduced a new compensation program for our U.S. broadline sales colleagues. We have remixed the base pay to incentive ratios within our compensation program. In the process of doing so, we have increased the earnings potential of our sales staff, and the incentives put in place motivate the specific behaviors that will help advance Sysco's P&L. The communication and change management of the new compensation program is well underway, and we are confident that this program will be good for our colleagues, our customers, and our P&L. Benefits of this new program will be felt as the year progresses, but I don't anticipate any major movement in Q1. Our total team selling program continues to advance, with our sales consultant generalists partnering better than ever with our produce and protein specialists. At our Investor Day in May, Greg Bertrand, our Global COO, covered the compelling growth opportunity via our total team selling program. As he presented in May, a customer that buys from Sysco broadline plus one of our specialty businesses spends three times more per week than a broadline only customer. Winning with specialty is a $10 billion plus opportunity for Sysco as we work to earn our fair share of the specialty market. Sysco specialty is a compelling moat versus the overall industry, as it has taken more than 20 years for us to assemble our specialty assets. Integrating the systems, supply chains, colleague compensation programs, and the important go-to-market selling strategy between specialty and broadline, this was a very large work effort. In the coming years, we will continue to expand our specialty capabilities, both domestically and internationally, through a combination of M&A and greenfield activities. For example, we are adding our Asian Foods business to our recently opened Allentown, Pennsylvania distribution center. This addition will greatly improve our ability to serve the large and growing Asian markets in the Northeast. Lastly, our international business delivered compelling local case growth of 5% for the quarter. We are running the Sysco play internationally, with programs like Sysco Your Way and Perks! beginning to positively impact our outcomes. We are also bringing improved technology and Sysco brand products to these important geographies. All told, the strong local case growth enabled our international segment to deliver a compelling 13.1% profit growth in the quarter. We expect international continued to be a top- and bottom-line tailwind for Sysco and fiscal 2025. Now that we have covered our local case growth performance, let's turn to the status and health of our supply chain. As I have said many times, the key to success in this business is being the distributor that can consistently ship on-time and in-full to our customers. Over the past quarter, we have continued to make progress in improving our service levels to our customers. We improved and advanced our on-time rates with a dedicated focus on routing excellence. I'm proud of our operations team for the hard work and for the improvement that they are making in on-time delivery. You can see the impact on our NPS scores as satisfaction with delivery is up versus prior year. In addition to the good work with delivery service levels, our merchandising and inventory teams continue to work collaboratively to improve our first-time fill rate. Progress is being made on core in-stock items as well as improving our agility when a supply chain disruption occurs at one of our suppliers. We improved versus prior year in both aspects and will make additional progress in 2025. We have increased the importance of fill rates and our leadership performance evaluation metrics for 2025. Fill rates are a strength point for Sysco historically, and we are working to further advance that advantage through these efforts. As I have mentioned many times, the number one lever to improve our supply chain cost performance is to increase colleague retention. Retention rates improved sequentially quarter-over-quarter throughout the year, and they more than doubled compared to the prior year in the fourth quarter. The improved retention is showing up in improved safety metrics, reduced product shrink and increased productivity of our colleagues. Many of these items, like workers comp and auto liability, have a long tail, so the improvement we are driving now will reflect positively in our P&L in fiscal '25 and '26. The last topic to cover in our supply chain update is the progress that we are making to expand our throughput capacity. During our Q4, we opened our first DC fold-out in more than 10 years in Allentown, Pennsylvania. This facility will help Sysco better serve the population dense in Northeast corridor by increasing service levels and lowering our costs to serve. As I wrap up my prepared remarks, I want to thank the entire Sysco team for a strong year. We grew our business more than 1.75 times the overall market at industry-leading profitability metrics, and we exceeded the midpoint of our EPS guide for the year. Importantly, we have continued to advance our business strategy, making progress in important areas like improved technology and customer programs like Sysco Your Way and Perks!. Lastly, we are focused upon the most important things to ensure success for fiscal 2025 and beyond. And we are positioned well to deliver against the guidance that Kenny will share in a moment. So, with that, I'll now turn the call over to Kenny, who's going to highlight the fiscal details of the quarter and our year, as well as tee-up our guidance for fiscal 2025. Kenny, over to you.
Kenny Cheung: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I would like to start off by thanking our customers, colleagues, shareholders and partners. This quarter's results further demonstrates our ability to deliver solid financial performance in a relatively softer macro environment. Our focus on core performance drivers enhanced operational discipline. As we have said before, business plans don't always materialize the exact same way you draw them up on paper. This past year was no different. We focus on operational discipline and tighten the belt to deliver on our initial profit guidance. I'm confident these choices, however, difficult at the time, create long-term structural returns. There is muscle memory across the organization, helping develop a stronger operating model that positions us to grow share profitably as we look ahead. Q4 financials reflect positive sales and volume growth, as well as our seventh consecutive quarter of positive operating leverage, with gross profit growing faster than operating expenses and operating income growing faster than sales. Altogether, these rendered growth across adjusted operating income and EPS, with the full year coming in $0.01 higher than the midpoint of the guidance range. Given the multiple levers across our business, we improved efficiency both on gross profit and operating expenses. GP dollar growth of over 4% was driven by optimal pricing and sourcing improvements. Operating expenses included record levels of supply chain productivity improvements, coupled with our continued focus on managing corporate expenses, which were down 10% year-over-year. These efforts helped us deliver our profit growth, reinvest back into the business, and return over $2.2 billion back to shareholders in FY '24. Now, turning to a summary of our reported results for the quarter, starting on Slide 14. For the fourth quarter, our enterprise sales grew 4.2%, driven by U.S. Foodservice growing 4.9%, International growing 3.8% and SYGMA growing 2%. With respect to volume, total U.S. Foodservice volume increased 3.5% and local volume increased 0.7%. Don positively impacted U.S. Foodservice volumes by 2.7% and local volumes by 1.6%. We produced $3.8 billion in gross profit, up 4.2%, and gross margins of 18.7% was approximately flat with prior year due to mix. Our gross profit dollar improvement reflected our ability to continue to effectively manage product inflation, which came in at 1.6% for the total enterprise, consistent with our expectations. The improvement in gross profit was also driven by incremental progress from our strategic sourcing efforts in our U.S. and International segments. Specific to Sysco brand, penetration rates decreased by 51 bps to 36.6% in U.S. broadline and 37 bps to 47.1% in U.S. local results. We continue to improve with local customers with single units, despite pressure from local businesses with multiple units. We have a strong history of growing Sysco brand penetration, and we have trade management actions to improve the mix over the course of the year. Adjusted operating expenses were $2.8 billion for the quarter, or 13.4% of sales, a 12 bps improvement from the prior year, reflecting supply chain and corporate expense efficiencies. Adjusted operating income was $1.1 billion for the quarter, improving to 5.3% margins. For the year, adjusted operating income grew 8.4% as we expanded margins both on a dollar and rate basis. Most noteworthy, our International segment continued to deliver substantial growth, demonstrating positive operating leverage and margin expansion. This included a 13.1% increase in adjusted operating income, with our teams successfully growing share and executing the Sysco playbook with best practices. This segment remains a growth driver for the Company. Adjusted OI growth also benefited from SYGMA contributing 44.4% profit growth, as we continued to focus on profit enhancements and growth from new customers. For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA increased to $1.3 billion, or up 5.4%. I am also pleased with the health of our balance sheet, which further strengthened this quarter. We ended the year at 2.7 times net debt leverage ratio, which is within our target. We ended the year with $11.3 billion in net debt and approximately $3.5 billion in total liquidity, which is a substantial headroom above our minimum threshold. Our debt is well-laddered without any maturities over $1 billion until FY 27. Turning to our cash flow on Slide 23. We generated approximately $3 billion in operating cash flow and over $2.2 billion in free cash flow, which was a new record. Our conversion rate from adjusted EBITDA to operating cash flow was over 70% and free cash flow conversion was over 50%, showing the Company's robust earnings power. Our strong financial position enabled us to return over $2.2 billion to shareholders this year. This was done through $1.2 billion of share repurchases and $1 billion of dividends. Despite the current macroeconomic landscape, we are poised to grow both top-line and bottom-line results in FY '25, in line with the financial algorithm range. As a refresher from our Investor Day back in May, our three-year growth algorithm calls for sales growth of 4% to 6% and adjusted EPS growth of 6% to 8% per year. We continue to be confident as we believe this algorithm is achievable and one we can deliver on a consistent basis. Let's go a bit deeper on 2025 guidance as seen on Slide 25. During FY '25, we expect net sales growth of 4% to 5%. Net sales growth includes inflation of approximately 2%, which we are seeing now, and positive volume growth of low-single-digits for the year. We also anticipate a slight benefit from M&A during the year. All in, we are guiding to adjusted EPS growth of 6% to 7%, in line with the financial algorithm range. As we highlighted at the Investor Day, 2025 EPS growth will be impacted by non-operational below-the-line items with a higher tax rate and interest expense. We are confident these targets are achievable. Regarding phasing for the year, we expect similar traffic trends from this last quarter to continue into Q1, with modest industry traffic improvements in the back-half of FY '25. We also expect benefits from our investments in sales professionals and other growth initiatives as the year progresses. Consistent with our ROIC focus, our investments with sales professional hiring will yield meaningful returns over the long term. As Kevin stated earlier, we remain focused on improving local case performance in FY '25. For example, the sales consultant comp structure will shift to more bonus, less base, raising performance driven incentives and ensuring operating expenses will correspond more closely with sales results. We will be disciplined in adding self-headcount in high-growth areas, and we will be focused on profitable local sales growth. Turning to expenses. We expect further improvements in operating leverage based on a continuation of the process improvement from this past year across our supply chain and corporate expenses. We ended FY '24 with strong cash flow conversion rates, highlighting the importance of cash generation. For FY '25, we expect a continuation of strong conversion rates in working capital management. We expect to distribute essentially all of our free cash flow to shareholders in 2025, depending on the volume of M&A activity, as we did in 2024. Returning cash back to shareholders is an important part of our capital allocation strategy, as we value our dividend aristocrat status, as we expect to pay over $1 billion related to dividends in FY '25. Additionally, we are targeting approximately $1 billion of share repurchases, with fluctuations dependent on M&A plans. We also expect to operate within our stated target of 2.50 times to 2.75 times net leverage for the year. We wanted to provide guidance on several other important modeling elements. The tax rate for FY '25 is expected to step-up to approximately 25%. The increase is driven by global minimum tax rate. Interest expense is expected to step up to $650 million. Other expense is expected to be approximately $50 million and adjusted D&A is expected to be approximately $800 million for the year. CapEx is expected to be approximately 1% of sales. We will look at each investment through the lens of driving both growth and ROIC. As a company, ROIC will dynamically guide our operating and investment decisions, which will accrete shareholder value over time, as we continue to focus on both margin dollars and rate growth. In closing, I'm pleased with our quarterly performance as we have tremendous opportunities ahead. I'm continually impressed by the size and scale advantages at Sysco. We are the industry leader in a growing industry. The stronger operating model, I mentioned before, allows us to continually enhance our competitive advantages in this highly fragmented market. Consistent performance, combined with Sysco's focus on the long game, is a winning formula to create compounding benefits for our shareholders. Our scale advantages are reflected in our industry-leading margins. Sysco's diversification as the industry leader across customer types with two-thirds in restaurants and one-third in recession-resistant categories, such as education and healthcare, is also a structural advantage. Our robust industry-leading operating cash flow and strong investment-grade balance sheet gives us access to capital at attractive rates, so we're able to take advantage of high ROIC growth opportunities, as they present themselves. And as you can see in our performance results, our International segment is proving to be a benefit, contributing higher rates of growth than our U.S. business. We believe International can continue to be a profitable growth engine for Sysco. As we embark on a new fiscal year, I look forward to our progress ahead. We are positioned to win. Thank you for your time today. With that, we are now ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Mark Carden with UBS. Please go ahead.
Mark Carden: Great. Good morning. Thanks so much for taking the questions. So to start, I wanted to dig into some of your on-demand commentary a bit. Are you guys seeing trade down and trade out impacting a broader customer demographic, or is it still largely confined to the lower to middle end here? And then on top of economic concerns, would you expect for uncertainty around the election to have much incremental impact on food away from on-demand in the quarters ahead?
Kevin Hourican: Good morning, Mark. It's Kevin. Thanks for the question. So relative to just what's happening with the macro, trade down, trade out, we're seeing reasonably consistent performance across all forms of restaurant types. It's not just QSR that's being impacted. So pretty consistent traffic declines, by segment. We have a tremendous amount of data, as you know, serving the highest end white tablecloth all the way down to QSR and everything in between. So I just start with traffic to restaurants down 3% for the quarter, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. We don't anticipate that getting much better in the near term, probably through the election as you indicated. Kenny indicated in our fiscal 2025 guide, we anticipate some improvement in the macro backdrop starting in the second half of our fiscal year. So calendar beginning 2025, hopefully interest rates coming down will be a catalyst for that type of improvement. Why would traffic be down? We believe it's the cumulative impact of inflation over the past three years, while inflation has moderated significantly over the past year. It's still the cumulative impact over the past three years of price increases. As always, we at Sysco convert that into actions that we're taking. We can profitably grow our business even in a slower backdrop, as we did in this most recent quarter. I'm really pleased with our performance in the non-restaurant segment, specifically FSM and travel and hospitality. We're doing very well in those two spaces. Our international local business growing notably. And within local in the U.S., I communicated on today's call the actions that we're taking. We're not satisfied with our current rate of performance in local. We have a strong plan to improve throughout 2025.
Mark Carden: Great. And then as a follow-up, you're now a few quarters into your new sales force hires. How is retention trending relative to your expectations? Does it become any tougher to hold on to new sales people and an increasingly challenging macro? And does the ramp become any tougher, for those with less direct foodservice sales experience?
Kevin Hourican: Mark, thanks for the follow-up. We track our retention on a daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly basis. No notable call outs on turnover or retention. We have solid retention of colleagues. We don't anticipate the hiring of the new folks to change that dynamic. What the key to success for '25 will be is ramping up the productivity of that sales colleague workforce, providing them the training that they need. A lot of it is product training, to your point, depends on where they come from. If they come from a culinary background, if they were a sales rep at a competitor, we can ramp them up faster. If they're a good sales colleague, but they need to learn the food space, food business, there's a lot of product knowledge training that goes along with that. So the real key is that focus. Intense, meaningful focus on the training of those new cohorts, working them up the productivity curve. That's the real key to success. That's why we've communicated that the hiring that we did throughout 2024 will positively impact 2025, but more in the back half, the majority of the hiring that we did for that net 450 colleague population was in the second half of fiscal 2024. Related, tied to what you brought up, is we introduced a new compensation model. I'm sure we'll get some questions about that on today's call. We will monitor retention of colleagues very closely tied to that new comp model, but net-net, we're optimistic and confident that the new comp model will positively impact results.
Kenny Cheung: Hi Mark, I think one thing to add on the compensation model, one is, as I mentioned earlier in the prepared remarks, we're shifting to a more variable incentive plan, which allows us to grow sales, and commensurate with expenses. So matching health flows and inflows of cash, which also helps working capital. The other thing is, this plan is the epitome of growing profitably, right. And what I mean by that is the construct of the plan, rewards growth and profit. Paying relatively more for example, a local case growth, Sysco brand and products, total team selling, specialty and the like. So, it's truly a win-win for our sales professional as they have the opportunity to win, to make more, and for our company to create value in the P&L.
Mark Carden: Great. Best of luck guys.
Kevin Hourican: Thank you, Mark.
Operator: Next, we'll hear from Lauren Silberman with Deutsche Bank.
Lauren Silberman: Thank you for the question. I first wanted to ask about the promotional environment. Obviously, restaurant industry is challenged. Growth margin looked like it was down in the U.S. Foodservice business. Are you seeing an increase in promotional activity to drive customer acquisition more up front, or discounts? Then any discussion on gross margin would be helpful? Thank you.
Kevin Hourican: Yes, Lauren, good question. With traffic down to restaurants, cases per operator would be negatively impacted by that fact. And therefore, distributors of all types and all sizes, are going to work hard to be able to get profitable cases to be put on their truck. So yes, it's a competitive environment and competitive intensity increases when traffic is down. We at Sysco, as you're well aware, operate at the highest profit margin rate in the industry. We are extremely disciplined in our process of evaluating pricing strategies for customers. We will not sell cases below cost. We are very disciplined in that regard. Our pricing system, pricing tool, and pricing process enables for our RCs to sell competitively in the marketplace, but within guardrails. So pleased with our performance in profit management, during the most recent quarter. It helped enable strong overall bottom line results. With that said, I'm going to toss to Kenny for further comment on gross margin. Kenny, over to you.
Kenny Cheung: Hi, Lauren, this is Kenny. So on gross margins and gross profit, a few things here. I'll take a step back, gross profit for the quarter grew 4%, and gross profit per case grew 1% year-on-year. So for us, dollars really matter here. Now, to directly answer your question on the margin front, the key driver of margins slightly down year-on-year is, because of the mix. So if you take a step back, we continue to grow and take share in the CMU space profitably. And that action, while it's margin dollar accretive, it does dilute to some extent margin rate. So with that said, we'll continue to grow both CMU and local and take share, which we have tangible actions against. And the other piece is Sysco brand. It was slightly down year-over-year, as you may have seen in the press tables. And we have tangible actions in plan as well, to drive Sysco brand penetration for the remainder of the year. This includes additional product conversion opportunities, short-term incentives for targeted categories, and driving more product innovation as well. So I'm pretty confident that despite the fact that we already have roughly $22 billion of Sysco sales annually, we can continue to penetrate on the space and drive margin for our P&L.
Lauren Silberman: Great. Very helpful. And then if I could just ask about some of the comments on case growth, the cadence throughout the quarter, restaurants have seen a slowdown in June and July. Any thoughts on if that's where we should expect trends are running to start fiscal 1Q, and if we should expect relatively similar trends in 1Q, to what you saw in 4Q? Thank you very much.
Kevin Hourican: Yes, Lauren, thanks. We won't comment on July specifically, but I'd say Q1 macro environmental conditions are very similar to the exit velocity of Q4, and that's been factored into the guidance that we are providing today. And as I mentioned, we have the opportunity to grow our business profitably, and be successful in that softer environmental conditions. And we anticipate some improvement in the second half of this fiscal year. New customer prospecting is an increased focus for our Sysco sales colleagues. 50% of the restaurant doors are not currently served by Sysco, and we have a substantial opportunity to grow our customer count, and we're very focused on that. The new compensation model that Kenny talked about, one of the key elements of that program is to incent and motivate new customer acquisition in a profitable way. Kenny and additional thoughts?
Kenny Cheung: Sure. So from a phasing standpoint, just to provide color, as Kevin said, I agree. We're seeing similar industry traffic patterns from last quarter into this quarter. So now as you think about the guidance for the year, the 4% to 5%, within that we have volume at low single-digits. And in particular, if you think about the pieces of that, most of the hires was completed in the back half of FY '24. And the new compensation program was just recently rolled out as well. So we start seeing the financial benefit from this investment in the back half of fiscal year.
Lauren Silberman: Thank you very much. Very helpful.
Kevin Hourican: Thank you, Lauren.
Operator: We'll go next to Jake Bartlett with Truist Securities.
Jake Bartlett: Great. Thanks for taking my question. My question was on the sales force investments. And I understand you mentioned that retention has not changed materially, which is encouraging. I think there's some concern among investors that the changes that you're making, the large investments, would create some disruption. Maybe it's disruption of accounts switching sales people. And that provides opportunity for competitors to kind of come in and take them. So the question is, should we expect a disruption in the near term? I mean, is that one reason why sales might be a little bit kind of weaker as this initiative gains steam? Just wanted to get your comments on the near term impacts of these investments?
Kevin Hourican: Okay. Jake, very good. It's Kevin. I'll start just macro commentary about the new sales colleagues, a little bit more color on the comp model. I'll then toss to Kenny, who can talk about how these two factors impact our guide for the year, and our confidence in delivering against the guidance that we provided for the year. So let's again go back to the sales colleagues, net 450 new SEs. Let's do a refresh on the why we're doing this. Our territory sizes have grown larger than we would like them to be over the past few years, given the growth in our business, the number of new customers that we're serving. And this is a relationships business. We desire for our SEs, to be in our customers' accounts on a weekly basis, having quality conversations about the business of that restaurant, helping them with challenges and issues that they're facing to help profitably grow their business and ours. And that can only happen if they're in the back room of the restaurant kitchen. So that's the net-net objective, increase boots on the ground in the restaurant, territory sizes have grown too large. So the positive yield of having increased base time outweighs the short-term disruption of the territory realignment that, Jake, your good question is alluding to. But let me just put that in a little bit of context. So existing SEs, they would give up approximately one current customer to this net new hire. It's not like an existing SE is giving up 10%, 20%, 30% of their business. They're probably giving up one new customer, excuse me, existing customers. We then expect that current SE to go backfill that, right, to grow their business. And then this new colleague who has a starter territory, the main job to be done by that person is to go get net new customers to Sysco. So the disruption that you're alluding to is real, but it's manageable given the net-net context that I provided. And the majority of this growth is coming from winning new customers to Sysco. So that's tied to the hiring. And it's not a flip of a switch, right? These are classes that are hired in cohorts. They hit the streets over time. This is why it's a gradual ramp up of performance over time. The compensation change went live on July 1. So we are one month into that comp change. Just again, a refresh on what we have done here. We've remixed base to bonus, AKA lowered base pay, putting more dollars into the incentive program. I want to be very clear about one thing. Every sales colleague at Sysco has the opportunity to make more money in this new program than they were making before with uncapped earnings potential through the incentives. It is a net positive for our sales colleagues. But as Kenny talked about in his financial modeling, their pay will be consistent with their performance. For our top performers, this change is a very, very good change. It's the type of change that our top performers want. If you remember back prior to COVID, they were on full commission. Our top performers, they want to be paid on their performance. And this program does more of that. For a lower performing colleague, or a newer performing colleague, they need to improve their outcomes. And they need to improve those outcomes through behavior focused on, key deliverables that we provide them coaching, and resources to succeed against. And it's that colleague population that needs to impact positive their performance to make the type of money that they expect to make and that we want for them to make. Our sales leadership team, extremely focused on that population of colleagues, to help them be very successful in this new model. And Jake, we're going to monitor the change management of that very, very closely. And that would be a Q1, Q2 meaningful focus, which is why I said in my prepared remarks today, the comp model change that we put forward that started July 1, will have more of a second half of this year positive impact. Kenny, over to you for any additional comments.
Kenny Cheung: Sure. Thanks, Kevin. So, the sales hires, as we said before, this is ROIC positive. That's the headline news. We are deliberate in terms of when and where we add, meaning investing in high growth markets, to ensure optimal return on investment. Now, Jake, kind of to double click on your question in terms of timing. Now, there is some timing, given early on the full return isn't rendered given timing of the ramp, as Kevin mentioned, Kevin mentioned not a flip of a switch. So, the good news is we have other levers in the P&L, to ensure we receive leverage from the enterprise standpoint, expand margin on the bottom line, which is on the guide. All in all, we are confident with the return for our sales consultants and we're confident in our guide.
Jake Bartlett: Thank you.
Operator: We'll go now to John Heinbockel from Guggenheim. Apologies.
John Heinbockel: So, Kevin, I want to start with going back to U.S. gross margin, right? Because that was sort of an unusual decline versus, what we've seen from you and others. So, I guess as I understand it, the bulk of that, the bulk of the 32 basis points was mixed, both customer and product. So, is that fair? Do you think that is that a one-off or we, the idea we're sort of going to be in negative territory here for a little bit? And then I'm not sure what you put into your guide for '25 on U.S. gross. Did you sort of assume flattish and a rebound in the back half of the year?
Kevin Hourican: Hi, John, good morning. I'll start, it's Kevin, I'll toss to Kenny for the comments on the '25 performance. So, it's customer mix and Sysco brand percentage mix are the two primary drivers. As Kenny said, we've profitably grown our CMU business. Key there is profitably grown. We've improved our profitability of CMU, and we have some real solid wins in that space. And we grew national CMU faster than local in the most recent quarter, which applied some margin rate pressure to the overall. We're pleased with our gross margin performance within the local business. It's a customer mix shift. See our comments on the need to improve our local performance that we're not satisfied, with our local case growth performance. We are going to grow our local business responsibly and profitably. We're not going to chase cases - to chase cases. We will be disciplined. We will be pragmatic and thoughtful, but we need to improve our local case performance, and we will and we anticipate that impacting positively, our 2025 business performance. The second part Sysco brand, Kenny did some key commentary early about that. If I could just add one piece of color to Sysco brand, one of the backdrops as to why Sysco brand was slightly down on a percent basis year-over-year, to be clear, Sysco pieces, Sysco brand pieces were up 2% year-over-year. Our GP dollars from Sysco brand was up 3.2%, but there was a minor percentage reduction of mix to national brand products. Here's the key point, our fill rates of national brand suppliers have improved on a year-over-year basis and a quarter-over-quarter basis. So there's less substitution happening from national brand out of stocks into Sysco brand. While that has a slight negative impact on margin rate, that's actually a good thing for our business. It's a good thing for our operations. We want our suppliers to fill on time and ship to Sysco, including our national suppliers, and it's a good thing that national supplier fill rate improvement has stepped up. In the meantime, it has a moderate impact. We are confident that we can increase Sysco brand penetration. Kenny talked to those hows, but by providing value to our customers, motivating our colleagues, through their performance evaluations to be focused upon it, and bringing product innovation to our customers through Sysco brand. So Kenny, over to you for any comments about the modeling for '25.
Kenny Cheung: Yes John, so the way to think about the modeling is, as Kevin talked about, as we start realizing benefits from our sales consultants' investments, new compensation models, the Sysco brand actions that Kevin talked about, that should drive further leverage on the GP side. You should expect the GP dollar per case to expand for us, on a year-on-year basis for 2025. And the thing we haven't talked about is also specialty. Specialty is also a GP accretive action for us, and that business is growing very well for us as well. So both of the - all three things, Sysco brand in terms of, and then local sales and also - and specialty growth will all drive our GP dollar per case for us.
John Heinbockel: All right, maybe as a quick follow-up, just curious, going sort of going back to existing account opportunity, right, particularly as you free up some time here for existing sales consultants. I know there's a headwind, right, a macro headwind, but maybe touch on that opportunity, right, to make some improvement in existing wallet share. And then I guess, Kevin, when you think about local case growth, I mean, I think you want to get into the 2% to 3% range ultimately. What do you think is a reasonable target, or the target that you would have for sort of exit rate of fiscal '25? Is that a fair exit rate, or is that an optimistic one?
Kevin Hourican: Yes, just the first part of your question first. I'll toss to Kenny. He's always going to be the one that talks about the guidance that, we have provided in case growth is a part of that guidance, so he'll do that part. The two main levers for existing customer case penetration improvement opportunity that I would highlight is the total team selling opportunity that Greg Bertrand covered at our Investor Day. We have a very large sample size now of customers that we have sold from a total team selling perspective, and when we can bring that specialty produce sales rep from FreshPoint into an existing broad line account, or bring a sales protein expert from our SSMG business, specialty meat business, into an account, that customer spends three times more with Sysco, and those are cases. Those are cases that are higher average ticket, and those are cases that are probably going on a specialty distributor's truck today, and getting them on the Sysco truck or on a FreshPoint truck is a meaningful positive. So, we are meaningfully focused on that total team selling opportunity. We have tremendous data, and we know exactly which customers, are using that type of product and not buying it from Sysco. We have prospect lists. We can track those prospect lists on an ongoing basis. Our compensation systems are properly calibrated to reward that behavior. We can track it by geography. We can track it by site. We are tremendously focused on moving the needle on winning with specialty. It's our number one opportunity to improve cases per operator within existing customers. The second vector, though, that just again has tremendous upside still despite multiple years of success is our Sysco Your Way neighborhoods. Those neighborhoods tended to be previously prior to Sysco Your Way neighborhoods, where we under penetrated both cases per operator and number of doors covered, most likely and most often, because these are urban areas where Sysco historically, has underrepresented from a market share perspective. Sysco Your Way, we've got internal goals. We've not quoted those statistics externally to increase our market share of existing customers. And we have many neighborhoods that are hitting those targets and many more that still have lots of growth potential. So those are the two things I'm most excited about, Sysco Your Way penetration opportunities and total team selling penetration opportunities. For your modeling question on how to think about local case growth, I'll toss it to Kenny. Kenny, over to you.
Kenny Cheung: Hi, John. So you can expect local volume to be roughly low single-digits growth for the year. Again, for the entire company as well, low single-digits and as part of our guide, which we are confident as we believe these targets are achievable.
John Heinbockel: Thank you.
Kevin Hourican: Thanks, John.
Operator: We'll go now to Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo.
Edward Kelly: Hi. Good morning, guys.
Kevin Hourican: Good morning, Ed.
Edward Kelly: Kenny, I wanted to start with the guidance, and maybe some color on the cadence of how you're thinking about the guidance for the year. If I look at the volume, obviously, you're expecting a volume improvement through the year, both from the new associates as well as some market improvement in the back half. I'm not sure how meaningful that is. But then you have offsets, I guess, around things like corporate, which look like they may be down quite a bit early on. So how do we think about the cadence of the guidance? And specifically, are you comfortable with the Q1 consensus number, because consensus expectation have you up around the same amount each quarter?
Kenny Cheung: Yes. So let me answer your last one first. So I am confident in the Q1 number, and I'm confident in the full year guidance number as well. Just to recap, before your guide for '25 is within the algo range that we talked about on Investor Day. So that's the point number one. And your second - your first question more around the cadence and the phasing of the forecast, Ed?
Edward Kelly: Yes, yes.
Kenny Cheung: Yes. So from a phasing standpoint, we do - so let me take it in pieces here. From an industry traffic standpoint, as we mentioned, that will improve modestly in the back half of the year. That is our expectation. That's point number one. In terms of the benefits from the investments SEs, given those that were high in the back half, as well as the compensation model that Kevin rolled out - as we rolled out in July 1 that - we should see the benefit in the back half of the year as well. In terms of, call it, productivity, which is another folder of our P&L, that should be throughout the year, meaning we have good momentum from corporate this year down 10%, the assets that we took in Q3, and that rolls over into Q1 immediately. Therefore, we expect leverage in Q1. And that is the gift that keeps on giving, Ed, because it's not just a rollover. We also have robust productivity along, along the next four quarters as well. And then from a supply chain standpoint, we do expect as well continued progress on piece per labor hour and productivity. In fact, Q4 was the highest productivity month supply chain and across the past couple of years since COVID actually had. So we do expect that benefit to be more of a consistent throughout the year. Obviously, you have the inflation wage side, but from a productivity standpoint, that's our day one for us enter the new fiscal year. So productivity consistent throughout the year, volume we expect more back half, given the fact that we expect the industry to bounce back - in the second half of the year.
Edward Kelly: Got it. And then just a quick follow-up on international. Sales inflected in Q4. Obviously, you're still very optimistic about this business. I don't think the macro over there is anything special. So I'm just curious, maybe talk about momentum in the business and expectations for '25 there?
Kevin Hourican: Yes, good question. Thank you for asking about international. You're right that the improvement in our performance, the growth year-over-year, the profit improvement year-over-year is not from a macro. One of your terms is self-help activities in international. Productivity improvement within our supply chain has helped the P&L tremendously, in Europe specifically. We're putting in improved technology to be more efficient, which is, again, helping with our productivity Sysco brand being introduced in countries that did not have it before, which is helping on gross profit expansion. The local case growth that I mentioned, which was 5% local case growth in international is from a concerted effort on running the Sysco play, as we call it. Which is Sysco Your Way being added, Perks being added, adding resources to the local sales force in international countries, several of our larger international countries, Ed, were over-indexed on CMU National. So we're going to maintain, retain and grow profitably in our CMU business with a real meaningful focus on improving local. We have a team that started in our U.S. business that's now leaning and helping with each of those international countries, with their local business. And we're really pleased with the results, and we expect that improvement to continue into 2025. Kenny, is there anything you'd like to say about international?
Kenny Cheung: Yes. So for international, we have a global operating model that's working as we're replicating the success of recipe for growth, and it's working across international markets. I think if you look at the full year, we were top line 7% growth, bottom line, 24%. I do think one interesting fact is it's not just one market, if you look at across our portfolio, every market sitting within. For example, Europe and International Americas for the year, grew double-digit on operating income, every market, right, between Europe and international, America. So it's not just one market leading is. So the benefit that we're seeing is per-base across the board and we expect that to continue in 2025.
Edward Kelly: Thank you.
Kevin Hourican: Thanks, Ed.
Operator: We'll move next to Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley.
Brian Harbour: Yes, thanks. Good morning, guys. Kenny, just your comments on corporate costs. I know you took some actions in 3Q, right? So that's still kind of a benefit in the first half of the year. But are there ongoing actions just on the corporate cost side, specifically, do you still think you can see improvement there throughout the course of this fiscal year?
Kenny Cheung: Hi, Brian, good to talk to you. Yes, the answer is a resounding yes, but let me take a back step on this one. So corporate expense for the quarter, $205 million. That was down 10% as we talked about. But I also think it's important to note, it was down 7% quarter-over-quarter, driven by the structural cost out we did in Q3. And Brian, to your question, we are looking for more, and we've done more. This includes digital, automation, shared service deployment, indirect third-party procurement savings as well. So the answer is, we've done $120 million-plus last year. Part of it carries over into the new fiscal, and we have a robust pipeline to ensure we continue to execute the product that play across the year.
Kevin Hourican: Specifically in international, in particular, we have structural cost improvement opportunities international that we're very focused on. They've already done great work international, which is driving the outsized profit improvement versus domestic U.S., and we expect that to continue.
Brian Harbour: Okay. Your 2% inflation outlook, is that fairly even through the year? Is it kind of some of the same items driving that, that you called out most recently? Or could you elaborate on that?
Kevin Hourican: Yes. Even throughout the year, this is Kevin. There will be ups and downs by category. Kenny always talks about, we have 13 different category baskets. Some will be up, some will be down. We expect that roughly approximately 2%, which, by the way, we're there right now. We are at that level right now, and we have modeled it, and we expect it to be reasonably consistent at that level throughout the year.
Brian Harbour: Thank you.
Kevin Hourican: Thank you.
Operator: We'll move next to Kendall Toscano with Bank of America.
Kendall Toscano: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just curious, I know you talked last quarter a bit about maybe needing to see restaurants take down our investment prices a little in order to drive an improvement in industry volumes. So curious if you've seen kind of any of that starting to play out? And when you are assuming that the macro backdrop improves in the back half of next year, is that assuming that there is some price investment, by the restaurant operators? Thanks.
Kevin Hourican: Kendall, it's Kevin. Thank you for the question. It's up to our customers to decide what to do with their menu prices, obviously. What we start with and what we focus on are things we, Sysco, can do to help them driving improved purchasing economics, sharing in the value of that purchasing economic favorability with our customers, advancing Sysco brand. Providing them with products that save them time, save them money, precooked products when it's appropriate for their menu, et cetera, et cetera. So those are the things we can do. Those are the things we will do. We're here to help. As it relates to - are we seeing movement? Yes, we're seeing movements, specifically within QSR. I think that has been a sector that has written a lot and said a lot about the lower-income customer and the impact that raised prices have had upon them. You're seeing a lot of value menu activity happening out there within the QSR space. I do believe it will help that activity. I believe for the other restaurant types, it is about the quality of the product that they're serving, the quality of that in-restaurant experience. And again, us, we being Sysco, providing them with value. As we thought about this year, we didn't model into the year lower menu prices as one of the change vectors within our guide. We expect for consumer confidence to be moderately better in the second half than the first half, mostly through interest rate reductions. Hopefully, they began later in this calendar year. Mortgage rates coming down, that has a psychological impact on consumers as you're well aware. So our second half more optimism is more tied to mortgage rates and interest rates than it is to menu price. And then my main point here, and this is what I want to end, we, Sysco can profitably grow our business in these market conditions. We have share we can take profitably. We have new customers that we can acquire. We have penetration opportunities, back to John Heinbockel's question, with produce and protein. And we are going to profitably grow this business in these market conditions. And all of that obviously was built into the guide that we have for year - excuse me, for the year. Kendall, I'll pass back to you if you have a follow-up.
Kendall Toscano: Yes. Thank you. Just one quick - another question I had was, I know you mentioned a decline in private label penetration. Did you talk about what drove that?
Kevin Hourican: Yes. The primary driver is improvement in national supplier fill rate inbound to Sysco. So when a national brand supplier isn't able to ship, we have substitute alternatives. And most often, that substitute alternative is a Sysco brand, because we do a great job of keeping our Sysco brand products in stock at our facilities. So overall, it's a good thing for the industry that national supplier fulfillment rates, have increased and improved. It is a good thing. Nobody likes substitutes. Customers don't like them. Our warehouse operations get their on curveballs, when we have to do substitute. So net-net, it's a good thing. It's a short-term small headwind on the percent of cases, Sysco brand. But again, we grew our pieces, Sysco brand. We grew our profit Sysco brand. Long-term, we are bullish on Sysco brand. We are working on providing trade management deals to all of our customer types. And as I mentioned earlier, we've increased the importance of Sysco brand penetration on our performance objectives for fiscal 2025.
Kendall Toscano: Okay. Thanks again.
Kevin Hourican: Thank you.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, due to time constraints, that will conclude our question-and-answer session and Sysco's fourth quarter conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and everyone have a wonderful day.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-04-30 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to Sysco's Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. We will now begin with opening remarks and introductions. I would now like to turn the call over to Kevin Kim, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Kevin Kim: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Sysco's third quarter fiscal year 2024 earnings call. On today's call, we have Kevin Hourican, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kenny Cheung, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, please note that statements made during this presentation that state the company's or management's intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, and actual results could differ in a material manner. Additional information about factors that could cause results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's SEC filings. This includes, but is not limited to, Risk Factors contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 1, 2023, subsequent SEC filings, and in the news release issued earlier this morning. A copy of these materials can be found in the Investors section at sysco.com. Non-GAAP financial measures are included in the comments today and in our presentation slides. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures is included at the end of the presentation slides and can be found in the Investors section of our website. During the discussion today, unless otherwise stated, all results are compared to the same quarter in the prior year. To ensure we have sufficient time to answer all questions, we'd like to ask each participant to limit their time today to one question and one follow-up. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Hourican.
Kevin Hourican: Before I begin our call today, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge an extraordinary event that happened during our third quarter. As you may have seen, on Friday, March 1, a Sysco truck was involved in an accident on the Clark Memorial Bridge in Louisville, Kentucky. After the accident, a Sysco truck was hanging precariously over the Ohio River. A Sysco colleague was inside that truck, staring down at the river, not knowing if her truck would fall into the river before she was rescued. I bring this topic up to take a moment and recognize the Louisville Fire Department for their heroic efforts. I especially want to thank Bryce Carden, the firefighter that risked his life to rescue our colleague from her truck that day. The heroes of the Louisville Fire Department acted with efficiency, skill, and courage to rescue a Sysco family member. We are thankful for their successful efforts and for all that first responders do every day to protect our communities. I want to be very clear, business results matter, but the fact that the Louisville Fire Department save the life of a member of our family deserves praise and applause. Now, on to matters of business results and outcomes. I'd like to start with restaurant foot traffic data. Much has been written over the past few weeks as select restaurant names and select food service suppliers have announced their performance results. As you have heard in those communications, and observed through credit card transaction data, foot traffic to restaurants is down year-over-year. As we have previously indicated, January restaurant traffic came out of the gate with a slow start, down high-single-digits to prior year due to a host of factors. February and March foot traffic improved to down low-single-digits but still posted a headwind for distributor case volume growth. While the trend of the quarter was one of sequential improvement, we had expected a stronger recovery throughout the quarter. It is our belief that restaurant menu prices have impacted foot traffic and this is something that needs to be addressed more broadly by the industry. The industry needs to take actions to improve affordability for end consumers. At Sysco, we will be focused on helping our local restaurant customers by taking the following actions. Securing the best possible costs from our suppliers in sharing in those savings with our end customers; introducing new and improved Sysco brand alternatives to save restaurants time and money; introducing menu alternatives that bring lower cost food options to restaurant operators, so that they can provide value offerings to their end consumers; and lastly, providing restaurant operators with even more ready now and pre-cut offerings to help them lower their labor costs. While food costs have moderated year-over-year, restaurants are still facing significantly elevated labor costs. So with restaurant foot traffic data as context, I will segue into Sysco's specific business outcomes with a brief highlight of the quarter on Slide 5. We were able to convert negative foot traffic for the quarter into positive 2.7% enterprise sales growth with USFS volumes growing 2.9%. Both of these figures were greater than the food-away-from-home industry, which declined year-over-year in case volumes. Sysco's 2.9% case growth enabled a profitable market share increase for the quarter in the U.S. As I have stated previously, larger broadline players are winning in the market due to size and scale advantages, and Sysco's specialty platform is delivering outsized growth versus the specialty channel. Our local case growth was 0.4% for the quarter stronger than the overall market; however, it is an area that must improve. We are focused on making the necessary progress. I'll speak more to this topic in a moment. For the quarter, we increased adjusted operating income by 8.4% and adjusted EPS by 6.7%. Both figures were consistent with our expectations for the quarter and are well above the S&P 500 average profit growth for the quarter. As we have said many times, we have levers we can pull in our P&L if and when volume is softer than expected. I am proud of our team for taking strong actions in the quarter to manage expenses and deliver strong gross profit margins. The agility and accountability of the leadership team enabled us to deliver our profit objectives for the quarter despite softer sales and case volumes. I'd like to pivot now to give you a brief update on our two biggest areas of focus, local case growth and overall expense management with supply chain productivity. Starting with local case growth, earlier this year, I highlighted four actions we are taking to improve our performance as seen on Slide 8. I cautioned at the time that these actions would take time to impact the business, but that we are confident in their impact. First, sales force hiring. We plan to hire a net increase of approximately 400 sales professionals by the end of this year, and we are meaningfully on track to hit that hiring target. The quality of the new hires to-date has been strong and we are actively focused on skills development training for the new cohort. We believe this new sales staff will positively impact our 2025 growth trends. Second focus area, performance management. Our sales consultants have responded to the sales leadership coaching and have increased their visit frequency to Sysco customers. For the remainder of fiscal 2024, and entering fiscal 2025, we are increasing the focus of our sales staff on prospecting net new customers. In a slower traffic environment, we need to increase the number of customers that we service. Third focus area, sales compensation. We are two quarters live with an updated compensation model and the feedback from our SEs has been positive. Our top performers are seeing their earnings grow and our extended team has ample opportunities to increase their earnings. Importantly, retention data for our SEs is at or above historical high water mark levels. Our updated compensation program better aligns the incentives of our sales teams with the P&L of Sysco. Fourth focus area, total team selling. When a Sysco customer buys from broadline plus one or more of our specialty businesses, Sysco wins and the customer wins too. Why? We remove one or more competitors from the account and we are able to get more cases on a Sysco truck. As a result, we can increase delivery frequency, increase sales colleague coverage, and invest in the customer from a buy more, save more perspective. Sysco's extensive produce, protein and now equipment and supplies specialty businesses are unmatched in the industry. We intend to better leverage this competitive differentiation in years to come, domestically and internationally. In summary, we are confident in our ability to profitably grow our local business and we are working on the right things to deliver that growth consistently. This work is a top priority and will receive the necessary focus and attention from our entire team. Let's transition to our supply chain, and overall expense management at Sysco as seen on Slide number 9. I'm very pleased with the progress we are making on both fronts. Retention is greatly improving, especially within our driver population. This is resulting in better productivity, fewer accidents, reduced product shrink and improved customer service outcomes. Labor productivity is improving within our warehouse and driver populations. Both departments delivered the highest productivity rates of the past few years in March. Lastly, our transportation metrics are improving as we have increased pieces per truck, optimized our routing metrics and improved on time arrival rates. All told, these supply chain improvements are helping us lower our cost to serve and increase our Net Promoter Scores. Even more impressive is the work we are doing in our global support center to reduce our SG&A expenses, as we delivered a year-over-year 5.5% reduction in SG&A in the quarter. We displayed strong discipline and management agility by leading through a softer than anticipated customer environment. We plan to stay very focused on expense management and gross profit delivery in the quarters and years to come. It is important to note that while we are very focused on expense management, we continue to invest where it matters. Our supply chain capacity expansion projects remain on track and the investments and improvement in our customer facing technology tools continue to advance. International continues to be a bright spot for Sysco. I recently returned from a trip to Europe and I'm very pleased with the performance of our International business segment and leadership team. Our newly formed global operating model is having an impact. International top-line grew 4.5% and adjusted operating income grew 63.4% in the quarter. Both figures are better and higher than our U.S. business. As I have said, International will be a top and bottom line growth catalyst for years to come at Sysco. More importantly, there are no structural impediments internationally that prevent Sysco from delivering higher EBIT as a percentage of sales in each international country. Greg Bertrand, our Global COO has identified many examples of best practices that are being shared across the globe to help each country accelerate profit improvement progress. The proof is in the strong profit improvement results that we are delivering. At Sysco, we take a long-term view in running our business, focused upon profitable and disciplined business returns. Despite the softer traffic start to calendar 2024, food-away-from-home is a growth industry as seen on Slide number 10, taking share from the grocery channel for 17 of the past 20 years. We believe that is a macro trend that will have staying power for years and decades to come. Internationally, the food-away-from-home trend is following a similar pattern to the U.S. business. However, it is many years behind from a penetration percentage. This fact will be a tailwind as Europe follows the food-away-from-home percentage growth trajectory growing sales across all three dayparts. Food-away-from-home is a good business, a stable business, and Sysco has a diversified range of customer types that help us navigate individual segment choppiness, including a strong business in healthcare, hospitality, education and business and industry. As I wrap up my prepared remarks, I will echo something I have said previously. I'm very optimistic about the future of Sysco. We are confident in the strategic plan we are executing against and we have a strong leadership team. Business plans are always materialized the exact way you draw them up on paper. This past quarter, volume was softer than we anticipated and planned. I am proud of our team for acting with agility and delivering strong bottom line growth for the period despite the slower restaurant traffic. Additionally, we are committed to making progress in local case growth and operations efficiency. These efforts will enable us to deliver solid financial outcomes. Before I turn it over to Kenny, I welcome you to join us in New York City on May 22 for our next Investor Day. We will go deeper into each component of our business strategy and Kenny will present a financial algorithm for Sysco to deliver against for the next three years. We look forward to seeing many of you in New York. And with that said, Kenny, over to you.
Kenny Cheung: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Let's start by building upon Kevin's commentary regarding the quarter. This quarter delivered strong earnings growth in a dynamic volume environment as our teams took appropriate proactive steps and deliver adjusted operating income growth of 8.4%. After the soft January start, we delivered sequential volume improvements each month during the quarter. Our team is focused on improving local case volume growth with several factors that provide confidence in improving results for the remainder of FY2024 and into FY2025. Turning to margin management, continued execution across our operating levers resulted in improvements to both gross profit dollars and margins, and lower structural and variable operating costs. This included continued progress with supply chain retention and productivity, ending the quarter with our highest monthly productivity rate for the year for both delivery partners and selectors. We are also excited today to announce that we are raising our cost out target for FY2024. We now expect to generate more than $120 million of cost out in FY2024 based on incremental actions during the third quarter. This is especially important to offset the softer than expected near-term consumer backdrop while continuing our investments for growth. In addition to these structural cost outs, our plan this year, also include executing on synergies from our acquisitions this year. For example, with the closing of the Edward Don transaction earlier in the fiscal year, we are already realizing early post acquisition synergies that are in line with our expectations with more to come. In total, our actions resulted in positive leverage with gross profit growing at a faster rate than operating expenses for the sixth consecutive quarter as we delivered sequential improvement in cost per piece throughout the quarter. Despite the current macro environment, we are confident in our ability to efficiently flex operating expense, the volume performance, and achieve bottom line results. Our continued balanced and consistent approach with capital allocation priorities also resulted in $753 million returned back to shareholders via repurchases and dividends. Our Q3 profit performance combined disciplined use of our operational levers. We remain focused on the long-term along with more consistent and normalized demand in future periods. As we navigate through transitory industry trends, our size and scale advantages and operating discipline deliver strong bottom line results this quarter, while we continue to gain market share. As the market normalizes, we will be able to use the power of our P&L to continue to deliver accretive results. As we look to finish the year strong, we remain focused on delivering our annual EPS guidance, while also executing on planned share repurchases and dividends in Q4. Now turning to a summary of our reported results for the quarter starting on Slide 13. For the third quarter, our enterprise sales grew 2.7%, driven by U.S. Foodservice growing 3.4% and International growing 4.5%, partially offset by SYGMA decreasing 3.5%. Enterprise inflation was 1.9%. Additionally, U.S. broadline inflation was 1.2% and our International segment was up 4%. We expect this normal rate of inflation in line with historical averages going forward, which bodes well for the industry. The total U.S. Foodservice volume increased 2.9% and local volume increased 0.4%. Additionally, International local volumes were up over 4%, adding to our outside International growth. As previously outlined, we have plans in place to drive more positive, consistent local volume performance. Please note, volume reporting now includes Don following its first full quarter under Sysco's leadership. Don positive impacted U.S. Foodservice volumes by 2.7% and local volumes by 1.6%. We deliver expansion in both GP dollars and margins as we produce $3.6 billion in gross profit, up 5.2%, and gross margin improved to 18.6%, an increase of 44 bps. This improvement during the third quarter reflected our ability to effectively manage product cost fluctuations through tight margin management driven by incremental progress from our strategic sourcing efforts, disciplined and rational pricing, increased mix of specialty as well as improved penetration rates from Sysco brand products within local, which increased 3 bps to 46.5%. Sysco brand continues to offer superior customer value and we expect positive momentum going forward. Overall, adjusted operating expenses were $2.8 billion for the quarter, or 14.5% of sales. Expenses during the quarter included benefits from continued improvements with retention and productivity, Kevin mentioned earlier, in addition to our benefits from a variable labor planning tool and cost out commitments. Based on incremental actions during Q3, we now expect to generate over $120 million of savings in FY2024. We recently reduced 500 rolls to reduce expenses and fund incremental headcount in higher growth areas like specialty. The residual savings were also used to offset a softer current macro backdrop, which is a proof point of the agility of our business and dynamic levers across the P&L. These Q3 actions position us well to enter FY2025 if we're delivering incremental cost outs and operating leverage for future years. We continue to be encouraged with the progress of our International segment with adjusted operating income growing 63.4% for the third quarter. This is a continuation of the robust growth and positive momentum in this segment over the past three years. Q3 adjusted operating income grew 8.4% to $799 million for the enterprise. For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA was $977 million, up 8.5%. Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 17. We ended the quarter at a 2.81x net debt leverage ratio and we are confident we will end the year within our target range. We ended the quarter with $11.6 billion in net debt and approximately $3.1 billion in total liquidity. Approximately 96% of our debt is fixed with the floating component offset our cash reserves. Our debt has well laddered and our strong investment grade credit rating is a competitive advantage for us. Turning to our cash flow on Slide 18. Year-to-date, we generated $1.4 billion in operating cash flow and $864 million in free cash flow. The decline in free cash flow year-to-date was driven by timing of working capital and the Easter calendar impact, along with a planned step up in cash taxes. Our cash flow is driven by continued strong conversion rates from EBITDA to operating cash and free cash flow, and importantly, we remain on track to grow free cash flow for the full year FY2024. Our strong financial position enable us to return $753 million to shareholders this quarter via share repurchases and dividends. Turning to FY2024 guidance. We are reiterating adjusted EPS of $4.20 to $4.40, our guidance at the mid-point assumes approximately 7% EPS growth on a year-over-year basis. Factoring in the softer overall marketplace, we also expect to end the year with net sales to be approximately $79 billion. Additionally, we remain confident in delivering increased free cash flow by year-end off of a record performance last year. We also plan to remain diligent with operating discipline for the fiscal year and beyond. For the year, we also remain on target to return over $2.25 billion back to shareholders. Looking ahead to the future fiscal years, we also wanted to highlight and anticipate a step up in our FY2025 tax rate due to the global minimum tax rate rule changes. More details will be shared in our Q4 earnings call. Furthermore, we want you to be aware that interest expense will step up from FY2024 to fund our capital allocation priorities while continuing to operate within our leverage ratio of 2.5x to 2.75x. Looking ahead to Q4 and beyond, our focus on high ROIC investments back into the business will be balanced and disciplined, supporting our industry-leading margin profile. This includes operational discipline with cost out delivery and margin management. This is in addition to our strong investment grade weighted balance sheet. Our size and scale advantages are meaningful positions of strength for the long-term. We have successfully demonstrated our performance in a variety of operating environments in our company's long history. That remains true today as we expect to win market share profitably and continue to generate cash with strong conversion rates, ultimately beating our plan to grow and reward our shareholders on the forward. Before I conclude the call, I echo Kevin's invitation to join us for Sysco's Investor Day on May 22. If you are interested in attending, please reach out to Kevin, Kim, and our Investor Relations team. Please note this meeting will also be webcast. We hope you can join either in-person or virtually. Thank you for your time today. I'll now pass the call back to Kevin.
Kevin Hourican: Thank you, Kenny. I'd like to turn to one more important matter before we move to our question-and-answer session this morning. As you may have seen, earlier today, we announced that Ed Shirley has stepped down as Sysco's Chairman of the Board for personal health reasons. As a result of Ed's decision, effective immediately, I will serve as Chair of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. I am honored by this appointment and I look forward to serving our shareholders, our customers, and our colleagues in this expanded responsibility. I want to thank the full Board for their continued support and guidance. More importantly, I'd like to take a moment to recognize and thank Ed Shirley for his tremendous impact on Sysco over his eight years of exceptional service on our Board. When I joined the company in February of 2020, Ed was our Executive Chair. Ed and I spent countless hours together building what became our recipe for growth strategy and of course, navigating the early and significant impacts of COVID on the food-away-from-home sector. Ed's wisdom, guidance, and substantial business experience were invaluable to me in those early innings at the company. Roughly a year later, Ed transitioned into the independent Chair of the Board leadership position. He continued to provide substantial and helpful feedback and guidance to me, the Board, and the entire management team from that leadership position. We are a better and more resilient company due to Ed's impact and leadership. On behalf of the entire Board, I want to thank Ed for his friendship, his mentorship, and for his dedication to our company. He will be greatly missed. With that, operator, we are now ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And it appears we do have our first question from Alex Slagle with Jefferies.
Alex Slagle: All right. Thanks. Good morning. I guess maybe just start off digging a bit further on what you're seeing in the industry and the demand environment and into early April if anything, just, I mean, it seems like a continuation of the soft traffic environment in restaurants, perhaps some more divergence between the operators that are finding ways to be successful highlighting value versus maybe caught a bit flatfooted. So interested in kind of your view and given such broad exposure, what you've seen, if any, divergence between chains and independence or full service, limited service, and maybe just a little bit on giving your strength in private label and all the offerings you have, what that means for Sysco's opportunity to gain more share in this kind of environment.
Kevin Hourican: Okay. Good morning, Alex. It's Kevin. That's a good question and a loaded question. So I'm going to try to unpack it to a couple of points. Just start with the headline, which is traffic to restaurants down year-over-year in the quarter, starting with that tough January start and sequentially improving throughout the quarter. It's important to note that traffic is what drives distributor case volume shipments, not the same-store sales that they post in their revenues; traffic is the more important of metrics for us. Sysco did gain share in total versus the food-away-from-home sector in aggregate in the quarter, but the volume was less than what we had anticipated. Therefore, the actions that we took and spoke about, and we're pleased we delivered our profit expectations for the quarter in spite of those overall market conditions. Now, what we're seeing in the aggregate data tied to what your second part of your question was performance divergence by type of restaurant operator. It's more based on income strata than restaurant type. We have customers that serve restaurant highest white tablecloth all the way down to QSR. Our hardest hit sector right now is QSR. You can look at our SYGMA volumes. Our SYGMA volumes were down roughly 3.5% for the quarter, which is an indication of that point. And those that are succeeding are those that either have a differentiated value prop and/or a great product offering and/or a digital app that's rewarding loyalty, and great operators can be successful regardless of environmental conditions, as evidenced by the quarter that we just posted an overall softer environment, but yet, we were able to deliver our profit expectations and take share profitably during the quarter. What we're specifically doing about that is we're working hard to lower food costs to restaurants, so they can in fact lower menu prices. I do want to be clear about that. I believe restaurants need to lower menu prices. It starts with our negotiations with our suppliers. We need to work hard to create value by lowering costs inbound to Sysco and then share pass on those savings to our end consumers. And we're fully prepared to do that and to execute that with efficiency, number one. Number two, is we can provide Sysco brand offering at an even more extensive level. We did make progress in local case penetration with Sysco brand and we think we can accelerate that. We're doing a new packaging overhaul. We're doing a brand, tier brand hierarchy overhaul that work takes time, but we're bullish on Sysco brand, especially within the local segment. And as I said in my prepared remarks, my last comment I'll toss to Kenny for any comments he'd like to make on April. We can provide our customers with value-added solutions, with our specialty protein business, with our specialty produce business. We can do a lot of the back office cutting, preparing, staging a product, delivered to the restaurant, which takes labor out of the kitchen. Because while food costs have moderated, labor costs at restaurants have not moderated. And we're seeing upticks from our customers ordering what we call value-added services products, which tend to come at a higher margin for Sysco. So it's good for our P&L, but it really helps the restaurant take labor costs out of their model. So Kenny, I'll toss to you for any comment on April.
Kenny Cheung: Sure. Thanks, Kevin. Hi Alex, this is Kenny. The growth rate from March is carrying into April. So if you take a step back and bifurcate Q3 performance, as Kevin noted, January was negative growth, mostly driven by weather. February and March were positive with sequential improvement. So that growth rate from March is carrying into April. As Kevin mentioned in his prepared remarks, we have initiatives in place to improve volume and we have cost levers in place as well to further enhance profit margins. As a company, we are confident we can operate in any environment that's proven in Q3 and this year, as we had disinflation, deflation to inflationary, which is what we're seeing at a spot moments. Overall with software macro backdrop, we are still confident with our guidance.
Alex Slagle: Thanks. And then a follow-up on the private label. And you mentioned the opportunity in local, but it would seem like there's still some opportunity on the national side. I know there's some differences there, but I'm just kind of curious how you describe the opportunity in terms of maybe the magnitude or the timeframe of where maybe you could get some private label gains in that side of your business that could just move the needle.
Kevin Hourican: Yes, Alex, good question. The primary focus is in local because it's where the end restaurant operator sees even more value from Sysco, where we can provide them tremendous value for their menu at great quality. And we are very focused on making continued progress there. National is trickier. It's more complicated. As you know, large, large restaurant chains negotiate direct with suppliers for proprietary products that are on their menu that are unique to them. And then we provide a distribution, cold storage, tri temperature truck delivery on time and in full service for them. So it's a little bit different model. We can make progress on national. It'll be slower going and you won't see step change increases in penetration in national for the reasons that I just described. With that said, we have a change in management function which Kenny helps supervise. We can provide options to those large national customers to at least have choice. You have your vendor direct program that you can negotiate. This is a program Sysco can offer you that's comparable or better, and we work to provide that penetration opportunity. So we can make progress on national. The bigger focus is on the local customer.
Kenny Cheung: I think one thing to add on that piece is, as Kevin said, we will make further progress. I think it's important to call out that we are continuing to improve profitability by leveraging strategic sourcing on both Sysco private label and non-Sysco brands, which is one of the reasons why, Alex, you're seeing a nice leverage from sales to gross profit.
Kevin Hourican: And Victoria, our Chief Merchant is going to talk more about the Sysco brand evolution at our Investor Day on May 22. Let's -- Alex, thank you for the questions. Let's go to our next --
Alex Slagle: Thanks.
Kevin Hourican: Next questions. Thank you.
Operator: And we have our next question from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.
John Heinbockel: Kevin, start with the expansion of the sales force that looks like a 5% or so growth rate. How do you look at that as a catch up versus something that's sustainable? And then your thought on what that -- there's this thought, right, that you take that and maybe multiply by 1.5% to get local case growth. I'm not sure if that still applies. But how do you think that works through the P&L? And I guess, you'd say it's almost all going to be new accounts, not existing growth.
Kevin Hourican: Yes. John, I appreciate the question. Let's start with -- I did today for the first time actually size the price from a headcount growth perspective in fiscal 2024. To be crystal clear for everyone who's listening, that's a net number. So there's of course, term that occurs within that population. And this is a net increase in our headcount by year-end of 400. We're on track to be able to hit that target. It's the start, John, of what will be a continued forward progress on hiring. Today, I'm not going to disclose the hiring target for fiscal 2025, but again, that's something that we can talk about at our Investor Day. And we do intend to talk about at our Investor Day for Q4 and frankly, for all of fiscal 2024. This is an investment, as in below water investment. I mean the expense greater than the revenue and profit that they're contributing. But we are confident and that will continue in Q4. It's an investment in Q4. It will positively impact our fiscal 2025 financial outcomes with a positive return on investment. And again, we'll talk more about the impact of that and how it contributes to our sales growth targets at our Investor Day.
John Heinbockel: Okay. And maybe as a follow-up, you talked about affordability, maybe speak to your thoughts on elasticity and how do you work with. I know you talked about private brand and getting your costs down, but obviously, you can take your costs down. You have to get your customers to pass that through to their end customer, your confidence in that occurring. And then when you think about elasticity for your customers, how do you assess that, right? And what has to be done with affordability to move the needle?
Kevin Hourican: That's a really good question. I'll unpack the first part, second part. First part, listen, we admire, respect, trust our customers. And I want to be clear. They are running their business to the best of their abilities. But what we are seeing, John is, we are in fact providing more value year-over-year to end restaurant operators. And we're not seeing that show up on menu prices. That's the main point. And I believe that menu prices need to come down for traffic to grow. And I believe restaurant operators are going to become more aware of that reality as time progresses because they're -- as you know, benefiting from those menu price increases at this point in time. To be fair to the restaurant operator, their overall operating costs have gone up. Their labor costs are up significantly over the last three years. And some of that menu price taking has been necessary to offset that wage increase, especially in a State like California. So you understand how dynamic that is. And they're making the best choices for their individual business P&L. What we need to focus on at Sysco is what we can control. What we can control is the price we pay for the product we purchase and the prices that we offer that product to our customers, so that we can provide value to them, so they will choose Sysco and choose us at an increased rate over time, because value does matter meaningfully in this environmental condition. Which segues to the second part of your question, which is price elasticity, we've gotten much better at this over the last few years tied to our strategic pricing software. It is very robust. We know at the customer level, elasticity at the item level, and we price accordingly. John, what we're seeing just from some color perspective, and this will not shock you, restaurant operators need for really sharp prices on their key commodities is intense right now. So tremendous focus, let's call it their top 10 items, and we need to be right on price on those top 10 items. And it's intense out there right now. The need for restaurant operators to lower their costs for those highest volume SKUs. So we need to be sharp there. We need to be sharp and we need to be right on price on those items. That means relative to the market competitive. And what that means is there's a long tail of product and the long tail product is more inelastic and we will never take advantage. But we have an opportunity to be a little higher in price, perhaps on some of those inelastic SKUs to fund sharper prices in the commodity space. And that's something that we're working on. That's something that we leverage our technology to deploy. The thing that we need to get better at from a pricing perspective is the ability to react in the moment at that individual customer level. If we have a competitor in the account who wants to win business from our customer, we need to enable our sales reps to make timely decisions to respond in the moment and that's something we're working to improve upon, and I'm confident we can improve in that regard.
Operator: And we now have our next question from Mark Carden with UBS.
Mark Carden: Good morning. Thanks so much for taking my questions. I want to start with one that's building a bit on the last question. How has the broader distributor pricing backdrop been amid some of the industry headwinds? It's placed in 3Q. Are you seeing competitors being much more aggressive with upfronts in this environment? There's still the concern, obviously, about avoiding a race to the bottom. Just what do you think on that front?
Kevin Hourican: Mark, I think it starts with the restaurant operator. The restaurant operator is looking for value right now because of their P&L, the labor cost point that I mentioned. So we're seeing increased activity of what I'll call price shopping. The goodness of digital penetration also creates an environment where it's easier for an end restaurant customer to be able to shop for price. So we've moved our digital order placement from 35% to over 80% over the last couple of years. And that is an in aggregate terrific thing for Sysco. They buy more, they buy categories, they've never shopped from before. We can provide them personalized offers. We can provide them personalized pricing. But competitors have ordering websites too. And it's easier now for a customer to be able to rate shop across distributors, and they need to because their labor costs that I mentioned. So it's less activity from our competitive set, it's more customer driven. We've seen an increase in front shopping. I'm sure that's very clear and very straightforward to you. And it's specifically, as I mentioned in the answer to John's question on commodities. So it's an aggressive market right now from a commodities perspective, if you're not right on price, you'll lose that business. And we need to be appropriately priced in that regard. And that's something given our purchasing scale, we at Sysco can drive the best possible purchasing cost and we can be credible and relevant from a price perspective to our customers in that regard. You mentioned upfront monies in your question. I want to be clear. Upfront monies are not a bad thing. Upfront monies, if they enable you to secure a large customer win for a dedicated period of time with minimum volume guarantees; our finance team underwrites every single one of those deals. I approve personally, the bigger deals, those are good deals. So I don't want you to infer that increase in upfront monies is actually a bad thing. They tend to be a good thing. And we have not, to answer your question, specifically seen an increase that activity in the marketplace. Mark, back to you, if you have a follow-up.
Mark Carden: Got it. That's helpful. And then as my follow-up, just amid some of the industry slowdown, have you seen any changes to the M&A backdrop? Any more opportunities opening up just for consolidation base with some of the smaller players maybe running some challenges?
Kenny Cheung: Yes. So in terms of M&A, what we're doing at Sysco is a couple of things, right? So number one, we are focused very hard on the integration. By the way, the Edward Don integration is underway and the synergies are being realized on both from a go-to-market standpoint as well as from a back office purchase standpoint. So right now, our priority is to focus on integrating and realizing synergies that we have in our portfolio today. In terms of the backdrop and how we think about M&A, and from a more of a macro standpoint, we have a robust pipeline. We have extremely robust pipeline right now, given the lens of ROIC, we will keep a close eye out for accretive opportunities. But at that moment, as I mentioned, we are focused on integrating and realizing synergies as we expect, these M&A opportunities that we have in our portfolio will be enterprise accretive from a multiple standpoint.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And our next question comes from Jake Bartlett with Truist Securities.
Jake Bartlett: Great. Thanks for taking the question. My first was a clarification on the comments on April trends. There's a big calendar shift of Easter and some spring break. You mentioned, I think that the kind of similar growth rate for both months. So that to me would imply a kind of underlying deceleration in April. I just want to clarify what the message is there, whether the comments are kind of adjusted for those calendar shifts. And then my real question is really about the non-local case growth, and it's not specifically given, but it looks like it implies an acceleration. The question is, what is driving that that non-local case growth? The builders are the drivers of that. And what your expectations are in the next couple quarters, whether you think that that momentum will continue and potentially offset some of the headwinds that we might be seeing in independence. Thank you.
Kenny Cheung: Okay. I'll take the first part. This is Kenny. So just to clarify, there is no deceleration into April. The growth rate from March is carrying into April. So just to be very clear, we're not seeing a deceleration in the market right now. It's similar to the ex of velocity of Q3. And with that said, as Kevin mentioned, we do have action in place to stimulate volume growth further in subsequent periods. Kevin, back to you.
Kevin Hourican: Yes. And I think the second part of your question is outside of local, what else do you see going on. We've had a tremendous amount of success in our corporate national CMU business over the last few years, and we continue to win net new business profitably. In national sales, including new customer wins signed in the quarter, Q3 that began shipping at the end of Q4 and into fiscal 2025. And one other call out is our SYGMA business, which I mentioned earlier, down $3.5 million in the most recent quarter. We're now lapping week 53 of a customer exit from a year ago. That was an unprofitable customer that wasn't willing to partner with Sysco to far an appropriate margin profile, and we exited that business we are now lapping that, which will positively impact SYGMA's growth rates in Q4, and we've signed some net new profitable business in SYGMA, which will contribute positively to SYGMA in Q4 and into 2025 as well.
Kenny Cheung: Sorry on SYGMA, one piece to add is SYGMA is down on a sales basis, however, year-to-date, the profit margins are up 20% year-on-year. So we've done a nice job really focusing hard on supply chain productivity. And once volume comes in, as Kevin talked about, the new deals we are signing at inking that should flow nicely down to the bottom line.
Jake Bartlett: Just if I'm so on, just a follow-up question. Is Easter a negative for you? Or how does the calendar shift just to make sure I understand how the calendar shift would impact Sysco as a whole?
Kevin Hourican: Yes. I don't think we're going to get into a specific commentary about Easter. There's movable holidays. Easter is one of them. I think it can move six weeks in any calendar year. Kenny's commentary was much more macro than that just one event, it was in Q3. There was a notable step up from a very tough January into more positive February. February stepped up more positive into March, and we're seeing the trend of that improvement continue. And we have to take further actions in Q4 to drive a step up from Q3, and we're prepared to do that through the things that I talked about on today's call. We're confident -- we're focusing our sales reps on the new customer acquisitions in Q4 that we can improve our market share capture. And to be clear, we took profitable market share. We grew profitably versus the market in Q3, and we believe we can step up that performance in Q4, and we're focused on doing so.
Operator: And we have our next question from Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo.
Edward Kelly: Hi, good morning, guys. I wanted to ask a question just about the backdrop and the expectation and how we should be thinking about the go-forward. Kevin, your tone definitely seems to have changed a bit about the backdrop. Kenny, you mentioned transitory, I think in your remarks, and if you look at Q4 guidance, you have a $0.20 range out there. That's a pretty big range, I think, for you guys. So it does suggest some uncertainty. But I guess what I'm curious about is how you're thinking about the duration of what we are seeing today? What specific adjustments that you're making that allow you to get to your goals? How do you think that's going to actually impact next year?
Kevin Hourican: Yes. Good morning, Ed. It's Kevin. I'll start. Yes, Q3, from a volume and traffic to restaurant perspective was a softer macro than we had anticipated. It was negative for the industry, food-away-from-home in total, volume of cases by the food distributor network in aggregate was negative in the quarter and that's not what we would have anticipated for the quarter. So the tone that you heard is tied to that fact based, the overall macro in Q3 was softer than we had anticipated. So that means we need to take share in order to be able to grow at the rate that we desire to grow at. And the good news is we can do that. We can do that by focusing on net new customer prospecting. We can do that by further penetrating our specialty businesses, which have a large opportunity to grow prospective market share. And we have teams really focused in that regard. I think we'll defer a comment on fiscal 2025 until our May Investor Day. But we are confident in our ability to deliver against the guidance for the year. And for that, Kenny, I'll toss you to comment on Ed's question about the guidance range for the year and for the fourth quarter.
Kenny Cheung: Hi Ed, it's Kenny. So based on our current expectation and with three quarters under our belt, we are more confident at the mid-point of our guidance range. And why is that? Three reasons. One is our confidence is guided by data. We partner with third parties, suppliers, institutions, and we have a lot of data. We have a lot of volume running through our shop each and every day. That's point number one. Number two, what gives me confidence in our guidance is the fact that we have a ton of dynamic levers in our P&L. As you can see in Q3, our GP grew faster than expenses and faster than sales, which means that you can leverage on both the GP line as well as the operating expense line. We talked about a lot of levers in the GP. You have strategic sourcing. You have Sysco brand penetrated within local. You have centralized pricing tool. We also have growth from our specialty business, which we saw this quarter. So GP leverage that we see. And then we're also very excited with the fact that we increased our structural SG&A cost takeout from $100 million to $120 million. And the good news is, as the market normalizes as volume materializes, that volume will flow down nicely and accretively down to the bottom line. And as these costs are structural and they will not be back in.
Kevin Hourican: And just to add one, we try not to do three-part answers. But as we think about where else can sources of value come from as we go from 2024 into 2025, there's more to be gained with supply chain productivity. We're not done. There's still gas in the tank on productivity improvement. We're really pleased with our performance in supply chain in March. It was the best performance in years, and we're seeing that carry into Q4, and that can and will carry into 2025. So supply chain productivity will continue to be a beneficial contribution going forward. And then local case growth. We can accelerate local case growth relative to our total company case growth and that's something we're very focused on for fiscal 2025, and we'll talk about how we're going to do that at Investor Day.
Operator: And we now have our next question from Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets.
Kelly Bania: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking our question. Kevin, you noted a couple of times just the need for restaurants to lower their menu prices. Just curious if you can elaborate on any context you're hearing from them about their willingness to do so. And can you also tie in just what you're seeing in California, in particular, in light of the recent wage dynamics there? Are you seeing restaurants pass along those higher costs in terms of menu pricing? How is California impacting the total volumes across the industry?
Kevin Hourican: Yes. Kelly, it's a good question. I appreciate the question. We tend not to get into conversations with our customers about the prices they should charge their end consumers. I was just making an observation on what we see in the data, just being back based traffic down for the quarter. Cases shipped in aggregate by the food-away-from-home industry down year-over-year for the quarter and sales up at restaurants, so it's just pure math. The only way that those dynamics could be true at the same time is for menu prices to be up significantly on a year-over-year basis. And research indicates, we do a lot of consumer research that consumers are getting fatigued with the increases in menu prices. But it's not for us to tell our end customers what to do with how they run their business. What's on us is what we can control. We can provide them value. We can provide them value with Sysco brand. We can provide them value by smaller portion size. We can provide the value by doing value-added cut services to take labor out of their kitchen. And that's what we focus on. We tend to focus on what we can control and help be a solution-oriented company for our customers. So the second part of your question about California, it's too soon to tell. I mean the largest passed we are not seeing a negative impact to our business in California to discretely and specifically answer that part of your question. I think what I've read and what I'm sure you've read is new door count openings will be muted in the state versus historical 10-year average tied to concerns that -- these are more -- these are national chain operators. As you know, the law does not impact mom-and-pops. It's a national chain law. And you've seen those companies announce that they're going to reduce the number of new door openings. We're seeing plenty of growth in other states. The South, in particular, they're seeing lots of new door starts in the South and a lot of population moving from California, frankly, to other states and smart restaurant operators tend to follow the puck where it's going and focus their new door growth elsewhere. Kelly, back to you if you have a follow-up.
Kelly Bania: Thanks. That's helpful. I guess, can you also just talk about how mix or trade down is impacting kind of net pricing or what you're seeing in a sequential basis relative to last quarter in terms of price points among the different like customer cohorts?
Kevin Hourican: Yes. I think the notable callout that I provided today is that QSR in our book of business is soft versus the others, and I point you to the SYGMA data that we shared today to give that illustration. We are not seeing meaningful trade down within concepts to lower-cost proteins as an example. That's something actually we think is appropriate and should occur, and it's something that we can do and we can help our customers do that so that they can, in fact, provide value to their customer who's coming into that restaurant. And that's something our sales force, the largest in the industry, works with customers on. We work with them on portion size. We work with them, alternative proteins. We work with them to provide alternative Sysco brand cuttings, as I mentioned earlier, that can help them save money. So we're not seeing a trade down within restaurant concepts. It's more about that lower-income consumer being pinched right now, and that's showing up in the sales results.
Operator: And our next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much. My first question is just on the cost savings that you talked about. It sounds like we're up to $120 million or more for this fiscal year. So you were able to increase it by $20 million pretty quickly when you saw sales perhaps a little bit more challenged. I think you mentioned 500 roles were eliminated and yet, you're still able to invest in what sounds like accelerating the sales force. So just to clarify, sounds like all of these incremental cost savings are back of house with no customer impact. And if that's the case, what's the future opportunity for cost savings and the supply chain if sales remain challenged. I'm wondering if you have any order of magnitude in terms of the potential incremental cost savings going into next year if you were to see these sales challenges persist.
Kenny Cheung: Hey Jeff, it's Kenny. I'll take that one. So first thing is first, and you called it. We are very proud of our leadership team, taking proactive actions given the softer macro backdrop. And the good news is we have a lot of levers in our P&L. In particular, to your question around the $120 million of cost out, let me give a bit more color. As I mentioned, last quarter, it was roughly $100 million. That's increased by $20 million to the $120 million for FY2024. If you double click on that P&L, Jeff, if you look at GSP or corporate operating expense that was $220 million for Q3 and that was down 6% year-on-year. If you look at it quarter-over-quarter between Q2 to Q3, it was down 8%. So the cost is coming out of the P&L. And you are correct. That does include most recent 500 elimination of positions, which is predominantly on the corporate side. So that is correct. We did not impact client-facing roles in our USFS business. In terms of other periods, what are some of the areas of opportunities? There's more room to go. As a company, we continue to have a pipeline of initiatives and savings. I'll give you a couple of examples, but just put color on it. Last quarter, meaning Q3, we rolled out the full implementation of Canada. Sure, Service Center under Mayor and that has yielded accretive savings for our company. And if you think about just pure SG&A, yes, part of its headcount, but we have a big bucket. That's what I call third-party indirect sourcing, and we are making good strides on that one as well. Be a vendor consolidation and rate reduction as well. So there's still a lot of room to go. As Kevin mentioned earlier, on the supply chain side, we saw a record level of productivity this quarter. With that said, we are not back in 2019 levels yet, and we still have room to go on that front as well in terms of P&L accretion from a cost standpoint.
Kevin Hourican: Yes. Just Jeff, this is Kevin, I'll add two things to that. Salesforce, we're investing in our salesforce. So -- and we're investing in specialty, as Kenny said in his prepared remarks, within supply chain operations, we will flex our staffing to the volume. So if the volume declines, we flex staff accordingly. But we're not talking about things like furlough and drivers. I mean the business is robust and it's healthy. It's growing. It's nothing like what we were continuing back in COVID. It's more about, over time, flex it down. It's about part-time labor flex it down and we're getting very good at flexing our supply chain labor to macro volume. And in fact, that's why March was as strong as it was.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Understood. And then just my follow-up, Kevin, I know you highlighted on the slide deck, your 17% market share, and I know we've talked about the big three, maybe having still sub-40%. So it does seem like the focus is predominantly on taking further share from the other 60%. I know it doesn't necessarily require M&A. But just -- can you talk about that opportunity to take market share? I would think that opportunity would accelerate if the competition is struggling. I know we've talked about the restaurant industry perhaps struggling. But can you just talk about maybe the other 60% of the foodservice distribution industry, and what you're seeing there in terms of your competition and maybe the greatest opportunity you see there to gain share?
Kevin Hourican: I think your main point is the strong gets stronger when times are tougher. And yes, that is the case. And if you look at the time of COVID, we performed extremely well versus the industry at large, top and bottom line versus the industry during that period of time, and I think that would continue in a softer macro environment. I tend to focus more on the vectors of growth where we are meaningfully focused is in specialty. We have the most robust specialty offering by far in the industry coast-to-coast. It is unmatched by anyone in the industry. And our market share in specialty is well below our U.S. Broadline market share. So we have the product offering. We have the geographic coverage, the market share growth opportunity in specialty is substantial, and we're making investments in specialty to be able to bring that market share capture to life. The net 400 sales professionals that I talked about today includes increases in specialty protein and specialty produce sales experts we are going to talk in more detail about the opportunities in specialty at our Investor Day at the end of May.
Operator: And we have our next question from Kendall Toscano with Bank of America.
Kendall Toscano: Hi, thanks for taking my question. The quick clarification point was on; I know you gave the impact from Edward Don. But just to make sure I understand, would it have been that the total case growth on an organic basis was plus 0.2% in local would have been down 1.2%.
Kevin Hourican: That's correct. Your math is correct.
Kendall Toscano: Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then another quick one is just when you talk about lowering menu prices and working with your suppliers on that, are there any specific product categories that you would have in mind on that? Would it be more commodities focused for non-perishable items?
Kevin Hourican: Center of plate is what drives the purchase ticket in any restaurant. So we're focused on is providing value, good, better, best options, alternative proteins, portion size, center plate is what drives any restaurants purchasing cost. And then commodities is the place that a customer will go to help save themselves money and they'll price shop distributor A versus B. So we need to be, as I said earlier today, right on price on commodities. And we can do so intelligently by leveraging our pricing tool, purchasing those commodities that rates that are industry-leading. And it's a basket of goods they buy from us. And as John Heinbockel asked about, it's managing the elasticity across that book and nobody is better positioned to be able to do that work than Sysco.
Operator: And we have reached our allotted time for our question-and-answer session today. This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-01-30 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to Sysco's Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. We will begin with opening remarks and introductions. I would like to turn the call over to Kevin Kim, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Kevin Kim: Good morning everyone and welcome to Sysco's second quarter fiscal year 2024 earnings call. On today's call, we have Kevin Hourican, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kenny Cheung, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, please note that statements made during this presentation that state the company's or management's intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, and actual results could differ in a material manner. Additional information about factors that could cause results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's SEC filings. This includes, but is not limited to, risk factors contained in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 1st, 2023, subsequent SEC filings, and the news release issued earlier this morning. A copy of these materials can be found in the Investors section at sysco.com. Non-GAAP financial measures are included in our comments today and our presentation slides. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures is included at the end of the presentation slides and can also be found in the Investors section of our website. During the discussion today, unless otherwise stated, all results are compared to the same quarter in the prior year. To ensure we have sufficient time to answer all questions, we'd like to ask each participant to limit their time today to one question and one follow-up. Additionally, we want to make the audience aware of Sysco's participation at the CAGNY Investor Conference on February 20th and our Investor Day on May 22nd in New York. We hope you can join these events in person or virtually. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Hourican.
Kevin Hourican: Thanks Kevin and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining our call today. I'm very pleased with Sysco's performance for the quarter. Our company is the market leader in a growing industry or size and scale matter. This past quarter, we demonstrated that important position of strength by delivering another quarter of double-digit earnings per share growth. Sysco delivered bottom-line growth through a combination of volume growth, disciplined margin management, and expense control. Our positive momentum from the first half of our fiscal year is expected to continue into the second half, and we remain confident in our full year growth expectations for sales and EPS. This includes 2024 adjusted EPS growth of 7% at the midpoint of our guidance range. Sysco has improved how we leverage our scale through the Recipe for Growth strategy and we continue to deliver industry-leading profitability metrics as well as leverage our industry-leading strong balance sheet. Our confidence in the year has enabled us to increase our capital allocation to shareholders for the year. We are announcing today an increase of our stock buyback target for fiscal year 2024. We now expect to buy back approximately $1.25 billion of our stock this year up from our previously communicated $750 million. With the increased stock buyback and our industry-leading dividend yield, we will contribute more than $2.25 billion directly to our shareholders. Sysco's strong balance sheet and free cash flow enable us to make these types of shareholder-friendly decisions while providing ample liquidity to fund the long-term growth of our business. We are, as we say, play from a position of strength. So let's get started with a brief highlight of the quarter on Slide number 5. Beginning with the top line, we delivered sales growth of 3.7%, a sequential improvement from Q1, driven by a combination of positive case volume growth and positive product cost inflation. Importantly, this included a sequential improvement in local case volume growth quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. We will share more on that later. Turning to the bottom line, we posted over 11% growth in adjusted EPS, generating strong operating leverage. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of positive operating leverage and the 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Kenny will provide more details in his financial section. Today, I would like to update you on two topics I highlighted as priorities on our Q1 earnings call: Local case volume and supply chain productivity. During the quarter, we sequentially increased our case volume performance, growing our US foodservice segment 3.4% and delivering local case volume growth of 2.9%. We grew our market share profitably through our improvement efforts. Notably, this growth comes with the industry-leading profit margin rates you can expect from Sysco. The rate of volume growth does not include the benefit of Edward Don, which closed in late November, and we remain solidly on track to deliver our growth ambition versus the market this year. Importantly, the initiatives we outlined to drive local case performance earlier this year began to bear fruit this past quarter. We are focused on improving sales execution. Our efforts are centered around properly serving our local customers in improving our local sales growth. A reminder of our local sales focus areas for fiscal 2024. First, we started adding incremental sales headcount in the second quarter and expect to continue hiring in the second half of fiscal year 2024 and in the coming years. The incremental headcount is targeted to optimize territory sizes and enhanced sales consultant effectiveness, demonstrating focused actions to deliver higher returns. The benefits from increasing our local salesforce will accrue over time as new colleagues complete their training, move up the productivity curve and settle into their territories. As previously indeed, we continue to expect to see the vast majority of the positive impact from our fiscal year 2024 hires impact fiscal year 2025 performance. Second, we recently refined our compensation model to further motivate our sales consultants on win, win, win behaviors for Sysco, our customers and our salesforce. We can already see the impact of the compensation change, and we expect the impact of these recent changes to grow over time. We will continue to optimize our compensation program over time to ensure we are properly rewarding and motivating our sales team. Third, our focus on performance management continues with a hyper focus on customer visit frequency and sales consultant visit quality. These efforts are improving outcomes of our sales visits and can be closely tracked in our CRM tool. Leveraging technology to maximize the effectiveness of each customer visit remains a top priority and I am pleased with the impact of our sales leadership team in the past quarter. Lastly, total team selling continues to gain traction. Our sales teams across broadline and specialty are working more collaboratively and we are leveraging our data to maximize the time allocation of our selling specialists in produce, protein and ethnic cuisine segments like Italian. All told, these interconnected actions increased our local case performance from Q1 to Q2 by 300 basis points. Importantly, the exit velocity of the quarter was even stronger as our performance improved each month of the quarter. We are confident in our ability to continue to grow local sales, while maintaining the positive momentum we have displayed in national sales. Next, I would like to provide an update on the progress we've been making within our supply chain. We continue to improve the performance of our supply chain by focusing on operational excellence. Chart 9 displays our year-over-year operating profit improvement, driven by positive operating leverage, with gross profits growing at a faster rate than operating expenses. Our supply chain employees continue to move up the productivity curve due to improved colleague training and significantly improved levels of retention, especially within the driver position with improved retention comes improved outputs across the supply chain, lowering hiring expenses, lower training expenses, improved productivity, lower levels of product shrink, improved safety metrics and improved service levels to our customers. Each of these elements positively impact our P&L and the improvement drops straight to the bottom line. We are extremely focused on continuing to improve colleague retention and productivity within our supply chain. Lastly, we continue to improve the rigor and discipline in our colleague staffing efforts. This includes better matching our hours worked to the volume of cases shipped and the difficult work of flexing down our staffing during lower volume periods. We will continue to refine our engineered labor standards that drive our staffing models, and we will increase the agility with which we match our staffing to our volume. Our Q2 results display a continuation of quarter-over-quarter progress in productivity gains, and we remain disciplined and focused on continuing that rate of improvement. These efforts will benefit the P&L in fiscal 2024 and will carry into 2025 and beyond. We are bullish on our ability to continue to lower our cost to serve while simultaneously improving customer service levels. As I lift up from these two topics, improving sales effectiveness and improving our supply chain productivity, I would also like to communicate that we remain on track with our Recipe for Growth business transformation. Our digital efforts continue to advance. Our merchant teams continue to improve our product assortment, especially in Sysco brand. We are excited about the integration with Edward Don and how we can profitably grow our equipment and supplies business. We remain very pleased with the performance of our Greco Italian platform, and I am proud of our international business leaders for the compelling performance produced year-to-date from our International segment. At our Investor Day in May, we will dive deeper into each of our Recipe for Growth pillars. Foodservice distribution is a space for size and scale matters, logistics scale, cold storage scale in both warehousing and transportation, technology scale, and sales force expertise and scale. We believe that no one is better positioned than Sysco to leverage global scale advantages in order to better serve customers and profitably grow the business. I am very pleased that fiscal 2024 is off to a strong start, as we are profitably growing our market share and continuing a track record of delivering compelling top and bottom-line growth. For the remainder of fiscal 2024, we remain hyper focused on the execution elements I highlighted today as well as advancing our Recipe for Growth strategy. We are confident that these efforts will enable Sysco to deliver our financial plan. I'll now turn it over to Kenny, who will provide a more detailed review of our financial performance. Kenny, over to you.
Kenny Cheung: Thank you, Kevin and good morning everyone. I'm going to build upon Kevin's commentary with a couple of points. First, we have positive momentum as Q2 marked another milestone with record topline and bottom-line performance. Future results included sales and volume growth, along with strong cost of goods sold performance, resulting in adjusted gross profit dollar growth and margin expansion. Positive operating leverage was also driven by gross profit growing at a faster rate than operating expenses, demonstrating our disciplined margin management, which rendered adjusted EPS growth of over 11%. Second, we are excited about our first half performance and confidence in our positive momentum for the remainder of the year. Therefore, we are increasing our share repurchases expectations from $750 million to $1.25 billion for FY 2024 versus the prior guidance. This will increase expected total shareholder returns, including dividends and share repurchases to approximately $2.25 billion for FY 2024. This is in addition to our continued reinvestment into the business, including M&A, such as the addition of BIX and Edward Don earlier this year. Capital allocation is a competitive advantage for Sysco as the strength of our balance sheet and free cash flow generation allows us to invest for growth and reward our shareholders at the same time. Now, turning to a summary of our reported results for the quarter, starting on Slide 13. For the second quarter, our enterprise sales grew 3.7%, with US foodservice growing 3.2%, international growing 9.6%, SYGMA and decreasing 1%, driven by planned exit of customers that did not meet our disciplined profit thresholds. This planned exit along with strong supply chain productivity improvement, helped more than double our SYGMA profits this quarter, another prime example of our ROIC focus in action. Enterprise inflation was 1.1%. Additionally, US broadline inflation was slightly positive and our international segment was up 6.6%, all aligned with our expectations. Total US foodservice volume increased 3.4% and local volume was up 2.9%, a 300 bps sequential improvement from Q1. Please note, volume reporting includes slight benefits from the acquisition of BIX Produce. Our volume reporting does not include our Edward Don or Specialty Meat business based on their unique product attributes. We produced $3.5 billion in gross profit, up 4.9%. Adjusted gross margin improved to 18.2%, an increase of 21 bps. Our gross profit dollar and margin percentage improvement reflected our ability to effectively manage product cost fluctuations driven by incremental progress from our strategic sourcing efforts and disciplined pricing. Penetration rates of Sysco brand products increased 22 bps to 46.9% in U.local and was essentially flat at 36.8% in US broadline. Overall, adjusted operating expense were $2.8 billion for the quarter or 14.4% of sales as we achieved another quarter of positive operating leverage. The strong management of expenses during the quarter was due to the positive impact of the variable labor planning tool and supply chain efficiencies that Kevin mentioned, and benefits from our previously announced $100 million of cost-out commitments. We are on track to achieve this commitment for FY 2024 and the planning process for delivering incremental costs for future periods has already begun. Additionally, with the successful closure of our BIX and Edward Don acquisition, we are on pace to realize both top and bottom line synergies. Adjusted operating income growth of 7.6% in USFS, coupled with outsized profit contributions from our international and SYGMA segments, contributed to bottom line performance. Positive momentum continued in our International segment, with adjusted operating income growing 30.1% during the quarter. Our international results are a continuation of the robust growth and positive momentum in this segment over the past three years. The Recipe for Growth playbook is yielding dividends in the US and internationally. In total, Q2 adjusted operating income was $745 million, up 9.2% and adjusted EBITDA was $927 million, up 11.6%. Turning to the balance sheet, which remains strong. We ended the quarter at 2.75 times net debt leverage ratio. This is in line with our target range of 2.5 to 2.75 times net debt leverage ratio. Our planned increase to the share repurchase program is already in action with an accelerated share repurchase program that was executed in early January. We ended the quarter with $11.2 billion in net debt that is well laddered and over $3.4 billion in total liquidity. Approximately 96% of our debt is fixed with the floating component offset by our cash reserves. Our strong investment-grade credit rating is a competitive advantage as evidenced by our team successfully issuing approximately $1 billion of new debt in November. We are committed to our capital allocation strategy as seen on Slide 19, which includes a balanced approach with three elements: First, investing in the business for profitable and consistent growth; second, maintaining our investment-grade credit rating; and third, returning cash to shareholders, through dividends and share repurchases. Turning to our first half cash flow. We generated $856 million in operating cash flow and $527 million in free cash flow, growing 70% and 141%, respectively. This growth includes continued strong conversion rates from EBITDA to operating cash and free cash flow, and we remain on track to grow free cash flow for full year FY 2024. Our strong financial position enabled us to return $353 million to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends this quarter. Looking forward to fiscal year 2024 guidance, we are reiterating net sales growth of mid-single digits to approximately $80 billion. Adjusted EPS is expected to grow to $4.20 to $4.40. This represents a 7% growth at the midpoint. Additionally, we expect positive operating leverage with gross profit growing at a faster rate than OpEx for the year. We continue to expect slightly positive rates of industry volume growth and inflation. This includes Sysco's US broadline remaining inflationary in the second half of the fiscal year. Our planned top line also includes benefits from M&A activity consistent with previous disclosures for an average annual contribution of 50 to 100 basis points of growth. We will continue to opportunistically evaluate accretive acquisitions, but the remainder of FY 2024 will focus on integration efforts, capturing synergies for accretive acquisitions like Don and returning excess cash back to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. For the second half and over the long-term, we expect to win market share, profitably and consistently. Our efforts will also focus on strong cash generation with conversion rates, ultimately feeding our plans to grow and reward our shareholders. Thank you for your time today. With that, operator, we are now ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Jeff Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much. I had one question and then one follow-up. The question on the US local case volume, the 2.9%. It's nice return to growth on a one-year basis and like you said, a sequential acceleration on a two-year basis. Just wondering if you could talk about your level of confidence in sustaining that accelerating growth, maybe prioritize the most important drivers of that momentum. I think you mentioned that momentum actually built each month of the fiscal second quarter, and therefore, a strong exit rate. So I'm just wondering if you could provide some context, especially as someone was talking about maybe a slowdown that has been seen across much of the industry in January. Any thoughts there would be great. Thank you.
Kevin Hourican: Good morning, Jeff. Thank you for the question. This is Kevin. We're confident in our ability to continue to improve in local sales. As you just said, the 2.9 is an average -- weighted average, obviously, across the three months. And sequentially, the quarter improved each and every one of those months. So we are confident in our ability to continue to make progress in local case volume growth. And at the historic profitability metrics that Sysco industry-leading will continue to produce. So it's profitable local case growth. The biggest drivers, I'd say the performance management on the sales consultant side is the most immediate lever. The compensation change would be the second most impactful measure and total team selling followed up by the increased SC headcount would be the third and the fourth of the four things I said on the call, if I ranked them from an impact perspective. As it relates to the second half of your question on January, there has been a slowdown in January. I would describe it more as a blip, a bump in the road, if you will. There's a couple of factors driving the January. Week one of January had a calendar unfavorability tied to a holiday and where it fell historically cold weather. I hate the W word. I never used the W word, but there was some extraordinary weather in January, which made it awfully difficult to make deliveries to customers in large swaths of the United States. That's backed up by the credit card data from the major banks that consumption that food-away-from-home was down in January. Jeff, I'm not overly concerned about that. It's the lowest volume month of the year that there's going to be a blip or a bump you'd want it to be in that month. So, goes March, so goes the quarter. And we've got levers that we can pull on the year to go, and I toss to Kenny for any additional comment in that regard.
Kenny Cheung: Hey Jeff, good morning. On January, I agree with Kevin, what we're seeing right now. While volume has been slightly impacted. We have the ability to flex labor and mitigate the impact of lower volume with our labor [ph] planning tool that we talked about, and that is in conjunction with the disciplined engineering labor standards that we've implemented. However, weather also impacts over time, productivity, customer returns, delivery costs, which we will mitigate throughout the fiscal year with levers in our P&L. Therefore, the full year guidance remains intact. In terms -- Kevin talked a bit about local in the US, one comment is local international. As we know, international is roughly 20% of our business. And we've replicated some of the RFG, Recipe for Growth playbook there. And we are seeing nice growth from our Canadian business and our European business, which is both up roughly 80%, and it's really driven by new customers, penetration, and customer retention. So, we are excited and we continue to invest and capture growth with pace and discipline.
Jeff Bernstein: Got it. And just my follow-up on the fiscal 2024 guidance. I know from a very high level, you reiterated the mid-single-digit topline and the 5% to 10% EPS growth, I think you called out 7% at the midpoint. I'm wondering if you could share anything that might have surprised you on the positive or negative side in the first half of the year, especially because I think you said 7% at the midpoint. You've also talked about in the first half of the year, double digit and 11 consecutive quarters of double-digit EPS growth. So what potential incremental challenges are you seeing in the second half, especially as you've got an incremental $500 million bump in share repurchase to come. So, just wondering your thoughts on the back half of the year EPS growth relative to the recent momentum you've had. Thank you.
Kevin Hourican: Okay. So, let me unpack to questions, what surprised me and what are some takeaways in the first half of the year. I think the biggest thing is Sysco has proven we can manage the business under various different environments. If you remember, Q1 was slightly deflationary in the US. Q2 was slightly positive in -- for the US. And in both quarters in the first half, we delivered operating margin expansion of roughly 26 bps and also GP margin dollar expansion and GP margin expansion of 28 bps. So, again, I think first half was a really good proof point that under any circumstance, Sysco has the levers on the P&L to drive positive and consistent growth and being able to drive quality of earnings on the cash flow side. So, that's about more in the first half. In terms of the full year guidance, let me just provide a bit more color. So, we do expect overall this year, lower overall market volume growth versus 2023. However, continued market share gains from our company, profitable growth at Sysco. Inflation, as I mentioned on the last earnings call, Q2 came in slightly positive aligned with our expectation. In the back half, we are still -- remain consistent with what we said on both the first earnings call that we had at the end of last year and the previous 90 days ago. We expect the back half to be slightly positive on inflation. We still have two quarters ago, but I believe that Q2 slight positive inflation provides us comfort around our original assumptions. In terms of -- on the expense side of the house, disciplined expense management, our team has already directed an effort to reduce the structural expense by $100 million. We are on pace and we've begun building additional pipeline for future periods. In terms of working your way down to the P&L on the tax rate side, it's 24.5%, no change. There's a slight step up on interest expense of roughly $20 million attached to the $500 million of additional share repurchase. If you net it to impact together, so Jeff, I think your question is what is the accretion on EPS? There is a net accretion of roughly $0.05 or so net of the interest expense increase coupled with the retirement of the shares. So that is the $0.05 impact that you can expect for the fiscal year. With that said, with all the intra-working variables, we are reiterating and reconfirming our full year guide of $4.20 to $4.40 with the midpoint of 7% growth versus last year.
Jeff Bernstein: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Mark Carden with UBS. Please go ahead.
Mark Carden: Good morning. Thanks so much for taking the question. So I wanted to dig into your sales force additions to date. I know you said it's going to be a bit of a ramp, but how is the initial progress going relative to your expectations? And then how are competitor hires having? Are they having much of an impact on your ability to really find enough high-quality salespeople? Thanks.
Kevin Hourican: Good morning, Mark. We're really pleased with the progress that we're making. And those efforts began in Q2, I want to be clear about this. So in the early innings, we haven't quoted publicly the exact number of people we're hiring, but it's a significant number. We are not having a challenge with hiring and filling our classes. They are roster classes that we fill, and we put them through a very, very robust industry-leading training program. As it relates to competitive forces and the impact on our ability to hire, we're not having challenges filling the positions. That's my answer. We don't just go to a competitor, if you will. That is a source of talent. We also go to restaurants. We go to culinary schools. We're looking for people that are food eccentric that are good at selling have a passion for this industry. We can train them on our tools. We can train them on our selling systems and process, and we can train them to scale them up to be what they are, which is the best in the industry, and that's from our Net Promoter Score. So we're not having a difficult time filling our classes. We're really pleased with the first cohorts. We are on track to be able to hit the targeted hiring rate. And as I said before, that positively impacts 2025 from a growth perspective. Mark, back to you if you have any follow-up.
Mark Carden: Great. And then my follow-up is going to be related to M&A. You guys closed on Edward Don about two months ago. How is that early integration gone relative to your expectations? And then in December, you guys announced a small acquisition with Ready Chef in Ireland. Was that one simply a situation where the economics were just too good to pass up? Or does it signal a shift in strategy that you guys might be more open to international bolt-on or even larger scale M&A there?
Kevin Hourican: Hey, Mark, I appreciate the question. Let me just start with Edward Don, which is the significant transaction that we've done this fiscal year. I want to be really clear on the numbers that we quoted today. So one month of sales and profit are in the numbers that we described, but from a volume perspective because I know that's a question some may have, we have not included Edward Don volume in our case growth figures at this time. So the growth in cases of 3.4 in total and 2.9 in local is pure Sysco, not including Don. I just want to be really clear about that. As it relates to the early innings, I was just up in Chicago last week. We had a great day with Steve Don and his leadership team and our leaders talking about the synergy capabilities between the two companies, we can purchase better together, buying product at a better and more affordable cost. We can target joint customers more effectively. So we have large national sales, restaurant customers or hospitality customers of Sysco that aren't currently customers have Don and vice versa. Don has some really big customers that Sysco's not the food service distributor, so we can sell together in a joint proposition. And then there's this huge opportunity longer term to take that equipment and sales, product, category and have it shoppable on Sysco's digital platforms, deliverable on either a Don truck or perhaps some day to a local small mom-and-pop customer on a Sysco truck. We're really excited, not just about the $1.3 billion in profitable top line we acquired through Don, we're very excited about how we can grow that business meaningfully for years to come. And I know Steve Don and his team are equally as excited. As it relates to Ready Chef in Ireland, just keep in context, it's a much smaller countries. So the size of that acquisition is actually compelling for the country that it's in. And what it was, was a fresh point like entity. So to be crystal clear, in Ireland, we did not have a fresh cut bespoke produce business and purchasing Ready Chef gives us what I'll call from our US perspective, that FreshPoint capability. We're running the Sysco play. That's the headline. It's not a change in strategy. Our strategy is in each of the major countries that we compete within, we will run the Sysco play, which is to be the leader in broadline into bolt-on specialty capabilities over time, so we can sell around the room for the customers that we serve and do so profitably. So we're excited about that acquisition in Ireland. Our leadership team in Ireland is top-notch, and I am very confident in their ability to profitably grow the business, better serve customers and increase penetration with existing customers within Ireland.
Mark Carden: Make sense. Thanks so much. Good luck guys.
Kevin Hourican: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.
John Heinbockel: So Kevin, can you talk about visit frequency and quality of visit, right? Those two -- how you think about KPIs on each of those? And when you think about how that will move the sales needle, what are you looking? You're looking for a certain amount of year-over-year growth in frequency, how do you quantify quality?
Kevin Hourican: John, great question. And for the quarter that we just completed, this is the biggest reason for our improvement from what was flat in Q1 to up 2.9 in Q2 is from what I call performance management, which is visit frequency, visit quality. The comp change poorly helped, but it was early innings and that will have a bigger impact in a year to go and the incremental SEs will impact 2025. We've not gone public with the numbers, the targets, John. But we have a very specific target of the number of visits that need to happen per week per SE, and we can track it. We can track it through this year end. And we were not where we needed to be. COVID had a disruption in a lot of things in life, and one of them was SE's doing more of that work from a home office than we would have liked. We kind of ripped that band-aid off and made it really clear on what our expectations are of visit frequency. That's the wheel side of the job. Get out there, pound the street be in front of our customers. This is a relationship business. We're being in front of the customer every week matters, and we have moved the needle meaningfully in the last quarter on the number of visits being completed per week for our SEs. Point two, though, that you brought up is that's only worthwhile if it's a quality visit. So how do we measure quality? We have visited a purpose. And in our CRM tool, it will prompt our SEs with jobs to be done that day, introduce the Sysco brand case, win back the case that was lost over the last x period of time. Sell a category you've not sold before. Those are just three examples of jobs to be done. The CRM data rich understands what's being purchased, what should be purchased. And it essentially prompts the SEs with things to sell. And how do I measure quality? I measure quality by close rate against those jobs to be done and we can track it. We have a scorecard that ranks every one of our sales people from top to bottom, and then we do performance managing against the quality side of the visit. Recognize the top performers, coach the move the middle and hold accountable those that aren't getting the job done and everything in between. John, back to you for any follow-up.
John Heinbockel: The follow-up would be, right, so you talked about growing GP dollars above SG&A. So, if you take the US, right, the delta was 200 basis points this quarter. I mean what's your thought as to the right general level? And lately, it was gross margin-driven, right, gross profit driven as opposed to SG&A. We now shifted back, right, to an environment where it's more SG&A-driven than gross profit.
Kevin Hourican: So, here's my -- how we think about it. It's both, right? It is the gross profit line and the operating income line. If you look at Q2, you can see that our topline growth was 4%. If you just do the math, the cost of goods, if you will, between sales and gross profit was up 3%. So, you had a nice leverage driven by strategic sourcing, our partnership with suppliers driven by mix of business, growth in specialty, local brand penetration. And as a result, GP actually grew 5%. So, we had a nice leverage between sales and GP. Now to Europe on SG&A, we're working extremely hard, driving productivity out. The good news is, is the $100 million of cost out that we talked about at the beginning of the year, that is being seen through the P&L and we're working through a pipeline that's going to render success for us in outer period. And that is -- and you can see GP growing, call it, 5%, and then net earnings growing close to double-digit for the prior year. So, you're getting the leverage, John, on both the cost of good line and the OpEx line and we have initiatives back to both sides of the house.
John Heinbockel: Thank you.
Kevin Hourican: Thanks John.
Operator: The next question comes from Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo.
Edward Kelly: Hi, guys. Good morning. Nice quarter. I wanted to just follow-up on the case line growth. I mean the Q2 result was clearly an inflection around what's the last quarter and the last couple of quarters. Can you maybe just help us understand how we should be thinking about the back half of the year from here? So, you talked about January off to a slower start. I don't think industry growth is all that spectacular at the moment. I'm just trying to make sure that we're in the right place from an expectation standpoint, just given how strong Q2 was? And then just a clarification on Edward Don, I know it's not in the case volume numbers currently. Does that mean it will not be going forward as well?
Kevin Hourican: Yes, Ed, good question. Thank you. We're confident in our ability to profitably grow the local business and not kind of regress back to the mean on where we were in Q1. That's one of the main messages from today's call. We've built momentum local performance, very strong. Exit velocity was strong. Unfortunately, the industry as I did a speed bump, I talked about the W word, which I hate talking about. There's also a two-year stack thing going on in January where because of very, very strong growth a year ago. tied to the prior year being Omicron. There's a two-year stack phenomenon on January that normalizes itself by mid-February, which we'll get through. And as you know, March is the most important month. But we're not going to quote a number on today's call vis-à-vis what you should expect from a local case volume growth other than what we are seeing and what we predict is built into the guidance for the year, and we're confident in our ability to deliver the midpoint of the guidance that we point out today. Kenny touched to for any additional comments.
Kenny Cheung: Yes. On local growth, as Kevin said, our assumptions are baked into the guidance. We are always focused on profitable growth. That's really important for our company. And you can see that's the reason why that the cash conversion and not leverage was so strong in Q2. In terms of Edward Don, so in our volume number, just to clarify, BIX is in our volume year-over-year, it's immaterial. From a Don side, it is in our total number, just not in the volume number given the different product attributes.
Edward Kelly: And that's going to be the case going forward. And I'm just curious as to why Edward Don does not included in volume?
Kevin Hourican: I mean -- this is Kevin. We don't include SSMG in our volumes because the business is measured through pounds. And just getting to a common denominator is difficult. The way Don measures their business is today not the same as how we measure the business cases versus pallets versus eaches. And we want to make sure that we get that right before we include it in our metrics, and that's something that we're working on as a part of our integration planning.
Edward Kelly: Okay. Thank you.
Kevin Hourican: Thank you, Ed. Have a good day.
Operator: The next question comes from Joshua Long with Stephens.
Joshua Long: Great. Thank you taking my question. Was curious if you could further contextualize the strength of the local case growth in terms of the opportunity to further penetrate kind of existing consumers and then also execute against new customer wins, which I know has been a target and a goal over the last couple of calls that we've talked about
Kevin Hourican: Yes. Josh, thanks. On the existing customers, I'll bridge back. I didn't talk a lot today on the prepared remarks about our Recipe for Growth. I was trying to really keep it narrow and focused on drive local case performance through selling effectiveness and supply chain. We're really pleased with our Recipe for Growth strategy and the impact of our growth programs on our business. And I'd point you to Sysco Your Way and Perks as two very, very important programs that are increasing penetration with existing customers. They're continuing to do well at our Investor Day in May. We're going to talk about the longer-term plans for those two growth programs. And then the third is our total team selling effort, which is we over-index in broadline. We have meaningful share in broadline, and our share is below industry average in specialty. That's why we are as focused on produce and protein and the ethnic cuisines as we are, we're moving the needle with existing customers on total team selling. As I've mentioned before, what that program is, is each account has a sales consultant generalist, who is the relationship manager, who's there every week, but they are not going to be an expert in specialty [indiscernible] protein. They're not going to be an expert in specialty organic produce, as an example. And we're doing a better job of identifying which customers have the propensity to buy those categories, linking up that specialist with the sales consultant generalist in doing a joint visit and then compensating them in such a way that they win together when those cases are added to a Sysco truck, regardless if that's a fresh point truck or a Sysco broadline truck. And we're moving the needle with existing customers as measured by penetration. We're pleased with our performance in that regard. But the lifeblood, we call it the oxygen of the business is constantly bringing in new customers. You need that oxygen to breathe. We're very focused on new. We're very focused on making that a priority of the sales force. It's embedded within our updated compensation model as a priority. If they win new business, that's profitable and sufficiently large to make it worth our while to be going to those customers. There's a minimum threshold that they get rewarded as a sales force. That works hard. Prospecting is hard work. We need to make it a priority. We need to manage it, and I'm really pleased with the progress that's been made this last quarter on increasing the portion of our business that's new business one.
Joshua Long: Great. Thank you for that. And then Kevin, in your prepared comments, you mentioned just the overall improvement in supply chain. It seems like things are perhaps continuing to get back to normal. Your results highlight that. Could you talk about the overall health of the supply chain just broadly as an industry and kind of where some of the pushes and pulls are now that we're a little bit further removed from some of the disruptions that occurred over the last couple of years?
Kevin Hourican: Thank you for the follow-up. We're really pleased with our progress of improvement in supply chain. Retention is up overall market, as you just indicated, fewer people are leaving their jobs. There are fewer jobs that are open. So, therefore, just general staffing health in the industry is better. And then specifically at Sysco, we're fully staffed. It doesn't mean we don't have a job opening in a specific site today. But in aggregate across our network, we are fully staffed that bring down, as Kenny said, our hiring costs, our training costs, shrink improves, damages improved, accidents on the road improved. Everything about the ecosystem improves when we have a more tenured population. We're really pleased with that. The productivity levers that we have are moving up into the right as a result of that. Oftentimes, I get asked the question, what inning are we in? I think we're up to inning seven now on supply chain kind of recovering to pre-COVID, which means we still have some gas in the tank. And I want to be clear, when we get to inning nine, the game is not over. What happens in inning nine is then we introduce new technology, we introduced productivity improvement programs, et cetera. We can get beyond, meaning better than 2019 levels of productivity. But I'd say we're in inning seven, we still have room to improve, and we're focused on delivering.
Kenny Cheung: Yeah. One point for me is, as I mentioned earlier, we have the labor planning tool, and we're really matching -- being very agile here on the expense side, matching labor with volume and making sure that's with the backdrop of the Sysco work standards that I talked about earlier in my question in January, the driver academy, our training programs, our engineering labor standards keep getting better and stronger. We improve processes through leveraging, as Kevin said technology. The next wave of productivity improvement is the better have discipline to the standard work that we're doing. So still room for improvement, but we are pleased with the improvement we made in the supply chain, and that's factored into the 2024 guidance.
Joshua Long: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Kendall Toscano with Bank of America.
Kendall Toscano: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So I was wondering if, as you saw a pretty significant rebound in your local customer business in the second quarter, just kind of what the implications are on gross margin performance given that the local customers are a higher-margin customer segment. And then, I guess, as you enter the back half, as my follow-up, how you would expect the local customer growth to look versus the total company?
Kevin Hourican: Yeah. So I can start. So you are correct. The local customer does come with an attachment rate with a higher GP dollars per case, and there was a margin accretion as well with the local customer, and we are seeing that flow through the P&L, and that's one of the reasons why you're seeing a nice mix between your leverage on GP as well as the leverage down to EBITDA and net earnings. With that said, though, I think we shouldn't overlook the CMU success that we've had in our business. We are also seeing margin expansion. We are also seeing cost of goods leverage across the portfolio of our CMU business. Again, one may think it's just restaurant, but it's not. There's other specialty growth segments that we're winning in the marketplace, that's driving accretion on the margin side. When we talk about strategic sourcing, it is not just for a local customer. It is the size and scale of Sysco, and that benefit skills across both our local customers and CMU. We are renewing, we are winning businesses at a higher margin clip at the current moment.
Kevin Hourican: Just to plus up the last point that Kenny made, I've tried to be very clear about this point over the last several quarters. Our success in national sales, and we are clearly succeeding in national sales, growing new customer wins and the profitability of that business, as Kenny just said. There's nothing about the growth in national that hinders our ability to grow local. We do not have supply chain capacity constraints, we do not have hiring constraints. What I said on the last call is we want to keep the play running and working in national, and we want to make meaningful progress in local, and we displayed that this past quarter with a 300 basis point improvement and our intention is to continue to make improvement in local.
Kendall Toscano: Great. Thanks guys.
Kevin Hourican: Thanks Kendall.
Kenny Cheung: Thanks Kendall.
Operator: The next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.
John Ivankoe: Hi. Thank you. The question is on inflation. And I'm wondering what kind of indicators you were looking at to sustain inflation through the back half of 2024. I mean some PPI food, for example, metrics might suggest a little bit more deflation than what you're talking about is kind of the first question. And secondly, there's been at least some chatter -- some grocery stores actually sequentially lowering their pricing as their own commodity costs have you been easing. I mean have you seen anywhere in the marketplace in terms of your competitors, maybe on the nationals, but on the local or regionals of different operators that are lowering their price per case to their customers of something that could potentially be influencing the market over time? Thank you.
Kenny Cheung: Hey John, it's Kenny. I'll start. So, on the topic of inflation, you are correct. We are informed by data. We actually have a terrific [ph] tool of data. We partnered directly with suppliers, third-party strategic partners, institutions and the like. And so we have a rich data set of our own as well, given how much volume goes through our supply chain each and every day across various segments and industries. So, we're all that modeling in right now. Number two, we watch our basket very closely. Now, I've talked about this in the past. But if you think about our commodity basket, we have 12 main commodities. And we don't really over index on anyone in particular. No one come out more than 15%. So, each and every day, we're managing inflation and deflation, right? For example, you could have beef, for example, which is growing close to double-digit, but you can have another commodity that's in a different space. So, Sysco has historically and today managed deflation, inflation day in and day out. And the third point, as I mentioned earlier, Q1 deflation in the US; Q2, slightly positive inflation. On both quarters, we were able to effectively drive positive, consistent and operating leverage to our P&L.
Kevin Hourican: It's Kevin, I'll just add. You asked about prices to the consumer in the local business, in particular. It's a very efficient market, John. So, as our COGS come down, yes, the way it works is we then are able to pass through value to our customers. So, unlike a retail store, we're publishing prices in a circular and putting signs on a shelf. For us, it's a dynamic business. The book gets priced weekly, as do our competitors. And as prices come down, it's an efficient market. And that gets passed through to customers. As Kenny said, though, we didn't maintain profitability ratios on the way up. We can maintain profitability ratios on the way down. That's the value of our pricing tool that we are leveraging extensively to make sure that we are where we need to be. As it relates to just general confidence in the year-to-go inflation figures, we've got a lot of data at Sysco. We have global data. We have access to a large amount, as Kenny said, across the 12-plus categories. Some are moving up, some are moving down. The one that's going to be the biggest tailwind in the year to go is Produce. Produce was substantially deflationary in Q2 because of wild markets the year before due to major flooding in California. Produce is going to return to more normal, like low levels of inflation, 1% to 2% versus down substantially in Q2. So that's one of the bigger drivers of giving confidence in the year to go. And we said muted inflation, but certainly muted inflation is up from where we were in the first half of the year.
John Ivankoe: Very helpful color. Thank you.
Kevin Hourican: Thanks, John.
Operator: The next question comes from Alex Slagle with Jefferies.
Alex Slagle: Hey, thanks. Good morning. I just want to see if you could provide any color on the broader growth rates and health of the various categories you participate in. There are certain specialty categories that are growing particularly well or certain customer types in the industry if the growth has either carried off or accelerated lately?
Kevin Hourican: Alex, it's Kevin. I'll start and then if Kenny has anything to add, he can jump in. Let me first just talk about like where is the business growing, where is success happening, and then I'll flip back to the customer. But it's okay, I'm going to actually answer it in reverse. Right now, broadline is winning. And what I mean by that is distributors. So broadline distributors are winning. People ask us all the time, Kevin, how can it be true that you plus the other big two are all saying you're taking share? Answer is scale matters in this industry. Size and scale matter, our purchasing scale, our delivery scale, our technology scale. And frankly, all three of the big three are growing faster than the market. Our growth for the quarter was plus 3.4 and the overall market was very nominal growth. So we meaningfully outgrew versus the market and my suspicion will be as well the other big players in the space. So what does that mean? It means the growth is coming from smaller regional distributors and specialty distributors. Point two for the Sysco specific thesis is our specialty business is meaningfully performing. So we're winning in broadline in total versus the 60-plus percent of the business that's not done through the Big 3, that's a very clear point that should be understood. 60% of the business does not happen from the Big 3, where the big players are winning meaningfully in broadline versus that 60%. And then within specialty, Sysco's specialty is outperforming versus specialty. So that's kind of the thesis or the story of why we're outperforming versus the market. As it relates to the customer side, we're seeing no discernible moves trade up, trade down, trade left, trade right. The best operators are winning. People who have interesting concepts or interesting culinary trends are winning, but we're not seeing trade up or trade down. Since the January blip that I mentioned, it was a robust food-away-from-home market in Q2. And then specifically, December was a robust month as consumers were frequenting food-away-from-home establishments.
Alex Slagle: Thank you.
Kevin Hourican: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Jake Bartlett with Truist Securities.
Jake Bartlett: Great. Thank you. Thank you for taking the question. Mine was on the chain business and the growth there has been strong. And maybe if you can just confirm my math on that case growth among the chain business accelerated in the second quarter, maybe kind of what you're doing to drive that acceleration? And then if you can maybe provide an update on the relative profitability. I know the gap between independents and chains has narrowed, but if you can give us just maybe a better sense as to how much that's narrowed at this point?
Kevin Hourican: Okay. So I'll start, and I'll toss it to Kenny for any additional comment he may have. It's -- our CMU business, it's half of our business. We're winning meaningfully in that space. And yes, we did accelerate in Q2 versus Q1, and we have confidence in our ability to continue to be very successful in CMU. When people hear chain, they think national restaurants. I want to be very clear that is just one portion of that business. Travel and hospitality is in that space. Healthcare is in that space, education is in that space. And we've had notable and meaningful wins in each of those non-national restaurant sectors. In fact, our focus is in non-national restaurant sectors. The low profit portion of CMU is the national chain restaurant space, mostly in the QSR space. That's the lowest profit business. We're really focused on within national sales, which customer types we create a win-win contract relationship with our customers where we can help them achieve their objectives. We can do it at a cost to serve that meets their objectives. And they're willing and want to partner with Sysco on things that are profitable and helpful for Sysco. Like, for example, Sysco brand penetration. With local customers, we have more than 50% of our cases on that truck that are Sysco brand. And one of the reasons why the profit profile is lower in national is a lower penetration of Sysco brand. So we're looking for partners who want to grow together, who want to win together. And our national sales team has been doing a really good job in that regard, and we expect that momentum to continue. Kenny any additional comments you'd like to make?
Kenny Cheung: Yeah. Thank you. I'll say a few things here. So if you think about chain business, right, I'll say ROIC is a lens, how we look at all businesses, including chain. On the CMU side, as Kevin mentioned, we did accelerate. You are correct. The math is correct, but we accelerated profitably. That's a really important point here. Many of the things that we're doing across technology, strategic sourcing, all of our initiatives does impact both the local and the CMU side. So it is scaling and I know we say this a lot of time scale and size really matters in the industry. So that's really important. Sometimes, we'll say this -- we all think the compensation plan ties only local. We have many, many things that scales across both local and CMU driving possibility for both sides of the house. That's my first point. The second point is, again, ROIC cuts both ways. In SYGMA, which is mostly the bigger customers, they were down on volume year-on-year. However, given the supply chain efficiencies and productivity that we're driving and pruning the customer side of the house, we were able to double -- more than double the business on profit, 140% increase there. So that gives you a little bit of color on how we think about productivity as well as some of the other side of ROIC.
Jake Bartlett: Great. And I just had a quick follow-up on the comments on the local business on the independent side. Kevin, you mentioned that the industry was robust. Are you seeing generally positive traffic in your -- at your local customers? I'm wondering whether just local traffic has improved in this latest quarter versus the prior quarters?
Kevin Hourican: Yeah. Independent traffic, especially in December was robust. That's my most concise way of describing it. Really healthy, strong. I'd tell you we're strong across food away from home, but independents, in particular, very strong in December.
Jake Bartlett: Great. I appreciate it. Thank you.
Kevin Hourican: Thank you.
Kenny Cheung: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley.
Brian Harbour: Thanks. Yeah, good morning guys. You've discussed this, but maybe I'll ask it in a slightly different way. On operating leverage, you expect it for the full year. Do you expect a little bit less in the second half, maybe as a consequence of ramping up hiring? Or are some of the cost out sort of an offset to that? How do you think about that in the second half versus the first half?
Kevin Hourican: Yeah. So you are correct in terms of the second half dynamic and let me explain what that means. So, in the first half of fiscal year 2023, if you recall, we had snapback and [indiscernible] time in the first half of last year. But also recall, throughout the back half of last year, fiscal year 2023, those costs subsided, it became zero towards the back half. Also supply chain, productivity, turnover, retention, labor standards, all of those things that we're driving the value that we're seeing today, that started really towards the back half of last year. So, said differently, Brian, we are lapping a more challenging comparison from a comp standpoint. With that said, we are also investing in our business and our stride is operating leverage here for the full year.
Brian Harbour: Okay. Thanks. That makes sense. Maybe just on international. I know that's not as big for you, but it is pretty material, right? I think we've seen sort of some varying performance in international markets just restaurant companies have said. Could you comment on how you see that in the second half also kind of how you see the inflationary trend over the next couple of quarters in that business?
Kevin Hourican: Yes, this is Kevin. I'll start, Brian. I appreciate the question on international. I'll talk about just what we're seeing in international, and Kenny can address the inflation part of the question at the end. Yes, the headline here is we're very pleased with international performance. Rewind tape, I've been here four plus years now. COVID had a very negative impact on international. The shutdowns were earlier. They were deeper, they were longer. They were more punitive and it was a rough go, especially in Europe. We're out of that now. We are clear of that, and we are very pleased with our performance. International is a tailwind for Sysco from a growth perspective and from a profitability improvement contribution perspective. I'll just call out three examples from a color commentary to give it some texture. Canada is doing incredibly well. Local performance in Canada, greater than 6% case growth. Local performance Canada, greater than 6% case growth, and that's our largest international business. Why is that happening? We're deploying the Sysco play in an even greater way, bringing advanced digital tools to the country, bringing the Recipe for Growth to the country and leveraging an extremely talented team north of the border. So, Canada is doing extremely well. Great Britain, our second largest international country. We've always had a very good robust and mature CMU business and we were underpenetrated in local. We are meaningfully focused on winning local from a leadership perspective in country, and we are revamping our supply chain and our systems capabilities in Great Britain to be able to better serve local customers in that country, and we're moving them up the profitability curve as a result of increasing penetration with local. And last but not least, let me talk about France. France has been a problem child for my tenure at Sysco, mostly self-inflicted. I have been very transparent about that over time. And we have turned the corner in France, upward, onward, and better. We're off to a really good start in the first half of the year in France. We have a strong leadership team in place in France, and they're really beginning to -- like I've said a second ago, run the Sysco play. We've deployed strategic sourcing, AKA PJM, which is our strategic sourcing capability. We're working on introducing Sysco brand product in France, and we're working to increase the product range available and each of those things is working and France is contributing positively this year to our P&L in a way that is beneficial to the overall company. So, those are just some color commentary points and I toss to Kenny for any comments on inflation.
Kenny Cheung: Yes. Brian. So if you think about the -- earlier in the year, the inflation for international was roughly over 10% and this very quarter that we just had was roughly 6.5%. So we are seeing inflation subsiding a bit throughout the quarter. With that said though, we are excited given the one global operating model that we're operating in right now, and that is driving dividends. It extends our size, extends our scale, leverage capabilities, tools and best practices. So as Kevin talked about, a lot of that playbook under the one umbrella of global operating model is really creating dividend. So yes, while inflation is pressured, we are seeing the ops us through future sourcing local case growth, technology play, overall, one global operating model. So yes, we are still very optimistic and bullish about the international market as a growth engine for us. As you can see in Q2, we were up 10% on topline and 30% on operating income.
Operator: This does conclude today's question-and-answer session and today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.

===== 2024 Q1  (2023-10-31 12:02:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to Sysco's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. We will begin with opening remarks and introductions. I would like to turn the call over to Kevin Kim, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Kevin Kim: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Sysco's first quarter fiscal year 2024 earnings call. On today's call, we have Kevin Hourican, our President and CEO; and Kenny Cheung, our CFO.

During the discussion today, unless otherwise stated, all results are compared to the same quarter in the prior year. To ensure we have sufficient time to answer all questions, we'd like to ask each participant to limit their time today to one question and one follow up. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Hourican.
Kevin Hourican: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today. Our prepared remarks will cover the following themes; competence in reiterating fiscal year '24 guidance, another record quarter of disciplined financial performance with a focus on profitable growth, disciplined ROIC and balanced capital allocation priorities. These themes all confirmed Sysco's strength as the market leader.  During our call today, I plan to cover two topics. First, a summary of our Q1 results; and second, a spotlight on our Recipe for Growth strategy and how we continue to build capabilities for profitable growth at Sysco.  So let's get started on Slide 5. Our positive momentum from last year continued with tops and bottom line growth in Q1 to kick off the new fiscal year. Beginning with the top line, we delivered sales growth of 2.6% driven by a combination of positive case volume growth and effective management of product costs deflation in the U.S.  Turning to the bottom line, we posted double digit growth in both adjusted operating income and adjusted EPS, with an adjusted earnings per share of $1.07. We delivered this double digit bottom line growth in a slowing top line macro and deflationary COGS pressure within the U.S. Our ability to post strong results in Q1, considering those factors, is a proof point that Sysco is positioned to be successful in fiscal '24.  We believe the breadth and quality of our product assortment across both broadline and specialty, combined with the expertise of our commercial selling organization, and the strength of our supply chain and balance sheet positions Sysco to produce compelling results in the near term, and even stronger results over the longer term.  Digging a bit deeper into the quarter, we grew volumes in our U.S. Foodservice segment, with Q1 total case volume growth of 1.6% and local case volume essentially flat year-over-year. We successfully grew share, as the industry was roughly flat for the quarter. Our national sales team posted an outstanding quarter, winning substantial new business in the healthcare, restaurant and hospitality sectors.  As I have stated before, we are winning these multiyear contracts with strong profit profiles versus historical averages. Our success is a testament to the improvements we have made and how we serve large national customers. We have made it easier for national customers to do business with Sysco by improving our technology integration with our customers’ systems, and by providing large customers with more dedicated and accountable support.  Additionally, our national and international fulfillment scale is very attractive to large concepts. We are able to provide them with supply chain that can scale with them wherever they operate. We expect our national sales segment to continue to outpace the industry due to these capabilities.  Our local performance continues to outpace the overall industry, building on a positive multiyear trend. The local market has slowed quarter-over-quarter and Sysco is not reacting by leading with price to win share. Instead, we are focused on profitable growth, properly serving our local customers and improving our local sales execution.  Local volume, as I said, was essentially flat and that is something we intend to improve upon in our year-to-go periods. We're taking the following actions to drive increased growth in local volumes. First, we will invest in incremental sales headcount as we have grown our local business faster than the overall industry for each of the past three years. Our territory sizes for the sales teams have increased as well.  We are actively hiring more sales resources, which will allow us to optimize territory sizes and enhance sales consultant effectiveness. The benefits from increasing our local sales force will accrue over time as new colleagues complete training and settle into their territories. We expect to see the majority of the positive impact from this action in fiscal year '25.  Second, we recently enhanced the compensation model for our sales consultants to incentivize our colleagues to focus on profitably growing their and Sysco's business. This change was implemented recently during our fiscal Q2, and the positive effects will be felt in future quarters of this fiscal year. The change to our compensation model better aligns the incentives of our sales team to the key priorities of Sysco.  Third, we recently ramped up our focus on what we call visit frequency and visit quality expectations. Through our robust CRM, we are able to track the activity and outcomes from our sales team. Our sales leadership team is focused on colleague coaching to improve outcomes on both fronts.  Lastly, total team selling which was recently expanded coast to coast will improve cross-selling opportunities, combining the relationship strength of our sales consultants with the product expertise of our specialty businesses. All told, we are confident we can increase local sales volume growth, while maintaining momentum with strong margin management. We will drive that improvement through healthy long-term decisions and by remaining disciplined in our pricing decisions.  Next, I would like to provide a brief summary of select Recipe for Growth enhancements from our recent quarter. We recently implemented a global operating model for our leadership structure. It is important to note that our international segment posted another strong performance in Q1, solidly growing top line and bottom line faster than the U.S. business. The change to the global operating model will help further accelerate our progress internationally. We will move faster in adopting best practices, delivery of new capabilities, and leveraging new tools across Sysco's global footprint. An example would be taking the Sysco Your Way concept and bringing it to life globally. To head this new operating model, we named Greg Bertrand our Global Chief Operating Officer. In his expanded role, Greg will be accountable for managing Sysco's global operations, driving profitable growth in local sales and operations. I'm extremely confident in Greg as a leader and I'm bullish on the impact that he will have on his expanded geographic territory.  We continue to make progress in improving the performance of our supply chain. Chart 10 displays our year-over-year operating profit improvement driven by a positive operating leverage with gross profits growing at a faster rate than operating expenses. Our supply chain operation remains fully staffed, and we continue to improve employee retention and we're building on productivity gains.  We recently implemented a new and improved labor scheduling tool that has increased our flexibility in matching our staffing to the variable work nature of our business. As a result, we're becoming more flexible in how we manage our cost structure to match business volume seasonality. The end result of that improvement is a lower cost structure.  In addition to our focus on improving current day supply chain performance, we're expanding our supply chain capacity to increase our ability to serve rapidly growing markets. For example, we recently celebrated the groundbreaking for a net new Sysco fold-out site in Mesa, Arizona. Each new fulfillment center at Sysco undergoes a vigorous ROIC review, and a project prioritization test. Each of the investments will increase our capacity and feed future Sysco growth in already successful high growth geographies.  We are excited to have the first of these net new buildings in Allentown, Pennsylvania opening later this fiscal year. The Allentown facility will enable us to better serve the highly dense northeast corridor and support the eventual expansion of our specialty platforms in that geography.  On October 11, we announced an exciting addition to the Sysco family to our planned acquisition of Edward Don, a leading distributor of food service equipment and supplies based out of Chicago. Founded in 1921 and led by Steve Don, the business generates approximately 1.3 billion in annual revenue and services a broad range of customers across the U.S. We believe the acquisition will be a great addition to the Sysco family, further demonstrating our Recipe for Growth strategy but focusing on building strategic specialty platforms that help us support restaurant and hospitality customers.  Every Sysco customer needs restaurant equipment and supplies to manage their business. Don's compelling product offering and robust supply chain capabilities will improve how we serve those customers. After deal closing, Steve Don will continue to lead the business and we will partner together to profitably grow the segment.  Most compelling is the following. Sysco sells to hundreds of thousands of customers who are not currently buying restaurant equipment and supplies from either Don or from Sysco. Post the old approval and closure, we have a great opportunity to introduce the Don assortment to Sysco's customers and have a one plus one equals three equation through this accretive acquisition. I look forward to working closely with Steve and his capable leadership team to bring that ambition to life for many years to come.  As a wrap up to my remarks this morning, I'll summarize with the following. We grew our top and bottom line within the quarter and achieved positive operating leverage with gross profit dollars outpacing operating expenses. The result was more than 10% growth in adjusted EPS. This double digit growth is on top of a strong year in 2023. We are being very prudent in how we manage the business in fiscal '24.  We are closely monitoring the macro environment for signals on customer traffic in the rate of expected inflation this year. We are prepared to take actions to ensure we are successful in the operating conditions presented to our industry. For the full year, we believe Sysco is positioned to succeed growing top line faster than the market and delivering robust bottom line growth. We have three more quarters to go, and we are focused on delivering our plan. I'll now turn it over to Kenny, who will provide a detailed review of Q1 performance and select fiscal year '24 guidance commentary. Kenny, over to you. 
Kenny Cheung: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to build upon Kevin's commentary with a few additional points. First, we are reiterating our annual guidance for fiscal year '24. We have momentum, and we're off to a solid start for the year. Q1 was the highest operating income quarter in Sysco's history, marking the sixth consecutive period of record quarterly profits. We effectively managed deflation in the U.S.  Q1 results included sales and volume growth, adjusted gross profit dollar and margin expansion and discipline operating leverage, all slowing down to adjusted EPS growth of over 10%. Second, our Recipe for Growth strategy is delivering accretive margin value across the U.S. and international segments. For example, we've continued to expand and enhance Sysco Your Way neighborhoods globally.  In addition, we successfully closed on our BIX acquisition, a leading produce distributor, and our recently announced plans to acquire Edward Don, which will provide further penetration opportunities. Our strong balance sheet enables options to add acquisitions at opportunistic times, while simultaneously returning cash back to shareholders. Lastly, we are the market leader in a growing industry with leading profit margins. We have diversity across geographies, a broad customer mix and brands, in particular the depth of our Sysco product brand, which sets us apart from the competition and is a position of strength. For example, we were hedged from a deflation in the U.S. as international inflation rates remain positive.  Another example of our strong positioning would be local case performance. While we were essentially flat in the U.S., Canada local volumes were up over 6% adding to our outside international growth. These ingredients and fundamental building blocks are unlocking long-term profitable growth and positioning Sysco to win market share in a growing highly fragmented industry.  Now turning to a summary of our reported results for the quarter, starting on Slide 14. For the first quarter, our enterprise sales grew 2.6% with U.S. Foodservice growing 0.9%, international growing 12.2% and SYGMA decreasing 1.4% as we recently exited business that did not meet our discipline profit threshold. This planned exit helped double our SYGMA profits this quarter, another prime example of ROIC in action.  Enterprise inflation was 1.7% and positive throughout the quarter. U.S. broadline inflation was negative 0.4% and our international segment was up double digits in line with our expectations for the first quarter. Total U.S. Foodservice volume increased 1.6% and local volume was essentially flat. We produced $3.6 billion in gross profit, up 4.6% versus the prior year. Adjusted gross margin improved to 18.6%, an increase of 36 bps compared to last year.  As mentioned earlier, our gross profit dollar and margin percentage improvement during the first quarter reflected our ability to effectively manage product costs fluctuations. The improvement in gross profit was driven by incremental progress from our strategic sourcing efforts, discipline pricing, as well as improved penetration rates from Sysco brand products, which increased 6 bps to 37.2% in U.S. broadline and 53 bps to 47.5% in U.S. local results.  Overall, adjusted operating expense were $2.8 billion for the quarter or 14.2% of sales. The strong management of expenses during the quarter was due to the positive impact of the variable labor planning tool Kevin mentioned and benefits from our previously announced $100 million of cost-out commitments, which commence at the start of the year.  For example, we are expanding the use of shared services in Canada which are expected to drive improved operational efficiencies. These actions items enable Sysco to reduce Q1 adjusted at SG&A at the global support center by approximately 7% year-over-year. All four operating segments continue to show increases in quarterly profitability, including substantial growth in the international and SYGMA segments.  As seen on Slide 18, Q1 adjusted operating income of $854 million for the enterprise grew 10.6% year-over-year delivering another record quarter. For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA was $1 billion, up 11.7%. We continue to be encouraged by the progress of our international segment, with adjusted operating income growing 8.7% for the first quarter. This is a continuation of the robust growth and positive momentum in the segment over the past three years.  On an enterprise basis, Sysco's quarterly performance in the current macro environment provides another proof point of the company's ability to grow top line and bottom line under any environment while continuing to achieve positive operating leverage. I'm also particularly pleased with the health of our balance sheet. We ended the quarter at a 2.6x net debt leverage ratio. This is within our target of 2.5x to 2.75x, a substantial improvement from 5.2x just over two years ago.  We ended the quarter with $10.3 billion in net debt and over $3.1 billion in total liquidity. Approximately 96% of our debt is fixed, with the floating component offset by our cash reserves. Our debt is wall laddered without any maturities over $1 billion until FY '27. Our strong investment grade credit rating is a competitive advantage against the current macro backdrop. The strength of our balance sheet and history of delivering consistent cash flows provides us with robust options related to capital allocation.  We will be excited to add another accretive acquisition upon the planned closing of Edward Don, which is in addition to our acquisition of BIX earlier in August, as we continue to invest in the business. Even with the substantial M&A actions, we remain committed to returning cash back to shareholders, planning $750 million in share repurchases and approximately $1 billion in dividend payoffs for FY '24. Depending on the volume of M&A activity for the remainder of the year, we could increase share repurchases further, while remaining within our stated leverage target of 2.5x to 2.75x.  Turning now to free cash flow. We generated $87 million in operating cash flow and negative $73 million in free cash flow for the quarter. Our first quarter is typically our lowest cash flow quarter of the year due to seasonality, and this year was impacted by timing of working capital, as well as our continued investment for growth related to capital expenditures. We remain confident that we will grow free cash flow year-over-year in FY '24.  This growth is expected to be driven by continued strong conversion rates from EBITDA to operating and free cash flow. Our strong financial position enables us to return $353 million to shareholders this quarter. This was done through $100 million of share repurchases and $253 million of dividends. Even with a softer overall marketplace growth, we believe we are positioned to grow both top line and bottom line results in FY '24.  Looking forward to fiscal year 2024 guidance, we are reiterating net sales growth of mid single digits to approximately $80 billion and adjusted EPS growth of 5% to 10% to $4.20 to $4.40. We continue to expect slightly positive rates of industry volume growth and inflation. Regarding inflation and U.S. broadline, we expect a step up to slightly positive inflation beginning in Q2 ahead of our prior expectations, which had a positive inflection point in Q3. This slightly positive inflation rate is expected to continue into the second half of the fiscal year consistent with prior expectations.  For the year, we remain on target for enterprise inflation to be slightly positive. Our planned top line also includes benefits from M&A activity consistent with previous disclosures for an average annual contribution of 50 to 100 basis points of growth. Additionally, we expect positive operating leverage with gross profit growing at a faster rate than OpEx, translating the bottom line growing faster than top line. Our Q1 operating margin improvement reflected this leverage as we applied our commercial and operational initiatives, which will also have the benefit of driving long-term profitable growth. We remain on target for an effective annual tax rate of approximately 24.5%. Interest expense is expected to step up by approximately $50 million year-over-year, up $20 million from prior guidance driven by higher debt associated with our planned acquisition of Don. We plan to reward our shareholders with our industry leading dividend yield and consistent share repurchase activity, all while remaining within our leverage target of 2.5x to 2.75x for the year. For the remainder of the year and over the long term, we expect to win market share profitably and continue to generate cash with strong conversion rates, ultimately beating our plans to grow and reward our shareholders.  With that, I will turn the call back to Kevin for closing remarks. 
Kevin Hourican: Thank you, Kenny. As we conclude, I'd like to provide a brief summary on Slide 23. We are the market leader in a growing industry. We are the largest in a space where scale matters. We're investing to create additional fulfillment capacity to support profitable growth to further leverage that scale advantage. We're investing in technology to support our customers and remove friction in the purchasing experience.  We're expanding our product range to become even more of a one-stop solution for restaurants and strengthening our selling process with improved training, compensation and digital tools to improve the close rate of product introductions to our customers. These efforts are combined with an increase in the size of our sales force in order to reduce territory size, enabling our sales team to provide more dedicated service to our customers. All combined, these capabilities are making it easier for food service operators to focus on what they do best, serving great food for their customers.  Sysco has a strong record of generating consistent results. In fact, Sysco has consistently grown annual sales over our more than 50-year history. In addition to compelling top line growth, Sysco was the industry leader from an adjusted operating profit margin perspective. We have the strongest balance sheet, and we're the only food service distributor with an investment grade credit rating. Additionally, we remain the only distributor paying a strong dividend yield. We plan to build on that position of strength for years to come.  As our recent proxy statement highlighted, we increased the weighting of financial metrics in our annual incentive program and added return on invested capital as a measurement in our long-term equity plan. These changes are well received by our management team and we are very focused on delivering the guided results. We are confident in the long-term health and growth trends of the food service industry in total.  Our $350 billion total addressable market will continue to grow over time, as food away from home has taken share from the grocery channel for 24 of the past 25 years. Scale matters in this industry, and Sysco is playing the long game to strengthen or scale advantages. These factors, coupled with our dividend and share buyback programs, will set investors up to be rewarded over time. I am both excited and proud to be a part of the journey. There is no other place that I'd rather be than at Sysco right here, right now. As always, I want to thank our 72,000 plus Sysco colleagues for their commitment to our customers and our shareholders.  Operator, you can now open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Edward Kelly: Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for all the good color. Kevin, I want to ask you, the biggest overhang for this space at this point is probably around case volumes and expectations. Can you maybe just dig in a little bit more around what you're seeing from the customer segments? You did talk about some slowing in the local side today. And then you're obviously making adjustments. Given this backdrop and the adjustments that you're making, is it possible that you could see some improvement in underlying case volume growth from Q1?
Kevin Hourican: Good morning, Ed. I appreciate the question. Just as it relates to the quarter that we just closed, overall, Sysco grew our volume greater than the market we took share. In total, we took share in national for sure. And at the local level, we actually outperformed versus the market in aggregate at the local. I would say the quarter kind of played out the way we expected. When we guided the year, we guided that volume would be more muted for fiscal '24. We guided that there'd be deflation in Q1. That came to reality as well. So in aggregate, we're pleased with the performance of our sales organization and the outcomes that were delivered. I'd say a major point of strength would be our national success, as I covered in my prepared remarks. I want to be very clear about one thing. The success we're having with national in no way -- in any way is impacting our ability to win or grow in local. There are different sales teams. We don't have supply chain capacity constraints that are getting in the way. We're winning in national because of the improvements that we've made on how we serve those large national customers with technology integration and dedicated and accountable sales teams. I did communicate on the call today that we believe there is room to improve, Ed, in local. I communicated today several actions that we're taking to drive improved progress. Most notably the first thing I said, which is we will be adding headcount this year. We've grown local for each of the last three years faster than the overall industry. And the result of that is our territory sizes have gotten a bit larger than we would like by adding headcount that’s skilled and trained properly. We can reduce the number of customers served by each SE, which will increase face time, increase presence in that kitchen, and increase the relationship strengths of our industry leading sales reps. So that is a notable call out. But I emphasize today that's more of a 2025 benefit, because it takes time for those folks to get skilled up, trained up and incorporated into the company. We recently modified our sales compensation. That went live in this quarter, Q2, October specifically. It will take a little time for that opportunity to flow through in improved outcomes. But we are confident because we have piloted that change that it will motivate our sales teams to grow their business and our business profitably. We're very focused on improving outcomes for the sales organization. We call it selling effectiveness, providing performance-based coaching, and education and training to that team. And we're really pleased with total team selling, which is the leverage of our specialty platforms. If I put all those things together, I want to, again, emphasize one point we're not going to lead with price. We will be very rational in our pricing decisions leading with capabilities, service and outcomes. When I put it all together, I think yes, we can see an uptick in volumes, specifically in local. And I will call out that in October we're off to a good start. We're seeing some progress and that progress is actually across all segments and across all restaurant types. Q2 is off to a strong start. I'll toss to Kenny. Kenny, over to you.
Kenny Cheung: Yes. Thanks, Kevin. Hi, Ed. One thing to add is that in addition to the U.S. market, I think it's important to understand that we have a profitable growth engine in international as well, which makes up roughly 20% of our sales. During Q1, our Canadian business grew 6% in local and our European business grew at a similar rate. From my perspective, growing local is a big part of our long-term vision for Recipe for Growth. Under our global operating models that Kevin's referenced earlier, we are demonstrating sustainable value to our customers through programs like Sysco Your Way, which is yielding dividends as well as Sysco penetration, which is also driving positive flow through our margins. So local and national growth is important. But under the Recipe for Growth umbrella, our focus is sustainable, profitable growth.
Edward Kelly: A quick follow up. Edward Don and BIX looks like based upon the sales numbers, I don't know, could be 2% plus sort of like benefit to volumes. I'm not sure about price per case. That's hard to say. Is that fair? And both of those are in the U.S. Foodservice business. Is that right?
Kevin Hourican: Correct. They are and they're also in the current guide right now.
Edward Kelly: Okay. Thank you.
Kevin Hourican: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Lauren Silberman with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Lauren Silberman: Thank you. I wanted to follow up on the local case volume side and the investments and incremental headcount. Can you talk about what you're seeing with new customer acquisition relative to wallet share gains and negative underlying restaurant traffic just in terms of the composition of what local case growth you're seeing? And where do you see the most incremental opportunity? Is it really to improve on the new customer acquisition side [indiscernible]? Thank you.
Kevin Hourican: Lauren, thank you for the question. Good morning. I'm really pleased with the progress that we're making on what we call cases per operator programs that Kenny mentioned in his comments a second ago, like Sysco Your Way are doing extremely well in helping us advance cases per operator. The Sysco perks program, which is a loyalty program for our best customers, it's an invitation only club is having the desired effect of improved retention of our customers and increased penetration. And then our opportunity to improve specialty which we call total team selling where we're penetrating further with both produce and with protein is having a big impact. And last but not least is personalization through our digital tools. We're getting better and smarter at understanding the cuisine focus of the customer, and having our emails and our website and the topics that our sales reps bring to our customers be very focused for them. Those things are working. Lauren, if you ask me the question where do I see the opportunity for improvement year-to-go, we can be stronger in acquiring net new customers. In our new compensation program that we just rolled out, we will motivate and incent our sales reps to win net new business that's profitable. I want to be really clear about that. We're not going to go chase small unprofitable customers. We need to chase the right customers. But it's boots on the ground, out on the street, prospecting new customers. We've had a lot of success over the last three years in winning net new and we can be stronger in the year-to-go than we were in Q1 on winning net new.
Lauren Silberman: Great, thanks. Shifting on a similar topic, you talked about the local case and investing in incremental headcount, how does this impact your efforts on productivity this year? And then more broadly, if you could just provide any additional color on the progress around productivity? Thank you.
Kevin Hourican: Yes, sure. Good question, Lauren. On the sales reps aside, it's really a math formula. We've grown our local business. We've grown our local cases over the last three years and territory size is the key metric there, territory size because of the success we've had has grown. And we want to bring that territory size back down to what is an appropriate target ratio. We've not disclosed that number. And I'm not going to do that today. So that incremental headcount, again, those people have to go through training, they have to go through systems, knowledge, gaining inculcation into our culture, and what have you. It will take time for those folks to ramp up. And that process has just begun. It'll be a consistent effort as we grow the size of the sales force and our sales force retention has been strong. We're really pleased with the retention of our sales force. The productivity topic, Lauren, is more about our supply chain. And let me just talk about that for a minute. I've not spoken about that yet this morning. We grew our gross profit dollars more than we grew our expenses in Q1. And we're pleased by that. We posted positive net operating leverage. We're really pleased with the work that Kenny has led on CapEx [ph]. We've led through reduction in CapEx year-over-year and Kenny can talk more about that in a moment. On the cost per piece side, we continue to make progress. Year-over-year, Q1 versus Q1 in our main U.S. business, retention is up, pieces per labor hour is up, pieces for transportation truck miles are up. And we're pleased with the progress that we're making. I also want to be clear. There's still more progress to be made. We're not yet back to 2019 productivity levels. And we will continue to be very focused on that. And there's upside into forward facing periods and years as we continue to improve our productivity. And that is in our guide. We expect to make increased progress and continued progress. And those performance improvements are in our year-to-go guidance. Kenny, I'll toss to you for any additional comments?
Kenny Cheung: Thanks, Kevin. So a few points for me. First is in addition to the supply chain productivity Kevin's just mentioned, the corporate initiatives we outlined last call, the $100 million, that is underway and that is going to be realized ratably across the four quarters because we started on day one. That's number one. And if you look at the P&L from a corporate SG&A standpoint, we were down 7% year-on-year. That's point number one. Number two, in terms of the way to think about the pacing of the adds, I'll say one thing. We will be disciplined and deliberate on when and how and where we add, meaning we still expect to achieve positive operating leverage even with the heads that we're adding. So GP growing faster than expenses and bottom line growing faster than top point.
Lauren Silberman: Thank you.
Kevin Hourican: Thanks, Lauren.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Joshua Long with Stephens Inc. Your line is now open.
Joshua Long: Great. Thank you for taking my question. Kevin, you talked about the supply chain overall becoming healthier. That's a continuation of trends we've seen and a lot of the great work that you and your teams are doing. I wanted to see if you might be able to dig in a little bit more there in terms of, obviously, expanding capacity and the labor scheduling tools that you offered there are exciting and measuring the pace of dividends going forward. Can you talk about the underlying labor environment? We didn't spend much time talking about it in the prepared remarks. And I imagine that's because it's largely stabilized or largely improving as you start to think about just all the culminating work that you've done over the last several quarters. But curious if you could provide kind of any additional thoughts there in terms of the overall labor environment, maybe at the warehouse and kind of all the other scaling up that you've done over the last couple of quarters?
Kevin Hourican: Josh, thank you for the question. We feel good about our staffing levels across the enterprise globally and domestically. We're fully staffed as a network. That doesn't mean in every single site, in every single job that we're fully staffed. But in the network wide, we are feeling good about our staffing. We are fully staffed. And the labor market I'd say is mostly returned to kind of pre-COVID levels of inbound applicant flow for our jobs, and that's a good thing. Retention is improving year-over-year, and that's a good thing. Turnover is still elevated versus pre-COVID levels and that's something we're very focused on. But year-over-year, retention is improved and that's what's driving our improvements in pieces per labor, our productivity and it's what's driving improvements in our transportation metrics as well. That progress will continue, as I mentioned. Q2 through Q4 this year, we've got our team very focused. There are four key drivers of our ops expense; pieces per truck, our overall productivity, pieces per labor hour shrink, and safety. Those are the big four key metrics from an operations perspective. And if you interviewed any leader at Sysco, they would be able to tell you there was four, and we have everyone meaningfully focused on making progress against each of them. And that's the good news is that there's progress to be made in each of those critical four. We're making sequential improvement week-over-week, month-over-month, quarter-over-quarter, and there's still progress to be made. The staffing tool that I mentioned will pay dividends for the long term. It's muscle being built. This business is more flattish versus retail, which is very choppy with monthly promotions and certainly the Christmas holiday season. We don't have that degree of seasonality. But we do actually have meaningful seasonality. We have schools that are on and off. We have northern hemisphere that is much busier in the summer than it is in the winter. And then that flips where places like Florida get really busy in the wintertime. We are going to be more effective in our feature at managing our staffing levels to match those fluctuations in volume, leveraging technology, leveraging discipline, staffing tools, and that'll help reduce our cost to serve over time. Josh, back to you if you have a follow up.
Joshua Long: Great, thank you. I did. It was also encouraged by the improving profit profile you've talked about versus historical periods. So I imagine all of the initiatives and work that you just outlined there go into being able to service those new accounts that you bring on more profitably. But curious if you could talk a little bit more about that at a high level in terms of just other maybe systems, tools, procedures, behind the scenes that are helping to drive that improving profit profile as you go forward?
Kevin Hourican: Yes, I'll start on that question. Then I'll toss to Kenny if he has anything to add to that question. Yes, we're very pleased with the progress that we're making on GP dollars per case. I'll just go back to Lauren's question about the opportunity we have to win net new. We're better now at prospecting those customers to go after. It's not just go out and win a customer. You can win a small customer and add a lot of expense to your network by bringing on a small account, and then having them never matriculate up to a minimum profit threshold. It's a waste of time actually to send our sales reps out to those types of accounts. So our CRM is quite robust. And we have a lot of market intelligence. The opportunity by door [ph] on what that account can do, and we're getting better and better at being able to target our sales reps to those high propensity accounts and really focusing on winning them. That's comment one. Comment two, the other things that are driving GP dollars per case are actually in the buying side of our business. Our strategic sourcing efforts are continuing to make progress as we bring down our COGS and do so in a way that is stronger than the rest of the industry. It's a strength of ours. Topic three is Sysco brand penetration, especially at the local level. We continue to advance penetration of Sysco brand, and that's a huge strength point for Sysco. And then if you add the pieces that I talked about from a supply chain perspective on increasing the pieces per truck for the routes that we send out, increasing the productivity of our team, net-net all together, that's what drives a gross profit growth greater than expense growth, which allowed double digit bottom line growth at Sysco. Kenny, over to you for any additional comments.
Kenny Cheung: Yes, just one point to add. If you'd look at the gross profit line in the quarter, I know usually we talk about gross profit versus expenses, but I think it's worth pointing out that gross profit grew faster than sales, which is a proof point that what Kevin just mentioned, we are managing deflation in the quarter with discipline on the pricing tools side. Sysco brand, as Kevin mentioned, grew 53 bps on the local side for our business, strategic sourcing initiatives and the continued growth of our specialty business as well. On the corporate side, as I mentioned, $100 million is locked in for the year, and we're not stopping. We are looking for more as we speak. I know in the prepared remarks, we talked about Canada. As I'm looking at my own function, we're looking at finding better ways to drive outcomes more with less. So overall, I would say we are on pace with our productivity targets for the year and again looking for more.
Joshua Long: Thank you.
Kevin Hourican: Thanks, Josh.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Thank you very much. Two questions. One, just Kevin from a top line perspective, I know you mentioned maybe a slowing top line macro and closely monitoring the market. I know three months ago, there was more, I guess, enthusiasm. I think you had mentioned that exit velocity coming out of the June quarter gave you confidence in fiscal '24. So it does seem like it's kind of rocky month-to-month. I'm just wondering where maybe in the restaurant industry, which segments or perhaps chain versus local where you're seeing this greater or less than average volatility? And I think you mentioned most recently that in October, there's an uptick. I'm just wondering if that's industry specific or more Sysco specific. And then I have one follow up.
Kevin Hourican: Okay, Jeff, thank you for the question. And I appreciate it. As we think about the quarter, volume for the quarter was mostly in line with what we had actually predicted for the year. If you look at our kind of prepared remarks back in August, lower overall volume growth year-over-year, deflation in the U.S. business for the quarter in both of those things occurred. As I think about the full year for fiscal 2024, the volume will be softer than in 2023 from a growth perspective. But we have Sysco room for improvement in local. And I cited several things today on our prepared remarks that are going to help us drive improvement in our local volume. The second is margin from a rate perspective, and I'll toss to Kenny when I'm done here if there's anything that he would like to add. Can we grow profit during a period of deflation in the U.S. is a question that we were being asked back in August? Answer definitively, yes. We grew our bottom line double digits during a quarter where we had lower volume growth than is normal for our industry and deflation. And I think that's a powerful proof point to the financial fundamentals of this company. In a period of deflation with lower volume growth, we posted a double digit increase in profit. As we look forward, we look further down the road, this industry will return to more normal levels of volume growth and will return to more normal levels of inflation. In the engine of productivity improvement, the engine of relentless focus on taking cost out of this business will enable really compelling long-term results. And one of the proof points that I said on the call, our sector food away from home has taken market share from the grocery channel in 24 of 25 years. The only year it didn't was 2020 and I think we all know the reasons why. So we've got confidence in the long term. And we have confidence in fiscal year 2024, which is why we reiterated the guide. October, as I said, is off to a good start. It is stronger than where we were in Q1. It's too soon to tell if that's a Sysco specific thing and/or an industry thing, because we don't get the data on the overall market until after the months are over. But we're pleased with the start to the quarter. And it's coming across all restaurant types; national, down to local and it's also happening across our other sectors as well. So hopefully that's a strong harbinger of things to come for the remainder of this year, time will tell. We're very focused on what we can control, which is continuing the success in national and improving our performance within local for the things that I described today. Kenny, over to you for additional comments.
Kenny Cheung: Yes. Regarding the guidance as Kevin touched upon, we are confident in our guidance. Here at Sysco, we do adopt what I call the checkbook mentality where our business model allows us to pull levers to ensure we can manage against various market dynamics. As Kevin said, some are controllable and some are not such as the muted market growth and inflation which we were able to successfully navigate through in Q1. Just to put numbers on what Kevin mentioned, 36 bps improvement on GP and then 33 bps improvement on OI. Based on all the variables, risks and opportunities, we feel comfortable with the current guidance range.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Got it. And then my follow up is just on the inflation. It seems like specific to the U.S. it was down 0.4%. But I think you mentioned you're now expecting that to reverse to modest inflation in the second quarter, which, like you said, a quarter ahead of schedule. I know there was a lot of people pushing back on that thesis. I'm just wondering, your visibility or your confidence in that return to modest inflation in the U.S., any color on specific commodities that would be driving that? I'm assuming beef is a big component of that, but any color on that return to modest inflation will be great? Thank you.
Kenny Cheung: Yes. So let me first just kind of reiterate our guide on inflation. So you are correct. We are seeing one quarter ahead where we expect to on the last guide in terms of inflation in the U.S. market. We were inflationary in total from enterprise standpoint. The second half right now we're keeping what we said on the last call, which is consistently higher versus prior year elevated on positive inflation. In terms of your question around the kind of the product categories with commodities basket, here's how I would think about it. At Sysco, we have a diverse set of commodities or product categories in which we sell to a broad set of customers. The good news is we do not over index on any categories from a volume standpoint. No one categories more than 15% to 20%. Each commodity to your point connect differently. Beef right now is up double digit while other categories are in a different state. From a center plate standpoint, which makes up roughly 13% of our volume, we are seeing that trend up on the inflationary curve. If you think about it, take a step back, Sysco is always managing deflation and inflation because our commodities basket acts differently across the board. That is a reason why we have a natural hedge in the basket itself.
Kevin Hourican: This is Kevin. I think the only thing I'll add is Kenny hit the points very clearly is that center plate is where the significant increases occurred. Beef already started that process earlier in the summer. Poultry while still deflationary is nowhere near the level of deflationary pressure that it was impacting the business a couple of quarters ago. And Jeff, we've got really good data. We've got global data. We have connections with top suppliers. Ergo why Kenny communicated that it's about a quarter ahead of schedule the return to inflation and that it's a net positive for the overall industry and company.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Thank you.
Kevin Hourican: Thanks, Jeff.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Kelly Bania with BMO Capital. Your line is now open.
Kelly Bania: Hi. Good morning. It's Kelly Bania from BMO. Just wanted to dig in a little bit more if we can on the sales consultant investment, I believe you have about 7,500 today. But I was curious if you can talk a little bit more in color about the magnitude that you're planning to invest there. The cost, is that already in the guidance and the ramp that you've assumed in terms of contribution from these new sales consultants?
Kevin Hourican: Kelly, thank you for the question. You're correct on the total headcount for our sales force as of today. We did not on today's call communicate the quantity of headcount adds. It's a meaningful increase. It's in our budget for this year. It's in our guide for the year. It ramps up over time. They all don't start on one day. So think of it as a drumbeat that just gets louder each week. We're having success in filling the job. So it's not something we're struggling to do. And the reason I said sales professionals instead of just sales consultants is it's not just sales consultant generalists. We're adding more protein specialists. We're adding more produce specialists. We're adding more Italian specialists. And of course, we’re adding sales consultants as well across the board. It will have an impact, a very positive impact. What I said in my prepared remarks is think about that more as a 2025 impact, because it takes time for associates to learn the industry, learn the company, learn our tools and systems, learn the selling process. We give them a small territory to start. And then they ramp up that territory size over time. The main benefit, though, is actually the other individual. We're able to free up more capacity in time for an existing strong performer to have fewer accounts to focus on. And then they can actually grow their business as well by spending more time with our best customers. So we're bullish on it for the long term. It's something we will do on an ongoing basis going forward. But it will be a step change upward in the forward facing periods versus the past couple of years.
Kelly Bania: Okay, that's helpful. Can I just ask about the improving profit profiles for the national accounts and maybe just some color from your perspective on the driving force for that? I'm just curious, how much of that is a Sysco dynamic versus an industry dynamic in terms of competition for the national accounts, if that's changing or the way that the contracts are being structured in a way that allow you to pass on costs over time? Or maybe just help us understand why that is happening and the magnitude of the profitability for the national contracts versus their historical profitability levels?
Kevin Hourican: Kelly, excellent question. Thank you. I want to be really clear that we're winning meaningfully in national. These are competitive bid, RFPs, multiyear contracts. We're not seeing any reduction in the number of people participating in those competitive bids. We're winning at an increased rate. And we're not winning at an increased rate, because we're buying that business. As you just said, the profit profile of that business is actually up versus historical norms. Why are we winning? We're winning for the following reasons. We have improved our technological integration skills for large national customers. We can more deeply embed our capabilities in tech with that large customers' text to make it easier for them to do business for Sysco. What does that mean? New item setup, substitution management, new door openings, new customer onboarding. We have improved greatly our ability to make it easier for that customer to do what they do, which is focus on running their restaurants, take the worry of supply chain off their table. We've gotten much better at that. The second is we've increased the accountability and capability of our national sales teams. They have the right to make decisions. They are empowered to do so. They are more dedicated to our large national customers. And we funded that internally by taking out cost elsewhere. So our largest customers have more dedicated account and service and they have account reps that are more accountable and can make decisions in order to serve them. That's topic two. Topic three, because we're a global company, we're a one-stop shop for a large national customer to be able to support their door expansion both domestically and internationally. And that's now better understood by large customers that you would obviously know who they are. We're an attractive player and partner of theirs to make it easier for them to grow both domestically and internationally. I want to be really clear, though, that this is not just about restaurants. This is about healthcare. This is about hospitality. This is about education. We have dedicated specific SMEs, subject matter experts, now into each one of those categories. And while that might not be rocket science, that's reasonably new at Sysco. We've increased the skill set and capabilities within each of those dedicated lanes that I just mentioned. If you're going to sell to a healthcare account, you need to be an expert in the nutritional guidance from the government to help that end customer receive the reimbursement from the government that they deserve. You need nurse practitioners that are dietary nutritionists and we are increasing the quantity of people that have those skills. And we're having increased success on new customer acquisition as a result of that. And again, we funded those headcount to internal costs to take out elsewhere. In aggregate, it's working, it's winning and we're really pleased with the performance of our national sales team. Kenny, any additional comment?
Kenny Cheung: Yes. So in general, Kelly, when we think about capital allocation, when growth opportunities avail themselves, which exceeds our hurdle rate, we deploy capital to enhance shareholder values through these opportunities. This is CapEx. This is M&A. And this is, as Kevin mentioned, national sales. Each sales contract goes through a very rigorous process. We make sure that the margins is there and it passes the eye of the IRR and the hurdle rates. We will not grow for the sake of growing. This is all about profitable growth in our portfolio. ROIC cuts both ways. I'll explain the first way. If you look at my prepared remarks, SYGMA was actually down on the volume and because of productivity, because of discipline, we were actually -- it enabled us to double the profit for the portfolio in our business. Again, there is a lot of rigor in the approval process to one of your points in your questions.
Kelly Bania: Thank you.
Kevin Hourican: Thanks, Kelly.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open.
John Heinbockel: Kevin, I wanted to start with how do you think the expansion in the sales consultants triangulates with Sysco Your Way? And in particular, is there an opportunity to do maybe many Sysco Your Ways in less dense markets with the expansion of the sales force?
Kevin Hourican: Yes, it's a good question, John. And I would say it this way. We're being very strategic about where the headcount adds are happening. It's not peanut butter spread across the country. It's high dense trade areas, high growth trade areas, and where things like Sysco Your Way are happening. And that is where the headcount growth will happen. We're in select geographies with high customer density, with high growth are areas where we will over invest in the new headcount additions, and we expect high yield from that. As it relates to Sysco Your Way, we have a real opportunity to continue to optimize our performance within those neighborhoods. We're now live in more than 450 neighborhoods worldwide. And we have a big opportunity to increase the number of doors we serve within those neighborhoods. There's still tremendous growth potential in those neighborhoods where we don't serve every customer yet. And then for the customers that we are currently serving, we don't have produce and protein and Italian on every one of those customers' truck deliveries, and why wouldn't they order produce and protein from Sysco when we're coming literally every day and we have a sales rep. So we are having so much success and this perhaps is where you may have been going with your question in select Sysco Your Way neighborhoods. We're actually having to split them apart and create two neighborhoods within a geography. In some, we've actually had to split into three neighborhoods. And yes, there is headcount dedication that will occur in that regard. And some of the new headcount that we're hiring this year will in fact be deployed to those neighborhoods.
John Heinbockel: Great. And then one last thing. Can you remind us, you think about the national business, right, so your share of wallet is very high, correct. Maybe speak to is there any opportunity there? And then secondly, I think your share of the national business, right, your overall shares 17%, I think your national share is higher than that. When you think about the upside, right, to national share, where can that go?
Kevin Hourican: On the national side, I'll start with the answer to your question. Then I'll toss to Kenny if he has anything else that he would like to say. Our share count with an existing national customer is very high. For many of them, it's 100%. The opportunity for profit improvement with those accounts are things like penetrate further with Sysco brand. Sysco brand under penetrates with national brand customers versus local customers. But we're making progress on that. Now we're lining up our chief merchant with the chief purchasing officer for those top customers and where can we win together? Where can we partner, move a product over to Sysco brand, share in some of those savings with that national brand customer so that we win together? Other examples would be dropped size incentives. How can we do things in a win-win nature with those customers where if we can be more efficient through a decision that they make, we can share in some of the savings created from that efficiency improvement? Again, just back to why are we winning in national sales? If the contract is not win-win, it's short lift. We need to have contracts that are win for us, win for them, structure the contract that way and then these great sustainable, long-term partnerships. Reminder, these contracts are three to five years in nature. And our retention rate for our national sales customers is extremely high, in large part because we're doing an even better job of having that win-win contract provision where again where we can be more efficient, we will share in some of those savings with that partner. That helps them be more profitable, it helps Sysco be more profitable as well. With that rigorous, disciplined ROIC lens that Kenny mentioned, he mentioned it in SYGMA, we had a customer not to be named that wasn't willing to actually have a contract that was win-win. We walked away. We're more profitable because of it. We're not growing for the sake of growing. We're finding the right partners in national across restaurants, healthcare, education and hospitality. We're focusing on how we serve them better. And we're having a lot of success with that. Kenny, I'll toss to you for any additional comment you'd like to make.
Kenny Cheung: Yes, you covered it well, Kevin. The only couple of things I'd say is that you're right, John. The share of wallet can grow the most profitable cases, the extra case on the truck, if that's one piece. And the other piece, as I mentioned earlier, national growth, we’re watching very carefully. We're doing very well. But for us, it's all about sustainable, profitable growth.
John Heinbockel: Okay. Thank you.
Kevin Hourican: Thank you, John.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Kendall Toscano with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Kendall Toscano: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. One thing I just wanted to clarify was whether margin expansion for Sysco in fiscal '24 should be primarily driven by gross margin expansion or operating expense leverage. It looks like in the first quarter you saw pretty impressive gross margin expansion while operating expenses were flat as a percent of sales, which was kind of the opposite of how The Street was modeling it. So just any help on how to think about that going forward for the year would be really helpful. Thanks.
Kenny Cheung: Yes. So without going to actual numbers, the way that I would model and think about this, we should drive bottom line accretion through both on the GP side and the operating expense side. And what does that mean? If you look at Q1, as I mentioned earlier, Q1 gross profit growth rate was actually higher than sales, meaning the work that we've done around call it the strategic sourcing, Sysco brand penetration, proper mix of our business that will drive accretion between your sales and your GP line. In terms of operating expense at the low GP, you have two things working in favor for us. One is the continuation of supply chain productivity, as Kevin described earlier. This is tied to productivity. This is tied to better retention for our employees. We try to better productivity yield on the warehouse side and delivery side. And this also dovetails nicely into the productivity work that we've done on the corporate side, which is $100 million I referenced earlier. As I mentioned, we're not stopping there. So to answer your question directly, it is both the GP line and the operation expense line.
Kevin Hourican: Yes, I just want to add one thing. I 100% agree with what Kenny just said. I think the rate of inflation in sales a year ago is causing a little bit of perhaps year-over-year compare challenges because when I look at the actual core drivers, our transportation costs per piece year-over-year improved. Our warehouse costs per year-over-year improved. Maintenance costs year-over-year improved. Shrink improved, retention improved. These are the drivers that actually impact cost per piece and those metrics in our core U.S. business, all of them improved year-over-year. And we're not yet back to 2019. There's actual continued additional progress that can be made that will be made. We've built that into our guide for the year. And we are very focused as a leadership team on continuing to make those improvements.
Kendall Toscano: Great. That's really helpful. Thank you.
Kevin Hourican: Kendall, thank you.
Kenny Cheung: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We have reached our allotted time for questions. I will now turn the program back over to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks.
Kevin Hourican: Great. Thank you all for joining us. Please feel free to reach out to the Investor Relations group if you have any follow-up calls. Thank you.
Operator: This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at anytime.

===== 2023 Q4  (2023-08-01 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to Sysco's Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. We will begin with opening remarks and introductions. I would now like to turn the call over to Kevin Kim, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Kevin Kim: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Sysco's fourth quarter fiscal year 2023 earnings call. On today's call, we have Kevin Hourican, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Kenny Cheung, our Chief Financial Officer; and Neil Russell, our Chief Administrative Officer. Before we begin, please note that statements made during this presentation that state the company's or management's intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, and actual results could differ in a material manner. Additional information about factors that could cause results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's SEC filings. This includes, but is not limited to, risk factors contained in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 2, 2022, subsequent SEC filings and the news release issued earlier this morning. A copy of these materials can be found in the Investors section at sysco.com. Non-GAAP financial measures are included in our comments today and in our presentation slides. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures is included at the end of the presentation slides and can also be found in the Investors section of our website. During the discussion today, unless otherwise stated, all results are compared to the same quarter in the prior year. To ensure we have sufficient time to answer all questions, we'd like to ask each participant to limit their time today to one question and one follow-up. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Hourican.
Kevin Hourican: Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. I would like to cover three topics during my section of our call. First, I'll provide a summary of our Q4 results and our full-year performance. Second, I'll convey an update on our Recipe for Growth strategy. And lastly, I'll provide some commentary on the macro condition which we have modeled for fiscal '24 and how Sysco intends to operate within that environment. Kenny will provide much more detailed components of guidance during his section. So, let's get started. We are pleased with the strong finish to the fiscal year. Sysco posted record top-line and bottom-line results during the fourth quarter. Top-line results, as seen on Slide 5, were up 4.1% compared to last year, delivering $19.7 billion in sales. The strong quarter generated a full-year sales results of $76.3 billion, a record at Sysco. We grew annual sales by 12.5% or $8.6 billion on a constant-currency basis. That sales growth is the equivalent of creating a net new Fortune 500 company within Sysco. Turning to volumes. Q4 case volume grew 2.3% and local case volume grew 0.8% across our U.S. Foodservice business, successfully growing our market share in furthering our number one position in foodservice distribution. We are pleased with our share gains for the quarter in the year which build on meaningful gains delivered within fiscal year '22. Importantly, these gains are profitable share gains. We are not growing for the sake of growing as we have consistently pursued profitable sales growth vectors, domestically and internationally. Moving to gross profit. Our sales and merchandising teams delivered a strong quarter from a GP growth perspective. We grew gross margin rates and GP dollars per case, which is not easy to do in a disinflationary environment. Our teams are doing excellent work in strategic sourcing to reduce COGS and further penetrating Sysco brand cases with our customers. Advancing Sysco brand helps gross profit and leads to increased customer retention. Lastly, we are growing our higher-margin specialty business, which strengthens our overall margin profile. Next, in the P&L is operating expense. I am most proud of the quarter from the perspective of the progress that we're making in reducing our expenses. We have been clear with investors that our first half of the year in fiscal '23 had elevated expenses. This was driven by two factors: Investments in our business and a supply chain struggling with new colleagues productivity. In the second half of fiscal '23, we made major progress on our expense ratios and greatly accelerated productivity improvement within our supply chain. Retention of colleagues has improved, productivity of our colleagues has improved, and our supply chain initiatives are bearing fruit. All told, we delivered an operating leverage of 370 basis points in Q4, growing GP dollars meaningfully more than expenses. Slide 7 highlights the sequential improvement with OpEx over the course of the last fiscal year. We began the year in our U.S. Foodservice segment with quarterly operating expense growing over 22%, but ended the year with a growth rate of 0.5%. Our focused effort to deliver supply chain efficiencies and broad-based cost reductions drove the sequential improvement across the year. We expect to make further operating expense progress in 2024. We will be zealot-like focused on ensuring our supply chain is properly staffed, properly trained, and working safely and productively. We have the leadership expertise, supply chain tools, and supply chain infrastructure to lead the industry in this regard, which is one reason why Sysco operates at an EBIT margin over 1.5 times higher than our industry distributor average. Record top-line and record bottom-line performance in Q4 is a direct result of our Recipe for Growth and our focus on excellence in execution in operations. The improvement from first half to second half within fiscal '23 was notable, enabling Sysco to grow EPS more than 23% for the full year. In addition to delivering a strong P&L in Q4, we achieved a record free cash flow and we returned approximately $1.5 billion back to shareholders during the year. We are pleased with the strong financial performance in the quarter despite rapid disinflation and slower overall industry market volume growth. We believe our success, in spite of those conditions, positions the business to be successful in 2024, which I will speak to more in a moment. As is my custom, I'd like to provide a brief summary of select Recipe for Growth elements of our strategy from our recent quarter. I will start within our supply chain initiative. Our work on strengthening engineered labor standards across our supply chain is paying dividends. As I mentioned a moment ago, we made significant headway in improving our supply chain efficiency. We have recently strengthened our work method standards training within transportation roles, enabling our colleagues to work safely and work more productively. Additionally, we've increased retention rates within our workforce through our improved training programs. The driver academy is national, and the impact of this program is a better trained workforce. Now, I would like to highlight the progress that we've made on the food sales and marketing side of our Recipe for Growth. Last month, we announced an agreement to purchase BIX Produce. BIX Produce is a leading produce specialty distributor based in Minnesota. The acquisition is expected to provide a strategic opportunity for FreshPoint to expand its geographic footprint in an area of the country where it does not currently have operations. BIX has a strong assortment offering including fresh-cut produce, grab-and-go sandwiches, and value-added production capabilities. In addition to our good work in expanding specialty, we also upgraded our digital shopping platform during the quarter. Our Shop digital platform is now available in Spanish, and we have deployed more than 100 new feature enhancements. Some of these enhancements include a new homepage, new category and cuisine pages, improved search and navigation, and lastly, a new Deals For You page. These enhancements have driven an increase in product page visits at an incremental volume through add-to-cart purchasing. There is no finish line in our digital improvement journey. We will continue to improve our digital tools over time, enabling us to reduce friction in the purchase experience and inspire our customers to buy more from Sysco. Our centralized pricing tool has given us the ability to be, what we call, right on price at the region, customer, and item level. During the first half of '23, we experienced rapid inflation. And in the second half of '23, we experienced rapid disinflation and even deflation towards the end of Q4 within our core USBL business. Our merchants have been biting to secure best possible cost, and our pricing tool ensures that the real-time cost fluctuations are built into our pricing strategies. Managing pricing across hundreds of thousands of customers, tens of thousands of products and approximately 7,500 sales reps has never been stronger. This is evidenced by our consistently strong performance in GP dollars growth and adjusted gross margin rate growth of 28 basis points year-over-year in the quarter. We want our sales reps focused on customer engagement, relationship building, consultative selling and solving problems for our customers. Our pricing tool enables our SDs to spend more time on those value-added activities. Lastly, Sysco Your Way is now live in over 400 neighborhoods across five countries, and our loyalty program Perks is active with over 12,000 customers. Both programs are continuing to deliver compelling top- and bottom-line growth. The past year has been a heavy-lift as we work to get these programs off the ground. In 2024, we can focus on maximizing the impact of these compelling programs with less effort and investment required than in 2023. In summary, our Recipe for Growth is working, enabling Sysco to profitably grow our business and differentiate versus others in our space. Most compelling is that food away from home is a growth sector, as seen on Slides 10 and 11. Sysco has been profitably growing faster than the overall market, delivering record top- and bottom-line results. We expect to continue to win market share profitably in the years to come, and to do so in a fiscally responsible way. I'd like to wrap-up my time this morning with some comments about the operating environment we expect for fiscal '24 and Sysco's positioning within that environment. My main message is that scale matters in this industry and that strong operators are best-positioned to succeed, regardless of the environmental conditions. Sysco is a very strong operator with meaningful scale advantages. With that said, in fiscal '24, we expect the market to grow at a lower rate than '23. We also expect the rate of inflation for the year to be below historical standards. In the second half of fiscal '23, we experienced rapid disinflation followed by deflation within our core U.S. Broadline business towards the end of the fourth quarter. We expect that deflation will continue within U.S. Broadline for the first half of fiscal '24, followed by muted U.S. Broadline product inflation in the second half. We expect that our International segment will remain inflationary during the coming fiscal year given unique marketplace conditions in those geographies. Net-net for Sysco, we expect an inflation rate that is slightly positive throughout fiscal 2024, below our historical average. We believe the Q4 environment, we just exited, is largely reflective of the operating environment for the coming year. Importantly, we grew our top- and bottom-line within that quarter. We're being very prudent in fiscal '24 in managing our expenses given the volume and inflation components that I just conveyed. Despite these conditions, Sysco is positioned to succeed, grow faster than the market and deliver bottom-line growth. Our confidence is also based on our structural competitive advantages. First, our International business, which is approximately 18% of sales, continues to outperform, providing a natural hedge as international inflation rates remained elevated and are expected to stay higher than the U.S. Second, our purchasing scale is the largest in the industry. And our strategic sourcing efforts will enable Sysco to secure improved pricing in a deflationary environment. Third, Sysco has a diversified business with strong sales across 12 major product categories to help buffer the impact of inflation or deflation in any one category. Additionally, our strategic pricing software will enable Sysco to be extremely purposeful on how we manage the impact of disinflation and deflation. Lastly, further advancing Sysco Brand penetration, domestically and internationally, is another lever to pull to deliver GP dollar growth when the environment is deflationary. The exit velocity of fiscal '23 gives us confidence in delivering strong results in 2024. In summary, here is what we expect for '24. Lower rates of overall market volume growth versus '23, continued market share gains and profitable growth at Sysco, deflation in the U.S. for at least the first half of the year, and muted overall company-wide inflation for the full year. Disciplined expense management. Kenny and I have directed an effort to reduce structural expenses by approximately $100 million, extremely disciplined return on invested capital for ROIC focus, continued progress in advancing Sysco Brand penetration and growth within specialty. In total, given all these inter-working variables, we are modeling an adjusted EPS range of $4.20 to $4.40 for the full year. The midpoint of that guide would generate approximately 7% EPS growth versus fiscal '23. Now, on our third year of Recipe for Growth, we are positioned to press the accelerator on certain proven initiatives. For example, we can optimize our performance and launch Sysco Your Way neighborhoods, which takes less effort in starting up a neighborhood. Our digital tools are becoming more and more pervasive with our customers, and we can optimize the personalization of these interactions to increase yield through each transaction. We have always said that the Recipe for Growth is a wheel where each initiative fuels the next. Fiscal '24 is a year of optimizing what we have launched versus kicking off net new efforts. This will enable Sysco to be laser-focused on what matters most, executing with excellence against launched programs. This also means we will be able to grow our business with less investment. This was always our plan within the Recipe for Growth and it is coming to reality in fiscal '24. In addition, our expanded geography of specialty businesses, like the recently-announced BIX acquisition, will increase the impact of our higher growth specialty segment. In fiscal '24, we are committed to both profitably growing our top-line, meaningfully reducing OpEx and generating a higher rate of return on key initiatives. Given the confidence that we have in our long-range roadmap, we are happy to announce that we have reintroduced ROIC as a long-term compensation metric for our leadership team. In addition, we have increased the weighting of financial metrics within our short-term annual bonus program. As I've said many times before, the best companies in the world are growth companies, and we expect that Sysco will continue to profitably grow faster than the overall market. I am thrilled to have Kenny as my partner on these objectives. We are committed to maximizing every dollar invested in producing the greatest shareholder value. I'll now turn it over to Kenny, who will provide additional financial details. Kenny, over to you.
Kenny Cheung: Thank you, Kevin. And good morning, everyone. I would like to start-off by thanking our customers, colleagues, and partners around the world for helping us deliver another record quarter. Sysco operates a high-volume business, and I'm proud of our efficient response in servicing, delighting our customers. We closed out the fiscal year strong, delivering improvement across the income statement, balance sheet and cash flow. Q4 financials reflect positive sales and volume growth and operating expense leverage. Altogether, these rendered a record quarter of operating income, net income, and adjusted EPS. Our results also reflect improvements in operational efficiency to productivity and resource optimization. This elevated performance will enable us to reinvest back into the business and return excess cash back to shareholders, an important theme we expect for FY '24 and beyond. Our unique value proposition with the Recipe for Growth at the forefront is what differentiates us as a growth company. As Kevin stated earlier, we will continue to focus on accelerating programs that have high returns, which is a key priority and my role here at Sysco. Now turning to a summary of our reported results for the quarter starting on Slide 14. For the fourth quarter, our enterprise sales grew 4.1%, with U.S. Foodservice growing 2.5%, International growing 12.2%, and SYGMA growing 1.4%. With respect to volume, total U.S. Foodservice volume increased 2.3% and local volume increased 0.8%. We produced $3.7 billion in gross profit, up 7% versus prior year. Adjusted gross margin improved to 18.7%, a sequential increase from the prior quarter and an increase of 28 bps compared to last year. Our gross profit dollar and margin percentage improvement during the fourth quarter reflected our ability to continue to effectively manage product inflation which moderated at 2.1% for the total enterprise, consistent with our expectations. The improvement in gross profit was driven by incremental progress from our strategic sourcing efforts as well as improved penetration rates from Sysco Brand products, which increased by 11 bps to 37.2% in U.S. Broadline and 64 bps to 47.3% in U.S. Local results. Overall, adjusted operating expenses were $2.7 billion for the quarter, or 13.5% of sales, a 29 bps improvement from the prior year. All four operating segments continue to show increases in quarterly profitability, including substantial growth in the International and SYGMA segments. As seen on Slide 22 and 23, Q4 adjusted operating income of $1 billion for the enterprise showed a strong exit rate, growing 25% compared to FY '19. This is the highest adjusted operating income quarter in Sysco's history, and is now the fourth consecutive period of record quarterly operating income. For the year, adjusted operating income increased to $3.2 billion, growing 17.3% compared to our prior FY '19 record, an important signal of the progress being made at Sysco. For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA increased to $1.2 billion, growing 14.4%. We are thrilled with the progress of our International segment with adjusted operating income growing 58% for the fourth quarter. As stated earlier, our International business continues to deliver robust growth with positive momentum. I'm also particularly pleased with the health of our balance sheet, which further strengthened this quarter. We delivered on our target leverage ratio, another important milestone as we ended the year at 2.5 times net-debt leverage ratio. This is within our target of 2.5 times to 2.75 times, a substantial improvement from 5.1 times just over two years ago. We ended the year with $9.7 billion net-debt with total liquidity of $3.7 billion and no commercial paper outstanding. Our debt is well-laddered without any maturities over $1 billion until FY '27. Turning to our cash flow, we generated $2.9 billion in operating cash flow and $2.1 billion in free cash flow, which was a new record. Our conversion rate from adjusted EBITDA to free cash flow was 55% and operating cash flow conversion of 75% shows the company's robust earnings power. Our strong financial position enabled us to return $1.5 billion to shareholders. This was done through $500 million of share repurchases and $996 million of dividends. Despite the changing macroeconomic landscape, we are positioned to grow both top-line and bottom-line results in FY '24 in the long term. The guidance we're providing is reflective of the traction our Recipe for Growth initiatives are gaining, in addition to moderate industry growth rates. Furthermore, we believe our Q4 performance provides significant proof of our ability to drive shareholder value, as several of these macroeconomic and industry dynamics are expected to continue into FY '24. As Kevin highlighted on Slide 7, we began the year with elevated levels of operating expense growth. As a result, operating expenses were an area of focus for our supply chain teams throughout the year and we were able to produce sequential improvements. We ended the year with significant operating expense leverage, allowing us to improve margins. This is important progress, and we expect continued improvements going into FY '24. Let's now turn to look-forward. During FY '24, we expect top-line growth of mid-single-digits and positive volume growth, which will move Sysco to approximately $80 billion in annual sales. This will be another record for Sysco. Importantly, we expect inflation to be slightly positive on an enterprise basis for the full year. Based on our analysis and the exit rate from the fourth quarter, we believe that first half globally will be slightly positive and the second half will step-up. This includes continued deflation in U.S. Broadline during the first half of the fiscal year with an expected rebound in the second half of the fiscal year. Based on our structural advantages, Sysco is well-positioned to manage our COGS effectively and continue to pass along pricing without impacting demand. It is all about better buying and better selling. Turning to expenses. We expect further improvements in operating expense leverage based on a continuation of the process improvement from this past year. One month into the new year, we've already executed actions to support $100 million of cost-outs where it has been factored into the guidance. We will continue finding incremental opportunities to enhance operational efficiency and adapt swiftly to the constant evolving business environment in which we function. We will manage our business with discipline and agility. We have modeled out front-line operations wage growth to be approximately 4.5% to 5%. This is higher than our historical average, but much lower than select other industry news due to the fact that in many instances, our supply chain colleagues are paid above-market and our drivers can earn as much as $100,000 per year. We also expect free cash flow to grow further in FY '24, on top of a record performance in FY '23. We wanted to also provide guidance on several other important modeling elements. The tax rate for FY '24 is expected to step up to approximately 24.5% compared to 23% in FY '23. The increase is driven by geographical mix related to strong International growth and increases in state tax rates. We plan to remain in line with our net-debt leverage ratio for the year. Related interest expense is expected to step up by about $13 million for the year due to cash uses for growth investments, dividend payments, share repurchases, and anticipated M&A activity. Other expenses is expected to be approximately $30 million for the year, driven primarily by pension expense. All in, we are guiding to adjusted EPS for FY '24 at $4.20 to $4.40. This reflects adjusted EPS growth of approximately 5% to 10%. Our capital allocation strategy will continue to focus on investing in the business. Examples include M&A, maintaining our strong investment grade credit rating, and continuing our return of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. CapEx should be consistent with prior year at approximately 1% of sales. Returning cash back to shareholders is important as is our dividend aristocrat status, and we plan to step up these efforts at the coming year. In FY '24, we will have a $0.04 dividend increase and we expect to complete approximately $750 million of share repurchases as we start the fiscal year with $4 billion and remaining authorization. Depending on the volume of M&A done in FY '24, we could increase share repurchases further, while continuing to operate within our stated goal of 2.5 times to 2.75 times leverage. We will look at each investment through the lens of driving growth and ROIC, and I am pleased to state that our ROIC for FY '24 is expected to surpass our pre-COVID levels through sales growth, margin expansion, and prudent management of the balance sheet. As a company, ROIC will dynamically guide our operating and investment decisions, which will accrete shareholder value over time as we continue to focus on both margin dollars and percentage growth. Now in my role for a few months, I am constantly impressed by the size and scale advantages at Sysco. This is a high-volume business that runs fast, and any micro adjustments around operational efficiencies are felt quickly. Our scale advantages are also reflected in our industry-leading margins, our diversification as the industry-leader across customer types with two-third in restaurants and one-third in recession-resistant category such as education and healthcare is also a structural advantage. Our robust industry-leading operating cash flow and strong investment-grade rated balance sheet gives us access to capital at attractive rates, so we're able to take advantage of opportunities as they present themselves. As you can see in our performance results, our International segment is proving to be an advantage contributing higher rates of growth than much of our U.S. business, and the inflation dynamics in other geographies are helping create a bit of a natural hedge across our business portfolio. We believe that International continues to be a profitable growth engine for Sysco. I'm even more excited 90 days into this role that I was on day one, and I look forward to our progress ahead. With that, I will turn the call back over to Kevin for closing remarks.
Kevin Hourican: Thank you, Kenny. As we conclude, I would like to provide a brief summary on Slide 28. Sysco has a strong record of generating consistent results. In fact, Sysco has grown annual sales in 51 years out of our 54-year history. We expect our positive momentum to continue in 2024. In addition to compelling top-line growth, Sysco is the industry-leader from an adjusted EBITDA margin perspective with the strongest balance sheet. We plan to build on that position of strength in fiscal year 2024. We ended our fiscal year 2023 with strong sales, volume, and share growth, growing volumes across both our chain and independent business. The result was a 23% adjusted EPS growth for the year with record top- and bottom-line contribution. We have momentum going into the year, as our Recipe for Growth transformation, now in its third year, is further building upon and enhancing our competitive scale advantages. Importantly, we have demonstrated our third consecutive quarter of operating leverage with gross profits outpacing operating expense growth. For fiscal year '24, our dual focus on core efficiency measures and optimization from proven growth opportunities will deliver another year of top- and bottom-line growth. There are bright days ahead for the food away from home industry and, more specifically, Sysco. I am both excited and proud to be a part of the journey. And as always, I want to thank our 72,000-plus Sysco colleagues for their commitment to our customers and our shareholders. Operator, you can now open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Edward Kelly at Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Edward Kelly: Hi, guys. Good morning. Kevin, so my question is on the guidance. I mean obviously the backdrop for the industry, it's a little bit tougher than what it would normally be, and providing guidance in that backdrop is not easy, 5% to 10% earnings growth against that is certainly respectable. But can you talk about the confidence in that level of growth, the cadence that we could be expecting? And if you were to be at the bottom-end of the range, what would drive that? And if you were at the better end of the range, what would cause that outcome?
Kevin Hourican: Hi, good morning, Ed. This is Kevin. I'll start, and I'll toss to Kenny for additional comments. I guess, I'd start with a few points. The guide is based on a continuation of momentum that the company has been building over the past six months, most notably tied to our operating expense improvements. We call our planning process, three big boulders. Volume of the market, inflation, projections of the market and then our expense ratios. And we've worked very hard to make sure that we can do the best job possible in guiding what these individual three components will be. So, let's start with volume. As I said in my prepared remarks, we do expect for the volume growth of the industry to be more muted this coming year. We have factored that in to our guide. We've triangulated that from supplier partners, from economists, from bankers and our own data. We have a treasure trove of data across all of the different business segments that we serve. So, we do expect for volume growth of the market to be more muted. With that said, we're confident that we, Sysco, can grow faster than the market and we are committed to doing so profitably. Topic two is inflation or deflation as it is, as it were. And we have to break that down into individual businesses in individual countries. As I said in my prepared remarks, USBL we expect to be deflationary for at least the first half of the year. We do have a natural hedge at Sysco, given the fact that we have an International segment that is still experiencing inflation due to unique geography considerations and purchasing considerations within those countries. So, when you put that altogether for the year, I'll use that same term a second time. We expect for muted inflation for the entire year that's below our historical standards. On the positive side, continued logistics efficiency. A chart in our slide that we're really pleased with is Page 7 in our slides that are out there. The progress that was sequentially made throughout the year quarter-over-quarter on improving our logistics efficiency, we expect to continue. There's some important below-the-line things in the guide that Kenny can talk to, about tax and interest. To answer your question on confidence, Ed, I'll end with Q4, the environment that we've just exited in most notably June, we believe to be reasonably consistent with what we expect the overall environmental conditions to be in fiscal '24, and we had a solid performance ending the year and a solid performance in June. So, when I put all those things together, that's why the guide, what would have to be true to be at the top-end, continued performance on operating cost efficiency improvement, accelerate our growth versus the market. Those would be the two things directly within our control, that could enable us to be at the top. For us to be at the bottom-end of that range would be, I'd say, if deflation lasted longer or persisted longer or we're deeper than had been modeled, that would be a headwind that would put it more towards the bottom-end of the range. So, we focus on what we can control at Sysco. We're going to drive operating efficiency. Kenny and I, as announced today, have issued $100 million cost-out improvement which is baked into the guidance that we just provided, and we've actually executed already against the major components of that plan, and we've got our sales teams focused on driving profitable sales growth. With that, I'm going to toss to Kenny for any additional comment.
Kenny Cheung: Thank you, Kevin. I'll talk about two things. One, the confidence level around the guidance. And second, as Kevin alluded to, a couple of below-the-line items that I think needs a bit more color. But first is around the confidence in the guidance. Our confidence in the guidance is based on how we successfully managed Q4. So, if you think about Q4, we ended the quarter deflationary in the U.S., and with that, we still managed to expand GP margins by 28 bps and operating margin by 56 bps. So again, we're doing it right now. The second piece I would say is that, if the environment were to change, we have the agility to flex up and down, given the fact that we have a world-class balance sheet and we have a very agile cost structure, and we have productivity in place, the $100 million that has already been executed and baked-in, in our guidance. So, that is around the confidence of the guidance. In terms of the below-the-line items, there are two areas I want to go a bit deeper on. One is tax rates. We expect our tax rate to step up from 23% to 24.5%. There's two pieces to the tax side. First, we are seeing earnings strengthening across our international markets, which is yielding a higher tax charge. This is a good thing. We are seeing our international arm growing fast. The second piece is, here in the U.S., we are expecting a higher state tax expense due to various factors including the mix of earnings across the state. This is our current view. We are continuing to evaluate tax planning strategies, and we'll report back as appropriate. The second piece is around interest expense. Overall, the rate has risen. And we also plan to raise capital to deploy against high-returning accretive initiatives, which includes growth investments, M&A, return excess cash to shareholders. This is driving the higher interest expense. Again, $13 million increase year-over-year. The last bucket is other expenses. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we expect it to be roughly $30 million related to pension expense.
Edward Kelly: Thanks guys.
Kevin Hourican: Thanks Ed.
Operator: Your next question will come from Joshua Long at Stephens Inc. Please go ahead.
Joshua Long: Great. Thank you. Hopefully, you might be able to dig into some of the underlying core customer segments. Obviously, we were able to see some of the case volume trends there that you provided in the release and that's helpful. And just curious if you could tie that together, Kevin, with some of your higher-level thoughts on where the consumer is at, how they're choosing to spend their dollars. and maybe how that corresponds with your customer makeup, as we think about the fiscal 2024 guidance?
Kevin Hourican: Hi, Joshua. Thank you for the question. I'll start just at the more aggregate level. As you know, we serve every segment of the food away from home industry, which is what I meant when I answered to Ed's question about, we have a treasure trove of data. We can see macro trends. So, our national sales team had a banner year this past year, that's on top of a banner year in 2022, I want to be very clear that those growth constructs are profitable growths at healthcare, education, and travel, hospitality business and industry, there sectors have been continuing to see a tailwind of recovery and we are winning market share profitably in those sectors. National restaurants, we are winning large in that regard as well, mostly because those partners view Sysco as a backbone for them. We're in every state including Alaska and Hawaii, not every food distributor is, and it's an easy button for them to be able to partner with someone like Sysco because we can distribute coast-to-coast, and many of these restaurants have international doors into our international freight group business, we can export their product overseas to usually a licensee partner that they use in those countries. So, again, for these national restaurant chains, we are a very attractive option for them, and we've been winning big. Those contracts are multi-year contracts, and as I've mentioned, we've been signing those contracts at above historical profit margin rates. On the local side, we've been winning in specialty as I mentioned, the BIX produce acquisition intent today, that will be a tailwind for us in fiscal 2024. We're winning with our Italian segment and we're winning market share in aggregate as a company. So, when I think about the end-consumer, the rapid rate of inflation increase this past year put a strain on the American consumer, specifically beef at one point was 35 plus percent inflationary, you saw portion sizes being reduced at menus, you saw menu price increases. And I do think that had an impact on particularly the independent sector. And as I think about the future, the deflation that we're currently experiencing and the return to eventually what we would say would be normal rates of inflation, which are 2% to 3%, will be good for the end-consumer. So, when I talk about our teams internally, I think about a graph chart where inflation was well-above healthy, now we're dealing with disinflation into deflation, and now that curve is going to come back to normal over the next period of time. And as we're thinking about fiscal '25, you would see more normal rates of inflation and that should drive a tailwind in volume, and those two things together for 2025 would be favorable elements for Sysco. So, how are we thinking about this to help our customers? As Kenny said, well, we're going to work our tails off to have best-possible purchasing economics, so that we can share in value with our consumers things like discounts on appetizers, so that in fact that can be added to the purchase, because when that center of plate cost goes up, what we tend to see is dessert and app purchases go down, and we want to help our end-consumers and customers be successful by providing them with strong and compelling value through Sysco.
Joshua Long: That's helpful. Thank you. And then one follow-up, if I could. When we think about the $100 million cost-outs, that comes on the heels of some other great work over the last year or two, coming out of COVID, curious if you could, can you dimensionalize that $100 million a little bit more, maybe not getting into the specifics of it but just the visibility you have into maybe the timing or the realization of those, is that relatively balanced across the year, do you have - do we think about this in terms of just maybe second or third round iterations of initiatives that you've had more experience with in the past and just as you have more time you found new wins there, are these entirely new categories? Just any additional commentary you can provide there, as we think about the ability to drive margins and pull cost out of the system would be very helpful.
Kenny Cheung: Thanks, Josh. It's Kenny. I'll say a couple of things, and I'll go bit more detail. So, for us, it's all about driving operating leverage in our business. And what does that mean? That means our GP growth will be faster than expense growth, our EBITDA will be faster than sales, operating leverage on our business. As it relates to the $100 million, to your question directly, yes it will be more balanced across the year and why is that? Because we've started already, right? It started on day one. So, we -- all the actions have already been executing, meaningfully baked into our guidance, and all actions are underway. That's point number one. Point number two, this is incremental to the continued productivity gains and supply chain operations and efficiency that Kevin described earlier. The last thing I would say is that we're not stopping, right? We will continue to flex in line with market conditions. Now, I know, you asked for a bit more detail. Let me give you a tangible example. There are multiple parts to the $100 million. So, let me give you an example. We've been able to expand our global share -- shared support center, GSE, into other markets, most recently in Costa Rica. I was there about a month ago. Well, we have accessed a great talent and to further build our scale advantage. So, as our business grows, we're able to leverage a platform that scales accretively and effectively for earnings.
Joshua Long: Thank you.
Kevin Hourican: Thanks, Josh.
Operator: Your next question will come from John Heinbockel at Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.
John Heinbockel: So, Kevin, two topics. I'll hit them both upfront. So, number one, maybe update on wallet share, right. You talked about that in the past. Where is that opportunity today and obviously, if you drive drop size right, and that's the most efficient thing you can do. So, where is that? And then two, I think, you're overtime is down to zero. So, volumes were a little lighter. What lever do you now pull on, right, because, I don't think you guys want to or you don't want to furlough folks. Where do you go next if overtime is at zero?
Kevin Hourican: Yes. Thanks, John. I'll do the second question first and then your first question second. I want to be crystal-clear on what we meant by overtime at zero. It's excess overtime was taken to zero. So, the industry runs at a -- let's call it an average rate of overtime because some overtime is good, our employees desire some amount of overtime. Your truck that leaves the warehouse and doesn't get back for 12 hours because that's the nature of the route, there's going to be some overtime, et cetera. So, what we meant by that is that excess overtime enduring the worst of the supply chain disruption, we had meaningful, meaningful excess overtime. So, we feel really good about that. Where can additional efficiencies come from? Retention improvement jump. So, our turnover has dramatically improved, and it can still further improve to get back to historical levels of retention. And if you ask me six months ago, what's the single most important thing that we need to do more effectively? It was improved retention because that flows through in many different ways: Lower hiring costs, lower training costs, higher productivity because a two-year veteran is much more productive than a two-day newbie. They're also safer, fewer accidents occur, because they're trained and know how to do their job. So, retention improvement would be the number one lever. But the second lever is just improving discipline to what we call Sysco's work standards. The Driver Academy, we have a Selector Academy and our engineered labor standards keep getting better and stronger. We improve processes through leveraging technology, and that's the next wave of productivity improvement is to have better discipline to a standard work process. So, we still have opportunity to improve. I'm really pleased, most particularly pleased with the improvement we've made in supply chain. And we have factored continued improvement into our 2024 guidance. On the wallet share side of the business, I guess what excites me the most on our opportunity, and we're not going to quote a share of wallet percentage today, but Sysco Your Way and Perks are doing what we want and need for them to do, which is further penetrating additional categories of merchandise with existing customers. The Sysco Your Way model is through increased delivery frequency, a dedicated sales rep, a dedicated delivery driver and our consistent presence in that neighborhood, six days a week, with an afternoon recovery delivery. We are seeing what we would expect to see which is customers in those neighborhoods are adding specialty to the basket, eliminating another distributor from the purchase consideration and rolling up more with us. And Perks essentially does the same thing. But it's for a customer who happens not to be within a Sysco Your Way neighborhood. They could be 45 miles from the warehouse, but not within a current Sysco Your Way neighborhood. And by providing them with the service capabilities and dedicated marketing support, we're seeing incremental purchases. Last, but not least, is specialty. We're doing a really good job in our SSMG, which is our meat business and our produce business, and now we have our next 10-year old specialty business with Italian. When we put those specialty businesses together, we're making a lot of progress on what we call total team selling, which is bringing that specialist into the account along with the generalist, the SD generalist and we're moving the needle on what we call total team selling. So, it's those three things together, John, that are helping us with share of wallet, which as you said is the most profitable case we can put on the truck.
John Heinbockel: Okay, thank you.
Kevin Hourican: Thanks, John.
Operator: Your next question will come from Kelly Bania at BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Kelly Bania: Good morning. Thanks for taking our question. I was wondering if we could talk a little bit more about the centralized pricing tool and the price optimization work that you've been doing, as particularly as we do transition here, it sounds like into some deflation for certain category. And just how investors should think about modeling your gross margin, as we move forward given kind of not much disclosure at this point on how much of your business on a percentage markup versus a dollar markup or how this centralized pricing tool can change that? And maybe, included in that, can you just give us a little color on how the deflation that you're seeing right now is impacting the gross profit dollars?
Kevin Hourican: Okay, Kelly. Thank you for the question. I'll start just with how we leverage the pricing tool, and then I'll toss to Kenny in regards to your questions on GP dollars and percent and he'll handle that, and whatever matter he deems appropriate on the tool. This was what I tried to articulate during our prepared remarks. During a period of rapid inflation, it was extraordinarily helpful because we had discipline in regards to passing through what was an extraordinary increase in cost, especially in center of plate. I mean, we had proteins going up 35%, as I mentioned a few moments ago. In the older manual world, it would have been unlikely that all 7,500 sales consultants would have passed that through, they would have put too much of a humanistic flare into it and said, you know what, I just know that they can absorb this and I'm not going to pass it through, and we would have not actually seen the GP dollars per case growth that we experienced past year. So, I'm going to call it the discipline to perform within guardrails on the way up. Well, the exact same thing happens on the way down, but it's a different consideration. What I said on the prepared remarks is we'll be very purposeful about when we are able to secure improved COGS, how we passed that value on to our customers. Our intention is to pass that volume on to our customers. And we need to be thoughtful, disciplined, and pragmatic about how we do that. We have to be competitive with the market and we have to understand the volatility of categories that went from 30% up to double-digits down in a short period of time. So, the tool will provide structure and discipline in a performance within guardrails. I do want to be very clear about one point. It does not replace the importance of an SD in that relationship they have at that local restaurant in being what I call again, right on price at the local level. And if we have a competitive pressure at the local level, our SDs have a process they can follow, to ask for an exception, and we have a RevMan team that manages and adjudicates those decisions with financial discipline. So, it's a combination of two things. It's a tool that provides guardrails that we operate within with discipline and predictability. And then, we have the ability to respond at the local level through the sales force when, in fact, something unique is happening that the system can't see through data. And we're going to get better and better at that second point. We believe we can make that process faster, more agile and more efficient to give our SDs the ability to respond in the moment, and that's something that we're working on in fiscal '24. Kenny, I toss to you for any comments from a financial perspective.
Kenny Cheung: Yes. Thank you, Kevin. A couple of things that I want to add. Just to recap, in Q4, as I mentioned earlier, we did experience deflation in our U.S. market. And with that, we still expanded both GP dollars per case, GP margins as well as operating margins, both -- all three of them. Yes, to directly answer your question, the centralized pricing tool, it does help on the margin side. There is quite a few other levers that we have as an enterprise, right, besides pricing. So, let me walk you through some of those other things that enterprise is working on. This includes: One is strengthening our International segments, right, because obviously it helps on the inflation side. Currently, right now, International is close to double-digit right now the spot on inflation. The second piece is strategic sourcing. Third, Sysco Brand penetration, which we made immense progress this quarter. And then last is going specialty and the likes. And all these four things I just mentioned, in addition to what you bought up Kelly around pricing, drive a higher earnings margin profile for our enterprise going forward.
Kelly Bania: And, I guess, just in terms of this lower pricing environment, do you expect your restaurant and all your customers to pass on these lower prices to consumers?
Kevin Hourican: Kelly, on the National Restaurant business, I would defer to the leaders of those companies to comment. I think they'll all make their own individual choices. I think at the local mom-and-pop independent level, it's an efficient market and center of plate purchase cost will come down for them. And will some of them choose to lower the price point on the menu? I think some will, and they will see volume benefit from that. So, it's fungible, these things are levers that get pulled, but I'll defer it to our large customer base to answer that question, especially the national chains.
Operator: Your next question will come from John Ivankoe at JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
John Ivankoe: Hi. Thank you very much. The question is on sales force compensation. I know there's been a couple of changes or enhancements in the past years, maybe one being in terms of new account generation, market share per account, Sysco Brand, product sales. I think there were a couple of different things including, I think, most recently the removal of some ceilings that certain sales force members are actually heading in terms of total comp. So, just wanted to get a sense of kind of what we should be focused on in '24, especially in terms of like a stable comp plan? I mean, how it works for both Sysco and the sales force numbers. And if you can make a comment in terms of the number of salespeople in the Sysco organization, does it make sense to add more or give more responsibility to the best? Thank you so much.
Kevin Hourican: Yes. John, thanks for the question. I appreciate it. We are making some improvements to our compensation model this year. What John's referring to is we're actually in pilot right now with an improved program. By the way, we like our current program. Our sales consultant retention is at all-time highs and we believe the program we have motivates behavior and motivates our colleagues on the right things. With that said, continuous improvement, you can always make something better and stronger. Your feedback from our sales consultants has been, what John just said, which is there is a cap that exists today, and people that do that type of work don't like caps, like more I sell the more I should earn and the more Sysco can make, and we agree with our sales consultants on that. So, we are piloting a new structure, a new program, which if they profitably grow their business, they continue to earn. And by the way, that's good for Sysco, too. So, it's a big company, it's a big machine, it's a big engine. As I said on my call today, it's more than 7,000 sales consultants. We need to make sure we get it right. We need to make sure it's clear, simple, and understandable and, therefore, that's why we're doing a pilot. We're pleased with the results of the pilot. We're going to announce actually in August to our sales force the details of that compensation change. So, with professional discretion, I'm going to choose not to comment on what it will be on this call, because we haven't even told our colleagues yet. But in August, we're going to announce the worldwide sales meeting the change, it will be very well-received because it's exactly what they've been asking for, and we're optimistic that that will help us deliver the guidance that we covered today and to win more share profitably at the local level. So, we're pleased with that change. We believe it will motivate even more the right behaviors, and it's good for the colleague and it's also good for Sysco, and it's good for the shareholder because it's profitable growth.
John Ivankoe: Thank you.
Kevin Hourican: Thank you, John.
Operator: Your next question will come from Alex Slagle at Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Alex Slagle: Thanks. Good morning. Wanted to dive in a little more on the local restaurant business, and you touched on some of this with Kelly's question. But your views on the health of these independent restaurant operators, both for the Sysco customers and more broadly, as you think about the traffic environment being a little bit more difficult, inflation pressures coming down. But, If you're seeing any evidence of stress out there, closures or erosion in receivables, bad debt that you see on the horizon for that group of customers?
Kevin Hourican: Okay. Alex, thanks for the question. I'll start just on sentiment of that very important customer segment of ours, and then I'll toss to Kenny for any comments on receivables and bad debt. You know, from the very beginning of COVID, I've said the following that local mom-and-pop entrepreneur is just that they are an entrepreneur. This is their business. They are agile, they are scrappy, they are fighters, and they have dealt with a lot over the last four years, and the disinflation to deflation in aggregate will be a good thing for them because think about that curve I was doing, I wish we are on Zoom and you could see me right, like the 18% inflation followed by deflation will come back to a normalized 2% to 3% inflation once we've gotten through this transition period, and that will be good for the local operator. It will be good because it will help with volume and frankly a little bit of margin is benefited from a little bit of inflation. So, the environmental conditions are going to transition to more favorable for that local operator. As it relates to how we Sysco can help them, that is the core of who we are. Drive to the best possible cost for that operator through strategic sourcing, have a sales consultant who is an expert in the their craft. You can help them with menu optimization, productivity improvement, Sysco Brand conversion which Kenny covered very well, we made tremendous strides in this past year and further penetrating Sysco Brand, we expect for that to continue and to introduce innovation and newness to our customers through cutting-edge solutions. So, we believe in the independent customer, we believe there is a real reason they exist which is people like local, they like to eat fresh, and those local operators do a wonderful job of buying local product, and again Sysco buys and sells more local produce than any other distributor despite our size. When I think about outlook for where we head from here, we have the ability to win more of those customers even if that overall customer base is going through this transition period. We serve roughly half of those independent doors, and we have a big opportunity to grow the number of doors we cover, an increased share of wallet going back to John's question with those customers. So, independent customers will be a source of growth for us this coming year, which we've built into our guidance. Kenny, I toss to you for any comment on AR and bad debt.
Kenny Cheung: Sure. Thanks, Kevin. With respect to AR and bad debt, we are not seeing any drag on working capital. If anything, it's the opposite. In fiscal year '23, we actually saw improvement in AR and AP and inventory DSO. All these factors provided a tailwind for working capital, therefore driving our record free cash flow and operating cash flow conversion from EBITDA.
Alex Slagle: Okay. Thank you.
Kevin Hourican: Thanks, Alex.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached our allotted time for the question-and-answer session. So, this will conclude your conference call for this morning. We would like to thank everyone for their participation and ask you to please disconnect your lines.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-05-02 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Sysco's Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. We will begin with opening remarks and introductions. I would like to turn the call over to Kevin Kim, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Kevin Kim: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Sysco's third quarter fiscal year 2023 earnings call. On today's call, we have Kevin Hourican, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Kenny Cheung, our Chief Financial Officer; and Neil Russell, our Chief Administrative Officer. Before we begin, please note that statements made during this presentation that state the company's or management's intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, and actual results could differ in a material manner. Additional information about factors that could cause results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's SEC filings. This includes, but is not limited to, risk factors contained in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 2, 2022, subsequent SEC filings and in the news release issued earlier this morning. A copy of these materials can be found in the Investors section at sysco.com. Non-GAAP financial measures are included in our comments today and in our presentation slides. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures is included at the end of the presentation slides and can be found in the Investors section of our website. To ensure we have sufficient time to answer all questions, we'd like to ask each participant to limit their time today to one question. If you have follow-up questions, we ask that you please reenter the queue. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Hourican.
Kevin Hourican: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. We will start today with a brief review of our financial performance. We will then highlight how we continue to grow share profitably. And as is our custom, we will provide a brief update on select elements of our Recipe for Growth strategy. I will then introduce Kenny Cheung, who joined the team a couple of weeks ago as our Chief Financial Officer. Kenny will share a few thoughts about what attracted him to Sysco and his initial observations. Neil Russell, now on the Chief Administrative Officer role, will provide a detailed update on our third quarter financial results, our balanced approach to capital allocation and lastly he will provide additional commentary around guidance. Our Q3 results, as displayed on Slide number 6 show continued double-digit top and bottom line growth. We grew faster than the overall market profitably, driving case volume growth of 6.1% across our U.S. Foodservice business and total sales growth of 11.7%. Our positive momentum was aided by strong performance from our International division with segment profits nearly doubling year-over-year. Our total company adjusted operating income and adjusted EPS grew approximately 27%, resulting in the highest ever third quarter profit in company history. Importantly, sequential improvements in our supply chain operating expenses resulted in solid operating leverage. I am pleased with the progress that we are making in supply chain productivity and overall expense control. We delivered strong sales growth throughout the quarter despite some industry softness beginning in March. Core traffic to our customers moderated in March, negatively impacting the sales volume in the most important month of the quarter. Third-party data indicates that the overall market volume decelerated through slight growth in March softer than had been expected within the restaurant segment. Additionally, the rate of inflation year-over-year declined at an accelerated rate during the quarter. This pattern of lower volume and lower inflation put pressure on total sales and gross profit for the quarter. A lowering of the overall inflation rate is a good thing for the industry for the long term, but we need to carefully navigate through the reduction period. These two factors, lower traffic and lower inflation are now expected to continue throughout our fourth quarter. Offsetting these near-term headwinds, we expect our progress with supply chain productivity and overall expense control to also continue into our fourth quarter. Putting all of these factors together, we now expect to end the year near the bottom of our adjusted EPS fiscal 2023 guidance range for $4 to $4.15. Recall that last quarter we outlined that the low-end guidance scenario considered softer macroeconomic and industry performance, which is exactly what we experienced in March. On that call, we also outlined our focus on driving fundamental improvements in our cost structure by improving supply chain productivity and driving up costs across the entire company. Our objective was to deliver gross profit growth greater than expense growth, enabling operating leverage expansion. We delivered on that objective in the third quarter, delivering our highest ever Q3 profit at Sysco. We remain very focused on productivity improvement, and we expect our efficiency actions to accelerate into the fourth quarter. At Sysco, we are playing the long game, and we are investing to win through our Recipe for Growth strategy. We are increasing our fulfillment footprint of distribution centers. We are improving our digital tools. We are enhancing our selling process and technology. These efforts are building momentum, and we remain on track to deliver our growth target for fiscal 2023 of growing 1.35x the market. Despite what has become a more challenging macro environment, we are confident in our ability to differentiate versus others in the marketplace and create preference with our customers. We are also prepared to handle the challenges at a slowing macro and lower inflation rates will present to our P&L. We are hyper focused on what we can control. This means executing our sales playbook of driving profitable growth and improving our logistics expenses. I am pleased to report that in the most recent quarter, we made meaningful progress in our supply chain productivity. As you can see on Slide number 8, we delivered improved retention, improved labor productivity and improved overall expenses. While our operating expenses remain elevated compared to historical standards, Q3 marked a major step forward in sequential improvements. We continue to have healthy staffing levels, and we are increasing our fill rates to our customers. These factors are helping Sysco improve our Net Promoter Scores. We will continue to make progress in operating efficiency and improving customer service into our fourth quarter. We profitably grew our volume and sales this quarter with U.S. Foodservice volumes up 6.1% and local case volumes up 4.2%. Sysco continues to succeed versus the overall market. And as I stated a moment ago, we are on track to deliver our stated growth target for the year. We delivered compelling business performance in our specialty businesses this past quarter with notable gains in our Italian platform, and we continue to see very strong performance from our FreshPoint produce business. Winning in the specialty space is a priority in Sysco as our market share is below our fair share in these fast-growing and higher profit margin segments. Sysco brand continues to succeed with increased penetration year-over-year of 29 basis points in U.S. Broadline and importantly growing over 100 basis points in the U.S. local segment. This progress creates a mix benefit as each additional Sysco brand case adds to our profit rate due to the higher margin and positively impacts customer retention due to the unique value proposition of Sysco Brand products. Additionally, I am pleased to report that our sales consultant retention remains at record high levels as our sales reps have adapted well to our improved sales enablement technology, pricing platforms, and our compensation program. And speaking of our compensation program, we plan to implement changes to the program at the beginning of the coming fiscal year. These changes will provide even more incentive for our industry-leading sales reps to grow their business profitably. The updated program is being tested currently in a U.S. region, and the early indications are positive. The modifications to our program came directly from feedback from our sales force. Turning to the Recipe for Growth on Slides 9 and 10. Our key initiatives are winning in the marketplace and fortifying our leading position in foodservice. We continue to drive compelling profitable growth as we expand the Sysco Your Way neighborhoods across the U.S. and internationally. As we highlighted at our recent CAGNY conference presentation, we are now live in over 300-plus neighborhoods across five countries. We will expand the program further in the coming quarters. The results from this customer-focused program continued to exceed our expectations, delivering double-digit top and bottom line growth. Additionally, we continue to gain momentum with Sysco Perks. We have now enrolled more than 11,000 customers into the exclusive loyalty program. Sysco Perks is our invitational only loyalty club, providing members with white glove service. Membership benefits include deliveries up to six days a week, exclusive access to rewards and industry-leading restaurant solutions to help our customers grow their business. When our customers succeed, we succeed, and we believe Sysco Your Way and Perks are two outstanding programs to help our customers be successful and differentiate Sysco from our competition. Lastly, we continue to make excellent progress with enhancing our digital tools. In the most recent quarter, we launched critical enhancements to our Sysco ordering platform called Shop, and we further enhanced our sales consultant CRM tool making it even more clear to our sales consultants the key priorities for each customer visit. The improvements to Shop in our CRM will drive increased penetration with existing customers. Turning to our next topic. We are excited to welcome Kenny Cheung to the Sysco family as our CFO. We conducted an exhaustive global search for our next CFO, partnering with industry experts in talent placement and talent assessment. I'm thrilled that we have the opportunity to find and hire Kenny. Kenny joined Sysco with nearly 20 years of financial and operational executive experience, most recently having served as the CFO at Hertz. Prior to Hertz, Kenny had operational and financial roles at Nielsen, and he started his career with GE. Kenny has extensive financial, operations and international experience. When coupled with his learning agility and financial acumen, we are confident that he will help Sysco profitably grow our business. Kenny leads with a hands-on approach as a team player, and we believe he will be a strong cultural fit for Sysco, something that was essential to me in the search process. I want to publicly acknowledge Neil for his great work over the past few months as our interim CFO and congratulate him on his expanded new position at Sysco. I'm excited that Neil is in the newly created position of Chief Administrative Officer. In that capacity, Neil will help us ensure that our strategic initiatives are on track, including program governance for our expansive Recipe for Growth strategy. He is a trusted partner, and I greatly appreciate his leadership impact. With that, I'll now turn it over to Kenny.
Kenny Cheung: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I am thrilled and honored to serve as the CFO of the world's largest foodservice distribution company. So why Sysco? I am excited to join the company at such an opportunistic and transformational time. Notwithstanding recent market dynamics, the food away from home industry is healthy and growing, currently a $350 billion industry with continued long-term growth tailwinds. Furthermore, one of the most attractive parts of joining this exceptional leadership team is a robust opportunity to build on our leadership position across the global markets we serve. Size and scale matter in this industry and I believe in the bold transformation that is already yielding dividends for our business. Sysco has a long history of generating robust operating cash flows and engaging in prudent M&A while maintaining a strong history of returning cash back to shareholders. It all starts with our purpose, which is to connect the world to share food and care for one another. Combining our purpose with our unwavering culture for operational excellence and compelling investments around technology, products and solutions and supply chain productivity are important actions. We believe these and other actions render structural accretive value, which will compound with our scale and continue our profitable market share growth. In this role, I plan to leverage my background of adding value for large global companies that are customer service centric. My experience also includes driving field labor productivity profitably growing both contracted and short-cycle business and innovating to create value for our customers. Delivering consistent results will come from our industry-leading people, products and solutions. Remaining disciplined with supply chain inventory management and capital allocation will be critical to my role as it is all about maximizing return on invested capital and sustainable growth. Lastly, I understand and appreciate the importance of driving environmental sustainability initiatives with Sysco already on a great path under Neil's leadership. While only here for a few weeks, I am impressed with the bench strength of the financial organization and the passion that my fellow colleagues have for the industry and the company. I look forward to working hand-in-hand with the wider team as we celebrate our Recipe for Growth strategy and further our Number One position. The future is extremely bright. We have a unique opportunity to build on our leader position and to define the future path for the food service and supply chain ecosystem. I look forward to working with you all. I will now turn it over to Neil, who will provide additional financial details.
Neil Russell: Welcome, Kenny. And hello, everyone. I will start today with a review of our third quarter financial performance and then discuss our expectations for the full year to go. During my discussion today, unless otherwise stated, all results are compared to the same quarter in the prior fiscal year. As highlighted in our news release issued earlier this morning, and on Slide 14, which is posted on our website, we delivered double-digit year-over-year growth in both top and bottom line results. And we continued our balanced approach to capita allocation all in the midst of an evolving macro backdrop. Let me begin with a summary of our third quarter results. Sales grew 11.7%, with U.S. Foodservice growing at 10.4% and continued positive momentum in our International segment, which grew at 18%. Volumes grew year-over-year and also improved sequentially. The U.S. Foodservice segment, which includes our Broadline, FreshPoint, Italian and other specialty businesses grew 6.1% and local case volumes increased 4.2%. Adjusted gross profit for the third quarter increased 12.8% to $3.4 billion with adjusted gross margin improving 18 basis points to 18.2%. Gross profit dollars per case grew in all four segments, marking the seventh consecutive quarter of such growth. Our gross profit dollar and margin percentage improvement during the third quarter reflected our ability to continue to effectively manage product inflation, which moderated to 4.9% for the total enterprise, down sequentially from 8.3% during the second quarter of this fiscal year. The improvement in gross profit was also driven by incremental progress from our strategic sourcing efforts as well as improved penetration rates from Sysco Brand products. Overall, adjusted operating expenses were $2.7 billion for the quarter or 14.3% of sales, a 32 basis point improvement from the prior year. This quarter included transformation investments of $60 million. Excess overtime costs, otherwise known as productivity costs were reduced all the way down to zero during the third quarter. As we improve our cost performance, we have now eliminated both snapback and these productivity costs. All four operating segments again showed increases in profitability year-over-year including substantial growth in the International and Sigma segments. As seen on Slide 18, adjusted operating income for the enterprise increased by 27.8% and to $736 million. This is the highest adjusted operating income results for the third quarter in Sysco's history and is now the third consecutive quarter of record quarterly operating income an important signal of the progress being made at Sysco via our recipe for growth. This quarter continued to show gross profit dollar growth outpacing operating expense growth another important illustration of our financial improvement. For the quarter, we grew adjusted EBITDA by 19% to $900 million. Regarding the balance sheet, our solid investment-grade rated balance sheet, strong cash position and healthy liquidity remains a competitive advantage. We ended the quarter at a 2.8 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio. In the third quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares and year-to-date, we have now repurchased 4.6 million shares. We are now at nearly $400 million of share repurchases for the year, nearing our goal of up to $500 million. Inclusive of our dividend payments, Sysco has returned a total of $1.1 billion to shareholders thus far in fiscal year 2023. Of note, the Board approved last week another annual increase in Sysco's dividend, continuing the long-standing tradition of regular increases in solidifying our position as a dividend aristocrat. As a reminder, we remain well positioned in the current rising interest rate environment, with approximately 95% of Sysco's debt being fixed at attractive rates. Lastly, we are well positioned with our debt laddering schedule with staggered maturity dates over time. Let's turn to cash. As shown on Slide 19, year-to-date, cash flow from operations was strong at $1.4 billion, a $680 million improvement over the prior year. Net CapEx increased to $446 million as we continue to invest in our Recipe for Growth, particularly with respect to our planned investments in fleet and distribution facilities. This includes three expansion sites and seven new facilities in the next few years as we deliver new capacity in high potential markets and high-growth cuisine segments. Our investments are driving positive returns, and we plan to remain prudent with capital allocation with a focus on ROIC maximization. Free cash flow was very strong during the third quarter, increasing to $980 million year-to-date. This improvement was driven by disciplined inventory management and a positive change in working capital during the quarter. We ended the quarter with approximately $758 million in cash on hand and over $3 billion in total liquidity. As seen on Slide 22, our ESG or sustainability efforts advanced with the unveiling of our first electric vehicle hub in Riverside, California last month for Earth Day. This is the world's first electric vehicle hub of its kind, consisting of electric tractors and electric trailers fueled by renewable solar energy. These trucks are rolling, serving our customers as we speak with more on the way. Our industry-leading climate goals also include a commitment to work with suppliers representing 67% of our Scope 3 emissions to set their own science-based targets by 2026. Importantly, our focus on sustainability and diversity, equity and inclusion is not only the right thing to do, we believe it will be good for business in the long term. Lastly, looking ahead to the remainder of the year and beyond, we now expect diluted adjusted earnings per share near the bottom of the previously disclosed range of $4 to $4.15 per share. While Sysco continues to outperform the market due to the success of our Recipe for Growth strategy, the recent market softness is creating incremental business pressures impacting case growth and lower inflation. These macroeconomic headwinds are impacting traffic levels for some of our customers, resulting in slower traffic levels across the restaurant industry. To offset this, we are actively managing our portfolio and continue to expect further improvements in cost-out activities and supply chain efficiency for the remainder of the year. Additionally, inflation remains on target for a low single-digit rate in Q4 of this fiscal year. As a result, we expect the fourth quarter to reflect a similar positive trend of gross profit dollar growth outpacing operating expense growth. Specific to share repurchases, we remain on target to repurchase approximately $500 million in shares this fiscal year. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Kevin for his closing remarks.
Kevin Hourican: Thank you, Neil. As we conclude, I'd like to provide a brief summary on Slide Number 24. Our Q3 financial performance reflects another record quarter, delivering adjusted operating income growth of over 27% to $736 million. Our profit leverage improved in the third quarter with gross profit growth outpacing operating expense growth. We expect that performance to continue in the fourth quarter. Industry macro volume trends softened in March, which we expect to continue into Q4. We are also experiencing lower rates of inflation, a trend we expect to continue through Q4. These two factors are partially offset by significantly improving supply chain productivity performance. No one is better prepared to manage a choppy macro landscape than Sysco. Why? Scale matters in this industry? Purchasing scale, logistics route efficiency scale, inventory optimization scale. But even more importantly, customer diversification scale. At Sysco, we serve restaurants up and down the price point spectrum. And also have a large non-restaurant customer base. Many of our sectors are recession-proof, for instance, education and health care. Other segments are still in recovery, travel hospitality and business and industry. Within our restaurant segment, given that we serve all restaurant types, we retain case volume if and when customers trade up or down within restaurant customer segments. At Sysco, we are steadfastly focused on what we can control. We are focused on winning new business and in penetrating additional cases with existing customers. As importantly, we are focused on improving our supply chain efficiency. Food-away-from-home is a healthy long-term market, and we are prepared to be successful regardless of the short-term macro environmental conditions. Lastly, Sysco remains deeply committed to our strong and stable balance sheet, disciplined capital allocation and delivering continued returns to our shareholders. Our status as a Dividend Aristocrat remains a priority and we are proud to carry that distinction going into our 54th year. Sysco is a resilient and diversified company with scale advantages. We are increasing our scale advantages through our Recipe for Growth strategy. We are confident that our work product will deliver strong profit growth and compelling returns for our shareholders.  Operator, you can now open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Mark Carden at UBS. Please go ahead.
Mark Carden: Good morning. Thanks so much for taking the question and congrats on the new position, Kenny. I wanted to dig in a bit more on what you’re seeing in the labor front. I know that recent strikes you experience were quite a bit smaller in nature than the ones that took place in October. But are you expecting industry wage headwinds to intensify much more than you originally expected over the course of the next few quarters? And does this impact how you’re thinking of offsetting cost outs and what’s necessary on that front? Thanks.
Kevin Hourican: Great. Good morning, Mark. This is Kevin. Thanks for the question. I’ll start just, acknowledging the strike situation and then directly answer your question. I just want to thank our operations team, first and foremost, for the agility that they displayed. During the unanticipated strikes in the most recent quarter, within 24 hours to 48 hours, we were up to full shipping capacity, able to support our customers and communicate effectively with our customers, which is not an easy task given the amount of business that we do on any given day at Sysco. Point two for me is, Sysco pays above market wage rates, and we provide extremely compelling benefits to our associates. That has not changed, and that will not change. We will be a leader in wage and benefits. For example, drivers can make more than a $100,000 a year at Sysco. It’s a good paying job.  Unfortunately, as you know, Mark, you indicated there were some strikes in the most recent quarter and the one that impacted our Q2 for up in Boston. These are things we’re working through. We will continue to be fair to our colleagues and also manage our P&L for the long term during our discussions with our labor partners. Our goal is to have a solid relationship with all of our labor partners and to treat our colleagues with respect and the dignity that they deserve, and we’re committed to doing that. As it relates to wage, we’ll talk about that more in August when we provide our fiscal 2024 guidance. I want to be clear that the type of increases that we’re experiencing are not game changing. I know that restaurant names and retail names have talked about double-digit plus type annual wage increases. We are not experiencing that at Sysco. And that’s something we’ll provide you with more clarity and specificity about on our August call.
Mark Carden: Great. And then as a quick follow-up to that. You’ve referenced improvements in overall labor productivity. At this stage, how close do you think you are to getting back to normalized labor productivity levels, both from the selector front and the driver front, and then how much of an impact do you think you’re seeing date from the new academies?
Kevin Hourican: Yes, Mark, thanks for the follow-up. We are really pleased with the rate of progress that we made in Q3 from a supply chain productivity perspective. I like to start at the start, which is we are fully staffed. So we are a fully staffed network. We’re beginning to experience improved retention because over time rates have come down and obviously that flows through positively to our P&L. The types of things that we have done to drive that behavior in action is, as you mentioned, the academies for having a meaningful impact on reducing turnover for our new hires, improving productivity for our new hires. We have fully implemented engineered labor standards in our transportation division. We’ve always had that for warehousing, and we now have it for transportation, which allows us to provide our colleagues with proper coaching and recognition when they’re doing well and to help a new person or a person who’s not at the level of productivity and throughput [ph] that we desire to understand how they can individually improve. We’re improving how we flex our labor to match the volume for any given day in any given week, which allows us to, again, hit the desired productivity. And we’re really pleased with the exit velocity of our productivity in March, and we anticipate in our Q4 of this year that we will make continued progress. As I mentioned on the earnings call transcript, we’re still at an elevated level of cost versus our historical norm. And therefore there’s still progress to be made, and that progress will carry into 2024. We anticipate supply chain costs as a percent of sales will come down year-over-year, and we’ll provide you more clarity and specifics behind that on our guide that we will provide you in August. Neil has one comment to add to that. Neil, over to you.
Neil Russell: Hey, Mark. Good morning. It’s Neil. Hope you’re doing well. Listen, just a quick follow on here. You heard in my prepared comments a comment about productivity costs. So as you know, over the last several quarters, there are a couple of cost categories that were impacting the business that we’ve made great progress on. And one of which of course is directly related to your question. First of all, we had in our cost basis what we called snapback costs those types of costs that were related to the hiring of a large wave of new colleagues as we improved and increased the volume in our business. And those costs originally as high as nearly $70 million in a quarter came down to $30 million, came down to $20 million to $10 million. Those were eliminated last quarter. And now similarly, productivity costs, which you really should think about is excess overtime associated with the staffing and productivity in the business to the point of your question were $40 million, then they were $20 million. Those also now are down to zero. So having made progress on both the snapback costs and productivity costs being eliminated if you will is really good signals of progress to Kevin’s point.
Mark Carden: Great. Thanks so much. Good luck guys.
Kevin Hourican: Thank you, Mark.
Operator: Your next question comes from John Heinbockel at Guggenheim. Please go ahead.
John Heinbockel: Hey, Kevin. I wanted to start real quick with so Sysco Your Way, if you could sort of frame the most – the newest markets that you’ve entered, how they’re performing, right, versus some of the earlier ones, right, getting better at executing this? And then I think in the past, you thought that was $1 billion opportunity. Do you still think that’s true or is it bigger than you thought perhaps?
Kevin Hourican: Good morning, John. Thank you for the question. We’re really pleased with the performance of Sysco Your Way. Specifically as we roll out additional new neighborhoods, we’re not seeing a diminishing of the impact as each individual neighborhood comes on. I think you’ve heard me talk about that before as the Hawthorne effect. When you launch a pilot, it does great, but then when you attempt to scale it and it diminishes over time. We are not seeing that at all. Each and every neighborhood that we launch comes out of the gate strong and actually sequentially improves month-over-month and quarter-over-quarter. And the lie that happens is twofold. Again, remember, the truck is there literally every day, twice per day. The sales rep is walking the beat, as we call it, every day. And we win new customers on a sequential basis because we’re showing up every day and knocking on the door and saying, do you need anything? Do you need anything? And then within existing customers, we can win categories that they perhaps were buying from a specialty distributor, like a specialty house or a premium protein house and a dairy house. We’re gaining that specialty business and putting it on our truck, and then we’re winning new doors within the neighborhood. So each additional neighborhood that we launched we’re pleased most impressively. We’re now live in five countries and the model is scaling in every country that we’ve launched it in. Most recently, we’ve launched it in Stockholm, Sweden. And right out of the gate, the results have been really strong. So internationally it’s working, domestically it’s working. We anticipate that yes, John, it will exceed – we’ll be on target versus the $1 billion that we have quoted. And there’s the potential for upside, not prepared today to talk about what level of upside, but we’re really pleased with the performance. We’re also pleased with the performance of Sysco Perks, which is our loyalty program. If I may, I do get a lot of questions. Kevin, what’s the difference between Sysco Your Way and Perks? I’m kind of confused. I want to be really clear. Sysco Your Way is about the neighborhood, and it’s a couple of streets, in a town that have 50 plus restaurants on those one or two streets, and it’s about providing next level of service to those specific neighborhoods. Perks is the opposite of that. It’s a customer who’s not in one of those neighborhoods. That’s one of our best customers. It’s an invitation only program. We invite customers in and we provide them with white glove [ph] service, marketing services and culinary engagements. And that program as well, which is now more than 11,000 customers enrolled, is exceeding our expectations.
John Heinbockel: And then one quick follow-up. You mentioned that the comp change that you’re testing, I think that relates to the sales consultants, right, that side of the business. And is that, I assume that is some form of hybrid commission, right? Because I don’t think you’re going to full commission, but some hybrid, is that fair? And then what do you think the greatest impact is on the business?
Kevin Hourican: John, thank you for the follow-up. And you’re directionally accurate on where we’re headed. So, for everyone else who’s listening, go back to pre-COVID. The Sysco sales consultant was on a full commissioned model. During COVID because the business dropped significantly, we did the right thing for our sales consultants to retain them, and we converted to a base plus bonus model where they earn a livable wage through a base pay, and then they have opportunities to make money through bonus criteria. And that criteria can change quarter-over-quarter to have behavior that we desire to see from that population. For a while it was Sysco brand and then we were focused on helping our customers engage with Sysco Shop. And John, yes, where we’re headed for this coming fiscal year is to put even more incentive in front of the sales consultants for them to profitably grow their business. And the more cases they get put onto a Sysco truck, the more they make and obviously the more Sysco makes as a result. So we’re going to keep the base pay component of what we have because we like that element. It drives retention and quality of life for our associates with ups and downs that occur in business. But we want to put even more, put a more incentive in front of them to drive growth profitably. And what we anticipate the action and reaction from that John will be is real hunger on our sales force to go out and win business, penetrate more lines with existing customers and win new business. So we’re testing it, as I mentioned, the results are preliminarily positive and then we work on the communication plan and change management plan for our 5,000 plus associates in the sales ranks within the U.S. and we expect it to be very well received, because as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, this feedback came directly from our sales results, excuse me, from our sales consultants. Gave me more motivation and incentive to go out and win and go out and sell. And we’re going to be doing exactly that.
John Heinbockel: Thank you.
Kevin Hourican: Thank you, John.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question will come from Joshua Long at Stephens. Please go ahead.
Joshua Long: Great. Thank you for taking the question. Was hopeful we could dig into some of the digital tools that you called out, Kevin, sounds like strength and Sysco Shop and then also your sales associate PRM tool are performing well. Just curious what you could share in terms of the learnings that you’ve seen to date where you might lean into going forward, to the extent you could share that? And then also just, how does those tools and others that you have help you manage the pace of inflation? You mentioned being really important, but how do you use those tools to really navigate this current environment from a pricing and just cost management perspective?
Kevin Hourican: Good morning, Josh. Thank you for the question. And it’s two parts, so I’ll address it as such. On the digital side, just can’t thank our digital team and our business team enough for the progress that we’re making in our digital tools. So big shout out to our Sysco technology teams. Let me just break it down into the two most impactful pieces that are helpful to the customer. And then I’m going to answer the inflation question through the third prong, which is pricing technology. For digital, Sysco Shop is our ordering platform. We discontinue to make meaningful progress in the usability of that tool. Improved navigation, there are categories of product that we sell, like supplies and equipment, which is a very high margin category for us that was really difficult for our customers to shop in the past. They had to go to a separate website called Supplies on the Fly, and we’re increasing significantly the accessibility of those high margin categories and products, improving the search results, improving the navigation capability of the website. But here’s where it’s most powerful. Non-intrusive popups to our customer to help them make good choices in their order that they place. For example, they forgot to put into that order an item that we know they order regularly. There’ll be a dialogue box that pops up at multiple places throughout their shopping experience to remind them of that. And they have to interact with it in order to be able to proceed forward in a non-intrusive way. We're providing them with suggestions on things that they should be buying that we know based on the cuisine that they are in and the products we're buying that should be riding on a Sysco truck, and we're integrating that with pricing. For example, if they have not bought that item before, we can offer them a new item pricing discount because if we're able to win that item that we've never sold before, that is meaningfully margin accretive for Sysco because the most profitable case put on a Sysco truck is the next case going on a truck to an existing customer that were already routing the driver to deliver to. So those are just examples, improved navigation, improved shopability, suggestions for things that should be in fact placed on the order, but here's where the digital and human piece comes together effectively at Sysco in unparalleled ways versus our past. There were same suggestions that we're providing to the customer on shop are now being conveyed to the sales rep through our CRM tool in a very dynamic way. And there are two methods by which this can be activated. One is preparing for a customer visit. They can go into the customer tab of our CRM, and they can see explicitly the types of deals and the types of offers that have been put in front of the customer that they may or may not have purchased from. They can follow up specifically on those offers. We are seeing step level increases of engagement from our customers when that customer has seen the offer digitally and also it's been presented to them from their sales rep. And that's the power of Sysco. This is not a pure digital business. This is a relationship business. Our sales reps are culinary pros. They have intimate relationships with our customers, but now they're empowered with specific offers for that customer unique to their cuisine type, and again the power is the digital and human experience in these two tools, our CRM and our SHOP platform are talking to one another in a way that they never have before, and I call that visits with a purpose. What are the two or three things that I need to get done today when I visit this customer, and we can track it. We can track it at the colleague level, who is closing at a higher rate than the average, who is closing at a rate lower than the average, and we provide obviously selling coaching to go along with that. So super pleased with our tools and the progress we're making. The second half of your question was about inflation and how are we managing it through our tools. This is where our pricing platform tool is enormously helpful. As Neil has said before, and I'm going to talk to him in a minute for a comment, the local street business is an efficient market. As cost of products are going up quickly, those cost increases are passed on in that market. And the same is true if costs are coming down. The customer expects to be able to see a lower price on their order with Sysco and others that we compete against. Our pricing tool allows us to manage that environment in a dynamic way at the item level for each and every customer. I'm really pleased with how this company performed when we were dealing with this time last year, 15% inflation, and now that we're dealing with the opposite, which is a disinflation environment. We are using those tools to be thoughtful and strategic. We call the right on price versus the market and our scale advantages of purchasing allow us to get the net lowest cost for Sysco and we can in fact pass on value to our customers and win share profitably. Neil, I toss to you for additional comments.
Neil Russell: Yes. Thanks Kevin. Hey, Josh. Just a couple of headlines for you; the impact of these things that Kevin has been describing, so gross profit dollars growing at a pace faster than expenses now for two quarters in a row is the end result of the improvement in these tools and processes that Kevin was describing and there's one other tool in the toolbox that is helpful for that gross profit dollar growth, and that of course is Sysco brand, which has performed very well for us recently. Now at 36% of what we sell to our local customers and about 46% – I'm sorry, 46% of what we sell to our local customers, 36% what we sell overall. A very powerful tool in the toolbox of managing fluctuations and inflation and the power of the gross profit dollar growth, so all those things combined are leading to that improved progress of that leverage that we speak of.
Joshua Long: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from John Ivankoe at J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.
John Ivankoe: Hi. Its related questions or points I suppose. First, what is the nature of the customer type slowdown that you saw in March into April? Is it full-service independent restaurants or local customers, which I think is one of your highest profit customers? So if you don't mind addressing that? And then secondly, the slowdown in inflation, if you could talk about what cost categories it's happening in? I mean are these categories that are most likely sold to street accounts? Or is there a cost plus a dollar component to that or cost plus percent component to that? Just wanted to get some more clarity of what's happening beneath the surface on inflation. Thank you.
Kevin Hourican: Okay. John, its Kevin. I'll start, and I'll toss to Neil for additional comment. Just a little more color on what we experienced in March, and obviously that's built into how we described our expectations for Q4 and now for the full year. March restaurant traffic did slow down in March; I think that's pretty well understood. Restaurant names, credit card data purchasing, et cetera, did convey a slowdown in March's traffic. Now also to be clear, January and February were benefited by a pretty large year-over-year tailwind tied to Omicron. But again the March traffic was a bit slower than what had been expected. And we are expecting that to continue into our Q4. Now we expect Sysco to outperform versus the market. We're going to win share profitably, and we are committed to delivering on our growth targets. It's just a more overarching comment about traffic. No notable callouts marked on trade down. I know that's often a question within sectors and within segments of our book. The traffic that we experienced was kind of across the board, across our restaurant names that we cover. Specific to inflation I would like to provide a little more color in that regard. The number, the print for the quarter was 4.9%, as Neil said in his prepared remarks. The quarter started a bit higher than what we expected and it ended a bit lower than we expected. So mathematically, what that means is the rate of disinflation in March was steeper than we had anticipated. Now we're prepared to manage that. As I mentioned a second ago in answering Josh's question, for the long-term of this industry, lower inflation is a good thing. I want to be really clear about that. This time last year, we were dealing with 15% inflation, and we were receiving lots of questions from investors about the impact on that inflation would have on consumers psyche and consumer demand and when it decrease what traffic the restaurant. So the fact that the inflation rate is coming down is a good thing. With that said, we need to be thoughtful and strategic about how we manage the transition from double-digit plus inflation to what we're expecting in Q4 to be low-single digits. We have a tool to be able to do that, and that's our pricing tool. I'll reinforce a couple of key points, which is our purchasing costs because of our scale advantage is the best in the industry. And we have the opportunity to be strategic and thoughtful about passing on value when it is created to those end consumers. Specific to your point about product come out of categories, I think, the easiest way to answer that is what categories last year were most inflationary. And John, it was mostly center of plate. So I think you remember this time last year, protein specifically was in the 30% to 40% inflationary space in that subcategory and category went deflationary for a period of time. And what we say all the time is it's not about a category, it's about the overarching book of business, and while protein was deflationary. Our overall book average was plus 4.9%. And then one much more comment about that we're actually getting indications from the supplier community that beef will begin becoming inflationary again in the coming year because of some challenges on the production end of that particular product set. Neil, I'll toss to you for any additional comments.
Neil Russell: Thanks Kevin. Just a little bit of color commentary around some of those points. At any given point in time that some categories that are inflationary, like currently for us dairy, some that are deflationary like for us currently poultry and some that have swung as Kevin just talked about. So beef, which was recently deflationary is now becoming inflationary for us. And it was the pace of disinflation, particularly in March that changed a bit, and we ended as Kevin said the quarter at about 5% for the total quarter in terms of inflation. The local customer market is fairly efficient in terms of how you pass this through. And on the chain or multiunit side, you have longer visibility with the contracts that we have with those types of customers. Put all of this together and you still expect low-single digit inflation for the fourth quarter, which as Kevin indicated, if you were to look over a 20-year time horizon would actually be the preferred rate of inflation for both us and our customers. So that's where we think we are right now back to Kevin for any last point.
Kevin Hourican: Yes. Sorry for the three-part answer to this question, John, but it's just really important for everyone to understand. And as that is happening, as cost is becoming more efficient and therefore our ability to provide value to our customers passes through at a lower rate of inflation, aka disinflation. Simultaneous to that we are taking meaningful costs out of our current supply chain. We are driving improvement in efficiency, and it's those things that need to happen in concert, and I am pleased with the rate of improvement we are making within our supply chain. And again, the performance you see is for the full quarter in our numbers. I'm really pleased with the exit velocity in March of our supply chain productivity that we measure everything, pieces per labor hour, pieces per truck, we literally measure everything. And our exit rate in supply chain, productivity and efficiency in March was really strong. So as our inflation rate begins to decline aka disinflation, we're bringing costs down at exactly the same time.
John Ivankoe: Thank you.
Kevin Hourican: Thank you, John.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein at Barclays. Please go ahead.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thank you. One follow-up on that last question; the March slowdown that you anticipate continuing through the fiscal fourth quarter, I think you had noted in the release and in your comments that Sysco sales perhaps were maybe stronger or more stable through the quarter. I'm just wondering what do you what there is an opportunity to accelerate market share gains in what's likely a slowdown, presumably again scale matters and you've got more options to mitigate. So I'm just wondering if is an opportunity for greater market share gains in an environment like that? And then I had one follow-up.
Kevin Hourican: Okay. Jeff, this is Kevin. I'll answer the first question and then toss Steve for the follow-up. So we're bullish on Sysco's ability to win in the market for the long term. We are playing the long game, as I said in my prepared remarks. The recipe for growth strategy is all about better serving our customers in growing our business profitably and enabling Sysco to do so at a rate that is faster than the overall market rate of growth, and we're on track to be able to do that for our third consecutive year. Specifically, Jeff, what we will double down on during a period of time that would be a slower macro is initiatives and strategies that we know are working. So push even harder and work even faster on Sysco Your Way, engage our Sysco Perks customers with the benefits that are available to them because we have proven that a Sysco Perks member who engages with one of Sysco's programs and that would be an example, a culinary service, buys more from Sysco on an ongoing basis. The work we're doing with our website. It's moved faster, improve it even more. Spanish language version of our website is going live soon. Just double down on our ability to advance forward our strategy because our strategy is working, and our strategy is winning in the marketplace. Italian, as an example, we've doubled our market share in Italian over the past year, in large part through the Greco and Sons acquisition, but remember the Greco acquisition was about taking that platform nationwide not just cultivating it within its existing geographies. We're making meaningful progress in being able to advance that Italian platform by opening new physical geographies, most recently out in California through an acquisition we did in L.A., and we're going to flip that acquisition to the Greco model and meaningfully grow that business. So Jeff, we're all about profitable growth and doing so responsibly. And we do believe there's an opportunity, not just in our Q4, but as we head into fiscal 2024 to lead the industry from a profitable growth perspective. Toss, back to you for your follow-up.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Yes. In fact, perfect. I think you ended it with thoughts around fiscal 2024. Just wondering, I mean, I know back in the day, you had given guidance, which culminated in fiscal 2024. I know it was built off of fiscal 2019, I think it was for EPS growth, 30% plus, which at the time equated to 460 or more. I know it hasn't been mentioned of late and we had a reduction in fiscal 2023 guidance last quarter and the most recent slowdown now you're talking about the lower end of that range, closer to $4, I guess. Just wondering whether there is any still relevance to that prior target, whether you see further acceleration of efficiencies or whatnot? Or maybe throw it to Kenny. Just wondering what can you bring to the table in terms of a greater skill set to help to achieve those prior earnings targets? Thank you. 
Kevin Hourican: Yes, Jeff. Appreciate the question. This is Kevin. I'll start and then I'm going to toss to Kenny for a comment. Just to be clear, we're going to provide our guidance for 2024 at our August call. We are confident in our plans at Sysco to continue to advance our recipe for growth. The strategy is working and what we are confident in or some; let's call it, macro comments. We are confident we can grow our business profitably faster than the industry. We are confident we can continue to make improvements in our supply chain efficiency. Things have important that we'll provide you with more color on in August because we're deep in the throes of our fiscal planning process as we speak. And that work will happen over the next couple of months is what level of inflation will we assume for fiscal 2024, what level of market growth will we assume for 2024 and then what more from an efficiency cost out structural perspective, will we specifically be able to account for and book on our plans for 2024. So we need to put all that together to provide a reasonable guide for next year. That will come in August. And Kenny, I toss to you for additional comments.
Kenny Cheung: Sure. Thanks, Kevin. Hi, Jeff. So a few things from my side of the house. We are entering 2024 with momentum. So keep in mind, we will finish this year in Q4 with record sales and operating income, right? So a lot of momentum entering next year. As Kevin mentioned, there's a few themes that you will see as we unveil the new plan in August next earnings call. One is continuing to take care profitably, right? That's very important for all of us, and that's where refer growth comes in. Second is, we will continue to drive operating leverage in our business. Third is making sure that our balance sheet continues to be healthy and robust from a liquidity, cash and leverage standpoint. To your last question around where do I add value and how I think about these things that I just mentioned, right? As I think about my priorities entering, call it, Q4 and 2024 and there's a few thoughts on my mind, right? First of all, I view myself as a business leader with a finance expertise, right? So I'm a very hands-on operational CFO. So where I work directly with the team and deploy capital where it creates value for our stakeholders. I'm of the mind that one of my job – first priority is to make sure that we generate – continue to generate healthy cash inflows from operations, maximize the conversion from EBITDA and operating income and ultimately, continue the high quality of earnings that Sysco has enjoyed throughout the period. The second piece is continue to partner with the team, right, from a go-to-market standpoint, providing world-class service to our customers. Everything starts with our customers, especially as we grow market share, local, Sysco brands, specialty and the like, which accretes margins for our business. And last but not least, as part of my pedigree in my experience, it's all about per operational excellence, driving productivity and rigor with our supply chain and overall business. A penny for our business is huge, given the fact that we have scale and leverage that we talked about. And this comes full circle to my first point where we must generate cash and flow to invest in our business and to create further value on top of the scale advantage that we enjoy.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Thank you. 
Kevin Hourican: Thank you, Jeff. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Kendall Toscano at Bank of America. Please go ahead. 
Kendall Toscano: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to ask about the 2023 guidance. But first, I just wanted to see just a quick follow-up in terms of the local customer channel. So you had talked about some initiatives last quarter to accelerate new customer acquisition in that segment. I was wondering if you had any update on that? And then just in terms of the exit rate for the quarter, you said March for, I guess, the total U.S. Broadline segment was kind of exited at a low or slight growth, I think you said. I guess how does that look for local customers specifically? And can we assume it's still running a bit below the national customers?
Kevin Hourican: Yes. Kendall, this is Kevin. I'll start and then I'll toss to Neil for additional color. So part of it is accidentally there, we got a mixed message between the marketplace which means all businesses and then Sysco specific. So I'll unpack it and make it more clear. The comment about March low growth or slight growth, I believe, were the exact words I used, that's an overall market condition that is restaurant names in aggregate, leveraging third-party data and credit card data. That was that comment. We grew substantially more than that. We grew our local case volume 4% in the most recent quarter and total business 6%, which is that's the answer to the second part of your question. Yes, we are growing our non-restaurant business and our CMU restaurant business. That's the contracted long cycle to use Kenny's terms at a faster rate than local. And the lie is twofold. One, Sysco is the industry leader in the non-restaurant sector and that's business and industry, travel, hospitality. And those businesses remain in meaningful recovery. So that's not a slight on the local business. It's that we're seeing significant rebound in health, in travel. And we're seeing offices reopening. We're seeing more people going back to work on a daily basis. So we're seeing companies extend the number of days per week that you expect their colleagues to be returning to work. So that's – and we've been tremendously successful in our national sales business. We stopped reporting the number, but the last time we reported it, it was $2-plus billion of net new wins for national business. And I want to be really clear about that. We did not buy that business. The contracted margin rates for those wins exceeded our historical standards. The reason why companies are partnering with Sysco is our national scale. Our breadth and reach scale matters in this industry and our ability to ship on time and in full and provide competitive marketplace rates shine through strongly over the last couple of years from a national perspective. So that gives you the color. Our total was 6%. Our local was four [ph] plus that’s the volume and the overall market itself in March with slight growth. Our commentary for the Q4, I'm going to toss to Neil for anything you would like to say about that.
Neil Russell: Hey, Kendall, thanks for your question. As Kevin is talking about here on the industry perspective, we are seeing total growth and albeit, at a slower pace in Sysco outpacing that. It's not as much about the local independent versus the chain or multiunit as much as it is good operators innovating on their menu, offering fresh, local, customizable offerings that map to the end consumer. So I think that's ultimately what we're seeing. As it pertains to the year and the guidance, a few points that we've made that we continue to emphasize, we do expect to grow sales by at least 10% for the year. And as we talked about, we continue to expect a rate of gross profit dollar growth to exceed the expense growth and continue to leverage that. We talked about the inflation that's looking for us to be in that low single-digit range. And as we talked about here today on the call, we'll expect our earnings per share to be about $4 for the full year.
Kendall Toscano: Great. I think that answers all my questions. Thanks again. 
Kevin Hourican: Thank you, Kendall. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Alex Slagle at Jefferies. Please go ahead. 
Alex Slagle: Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to follow-up on the target to grow 1.35 times the market in 2023 and I guess further acceleration ahead and how you're thinking about that ramp relative to previous thoughts? I mean it looked like a pretty strong acceleration in the chart I didn't hear whether you reiterated the 1.5 times for 2024, but just any more color there?
Kevin Hourican: Yes, I'll start and then I'll toss to Kenny for any final or additional comments that he'd like to make about 2024. Alex. I appreciate the question. So what I said on today's prepared remarks is we're on track for our goal for this year. So are consistently growing more than the market, and that's our third consecutive year of doing that. So we're pleased with the progress that we are making. Sysco has been the largest in this industry for a long time. We have had the highest EPS as a percent of sales or EBITDA as a percent of sales in this industry by a wide margin for a long time, and we have become a growth company. We are consistently growing more than the industry, and we are accelerating our rate of progress. So the recipe for growth is the why and the how. And the increased allocation of capital specific to footprint, meaning infrastructure. So that's not an increase in the total capital at Sysco. It's – we said how many buildings do we save that number publicly yet. I didn't want to misspeak. So forgive me for tossing it over to Neil. We have seven physical buildings in flight as we speak. And those buildings are going to increase our fulfillment capacity in high-growth markets, in high rate of success markets for Sysco. In the past, we've called those fold-outs, some of those seven buildings are for our Italian platform to be able to replicate the Greco model in geographies where we don't currently have an Italian platform. So we're bullish on our long-term. As I said, we're playing the long game at Sysco. The recipe for growth is working. Perks, Sysco Your Way, our improved website, our pricing capabilities, the physical infrastructure enhancements that I mentioned Neil was down in California last week looking at Riverside, which is our site that has our first electric trucks. We will be a leader in that space. You can envision a future where Manhattan blocks combustible engines going into Manhattan for delivery. Deliveries must be between midnight and 4 a.m. and need to be on an electric truck. Sysco will be prepared to do that faster than anyone in our industry. So we're pleased with our progress. We're proud that we just posted the most profitable quarter in the company's history. And obviously, the overall market from time-to-time, if there were some curveballs. And I mentioned a few of those at the beginning of today's prepared remarks. As it relates to 2024, Kenny, I'll toss to you for a final word.
Kenny Cheung: Yes. Good morning. So capital allocation strategy is positioned for growth at Sysco. We are positioned for growth, right? Return on invested capital, as I mentioned earlier, is the lens in which we will operate to ensure that we are getting optimized return for where we deploy capital and resources. So just a bit of my thought on capital allocation. We will, first and foremost, invest in business and growth. That's because capital investments as Kevin mentioned, technology, digital tools, fleet, buildings, infrastructure footprint right? This also includes specific for growth as well. So we – right now, Sysco has the luxury given the fact that we are generating robust free cash flow to invest in our company, but also return cash to shareholders as well. So right now, I believe that we are well positioned for growth in 2024, given the healthy balance sheet that we have, that allows us a lot of optionality and flexibility. 
Alex Slagle: Thank you. 
Kevin Hourican: Thank you, Alex.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately, we have reached our allotted time for today's conference call, so this will be concluded. We would like to thank everybody for participating, and we would ask you to please disconnect your lines.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-01-31 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to Sysco's Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. We will begin with opening remarks and introductions. I would now like to turn the call over to Kevin Kim, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Kevin Kim: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Sysco's Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Earnings Call.

If you have a follow-up question, we ask that you reenter the queue. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Hourican.
Kevin Hourican: Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining our call this morning. Our reported Q2 results, as displayed on Slide number 6, include positive case volume growth, continued share gains, strong double-digit sales and earnings growth year-over-year. This included operating income growth across each of our segments, including SYGMA and International. Importantly, gross profit growth this quarter outpaced operating expense, an important milestone that we expect to continue into the remainder of the year as we make progress in further improving our supply chain productivity.  In addition, we continue to advance forward our Recipe for Growth strategy with continued progress in our digital tools, supply chain investments in sales and merchandising initiatives. The progress that we are making will enable Sysco to better serve our customers and grow profitably for years to come.  As you can see on Chart number 7, we continue to succeed versus the overall industry growing1.35x the market in the first half of 2023. I'll break down the sales momentum versus the market further in a moment. Strong top and bottom line growth was delivered for the quarter with adjusted EPS in Q2 of $0.80. I'd like to provide you with some details on select items that impacted our results for the quarter. The first callout is within case volumes. We leveraged a third party to help with macro forecast of the industry's growth. For the second quarter, the projection was that the industry in total, would realize nearly 5% case growth year-over-year. In Q2, the actual industry case growth rate was only 1%, excluding Sysco. This 400 basis points of case volume variance was significant, especially within the local segment. A contributor to the softer volume result was the reality that the Omicron overlap did not lift the market growth rate in November and December as had been anticipated. With that said, it is important to note that we are seeing stronger volume growth in January. Additionally, a labor dispute that impacted three of our operating sites in the second quarter negatively impacted sales and case volumes during the October and November time frame. To be clear, the overall market growth rate is an industry-wide issue, while the labor dispute was a Sysco-specific challenge. The latter of the two issues is now firmly in the rearview mirror. We will monitor the second half of the year case volume trends very closely and we are taking specific actions to accelerate new customer acquisition in the local segment for the second half of this fiscal year given the softer overall market.  In addition to explaining the case volume dynamic, I would like to provide an update on operating expenses. As I mentioned, we are making solid progress with improving operating efficiency and we grew GP at a faster rate than expenses in the quarter, a sign of progress and a trend we expect to continue. We are making progress on improving supply chain productivity and I will discuss that further in a few minutes. With that said, the aforementioned labor dispute had a meaningful impact on our Q2 expenses. During this disruption we prioritized deliveries for essential customers, especially in the healthcare and education segments.  As a result, we took the actions required to ensure that we could continue operations in these three sites, including leveraging third-party resources when necessary. These customer service measures pressured our expenses for the quarter, negatively impacting operating income.  Again, this challenge is in the rearview mirror. On the positive side of the ledger, our contract bid business is exceeding plan on the top and bottom line for the year. Our sales teams are doing an excellent job with customer retention, customer acquisition and profitability management within bid contracts. In addition for our total business, our gross profit per case was strong for the quarter. Our sales and merchandizing teams are doing a solid job with inflation management and strategic sourcing. Additionally, our Sysco brand merchandizing team continues to do good work as we increased Sysco brand case penetration by 65 basis points in the quarter versus the prior year. As you know, each additional Sysco case adds to our profit rate and also positively impacts customer retention. From a sales and margin perspective, we continue to succeed by introducing higher-margin specialty products to our customers and we are winning new business in the higher growth produce segment. The success that we are having in GP per case is expected to continue into the second half of the year and that progress will help offset portions of the market volume softness. Lastly, we are doing a good job of managing expenses at our Global Support Center or corporate expenses putting measures into place mid-Q2 to lower spending in these GSE cost centers. Those measures will stay in place for the remainder of the fiscal year to offset the lower marketplace growth and to mitigate a potential future recession. Turning to the second half, we remain resolute on continuing to drive profitable share gains and drive supply chain operations efficiency improvements. On the operating side of the business, we are making progress on improving our productivity. We are delivering improved retention rates and as a result, lower hiring rates.  By hiring fewer people, we have been able to lower recruitment expenses, lower training expenses, and we are seeing increased productivity across warehouse and transportation roles. These improvements will accelerate into the second half of the year. We are fully staffed domestically and internationally and we have detailed work in place to ensure our staffing levels match our daily, weekly and monthly volumes. Q3 is typically the softest volume quarter of the year. and we are improving our flexibility in managing staff levels to lower volume periods, all while preparing for the highest volume quarter of the year,Q4. These staffing planning efforts are built into our year-to-go forecast. There are four factors that influence our full year guidance. Number one, softer than originally budgeted market volumes in the local segment, partially offset by Sysco growing 1.35 times faster than the market in total; number two, higher than originally planned operating expenses, while steadily improving; number three, favorable GP per case and strong margin management; number four, favorable GSE or corporate expenses. Given that we are now at the midpoint of the year and based upon the factors I just covered, we are adjusting our full year guidance. The full year is now guided to be a $0.15 range from $4 to $4.15, which represents year-over-year growth of approximately 23% to 28%, lapping the 126% growth from fiscal 2022. The midpoint of 407 represents a 15% growth rate versus 2019 levels.  As is my custom on these calls, I plan to share a bit more color on a few key Sysco initiatives that are driving performance. First, let me start with sales growth. For the first half of the year, Sysco grew 1.35 times the industry and we are on track to deliver our sales growth goal for the year. Our Recipe for Growth strategy is winning in the marketplace.  We are seeing solid growth in national restaurants, healthcare and our education segments. At the local level, we are winning business through our specialty programs: Produce, protein and Italian and through our customer growth initiatives, Sysco Your Way and Perks. Altogether, these sales wins are delivering compelling share gains. In the most recent quarter, we advanced dozens of additional Sysco Your Way neighborhoods, introduced Sysco Perks to thousands of customers and began the integration of our latest Italian acquisition in Southern California. The Italian distributor we acquired in Los Angeles, Concord Foods will be converted to the Greco business model shortly. We are planning for compelling sales and profit growth from that acquisition located in the second largest Italian markets in the country. We will continue to expand the Greco platform across the country through a combination of both organic and inorganic activities.  Topic two for today I'd like to discuss the state of our supply chain and highlight the status of some important work. I'll start by discussing our core operations environment and then I will highlight some of our strategic initiatives.  During the first quarter of 2023, we achieved fully staffed status across our network. During the second quarter, we were able to focus on colleague training, productivity and retention. I am pleased to report and shown on Chart 9 that we are making progress on retention and as a result, we will need to hire far fewer colleagues in the second half of this year. We are seeing the green shoots of progress that come from the reality of less hiring, like lower recruitment costs, lower hiring costs, lower training expenses and lower overtime percentages. We are also experiencing improved levels of productivity from our colleagues as they become more skilled in their roles. Our colleague workforce is still inexperienced versus our historical standards and therefore, productivity is still below historical standards.  However, we are making solid progress. We expect to make even more progress in the second half, enabling better flow-through from the top to the bottom line. Importantly, we grew gross profit dollars in Q2 at a faster rate than our expenses grew, creating a favorable leverage ratio. We expect to make even more progress in the second half of the fiscal year.  From a supply chain strategic initiatives perspective, we continued on our journey to enable profitable sales growth, improved service levels to customers and to be the most efficient distributor within the food service industry. Our omni-channel initiative is now live in our first test region. We are able to share inventory across two Sysco houses and we have enabled the ability to proactively leverage stocking strategies to improve service levels while lowering our overall level of working capital within the region.  As I have mentioned previously, this project will help us lower transportation expenses by ensuring that the last mile distribution to a customer comes from the most proximate DC location agnostic of where the inventory is staged or warehoused. Equally importantly, we continue to make progress with six day deliveries. We have moved meaningful business through Saturday delivery, enabling effective day balancing, increased flexibility and increased capacity utilization across each of our now six full shipping days. The progress of this initiative will position us well for the upcoming peak fourth quarter shipping volume and will enable us to continue winning net new business at the national and local levels. We are pleased to have the implementation in the rearview mirror and we are now focused on efficiency leverage and customer acquisition. These two projects are perfect examples of how Sysco is transforming supply chain management within food service distribution. Our supply chain will enable us to grow profitably for years to come.  I'll now turn it over to Neil, who will provide additional financial details.
Neil Russell: Thank you, Kevin, and hello, everyone. It's good to be with all of you, and I look forward to our ongoing discussions while I am in this interim role. During the second quarter, we delivered solid growth in both top and bottom line results and continued our balanced approach to capital allocation. All important elements of our Recipe for Growth as we further enhance competitive advantages for Sysco. I'll start with a summary of our second quarter results. Sales grew 13.9% with U.S. food service growing at13.7% and continued positive momentum for our International segment, which grew at 17%. Volumes for the U.S. foodservice segment, which includes our Broadline, FreshPoint U.S. produce, U.S. Italian and other specialty businesses, grew 5.2% and local case volumes increased 3.2%. Gross profit for the second quarter increased 15.9% to $3.3 billion versus last year with gross margin improving 29 basis points to 18%. Gross profit dollars per case grew in all four segments versus prior year marking the sixth consecutive quarter of such growth. Our gross profit and margin improvement during the second quarter reflected our ability to continue to effectively manage product inflation, which moderated to 8.3%, down sequentially from 9.7% during the first quarter at the total enterprise level. The improvement in gross profit per case was also driven by incremental progress from our strategic sourcing efforts as we continue to partner with our suppliers. Overall adjusted operating expenses were $2.7 billion for the quarter or 14.3% of sales, a 33 basis point improvement as a percentage of sales over the same quarter in the prior year. This quarter included transformation investments of $55 million and new colleague-related productivity costs of $22 million. This is an improvement compared to $63 million of transformational investments and $41 million of productivity costs in the first quarter. Snapback costs were reduced all the way down to zero during the second quarter. We are pleased with the sequential improvement we experienced in both snapback and productivity during the quarter. All four operating segments again showed increases in profitability year-over-year during our second quarter. As seen on Slide 15, adjusted operating income for the enterprise increased by 37.6% versus last year to $682 million. This is the highest adjusted operating income result for the second quarter in Sysco's history. Just a few years ago, our operating income was about one-third of the amount we achieved this year, an important signal of the progress being made at Sysco via our Recipe for Growth. It is worth noting that adjusted operating income for the quarter was generally in line with external expectations. Importantly, as Kevin shared in his introduction, this quarter marked an important milestone as gross profit dollar growth outpaced operating expense growth, illustrating the beginning of the anticipated leverage with more progress expected going forward. For the quarter, we grew adjusted EBITDA by 23.9% to $831 million. We are pleased with the continued top-line growth in the second quarter. Gross profit dollar growth outpaced operating expense growth and each of our segments generated substantial operating income growth. Our results this quarter were also impacted by three items, including: One, the impact of the labor dispute during the quarter at Sysco. We estimate this impacted our results by approximately $26 million during the second quarter. Second, as just mentioned, a continuation of productivity cost of $22 million directly related to the higher volume of new colleagues we hired over the past couple of quarters. The first two items are included in adjusted operating income. The third item was below the operating income line in other income and expense, which showed adjusted expenses up $26 million over the prior year. This increase in expense was primarily due to increased pension expenses, which were a result of higher interest rates. Regarding pension, we also completed a transfer of a portion of our pension liabilities in the second quarter, decreasing Sysco's plan size, risk and overall administrative costs while protecting retirees as they will now be in the hands of an A-rated insurance company. This transaction resulted in a non-cash charge in the second quarter of $315 million. In regard to the balance sheet, our strong investment-grade rated balance sheet remains a competitive advantage for Sysco, and we ended the quarter at three times net debt to adjusted EBITDA. In the first half of the year, we returned $268 million to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and paid our increased quarterly dividend, in total, returning $766 million to shareholders. As a reminder, specific to our debt, we remain well positioned in the current rising interest rate environment with approximately 95% of Sysco's debt being fixed rate at attractive rates. Let's turn to cash. Year-to-date, cash flow from operations for the quarter was $503 million, a $126 million improvement over the prior year. Net CapEx increased to $284 million as we continue to invest in our Recipe for Growth, particularly with respect to our planned investments in fleet and distribution facilities. Free cash flow increased to $219 million for the quarter. Working capital was a modest use of cash. We continue to monitor our inventory balances, as well as our accounts receivable given the economic environment. We ended the quarter with approximately $500 million in cash on hand and over $3 billion in total liquidity.  Lastly, looking ahead to the remainder of the year and beyond, as Kevin mentioned earlier, we are adjusting our full year EPS guidance range to $4 to $4.15 per share for fiscal year 2023. The midpoint of this range reflects our current business plan, including the three items I described earlier. The low end represents a further macroeconomic softness and potential subsequent reduction in food-away-from-home volume demand. The high end of the range represents an improved macro environment or outside Sysco performance. As we look toward the remainder of the fiscal year, we expect further improvements in productivity costs as the prior wave of new hires continues to ramp up in their roles. We also expect the second half of fiscal 2023 to reflect a similar trend of gross profit dollar growth outpacing operating expense growth. Now I would like to provide a brief update on the status of our sustainability and diversity, equity and inclusion work at Sysco. We issued our 2022 sustainability report and our DEI report in November. Sustainability is a key ingredient to our recipe for growth strategy to help ensure that we are growing responsibly and purposefully while leading our industry toward a more sustainable future. We are proud of the actions we continue to take to build a more sustainable future for Sysco and for our industry. It is through these actions that during the second quarter, our MSCI ESG rating was upgraded from BBB to A in their latest ratings assessment. This is a reflection of our ongoing work in sustainability across Sysco's three pillars of ESG: People, product and planet. Furthermore, Sysco aspires to create a global culture that is decidedly diverse, equitable and inclusive, one where we foster belonging as we care for one another and connect the world through food and trusted partnerships. Our recently issued DEI report takes a deeper look into our strategic approach to diversity, equity and inclusion at Sysco and our commitment to caring for people. Since accelerating our DEI efforts in early 2020, we've developed a three year road map to guide our DEI journey, as we embed our strategic priorities throughout the business and achieve our DEI goals. Importantly, we recently achieved our current 2025 workforce representation goal and have now established a cross-functional task force to develop new workforce representation goals as we move forward. All of these efforts are consistent with our purpose of connecting the world to share food and care for one another. Both of these reports can be found on sysco.com. The focus on sustainability and DEI is not only the right thing to do, it will also be good for business in the long term.  With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kevin for his closing remarks.
Kevin Hourican: Thank you, Neil. I appreciate all that you are doing for Sysco. As we conclude, I'd like to provide a brief summary on Slide 20. The following are our key takeaways from today's call: Our first half financial performance with a 15% increase in sales and a 26% increase in adjusted EPS displays the progress Sysco is making to win in the marketplace while we are transforming our business for the future. Our profit leverage improved in the second quarter and we expect that ratio to improve further in the second half of this fiscal year. We communicated today several factors that impacted Q2 profit results. Importantly, the labor dispute is behind us and we are making solid progress on improving our operating expenses.  On the sales and volume side of the ledger, our core growth initiatives are working as designed and we will focus on winning more new local customers in the second half of the year. Sysco has proven that we can win share when we make it a priority for our sales teams. Encouragingly, January volume growth is off to a strong start.  Lastly, Sysco remains deeply committed to our strong and stable balance sheet, disciplined capital allocation and delivering continued returns to our shareholders. Our status as a dividend aristocrat remains a priority and we are proud to carry that distinction going into our 54th year. We look forward to keeping you posted on our progress as a company and look forward to highlighting more about our longer-term initiatives at the CAGNY conference in a few short weeks. Lastly, I'd like to provide a brief update on the status of our CFO search. We are making solid progress. The interest level from highly qualified candidates has been very strong. We have a very compelling pool of talent to choose from and we are progressing along in the evaluation and selection process. I would like to thank Neil for the outstanding job he is doing as our interim CFO. He is a trusted partner and I greatly appreciate his leadership.  Operator, you can now open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Kelly Bania of BMO. Please go ahead. 
Kelly Bania: Hi, good morning. This is Kelly Bania. Thanks for taking our question. I was wondering if we could just talk a little bit more about the plan for the second half. It sounds like the labor dispute is clearly isolated to the quarter, but the other factors that you called out as contributing to the guidance update.  Maybe can you just help us understand what is in the plan for the second half as it relates to these factors, whether it's the below-the-line pension, the productivity, the local growth and maybe just a little more color in general on the local growth, what you think impacted that customer base? What you attribute this to? And what you're expecting in terms of market-based growth from independents in the back half? Thank you.
Kevin Hourican: Good morning, Kelly. Thank you for the questions. It's Kevin. I'll start with comments about the updated revised guidance. I'll talk about the local growth specific question and then I'll toss to Neil for the below the line components of your question. It's a good question and a lot to it. So we'll take it into each of those three parts.  The forecast that we revised today is what we would call a middle-of-the-road, center of the fairway forecast. It's our updated view given the conditions that we are operating within and the data that we have available to us.  I'd like to start with the comment on overall market growth. We do leverage a third-party firm to provide us guidance on what the overall market will be and as I said on my prepared remarks, the expectation was that for the quarter that disclosed that the market in total will be up five and the market in total, excluding Sysco was up one.  Now we budgeted for and are delivering more growth than the market. So we layer on top of the market growth 1.35 times from Sysco's specific performance. The good news is we are achieving that particular outcome. We are, in fact, delivering performance results greater than the market. It's the reality that the market itself is performing softer or lower than what had been expected.  I'll come back to that in a minute to answer the second part of your question. So that needed to be adjusted for the full year, which we have done. I'm not going to quote a specific local case volume growth for the second half, just to point you to our total guidance includes our updated view on the second half of the year.  Operating expenses, we've updated for the year to reflect the current rates of productivity, which are lower than what we had originally budgeted, but as I called out in my prepared remarks, we're making steady progress, green shoots of improvement. I call your attention to Slide 9 in our prepared slides, showing you the specific data that are the leading indicators of what will become cost per piece improvements and cost per piece reductions and we are making meaningful progress in supply chain productivity.  So we updated point two, which was our cost per piece shipped for the year to go. And then the labor dispute happened already, but it needed to be incorporated into our full year because the guide we provided today is a full year. And it was a $26 million operating income hit for the quarter, that's now closed. It is in the rearview mirror.  It is behind us, and that will not be repeated in the second half of the year. And the other income component, I'm going to toss to Neil in just a moment for him to explain its portion impact on the full year. Let me just address the softer growth rates, kind of what are the drivers of that? Why is it transpiring and then toss over to Neil.  I think it's a couple of factors, Kelly. Number one is 2022 actually ended up being stronger than what the third-party modeling component had expected. So my belief there is that some of the over delivery, if you will, on snapback of COVID recovery in 2022 soften some of the recovery in 2023. That's point number one. Point number two is inflation as many of the restaurant names reported at ICR a couple of weeks ago.  They are delivering strong top line results, but to put traffic in their own case volume metric, if you will, is flat to down nominally. And that, I believe, is reflective in the overall volume component, the impact of inflation. Number three, consumer sentiment, mindset relative to everything that's being written in the newspapers, et cetera, and how that impacts consumer behavior.  Last but not least, and I mentioned this in my prepared remarks, is Omicron we had expected and anticipated a bump in November and December tied to that rolling over last year's headwind and we didn't see that bump in November and December. It is reported on my call earlier this morning, though, that we are seeing strong year-over-year performance in January and that is a positive.  So when we put all of those things together, the best predictor of future outcomes are current outcomes, and we essentially took our current trends modeled them forward for the second half of the year, applied what we call center of the fairway view, loaded in our own views of risks and opportunities and the things that we can do to manage our business performance and therefore, updated our guidance and provide that clarity today.  I'll toss to Neil for comments about the below-the-line elements that impacted EPS.
Neil Russell: Hey, Kelly, good morning. Good to hear from you. Just a couple of points from me here. First of all, talking about some of the operating expenses we had, as I alluded to in my prepared comments, first of all, snapback costs, which we've talked about for the past several quarters to remind you going back, we are originally about $35 million then they were reduced to $29 million then to $10 million and now very pleased for the second quarter to be down to zero in that.  And similarly, for the productivity cost that we've talked about over the last few quarters, we had $41 million and then $41 million again and now down to $22 million for the second quarter. So we are seeing the reductions in both of those lines that we had previously alluded to and we feel like we're very much at a turning point for some of these operating costs and we would expect that momentum to continue into the second half of the year.  Addressing the below-the-line item specifically, what you saw in the second quarter, which was expense of about $15 million, I think is a fair representation of what we should expect per quarter for the remainder of the fiscal year. That's largely driven by pension expense, which has been influenced by interest rates.  And we feel like that's going to be a fairly stable number because, as you know, we transferred liabilities as part of a transfer plan that we did during the quarter. And as a result of doing that, we had to remeasure the plant and so because we remeasured the plan, we feel like that's going to be a fairly stable number for us. We won't remeasure the plan again until we get to the end of the year. So thanks very much for the question. Hopefully, that helps.
Kevin Hourican: Mitchell, let’s go to our next question please.
Operator: Yes sir. Your next question will come from Mark Carden of UBS. Please go ahead. 
Mark Carden: Good morning. Thanks so much for taking the question. So, I wanted to dig in a bit more on market share. You noted that you grew at 1.35x the market in 1H, which was a bit of a slowdown from last quarter's 1.4x pace. What in your view was most impactful in driving the slowdown relative to the market? Was it mainly competitors having more access to supply? Do the labor issues have much of an impact and what gives you the most confidence that share trends can accelerate again in the back half of the year? Thanks.
Kevin Hourican: Mark, thank you for the question. In aggregate, again, we're on track for the first half of the year. Our stated goal for the year is to grow 1.35 for the year and at the halfway point to be able to deliver that goal. You're right to point out that Q1 was stronger than Q2. The honest straight talk there is the labor disruption, which impacted three of Sysco's operating sites did, in fact, caused a disruption in the period of October and November from a market share perspective.  We have cleared that hurdle. We have moved on from that hurdle and we are confident in our ability in the second half of the year to grow 1.35x the market. So that is the reason for Q2 versus Q1, just being direct and straight about it. We are winning at the total level. We're winning on the what we call contract bid business and our initiatives within the local segment are working.  And those initiatives are the Italian platform that we are expanding, our growth in our specialty categories and that our customer-specific platforms of Sysco Your Way and Perks major initiatives are delivering the impact that we expect them to deliver and we're very focused on them.  As it relates to the second half of the year, what gives us confidence in our ability to deliver the full year. We've got the best trained sales associates in the industry, 5,000-plus strong in the U.S. alone, and they're very focused on penetrating lines with existing customers, and we're going to make new customer acquisition, a bigger priority for our sales reps in the second half of the year given the overall market conditions as we're seeing them. And our sales force is very responsive to their compensation program.  And I believe I've shared on prior calls how that program works, the base plus bonus and the bonus is configurable by us. We can tweak it, and we can adjust it and we can make modifications to it. And one of those adjustments for the second half of the year will be to increase the weight on focusing on what we call prospecting or new customer penetration.  So I answer the Q2, and we have confidence in our ability to win versus the marketplace. And in aggregate, what we're looking for in the revised guidance – we provided today, the midpoint of 4.07%, just to keep in perspective is a 25% growth over prior year and it's a 15% growth over 2019, which is the peak profitability year of the company. So, all in, in aggregate, really strong year from Sysco in total.
Mark Carden: All right. Thanks so much and good luck.
Kevin Hourican: Thank you, Mark.
Operator: Your next question will come from Edward Kelly of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. 
Edward Kelly: Hi guys. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the cost side and what's embedded in the guidance again. I know when you set your initial guidance this year, there – the low-end incorporated some risk of a, I guess, modest recession. Obviously, the definition of that is debatable. But it does seem like the revision has a lot more to do with the cost side.  And my question for you is, how much improvement is embedded from here from a cost perspective? And how much visibility do you have on achieving that improvement, which, ultimately, sort of relates to how confidence in your guidance at this point with this adjustment. And then, as a follow-up to that, how does what's happening in 2023 reflect the goal of 462 plus in fiscal 2024 from an EPS standpoint? Thank you.
Kevin Hourican: Ed, good morning. Thank you for the question. As it relates to OpEx I repeat a couple of the numbers that Neil communicated and then provide a little more color on why we have confidence in our ability to drive the improvement in the second half of the year. Toss to Neil for any additional color or comments about the overall confidence that we have in the forecast for the year. Snap back has been taken to 0, and that was a material number a year ago and big progress has been made.  We're no longer needing to do things like hiring bonuses and referral bonuses and the marketing spend that we were doing to create awareness of jobs. So Snapback has gone to zero. The productivity piece, and that's specifically measured as excess over time, if you will, has gone from $41 million in Q1 to $22 million in Q2 and we expect for that to continue.  I point you to Slide 9, Ed, and I put that chart in there on purpose to show you the progress in the collective community, the progress we're making on retention improvement and how that retention improvement will, therefore drive transportation, as well as warehouse operations metrics. We have finite data, real-time data, weekly data, I host a weekly call, talking about our productivity at the site level that all of our key leaders attend and we have a firm understanding of where we are and where we need to be week-over-week, month-over-month, quarter-over-quarter to hit the full year.  So we updated our guidance today to reflect the fact that, yes, our operating costs in the second half of the year will be higher than what we originally budgeted, but an improvement from where we stand here today at the end of Q2 and we're seeing the progress that needs to be made in order for us to be able to deliver the full year and it has my personal full attention and the full attention of all of our leaders Neil will toss to you for any additional comments.
Neil Russell: Thanks, Kevin. Hey, Ed, good morning. Two things, Ed. First of all, on the FY 2023 portion of your question, we completely rebuilt the forecast as part of the process here and gratitude to the finance team for all the good work over the last several weeks to do that. As I alluded to, we feel very good about a few things that we rebuilt and are in there.  As Kevin alluded to in his comments, the labor activity expense impact of $26 million is in the rearview mirror, but obviously, that factored into the adjustment that we did. The pension expense that I just spoke about, we remeasured the plans, we have high confidence and what we think those numbers will be going forward.  I also mentioned things like the productivity and snapback cost that Kevin just alluded to that we feel very good about the turning point, if you will, that we see on those types of cost items. So we looked at the market, we looked at everything we have, and we have pretty high confidence in the numbers in which we're offering to you for the rest of this year.  As it pertains to the second part of your question for next year, fiscal 2024, we're at the halfway point here in FY 2023. We feel really good about the progress we're making across the enterprise. We continue to gain share as we've talked about. We're driving really compelling returns through the Recipe for Growth initiatives including a lot of really good operating efficiency.  That's part of the slide Kevin referred you to and our long-term plans reflect double-digit growth in both top and bottom line and along the way, we're returning a lot of value to shareholders through the dividend, share repurchase and of course, the profit growth. So we would typically update the next year during the summer as we look at the end of year results for us and that will be our plan for now. So we'll take a look at fiscal 2024 numbers when were port our end of year 2023 numbers.
Edward Kelly: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from Jeffrey Bernstein of Barclays. Please go ahead. 
Jeffrey Bernstein: Thank you very much. Just following up on the most recent softening you mentioned. I know there was some talk about how operating expenses have perhaps surprised you to the upside. I was hoping the shift to the market volume softness you mentioned. Just wondering how much of that you think is unique to Sysco or perhaps unique to specific product lines or geographies?  I know you mentioned that you're still outpacing the industry, but it doesn't seem like the restaurants or other customers that we hear from are really talking about as lowdown and in fact, we're talking about a little bit of a benefit from the Omicron lapse. I am just wondering if you can offer some detail on where you think the the softness came from and then whether your guidance assumes softness continues.  I know you said January is looking better. I wasn't sure whether you're extrapolating that better January trend in the back half of the year assumption. Thank you.
Kevin Hourican: Hey Jeff, thanks, it's Kevin. I'll start with your question. Just as it relates to Sysco versus the market, I'll just point to the most important of facts, which is that we grew in the most recent quarter, 1.35 times the market. So it is – Sysco is outperforming versus the market and that outperforming is coming from across the board, business health. We are winning meaningfully in the CMU segments: Education, healthcare, contract bid within the restaurant sector and the gross profit rate and that sector has also been strong and has been ahead of where we expected it to be.  At the local level, our business performance in total is being driven by our core growth initiatives within local that I referenced earlier. So this is not a Sysco-specific situation. It is a macro and we're actually pleased with our performance relative to the market. The only thing in the most recent quarter that was specific to Sysco was the labor dispute in three of our sites, which meaningfully pressured our operating expenses. We've size that for the investment community today to communicate.  That was a $26 million operating income hit for the quarter, which was a combination of expenses and also sales and therefore, flow through to margin impact from the three markets that were impacted by that labor disruption. So as it was called out by one of the other questions earlier on this call, our Q2 growth versus the market was a little bits lower than our Q1 growth, but we still grew meaningfully versus the industry.  As it relates to the second half of the year and then I'll toss to Neil if he has anything additional. We have been thoughtful about the full year volume. As Neil said, we took a big step back at the midway point, turned over every rock, looked at every component of our build of the full year budget and compared it to the trends of the business performance and we applied for the second half of the year, the trends of our business with known trend vendors that we - Sysco can positively impact, the operating expense that Ed just asked about is a projected improvement in the second half of the year.  But we've been thoughtful about volumes looking at the second half. And no, the January strength I referenced was not contemplated at the time that we built that second half. The Omicron tailwind will abate here quickly in February.  As you know, things began to reopen in the middle of February to the tail end of February and the forecast adjustment that we provided today is our best view of the full year center of the fairway, as I mentioned. Neil, over to you for any additional comments.
Neil Russell: Yes. Thanks, Kevin. Hey, Jeff, good to hear from you, as well. Just a couple of points from me. To answer your question, yes, we have factored in current performance to the year-to-go guide. One additional item I would point out to you is we've had improvement in our Sysco brand penetration, which we're very pleased with.  That team has been doing a very good job, further penetrating both current accounts and new accounts with our Sysco brand product, which, of course, is a higher-margin product. So we see that momentum we're factoring that into our guide as well.  So we do have good confidence in the year to go look that we have in the numbers we offered and just a reminder for those, the guide, the midpoint that we offered today is a 25% year-over-year growth and a 15% growth over 2019. So we like what we see there and we have really high confidence in that guidance.
Operator: Your next question comes from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. 
John Heinbockel: Hey, Kevin, a couple of things. On the local business, what are you seeing with drop size and profitability per stop right? What are the trends there? What's the thought on the your way rollout, right? How quickly can you roll that out? I know the target was to get to $1 billion of incremental revenue, how quickly can that be done?  And then just lastly, the contract bid. I know that's very lumpy. Do you think that is abnormally – the opportunity abnormally large over the next year or pretty much in line with what it had been?
Kevin Hourican: Hey, good morning, John. Thank you for the questions. I'll take them in order. On the local business, drop size, I think just as evidenced by the data that we've shared has been a bit softer than what we had expected on a cases per operator perspective. Now there is work we can do about that. We have the ability to target our sales reps to win back lost cases or introduced new categories through a customer that has not purchased them before, like produce and protein, and we call that team-based selling, and we're getting better and better at doing that type of work.  Profitability per customer, we're actually pleased with those metrics and where we are. We've done a nice job managing the inflation path through our Sysco brand win that Neil talked about is notable and significant and that meaningfully helps on profit per customer and we've done quality work with transportation routing over the last 45 days to make sure we're being as efficient as possible on our routes, especially for smaller customers and that has provided us with benefit as well.  All of those variables that I just described have been built into the full year forecast that we submitted today. Those are my comments on local. For Sysco Your Way, we couldn't be more pleased with the performance of Sysco Your Way. Each individual neighborhood that we add to the program continues to perform like the initial markets did.  That's one of my worries as we scale this thing as we add it to more neighborhoods. There's a halt or effect when you have a pilot program where the performance is outstanding. But when you go to scale, it cannot replicate. We're definitively proving that we can replicate that performance. It is material and significant. And how fast can we go? We're going as fast as prudent, John.  There is work that has to be done at the operating site to prepare that site to support a very lead late in the evening, ordering cut-off twice per day delivery, a dedicated consistent driver, dedicated consistent sales reps. So there is customer remapping that has to occur. And we're going at the fastest pace that's prudent because what we can't do is compromise the service experience because what's making this program work the step change level of service that we're providing to those customers and it's not an incremental operating cost for Sysco because these are such dense neighborhoods that are in reasonable close proximity to our warehouses.  So – and it's expanded internationally. We're now live in Toronto. We're live in Dublin. We're live in London, and soon, we will be launching in Stockholm. So it just shows you the breadth of this program is not just domestic U.S. It's working everywhere. We have launched it, and we couldn't be more pleased. We're also very pleased with Sysco Perks. Remember, Sysco Perks is not about restaurant dense neighborhoods, is Sysco Perks is a VIP program.  It's an invitation-only program for our best of customers, and we provide them Sysco Your Way like benefits, but they're unique to that one specific customer. So that's the first customer who's not inside a Sysco Your Way neighborhood and we're seeing significant lift in profitability and top line growth with customers that are invited into that program and we have meaningfully expanded the rollout of Sysco Your Way – excuse me, Sysco Perks over the last quarter.  The last of your three questions was in contract bid. I'm really pleased with our team, both in sales and supply chain in this segment. We've got a great sales leadership team. They've done excellent work with customer retention, customer prospecting. We are winning outsized business. We stopped reporting the number, but the last time I quoted it, we were at net $2 billion worth of incremental business, and we've continued to win net new business in the health care, education and national restaurant space. You asked me a specific question, you see outsized growth coming from that sector.  We plan for growth across all of our sectors. And one of the reasons we converted to a 6-day delivery model is so that we have the ability to support that growth without having to make building expansions or building investments. We real feel increased our throughput capacity by 15% across Sysco by converting to a full six day delivery model.  So really pleased with our success rate and contract bid. I expect for that success to continue in the forward-facing years. I am going to talk to Neil. He wants to add one more point. Sorry, John, I step down you I'm going to toss it to Neil for one more point.
Neil Russell: Hey John, I just want to put a proof point out there to wrap up what Kevin was talking about. I'll bring you back to the slide presentation in Page 9. In looking at our U.S. Broadline business sequentially, second quarter versus prior first quarter, our delivery pieces per hour for our driver universe 500 basis point improvement and then in the warehouse, in the selector position, a 600 basis point improvement in what we're seeing there.  So all these initiatives wrap together are really driving good momentum across both top line and bottom line and how we're managing it. I think it's a really good proof point. A lot of the initiatives Kevin was just walking you through.
John Heinbockel: Thank you.
Kevin Hourican: Thanks, John.
Operator: Your next question comes from Lauren Silberman of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. 
Lauren Silberman: Thank you, very much. I wanted to ask a quick follow-up on the EPS and then ask a question. But I understand there's a few moving pieces in the second quarter. Looking at the second half of the year, I guess what's driving the reduction in the guide relative to what you expected in the beginning of the year? I just want to have a better understanding of that.  And then, Kevin, I know you mentioned engaging in specific actions to accelerate local case growth in the second half of the year. I guess, one, what are those actions? And the genesis of the question is, just given the softness that you've talked about in the environment, do you expect the category to get more promotional or competitive in the back half of the year as everyone tries to sort of grow market share? Thank you.
Neil Russell: Hey, Lauren, it's Neil. I'll start and then I'll pass to Kevin. Let me talk about the EPS and the guidance first. There are a few factors that came into play for our adjustment. As I mentioned, we totally and completely rebuilt the forecast based on a few different things. First of all, the market environment that Kevin referenced in his prepared comments and having a clean, good view to where we think the market is right now and headed for the next couple of quarters.  On the cost side of the equation, as we talked about the impact of the labor dispute, putting that into the numbers looking at the pension expense, now that we've remeasured the plan at the midpoint of the year, knowing that that will continue forward as I mentioned, that about $15 million of expense that you saw down below the line, carrying forward again in Q3 and again in Q4.  And even though improvement, we still have some of those productivity costs that we are carrying and our best view on that. So taking all those factors into consideration, the market environment, some of these expenses, that is what went into the updated guidance and therefore, our confidence that we feel very good about that new number. And then Kevin, over to you.
Kevin Hourican: Sure. Lauren, thank you for the question. I do want to be very clear that we are growing volume and we posted a performance result in the most recent quarter. Our total volume growth was plus 5.2. Local volume growth was plus 3.2. What the facts are, we are growing faster than the market. The reality is that the overall market was expected to be mid-single digits and then we would have been in the high single digits with our growth on top of that.  It's now the total market is low single digits. We're growing in mid-single digits. So it's meaningful growth. It's just not the growth that we had budgeted essentially this time, a year ago, leveraging third-party data. So again, growing, and this is a very large business, $350 billion business. We have 17% market share.  We are meaningfully confident in our ability to grow versus the market to take share and to deliver compounded growth on an annual basis on the top line and bottom line. We'll talk more about that in August as Neil said. What are the types of actions that we can take? And then you asked a very specific question, are we worried about deep discounting?  I am not worried about deep discounting. That is not the recipe for success in this industry. Leading with price is not sticky, leading with price is able to be copied by others. We're going to lead with service differentiation through Sysco Your Way, through Perks, through our Italian platform expansion and we are going to be very clear on allocating our sales reps time to spend more time with new customer prospecting, but that does not imply that price is the lever.  It's calling upon a customer that you've not served before. It's bringing in a specialty produce expert to penetrate produce in a category that hasn't purchased it before. It's introducing one of our Buckhead Meats premium protein specialist to a customer who's not buying premium protein, but yet we offer the best product in the industry, et cetera.  So it's about in the second half of the year, leveraging our growth initiatives, they're working and we can accelerate those initiatives of Perks, Sysco Your Way, Italian and allocation of time and our sales reps can spend more of their time with prospecting new and penetrating further with existing and we're getting better and better at that.  I've net spoken a lot about digital tools today, but we've enhanced our website to make it more clear to customers who have not purchased a product from us before. We're providing them even better suggestions on you might also consider the following that technology gets easier to use and better over time.  We are now able to push promotional e-mails to our customer, articulating to them products that would be compelling to them and providing them a short-term discount in order to make it interesting to them to give that product to try, but those are levers that are new-ish to Sysco, leveraging e-mail, leveraging techs, leveraging our digital tools and the capability of targeting our sales reps to the right customer prospects with a preapproved deal that's compelling to the customer, but underwritten by Sysco Finance as compelling and profitable for us. .
Operator: Your next question comes from Alex Slagle of Jefferies. Please go ahead. 
Alexander Slagle: All right. Thank you. Good morning. Just wondering how the opportunity for additional cost out actions gets reflected in the new outlook. If you could comment on the pace of these opportunities maybe beyond the [Indiscernible] or so realized to-date?
Neil Russell: Hey, Alex, good morning. It's Neil. I'll take that one. As you alluded to, we are well north of the original goal of $750 million of cost out, which we feel very good about and we continue to make progress in that area. Largely speaking, these cost-out initiatives are helping to fund our investments for future growth and we feel very good about the long-term capabilities through some of the digital tools that Kevin just referenced for us to be able to have a good long-term platform for sustainable growth.  We're well north of the $750 million. We're working on what the next iteration of that will be, and we look forward to sharing what future cost out numbers can be on top of the $750 million that we've already exceeded. Go ahead, Kevin.
Kevin Hourican: Yes. So Neil, just did a good job talking about structural cost out and what I want to talk about is just operational cost. The biggest focus in the second half of the year has brought out through a couple of prior questions is the ability to continue to make progress in improving productivity. I haven't spoken about the strategic initiative side of those efforts during Q&A.  I just want to reinforce the importance of our driver academy. It's now nationwide and all hired drivers now go through the Sysco Driver Academy. If they don't have a CDL, they can become CDL certified. If they have a CDL, they get expert training and Sysco work practices and safety programs. So that training program is meaningfully working.  The retention and therefore lack of turnover for the people that are going through that program is meaningful. And as time goes on, the percentage of our associate population that has gone through that training program increases and then the retention value from that will grow over time.  So we're very, very pleased with the improvement in retention from our driver program and that will result in higher productivity into the future, because we're really good at training our associates when they're going through that program and also when they're with us and the more tenured they are, the more productive they are, the more safe they work and that is a positive to our forward-facing outcomes.  And we're building new muscle in regards to staffing that I talked about earlier. We're doing a better job of forward-facing planning on peak window periods, lower volume window periods and having more staffing flexibility so that we can be more nimble for the business up and down trends so that our cost per piece can improve over time tied to that improved staffing level and we're getting much better at that.
Alexander Slagle: Thanks.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we have reached the allotted time for today's conference. We would like to thank everybody for participating and ask that you kindly disconnect your lines.

===== 2023 Q1  (2022-11-01 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to Sysco’s First Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Conference Call. As a reminder, today’s call is being recorded. We will begin with opening remarks and introductions. I would like to turn the call over to Kevin Kim, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Kevin Kim: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Sysco’s first quarter fiscal year 2023 earnings call. On today’s call, we have Kevin Hourican, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Aaron Alt, our Chief Financial Officer; and Neil Russell, our SVP of Corporate Affairs and Chief Communications Officer. Before we begin, please note that statements made during this presentation, which state the company’s or management’s intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, and actual results could differ in a material manner. Additional information about factors that could cause results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company’s SEC filings. This includes, but is not limited to, risk factors contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 2, 2022, subsequent SEC filings and in the news release issued earlier this morning. A copy of these materials can be found in the Investors section of our website at sysco.com. Non-GAAP financial measures are included in our comments today and in our presentation slides. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures is included at the end of the presentation slides and can be found in the Investors section of our website. To ensure that we have sufficient time to answer all questions, we’d like to ask each participant to limit themselves to one question today. If you have any follow-up questions, we ask that you reenter into the queue. At this time, we’d like to turn the call over to Kevin Hourican.
Kevin Hourican: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. Our Q1 results reflected continued positive momentum in our business to start the fiscal year. Our share gains continued this quarter as we posted sales growth of more than 1.4 times the industry. We delivered double-digit growth in the top line and bottom line of our business. Beginning with the top line, we delivered sales growth of 16.2%, driven by a combination of effectively managing inflation and delivering case volume growth. Our U.S. Foodservice volumes and local case volumes continued to grow this quarter. Turning to the bottom line, double-digit growth across operating income and net income resulted in adjusted earnings per share of $0.97, which was in line with our expectations. The strong start to the year gives us confidence in reaffirming our full year guidance. I will highlight two topics during our call today. First, I will put into context Sysco’s sales and volume growth for the quarter by highlighting some of the drivers of our strength. Second, I will detail our progress within our supply chain and our efforts to improve service levels and operations cost efficiency. So let’s get started with our unique position of strength in a growing industry displayed on Slide 7. Beginning with the Foodservice industry, the total addressable market is approximately $350 billion. Sysco grew 17% and the rest of the market grew 12% in the quarter, a strong start to the fiscal year. Restaurants continued to be resilient and our travel hospitality, plus our business and industry segments of our business posted year-on-year improvements. We see continued strength coming as tailwinds in the non-commercial sector should continue. We are closely monitoring macroeconomic conditions for signs of a business slowdown. At this time, we are not seeing recession concerns negatively impacting our business outcomes. With that said, we are prepared to take additional cost reduction actions if or when the recession does begin to impact our P&L. In the backdrop of what has been a strengthening overall market, Sysco continues to outperform. Our sales teams continue to win market share, with Q1 being one of our strongest quarters of net new customer wins. Our national sales team posted an outstanding quarter, winning substantial new business in the education, health care and restaurant sectors. These wins are on top of the more than $2 billion of net new national sales wins delivered over the past two years. It is important to note that we are winning this business at strong profit profiles versus historical averages and these are multi-year contracts. In addition to our success with national sales, our Recipe For Growth is delivering results for Sysco at the local level. Local case volume for the quarter grew 5.4% versus Q1 of 2022, successfully lapping a 26.7% increase from the prior year. Our strong start to the year in national and local sales has us gaining market share overall as we grew more than 1.4 times the market for the period. As a result, we are on track to deliver our stated growth objective for the year. As seen on Slide 8, our Recipe For Growth includes five pillars, focused on building new capabilities that will further enable our leadership position in supply chain and food sales and marketing. As is customary for our quarterly updates, I would like to highlight a couple of our growth drivers. Today, I will highlight progress that we are making in the products and solutions pillar with our Sysco Your Way program, and I will also provide an update on select future horizons work. Within our Products and Solutions growth pillar, we meaningfully advanced our Sysco Your Way program over the past quarter. As a reminder, Sysco Your Way is our service and delivery model for what we call restaurant dense neighborhoods. Think a large number of restaurants and a few block radius. We provide these neighborhoods with a next level of service from Sysco. Examples of that service include a late in the evening order cut off, daily delivery service, dedicated sales and delivery partner representation and additional white glove culinary and marketing services. The constructs of the Sysco Your Way program were developed in partnership with our customers. And as a result, customers are responding favorably. The top and bottom line results from the program are exceeding our expectations. We are winning substantial new customers within these neighborhoods and existing customers are buying more product on a weekly basis. Over the past quarter, we ramped up our implementation efforts, and we will continue to roll out the program to applicable neighborhoods in the coming quarters. We are also bringing the program to international cities with recent implementations in Toronto and Dublin. The scale of Sysco Your Way’s impact on our overall results will grow each quarter as we add net new neighborhoods. From our future horizons growth pillar, we are pleased to announce that we have closed on two independent Italian distributor acquisitions over the past quarter. These acquisitions will give us access to premium Italian products in areas that were previously geographic white spaces for Sysco. We have plans to meaningfully scale these businesses by bringing the Greco go-to-market Italian selling strategy to these geographies. We are very pleased with the status of our work to expand Sysco’s Italian specialty platform nationally. In addition to these two examples highlighted today, we are advancing our Recipe For Growth within our International segment as well. Canada, our largest international business is also making good progress with these initiatives. This year in Canada, we will be upgrading our digital platforms, implementing a modern pricing tool, enhancing our team-based selling capabilities and launching Sysco Your Way. Canada is already a large and profitable market for Sysco that generated over $5 billion of sales last year, while posting number one market share at 17%. The Recipe for Growth strategy will enable our Canadian business to further enhance our competitive advantages and better serve our customers. I’m very excited for the progress that we will be making in Canada to deliver profitable sales growth. These are just a few examples of the good work that is happening, and I look forward to keeping you posted on our domestic and international progress across the five pillars in future quarterly calls. Topic two for today, I’d like to discuss the state of our supply chain improvement and highlight the status of some important work. Our global supply chain work continues to progress. We are simultaneously building on our long-term strategic initiatives like omni-channel while improving productivity levels and cost performance within our supply chain. Our strategic initiatives continue to move forward with six-day deliveries, improving the driver experience, implementing best-in-class associate training and omni-channel fulfillment, all advancing forward in the quarter, and we can see the early signs of progress that these initiatives are delivering. As they progress, they will enable profitable sales growth and improve our supply chain cost efficiency. Our supply chain is a strategic differentiator and the strategic work we are doing will widen that competitive moat in the coming quarters and years. Simply put, no one is doing more than Sysco to improve service levels to customers and to improve cost efficiencies within the Foodservice supply chain. In addition to advancing our strategic initiatives, our teams have remained relentlessly focused on improving productivity in the near-term. We made progress over the past quarter in improving associate retention. Retention improvement will enable us to improve associate productivity, and therefore, lower our operating costs in future quarters. It is important to understand that Sysco’s staffing levels remain healthy across our sites. We are staffed properly to support our current business and also to enable future profitable growth. Given our overall staffing health, we are meaningfully focused on associate retention and best-in-class training of our newer associates to improve productivity levels. We are also teaching our supervisors how to leverage our engineered labor standards to deliver performance-based coaching. As our staffing levels have improved in recent quarters, we have been able to spend more of our leadership time and communication muscle on training to our work methods and standards. And this is where the intersection between our future strategy and our current improvement efforts intersect. A driver academy is graduating cohorts of trainees that are now hitting the streets. These drivers are already showing strong service, safety and productivity standards. As importantly, we are tracking retention by training class, and we can see meaningfully higher retention rates of associates trained by Sysco versus hired from the external market. Over time, the percentage of associates trained from within Sysco will grow, and this ratio growth will improve retention and productivity. Cost of turnover is high in this industry, and improving associate retention is imperative. I’m confident that our training academies will give Sysco a meaningful advantage in the industry. We believe the advancements we are making in our physical capabilities and the investments we are making in improved training will provide improved service levels to our customers and strengthen Sysco’s ability to profitably win market share in the coming quarters and years. I’ll now turn it over to Neil, who will provide an update on our sustainability efforts. Neil, over to you.
Neil Russell: Thanks, Kevin, and hello, everyone. Today, I would like to provide a brief update on the status of our sustainability work at Sysco. As we have mentioned, our efforts are anchored around three pillars: people, products, and planet. We are proud that Sysco was a partner organization at the recent White House Conference on hunger, nutrition and health. At the conference, Sysco’s sustainability efforts were recognized for our previously communicated $500 million commitment to global good in our communities by 2025. This includes a donation of 200 million meals to 500 million, cash donations to food banks and volunteer hours associated with our colleagues actively participating in the communities we serve. Earlier this year, our Board also approved plans to include ESG and DEI metrics in our annual incentive plan and important best practice. Every leader at Sysco is now held accountable to making tangible progress on both DEI and climate change efforts for the company, directly impacting our own compensation. These efforts are consistent with our purpose of connecting the world to share food and care for one another. This focus is not only the right thing to do, it will be good for business in the long-term. As I have explained recently to investors, the majority of Sysco’s greenhouse gas emissions are the Scope 3 emissions of our customers. Many of our largest customers have set forth their own climate commitments and Sysco’s improvement will help enable those partners to achieve their goals. I will now turn it over to Aaron, who will provide additional financial details.
Aaron Alt: Thank you, Kevin, and Neil, and good morning. The Sysco team delivered another quarter of progress with our recipe for growth, resulting in growth across volume, sales and profit giving us many reasons to be upbeat about our business while being appropriately cautious given the complex operating environment. Turning to a summary of our Q1 reported results, Q1 was the highest sales quarter at Sysco ever. We achieved 16.2% sales growth at Sysco for the quarter, with U.S. Foodservice growing at 17.2% and international growing at 13.4%. Reflecting our focus on serving our local and independent customers through both our Broadline and specialty businesses, we are expanding our disclosure of total and local case volumes to, in aggregate, include our FreshPoint U.S. produce, U.S. Italian and other specialty businesses in the metrics. For clarity, our specialty meats business is not yet in this metric as it measures volume in pounds. With respect to volume, total U.S. Foodservice volume increased 7.3% compared to last year. All in, our inclusive local case volumes grew by 5.4% in Q1 2023 over the prior year’s comparable period in the U.S. You can see the history of this metric on Slide 18 compared to the prior year and the 2019 levels. We banked $3.5 billion in adjusted gross profit for the quarter, up 17.3% versus last year. Adjusted gross margin improved 17 basis points to 18.2% for the first quarter. GP per case grew in all four segments versus prior year, marking the fifth consecutive quarter of such growth. Our gross profit and margin improvement reflected our ability to continue to manage product inflation, which was at 9.7% at the total enterprise level, consistent with our guidance as well as incremental progress from our strategic sourcing efforts as we continue to partner with our suppliers. U.S. Broadline inflation was 12% in the quarter. Our inflation metric is in dollars, so the enterprise metric was reduced by the local currency declines against the dollar. Overall adjusted operating expenses were $2.7 billion for the quarter or 14.2% of our sales, a 30 basis point increase as a percentage of sales over the same quarter in the prior year. Cost this quarter increased in workers’ compensation, pension expense, health care and some operational elements like shrink, all of which are being addressed. We have more to do in this area but believe that our supply chain and North American teams has Sysco on the path to improving our operating expense profile. Additionally, this quarter included progress against capturing cost out which represents incremental efforts on top of the more than $750 million of cumulative cost out. Recall that last quarter, we outlined expectations for operating costs to be more heavily weighted in the first half based on the need to work through operating cost inflation, operating productivity challenges and our planned investments in the business. Consistent with that, this quarter included transformation investments of $63 million and new associate related productivity costs of $41 million and an improvement in snapback costs, which are becoming immaterial. All four segments showed increases in profitability year-over-year with SYGMA returning to profitability from the prior year’s modest loss in Q1. Additionally, adjusted operating income in our International segment grew over the prior year also exceeding pre-COVID 2019 levels. Adjusted operating income for the enterprise increased by 12.4% versus last year to $770 million. We grew adjusted EBITDA by 7.5% to $917 million. We often refer to exceeding fiscal 2019 adjusted EPS levels as part of our long-term guidance. It is worth noting that in the first quarter, adjusted earnings per share increased by 16.9% over prior year and for the first time since the onset of COVID exceeded adjusted EPS from the same quarter in fiscal 2019 by $0.06. Applying a macro financial lens, I will point out two financial factors that had an impact on profitability this quarter different from recent years. First, the weakening of local currencies against the U.S. dollar in our international operations. Second, an increase in pension expense tied to the rapid rise in interest rates. In total, those two externalities had a $0.03 negative impact on GAAP and adjusted EPS. On the pension point, to be clear, our largely frozen pension plan remains fully funded and the above reflects the non-cash impact of pension accounting that is a result of extreme movements in the global capital markets. You may have noticed an 8-K about a pension liability transfer exercise in October, subsequent to the end of our first quarter. That transaction decreases Sysco’s plan size, risk and overall administrative costs while protecting retirees as they will be in the hands of an A-rated insurance company. This transaction will result in a non-cash charge in Q2 of $250 million to $300 million, which we expect to be a certain item. Other than the certain items, we expect the income statement impact of the transaction to be largely immaterial to our year. In regards to the balance sheet, our strong investment-grade rated balance sheet remains a competitive advantage for us and we ended the quarter at 3.1 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA. We returned $268 million to shareholders in the form of share repurchase and paid our increased quarterly dividend, returning $517 million in total to shareholders this past quarter. Had we not executed the early share repurchase, our leverage ratio would have been three times. Given the focus on interest rates slightly, I want to remind listeners that approximately 95% of Sysco’s debt is fixed rate. Let’s turn to cash. Recall that the first quarter is typically the quarter in which we have the lowest in-quarter cash flow generation. This year, for the first quarter, cash flow from operations for the quarter was $158.6 million, a $48 million improvement over the prior year. However, net CapEx almost doubled in Q1 of fiscal 2023 to $145 million as we continue to invest in our Recipe For Growth, particularly with respect to our planned investments in fleet and distribution notes. As a result, free cash flow was $14 million for the quarter. Working capital was a use of cash, though we are watching our inventory balances closely as part of our supply chain transformation and are monitoring our accounts receivable closely given the economic environment. We ended the quarter with approximately $438 million in cash on hand. Let’s return to the look forward. As I said at the start of my remarks, we are upbeat about our business while remaining appropriately cautious given the operating environment. While we have work to do on our expense structure, as Kevin called out, Sysco has not yet seen any broad impact on our business from concerns around the risk of recession impacting consumer behavior. As a result, we are sticking with our full year guidance for fiscal year 2023 for adjusted EPS of $4.09 to $4.39. As Kevin mentioned earlier, we are well-positioned and prepared to operate through another dynamic year. We have a plan, and our team is executing against it with the benefit of all the learnings that our company and our industry have worked through in the last couple of years. Lastly, I hope you noticed that we are reporting Q1 a week early. As part of our transformation efforts, we have worked to accelerate our financial close process, increasing the speed of fine data to faster decisions and looking forward, not back. We plan to report earnings faster than our historical cadence for the remainder of the fiscal year. With that, I will turn the call back over to Kevin for closing remarks.
Kevin Hourican: Thank you, Aaron. As we conclude, I’d like to provide everyone with a brief summary on Slide 20. We plan to build on our position of strength in fiscal year 2023 and beyond. Our key takeaways from today reflect three points. We advanced our Recipe For Growth strategy, and we are on target to grow more than 1.35 times the market in a growing U.S. market. Our financial results this quarter reflected double-digit top and bottom line growth in the backdrop of a large industry that has proven resilient during very challenging macro conditions. Sysco is taking share profitably in a growing industry. Lastly, Sysco remains deeply committed to our strong investment-grade credit rating, a strong and stable balance sheet and disciplined capital allocation. We are committed to our long-term financial outlook, and we have reiterated today our full year guidance for fiscal year 2023. Just as we have done with COVID and the related disruptions over the past few years, we are prepared to navigate the potentially choppy macroeconomic waters in coming quarters. Our strong financial foundation gives Sysco the opportunity to continue to advance our strategy during potentially challenging environments. This reality will enable Sysco to win for the longer-term as our capabilities improve and our initiatives progress. As always, I’d like to thank our 71,000 associates for their commitment to our purpose and for their dedication in serving our customers. Operator, you can now open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Alex Slagle at Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Alex Slagle: Hi, thanks. Good morning. I thought it was notable your international business continues to see such strong momentum and now driving the operating profit above 2019 levels. I realize Canada is a meaningful piece of this and it’s been bouncing back in some effective initiatives on the way, but clearly, exposure to some more difficult regions as well. So, I’d love to hear more about what’s driving this relative performance and your confidence that can continue to deliver this kind of strength in the quarters ahead?
Kevin Hourican: Hey, good morning, Alex. Thanks for the question. This is Kevin. We’re really pleased with our progress and performance in international. Six consecutive quarters of strong profit improvement, the business is on track year-to-date and we’re really making progress on the Recipe For Growth up in Canada, as I mentioned, but it’s bigger than Canada. We just called out Canada today with some specific proof points to shine a light on the work that’s being done but across the pond in Europe meaningfully advancing forward core Sysco capabilities. Sysco brand penetration improvement this year. We’re filling in assortment gaps that we have in select countries. We’re bringing our team-based selling model that we have optimized in the United States. And as I mentioned, programs like Sysco Your Way, we went live in Dublin at the end of Q1, and that program is off to just an absolutely great start in Dublin, and we will be expanding it. So really pleased with our leadership team, strong, capable, talented team led by Paulo, who joined our company back in August and upward progress in the forward-facing quarters and years. Things like Latin American growth, we have an export business called IFG, which is doing well and we’re really optimistic about our future with international. As you mentioned, there are select countries that we are watching extremely closely. Great Britain, being the country of biggest concern from a macroeconomic perspective. For now, our business is strong in GB. And if that were to change, as I said in my prepared remarks, we are prepared to take action from an expense control perspective, but we’re really pleased with how we’re performing internationally, including GB at this time.
Alex Slagle: Great. Thank you.
Kevin Hourican: Thank you, Alex.
Operator: Next question comes from Edward Kelly at Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Edward Kelly, your line is open.
Kevin Kim: Let’s go to the next and see if Ed can come back in.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is from Jake Bartlett at Truist Securities. Please go ahead.
Jake Bartlett: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Mine is on the top-line growth, and you reiterated the target of 1.35 times the market. I’m wondering whether that still translates into at least 10% revenue growth in 2023, given what you know about the macro environment now and also within that 10%, what you expect product inflation to be? Thank you.
Kevin Hourican: Yes, Jake, thanks for the question. It’s Kevin. I’ll start just making some macro comments on top-line growth, and then I’ll toss Aaron for the inflation and sales parts of your question. Yes, we’re really pleased with the start to the year. We stated on our call today, we grew more than 1.4 times the industry, which is a great start to a year with a stated goal of 1.35 times. What I highlighted in my prepared remarks is that the strength is coming from both national and local business. On the national side, our sales teams are just doing a remarkably good job in the healthcare space, in the education space, large national restaurant space on working with our customers and customer prospects on kind of selling the values and capabilities of Sysco, the strength of our supply chain, our nationwide capability within the U.S. to support those national customer partners. And as I mentioned, at profit profiles for those contracts that are above historical standards, and these are multiyear contracts. On the local side, the combination of our specialty businesses that Aaron highlighted that are doing extremely well. Team-based selling, which is leveraging those capabilities within our Broadline segment and the Recipe For Growth beginning to take noticeable traction. So that is why we reiterated our guide for the full year in total, and I’ll toss to Aaron for comments on the inflation and sales ports of your question, too.
Aaron Alt: Great. Thanks, Kevin. Good morning. And we are really pleased with the market share gains and the sales increases over the course of the quarter, as you can imagine that, of course, is coming as a result of the combination between the volume growth and the impact of inflation on the portfolio. If you think back to the guidance that we provided in Q4, we – the sales reference we had was that we would grow at least 10%. And I believe at the time, I commented that at 10% without knowing what was coming from a macroeconomic perspective was tied to the lower end of our range. And so indirectly, yes, in answer to your question, we do expect that the 10% is achievable and that’s at the lower end of our range. I would observe that inflation we guided in Q4, high single digits in Q1, working its way down to low single digits in Q4. Certainly, as we sit here today, the enterprise number in dollars was high single digits, just under 10%. And so things are playing out in that respect as we had expected.
Jake Bartlett: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from Edward Kelly at Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Edward Kelly: Hi guys. Sorry about that. I’m not really sure what happened. I have a clarification then a question. The clarification is just on the case volume growth that you’re reporting. I think it’s now including M&A. So it’s just curious. Do you think that’s right? And I don’t know if you can give us some comparability versus the numbers that you’ve been providing, so we just know what’s going on here underneath of M&A. And then the question I have is really around gross profit per case in the U.S. Broadline’s business. I mean performance has been obviously very robust. Inflation is, beginning to decelerate as you sort of talked about; I think there’s been a benefit fuel surcharge in here. I’m just kind of curious as to how sustainable you see the current level of gross profit per case in that business? Would you expect it to decelerate and if it does, what fills the vote on that? Thank you.
Aaron Alt: So I’m going to go back and summarize. I think you’d like us to comment on the volume metrics and then comment on the look forward relative to GP dollars per case, if I summarize your question really. Let me start with the first part of your question on the volume, which is to touch on our disclosure today of the fact that our U.S. Foodservice segment, which is the combination as it has been of our Broadline and specialty businesses had total case growth of 7.3% and local case growth of 5.4%. From the outside, you might say, well, are you lumping the recent acquisitions in and that’s a small part of what’s in the case volume disclosure. But keep in mind that we have had a multibillion-dollar business what we call specialty, which is part of U.S. Foodservice, the segment we do most of our disclosures against that is not part of the U.S. Broadline. And so I want to take you back to the why, and we’re now disclosing a total U.S. Foodservice number, it’s simply this. The Recipe For Growth is designed to bring all of our assets to bear in support of specific customers. And we have customers that are serviced by Broadline, serviced by specialty. Kevin will probably comment on that more as we carry forward. What we’re trying to give you the true view of what’s going on with our total case growth and our local customer growth as we push ahead. And recognizing that this is different, we did provide many quarters of historical look on Page 18 of our earnings presentation to give you that perspective. Maybe before jumping to the second part of your question, Kevin, anything you want to add? We’re good, got it. So now let’s talk about the gross profit per case point now that you raised. We have been pleased over the last several quarters with the fact that while our environment is interesting, right? And indeed, we – our OpEx costs have been increasing our gross profit dollars per case has also been increasing, right? And that is a result of really two initiatives. The first is our ability to work with our customers to pass through our product cost inflation when our costs go up we pass through the cost to our customers as well. And we’ve been pleased with our ability to do that. It also goes to what we’ve been talking about for a couple of quarters on the work we’re doing to buy at scale and the work of our merchants and our commercial services organization to better negotiate, what we’re buying with our vendors as we carry forward. It is likely that inflation will pass. Indeed, our own guidance has inflation coming down, still growing but coming down to low single digits. What will not ask is the capabilities that Kevin and Judy and others have built within merchandising and sourcing. Indeed, our pricing systems that allow us to be right on price as we carry forward. And one of the factors of that is both market what’s going to the marketplace and what’s going with inflation. So, we feel good that the team has built the capability to address whatever comes. Kevin, anything you want to add to that?
Kevin Hourican: No, I think you covered it. One of the offsets was the very last part of your question, Ed and OpEx cost reductions would be one of the prime focuses of our company in the going forward period. And if the recession impact on the business, GP is something that impacts flow through to the bottom line. Our operating expenses should be and will be improving at that same time horizon, and that’s something we’re actively working on. I’m happy to discuss in more detail.
Edward Kelly: Thank you.
Kevin Hourican: Thank you, Ed.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from Lauren Silberman at Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Lauren Silberman: Thank you very much. I just want to follow up first on case growth. Are you willing to provide any color on cadence throughout the quarter and into October? My actual question is about OpEx and a little bit of a follow-up to what you started with in a prior question. Can you help us understand how to think about OpEx growth from here? I think productivity costs were consistent with the fourth quarter. So is that consistent with your expectations? And then just going forward, the opportunity for cost reductions in a more recessionary environment. Any color on what this could mean in terms of just substance of those actions? Thank you very much.
Kevin Hourican: Yes. We’re upbeat about the business. And we’re not going to make any comments specific to October. We provided guidance for the year by reiterating our full year guide, and we provided color in regards to the success we’re having at both the national and local level from a volume perspectives. And I think that’s about all we’re going to say in that regard. As it relates to the operating expense parts of your question, I completely understand the question. Our operating costs are elevated versus our historical standards, and we are meaningfully focused on it. I want to highlight a couple of key components here. Point one is that we are properly staffed across our network. And by being properly staffed, that allows us to support growth, reduce overtime, improve safety, and those are actions that will lead to lowering our future costs. We’ve been able to, because we’re properly staffed pivot to focusing on associate retention, associate training and associate engagement. And we see progress within our internal dashboards on those three very critical components. And these are leading indicators of what will become outcomes metrics of things like cost per piece shipped and our transportation efficiency metrics. So as I just said, we can see the leading indicators of success by focusing on associate retention, which is improving associate training, which has meaningfully increased versus prior periods and associate engagement, which retains that individual for longer periods of time. We are confident that we will make progress in our operations outcomes metrics. And as Aaron and I have both stated that improvement will be mostly in the second half. And we have the line of sight towards the improvement that we will make. As I said in my prepared remarks, we’re not just though focusing on that component, which is to improve the day-to-day operations within our buildings, we are also transforming the supply chain for long-term success, six-day deliveries, the launching of our Driver Academy, the deployment of a distributed order management system, which fuels omni-channel fulfillment and improving our overall driving experience. We are simultaneously moving both of these efforts forward at the same time, helping drive efficiency in the day-to-day and also transforming for the long term because we’re playing the long game at Sysco. And we know that the capabilities that we’re building are going to enable us to take profitable share for the long term. Aaron, is there anything you want to add?
Aaron Alt: Just to emphasize that I see opportunity for us. And consistent with the guidance where, as Kevin called out, we had said H1 would be heavier for a variety of reasons as we work through productivity, as we work through the environment, as we work through the transformation investments. If you think about the size and the scale in which we’re operating, given that we are staffed the way we are we have incredible opportunity to drive profitable growth at Sysco, and we are executing against our plan. Thank you.
Lauren Silberman: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from John Heinbockel at Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.
John Heinbockel: So Kevin, two related questions. what do you look at in the business as sort of a lead indicator of consumer demand weakening, right? There are certain metrics, particularly since you’re not in the industry, the things you’re looking at as a lead indicator, the canary in the coal mine, right, if you will? And then secondly, right, maybe talk about the balance, right? You mentioned making adjustments to OpEx, but by the same token, right, the real opportunity is long-term share gains. So, you don’t want to do anything right that would compromise that. So when you think about taking cost out, where is – how do you balance that? And where are the opportunities to do that right without hurting your long-term positioning?
Kevin Hourican: Yes, John. Good morning. Thank you for the question. On the first part, leading indicators, obviously, there’s external data that we mine and capture traffic to restaurants but remind everyone that we are much bigger than just restaurants. We serve large sectors outside of the restaurant chain business, restaurant business, in general, travel hospitality business and industry education, just to name a few. And we have data coming from each of those sectors and from our major customer partners in those sectors on what they see in the forward-facing trends for their business, and we combine all of that, Aaron, through FP&A manages all of that to come up with an overarching forecast view of where we’re headed and that was obviously factored into what we have guided today. On the second part of your question, it’s a good one, which is what would you do in a recession? And what are the types of things that you action upon and what types of things would you not action upon? What we’re prepared to do, if a recession begins to impact our business, which we said on today’s call has not begun. But if, in fact, we do begin to see an impact, there are discretionary expenses that we can tighten. There are, let’s call it, strategic initiatives that from a timing perspective on how fast they deploy and how fast they move that can be worked through and just belt tightening, I think travel, things of that nature. Here’s what we won’t do, and it’s the spirit of your point, John, on the ability to profitably take share during a disruption. We’re not going to reduce staffing in our supply chain. We’re not going to reduce drivers as an example. It was proven through COVID that expense reduction efforts at the beginning of COVID because of how extreme it was resulted in an understaffing scenario for the industry that was extremely difficult to dig out of, and we’re still digging out of it vis-à-vis the number of new employees we have at our company. So our supply chain is something that we will invest in if volumes were to decrease because we believe that, that will put us in a position of strength, which will enable us to win business during that type of disruption. And that business that we win would then be retainable and therefore, very accretive to our longer-term macro algo. So, I know you understand that, that’s just something that we are meaningfully focused on to ensure we stay properly staffed, and we’re playing the long game, as I mentioned.
John Heinbockel: Thank you.
Kevin Hourican: Thank you, John.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein of Barclays. Please go ahead.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much. First, just clarifying on the guidance for this year, specific to the first quarter versus the year. I’m just wondering how was the reported EBITDA relative to your internal expectation for the first quarter. I know it seemed like it was a large shortfall versus the Street, but just trying to gauge what you were thinking? Because I think you mentioned you’re still comfortable in the midpoint of the fiscal 2023 range if we’re not seeing a sign of recession. And then my question was really just on labor inflation. You’ve talked about it a bit. Just wondering if you can share whether you look at it as a basket kind of what level we’re seeing in the first quarter? I know you mentioned retention improvements, staffing and turnover improving. Just wondering if there’s any metrics you can share to validate those stats. Thanks.
Aaron Alt: Sure. Thanks for the question. We don’t provide specific labor metrics as part of our disclosures, but I will observe that the market is generally playing out as we anticipated it would coming into the year and given the environment that we’ve been – that we are in. Your question around your EBITDA, we didn’t provide EBITDA on a quarterly basis. And so what I’m going to observe is that we are effectively reaffirming the guidance we gave Q4 overall without giving you a breakdown on a quarterly basis for EBITDA. Keep in mind, from a seasonal perspective, from a profitability perspective, Q4 is always the highest quarter profitability for Sysco, pre-COVID and certainly in recent years as well, followed by Q1 and then Q2 and Q3 are a little bit lower, just given the seasonality of our business. The EBITDA disclosure is relatively new. We’ve been providing it, I believe, in the last year or so. And if I were you, I would look carefully at the definition of how the – we and our competitors that define the calculation of EBITDA as a non-GAAP measure to work through the mechanics there. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from John Ivankoe at JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
John Ivankoe: Hi, thank you. I was hoping to get some color in terms of market share per account. I mean, obviously, there’s been a lot of conversation about new account growth, but just wanted to see success some market share per account, especially as a number of the different things that you’ve been doing around team-based selling around some of the pricing tools changing delivery window availability, even product assortment. I mean a lot of those, at least from the outside would seem that they would, in fact, be quite successful in driving market share per account. So, I wanted to see, I guess, where we were on that time line in terms of what’s currently being realized versus what might be in the future? Or maybe even talking about the success in certain markets or piloted some of these initiatives versus others that have not.
Kevin Hourican: Good morning, John, it’s Kevin. To be clear, my comments on the net new business were tied to national sales because that is a big business. As you know, it’s multiyear contracts. We’re competing versus others and awards are provided. So my meaningfully positive comments about net new business, we’re focused on the corporate national bid sectors and health care, education and restaurants. We had a remarkably good quarter in Q1, and that will then pay forward in future volumes, again, profitable volumes because of the structure of those contracts versus historical profile. As it relates to our local business, your question is a good one. We’re pleased with our performance of the initiatives that we are putting forward and the impact that those initiatives are having on share of wallet. We’re not going to today disclose or share of wallet update but things like Sysco Your way, Sysco Perks, the Italian platform work we’re doing, our enhanced digital tools, which make it easier for customers to order, reorder and see suggested items, the pricing work we’re doing to be right on price at the item level, the aggregate of all of those things deployed, as you mentioned, in regional tests, in customer-specific pilots and neighborhood rollout like Sysco Your Way, we’re very pleased with the performance. Where we are now is rollout. We’re in implementation. And some of those initiatives are still in their embryonic phase, we’re a big company. We do over $1 billion of sales per week, and these initiatives will move the needle for the longer term. They’re just very early from an innings perspective on their impact on customers. But John, we can see the very clear data and the response that these customers provide to us when offered these product solutions, digital tools and capabilities. I’ll toss to Aaron for additional comments.
Aaron Alt: I would just make the added observation that part of what’s also going on here as well as utilizing all of the assets in the portfolio. So it’s the various parts of our business working together to help us to drive the success there.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from Joshua Long at Stephens Inc. Please go ahead.
Joshua Long: Great. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to dig into the Sysco Your Way program and just see how that is performing versus your expectations like we’re early on in the long-term opportunity. But based on some of your comments, it sounded like there might be an opportunity for you to expand or find new neighborhoods to layer in there. I’m curious if that’s the case and/or just how that exploration of this platform is unfolding for you?
Kevin Hourican: Yes. Joshua thanks for the question. We’re very pleased with how Sysco Your Way is performing. As I said in my prepared remarks, the contracts of that program were developed in concert with our customers. We asked them essentially what’s important to you? What could we Sysco do for you that would result in your increasing your business with us? Or how could we serve you if we’re not currently your partner? Things like very late in the evening order cutoff. I think a chef who is in a fine dining establishment and had a run on seafood or run on steak that evening. They want the confidence of being able to place an order after the evening rush and have it be on the truck that delivers that very next morning, and that happens six plus days per week. That’s what we mean by a different level of service and capability. And we afford the service capability to everyone who is in the neighborhood, whether they were previously a Sysco customer or not because the route density is tremendous in these neighborhoods. As I said on the call, I think 50-plus restaurants and a very dense geographic radius. So, we’re very pleased. We’re seeing a dual win. We’re seeing the customers that were previously with Sysco are buying meaningfully more from us, and we’re seeing customers that weren’t previously ours signing up because they see our truck there every day. They see the delivery partner there every day. They see a sales rep who’s walking the street every day, and I mean that literally, they’re at the neighborhood every day. The aggregate of the performance is strong, robust. The focus now is rolling it out and getting it out to as many eligible neighborhoods as possible, as efficiently as we can because we have to honor that service commitment that I just said for it to work. We know if we don’t deliver upon the promise that it will not deliver the overall outcome. So, we’re going to go at an appropriate pace to make sure we can deliver the service. And as I highlighted, this is not just domestic U.S. We went live in Toronto, we went live in Dublin, and we will be taking this capability to GB, to Sweden and to many other places across the globe in a pragmatic and thoughtful way. But Joshua, we’re really pleased with the performance thus far.
Joshua Long: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from John Glass at Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
John Glass: Thanks very much. First, Aaron, just a follow up on the change in the way you’ve disclosed the case growth information. If I look back in the last few quarters, there’s a pretty big difference between what you are now reporting and what you did before six, seven points in the last couple of quarters. Is that similar this quarter? In other words, we’re trying to figure out how to look at your case growth versus maybe what we had estimated. If you could just, comment on the difference between what the old version versus new version. And then Kevin, just on Sysco Your Way and Greco, what’s the percentage of the system that you think can get those either that service or product? What’s the impediment to ruling it out? I know you said you’re rolling it out, but what’s the percentage of your system that you think can ultimately be available those two businesses? Thanks.
Aaron Alt: Let me address the first question. If you turn to Page 18 of our presentation, we actually give you the history, so you don’t need to do the back calculation of the relative difference both versus prior year and versus fiscal 2019. And to emphasize, we have a couple – even pre-acquisitions, we had a couple of billion dollars of business that is very focused on both growth, consistent with the Recipe For Growth and serving the local customer individually and in partnership with our Broadline operators. And thus our believe it’s better for us to disclose the impact of the Recipe For Growth on the total U.S. portfolio in that way, which is what you see on Page 18. Kevin, over to you on the second question.
Kevin Hourican: Yes. I mean I love the Sysco Your Way question. We’ve obviously not provided percent lift in penetration lifts and customer acquisition targets. What we did say, I’ll call you back to May of 2021 at our Investor Day that Sysco Your Way would be $1 billion top-line growth effort for this company, and I would reiterate that. And we can see the line of sight towards the performance we’re delivering in the neighborhoods were live. There’s a thing called the Hawthorne effect when you roll out a project to a pilot location and it kills it. And then the question is, can you scale it, right? That’s the Hawthorne effect. We have proven that we can scale Sysco Your Way. We are now live in a significant number of neighborhoods. We’ve trained the trainer and the teams are now executing the rollouts on their own. And we are replicating the performance in the – from the pilot locations in the neighborhoods that we scale to. So, I’ll just bridge back to the May of 2021, $1 billion top-line opportunity for this company and we can see it coming, and I’ll toss Aaron for comment.
Aaron Alt: I just want to emphasize that really exciting initiatives like that one or part and portal [ph] of the guidance we provided both for the year and for the longer term.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from Nicole Miller at Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Nicole Miller: Good morning and thank you. Appreciate the market share grounding this morning. If you have it available by figure, at least just by I guess kind of proxy. Can you talk about your market share in any last recession? Any really period of economic or consumer weakness? Basically, just trying to understand if you take share and how you move with the industry. And then could you discuss your fill rates and your on-time delivery if possible on a year-over-year basis and sequentially? Thank you. 
Kevin Hourican: I’ll do the second, this is Kevin. I’ll do the second half of your question first. We’re making steady progress on what we call on time and in full shipment. So supplier fill rate inbound to Sysco has been steadily improving our merchandising teams have been doing extremely good work to improve that effort, provide more substitutions when they’re available to our customers. And the ability for us to ship on time has improved as our staffing health has improved. Both metrics are still slightly below historical norms, mostly because of the number of new people working within the supply chain, but we’re making steady progress. As it relates to the impact of a recession on our ability to take market share. I think we’ve proved over the last two and a half years during and even [ph] much bigger than a recession COVID, even go back to Omicron last winter. I mean, we saw meaningful negative impact to our business in the month of December, Jan and Feb last winter because of Omicron and we took share all throughout that period of time. And the why is our inventory health, our staffing health and our ability to be there and available for customers is a strength point versus others. The balance sheet that we have affords us the opportunity to make those longer-term decisions. And I would suspect that would be a pattern that would continue into the future if a recession would occur. Aaron, is there anything else you’d like to say about that?
Aaron Alt: I just – I would just add that one of the signals of the strength of Sysco in any recessionary environment is something I pull from looking back at our results during the recession at 2008, 2009, where – while I wasn’t here, the financial reporting, which shows that our sales were down between 1% or 2%. And that was a very different financial set of circumstances than what we currently believe to be the case. And so the lesson I take from that is that Sysco was strong back then or even stronger under Kevin’s leadership with the Recipe For Growth. And as we’ve said, we see opportunity everywhere we look, and we’re going to play the long game and execute against it regardless of the macro environment.
Nicole Miller: Thank you.
Kevin Hourican: Thanks, Nicole.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from Kelly Bania at BMO Capital. Please go ahead.
Kelly Bania: Hi, good morning. Kelly Bania here from BMO Capital. Thanks for taking our question. I was wondering if you could just help us unpack that 7% U.S. Broadline case volume growth figure. In terms of end markets or channels, do you see share gains pretty consistent across restaurants, healthcare, education, business and industry? And I guess within that, are there any channels or segments that you feel more or less bullish on relative to kind of pre-COVID, I guess, I was just a little surprised to hear some of the wins and the magnitude of the wins on the healthcare in particular.
Kevin Hourican: Yes, I’ll start on the segment part of your question, I’ll toss Aaron for any additional comment. We are winning across the board from a national sales perspective or as we call it contract management CMU business. I just gave examples of what that means for everyone out there and wins came in this most recent quarter from healthcare, from education and also from national restaurants. Because when we talk about national sales, people tend to assume it must mean restaurants and we are putting a meaningful focus on winning across the portfolio of national sales business. And as I said, the team did a really great job in Q1 and that the rates for those contracts are solid. What – separate point from that, my prepared remarks referenced strength that we are experiencing in the non-restaurant space as those customer types are continuing to move up the recovery curve. And I mentioned tailwinds continuing in that space. Think about the number of offices that are reopened and are reopening and are still not fully reopened. And we do a large business tied to providing catering services to those types in all of the forms of food away-from-home that are not restaurants are on the upswing in total and in aggregate. But as Aaron said, all that’s been built into our year-to-go guide that we have provided. So all of that is factored in. We do forecasting for each and every customer type globally and domestically, and that’s been factored into the guidance that we provided. But we’re pleased with the progress that’s been made from our sales team, not just in the last quarter, but the last three years, but this most recent quarter was particularly strong. Aaron, anything to add?
Aaron Alt: Just to emphasize that the 7.3% case growth is U.S. Foodservice in total, and we’re seeing growth across the U.S. Foodservice portfolio.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from Mark Carden at UBS. Please go ahead.
Mark Carden: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. So it sounds like your top line is holding up pretty well even with recessionary fears. Just drilling down into the last question a bit more. Are you seeing much of a shift in demand across restaurant types in your local business? And how is that impacting you from a margin standpoint? And then related, we’re not seeing as much at a federal level, but there are a number of states that are in the process of implementing stimulus payments. Would you expect this to be a meaningful tailwind for your business? Can this move the needle in terms of sustaining demand? Thanks.
Kevin Hourican: So great question, Mark. We’re positioned to be successful in the short, medium and long term enduring a recession as the question that was asked earlier, we believe we have an opportunity to take share if a recession begins to impact overall strength. And the main reason is, we’re fully diversified, so we cover every element of the food away-from-home, sector from the highest end white table cloth restaurant down to QSR and everything in between. And even within the local sector, we serve all customer types within the local sector. What we said on today’s call is we’re not seeing broad-based trend changes in our numbers; we do not have, at this time, impact of a recession on our P&L. If one were to occur to begin to impact our P&L, we’re prepared to take actions. Things that we would do, as I mentioned, expense tightening. Sysco Brand as a point of positive highlight, we improved our penetration in Sysco brand over the past quarter, and we would expect that to continue as we’re doing good work on assortment management, pricing management and selling skills capabilities and Sysco brand would become even more important. Stimulus would be positive for demand. I don’t have anything specific to comment about the prevalence of that, but it would be a positive. Aaron, over to you for any comment.
Aaron Alt: I would just observe on the stimulus point that, as Kevin just said, it’s a one positive factor in an overall tapestry of a business that we’re running as we carry forward. And I haven’t seen details of that need to believe it’s material enough to cost to change our guidance in that way. And so I would assume that it is supportive of the guidance we’ve previously issued.
Mark Carden: Great. Thanks and good luck.
Aaron Alt: Thanks.
Kevin Hourican: Thank you, Mark.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from Jonathan Feeney at Consumer Edge. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Feeney: Good morning. Thank you. I wanted to – you touched on this a little bit, but I wanted to ask specifically about the funding environment. First, congratulate you on your fixed cost balance sheet management. I think that’s forward-looking and puts you in a great situation. Congratulations on that. But historically, the first part of the question is, does that – does higher – less availability of funding help you competitively directly versus, says smaller Foodservice distributors who might not have the access to capital you have or might not have been as prudent. And secondly, how about the M&A environment? I mean I know its early days. We don’t even know if we have a recession coming, but one thing is clear. Funding costs are a lot higher. It’s a lot less cash around. So how’s that changed your M&A priorities and availability and likelihood of success? Thanks very much.
Aaron Alt: Great. I’ll kick off and take that one. Thank you for highlighting the strength of Sysco for the call. The fact that Sysco is an investment-grade issuer, one of the only in the industry. That also puts a firm focus on our capital allocation is part of why we are also invested in Sysco as a company and driving the Recipe For Growth as we carry forward. We’ve been very clear for the last couple of years that the first thing that we are going to do with the strong cash flow we generate with the balance sheet that we have available to us is to invest in growth to reinforce that very same algorithm of generate the cash flow, to drive the growth carry on as you carry forward. And indeed, that’s what we’ve been doing. Our treasury team has set us up for success by having a highly fixed portfolio at this moment. Having paid down substantial debt, we’ve paid down billions of dollars of indebtedness over the last couple of years. And we’re pleased now where we have financial flexibility. We – there is no maturity coming due that we don’t already have plans for that would require us to enter into high interest rate environment, even with our credit rating to carry forward, which means that we have every dollar available to us that we need, either through cash on hand, through our cash flow or our revolver or other sources if we needed it to both invest organically and the capital that we need to buy the fleet, build the distribution nodes [ph] investment and technology. If M&A comes along, that would be exciting to us, and Kevin will touch on M&A in a second is – we have the resources to be able to do that. And by the way, we’re going to continue to optimize our balance sheet, and we’re going to continue our firm focus on return of capital to shareholders. You will have noticed that we paid – sorry, I misspoke that we purchased shares in the first quarter of $267 million. We got out early on our $500 million commitment. And we’ve continued to pay the increased dividend. And of course, Sysco is a dividend aristocrat, and we’ve – that is one signal of our focus on shareholder return. Kevin, do you want to comment on the M&A environment?
Kevin Hourican: I’ll just say two things about the M&A environment. We’re not responding to inbound phone calls at Sysco. Joel Grade, who leads biz dev for our company is making outbound phone calls, meaning we’re very, very strategic about the types of acquisitions that we are interested in. We’ve talked about them before as being geographic white spaces and capabilities that we need to fill or capabilities themselves that we don’t have that we’re interested in that we think will build out our overarching assortment and/or selling profile and capabilities. And we get a chess board of things we’re interested in, and we’re very thankful for the strong balance sheet that Aaron and his team have helped us develop and deliver over time that gives us the flexibility that we need to want.
Jonathan Feeney: Thanks very much.
Kevin Hourican: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The last question comes from Andrew Wolf at CL King. Please go ahead.
Andrew Wolf: Thank you. Good morning. My question is in regards to the operating expenses. And I was hoping you could help us sort of unpack some granularity, some of the reasons they’re up. I think most of it or the majority of it is just market-driven, wage rate increases. Maybe you could help us understand that. And it sounds like Sysco is deliberately one; you have a lot of volume but also being fully staffed. A lot of it might be headcount as well. And as you look forward, when those numbers flatten out, so that we can sort of incorporate that in our modeling.
Kevin Hourican: Okay. I appreciate the question, Andrew. The primary driver is not wage increase. I just want to be crystal clear about that. That is not the primary driver. The primary driver is productivity levels being below our historical performance averages. And the net productivity impact is hurting the flow-through from the top line to the bottom line, and I’ll talk about that in just a second. The other is volume. Volume is strong. And obviously, volume up drives expense up. That’s an obvious. So let’s talk about the variable cost per piece, which is the metric that we’re most focused on that has the biggest impact. Why is it down? Why is it taking time to improve. I’d like to just kind of walk through the history of where we’ve been, where we are, where we’re going. Where we’ve been is we were understaffed because of a very strong rebound in our business and what was this time last year, the great resignation. We were in a position where we were understaffed. So over time, rates were up days and hours out on truck too long, which caused folks to then leave the industry, not leave to go to a competitor, but leave the industry. So we had meaningful work we needed to do to get the company back to properly staffed and Aaron called those snapback expenses, expenses that we needed to incur to get properly staffed. Here’s the good news. We are now properly staffed. That type of work, that type of investment is behind us, which is why today, Aaron described that as now immaterial and our going forward the snapback investments. As I mentioned on our last quarterly call, roughly half of our supply chain associates are now new to job, new to the company. So we’re investing in training to educate our folks to what we call our work standards, which are about working safely and working productively and that takes time. It takes time to matriculate an order select or up the curve or productivity. It takes even longer time to matriculate a driver up the productivity curve. The good news is we are properly staffed. We are investing our leadership time, our communication muscle and our investment dollars into improving the training that our associates are receiving, which will drive improved retention. And as I said, those are the internal leading indicators that will result in future periods is cost per piece, excuse me, improving, which is why both Aaron and I have said the second half of this fiscal year, our operating cost metrics will be better than the first half as we’re still working up that productivity curve at Sysco.
Andrew Wolf: Great. Thank you for that color. Appreciate it.
Kevin Hourican: Thank you, Andrew.
Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions. This does conclude your conference call for today. We thank you for participating, and we ask that you please disconnect your lines at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day.

===== 2022 Q4  (2022-08-09 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to Sysco Corporation Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2022 Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. We will begin with opening remarks and introductions. I would like to turn the call over to Kevin Kim, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Kevin Kim: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Sysco's fourth quarter fiscal year 2022 earnings call.

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Hourican.
Kevin Hourican: Good morning and thank you for joining our call. Q4 marked another quarter of positive top and bottom line performance at Sysco. The quarter capped off strong financial performance in fiscal 2022 as we grew annual sales by 33.8% to over $68 billion. For the year, Sysco grew our business more than 1.3x the industry. This result exceeded our goal for the year and the second half of the year performance was even stronger than the first. The outperformance in the U.S. helped drive over $17 billion of total company sales growth for the year. Consistent with our focus on profitable growth, we grew adjusted EPS by 133.8%. Our team generated these results while advancing our Recipe for Growth strategy, improving our balance sheet and delivering compelling shareholder returns. I will highlight two topics during our call today. First, I will share progress we have made as a company over the past year that displays Cisco's unique position of strength in the market. Second, I'll convey why we are confident in our trajectory for profitable growth in fiscal '23. Before I get started, let me acknowledge that we are closely monitoring macroeconomic pressures that are impacting consumer confidence across the globe such as spikes in gas prices, food inflation and rising interest rates. Despite these external factors, Sysco was prepared to deliver significant market share gains and profitable growth this coming year. So let's get started with our unique position of strength and a bit more about who we are displayed on Slides 5 and 6. I am often asked to describe Sysco. Simply put, Sysco is 50% a food supply chain company and 50% at food sales and marketing company. To be successful as a leader at Sysco and to be successful in this business, you need to be equally capable of leading in both arenas, supply chain and sales. Over the past 2.5 years, we have developed a strategy called our Recipe for Growth that is advancing our capabilities in supply chain and sales. We are transforming Sysco by building new capabilities that will further enable our position as a global leader in food distribution. Let me first highlight the 50% of Sysco that is our food supply chain by summarizing some of our biggest accomplishments of the past year. Throughout the year, we have led the industry from an OTIF perspective. For those not in logistics, that stands for on-time and in full. This past year was the most challenging OTIF year on record in our industry. During those challenging conditions, Sysco was able to be better in stock and better able to shift on time versus those that we compete against. As a result, we won substantial new business and provided stronger-than-industry average service levels to our existing customers. We're deeply committed to returning to and exceeding our historical OTIF levels over the coming quarters and years. We fully converted our supply chain to a full six-day service week. Simultaneously, we converted the majority of our U.S. frontline associates to a four-day work schedule, enabling improved work-life balance for our associates. The six-day work model for our large network of DCs will enable Sysco to grow profitably for years to come by better leveraging our physical assets. Their transition to the six-day model was a big lift. And I want to thank our associates and our customers for their partnership in the transition. The six-day model will ensure industry leading OTIF results for years to come. We launched our Sysco Driver Academy, opening our first training location and began building out a nationwide infrastructure that will that will be complete by the end of this calendar year. The driver academy is helping Sysco addressing the shortage of skilled drivers and our Academy will increase the number of skilled drivers at Sysco and will deliver increased lifetime earnings potential for the associates selected to participate. We have piloted and are scaling new picking methods at our warehouses that will improve the experience of our delivery drivers. In addition, we're providing our drivers with advanced material handling equipment that reduces the physicality of their day. These actions will improve the experience of our drivers, enabling improved productivity, improved retention and increased customer service. Lastly, we've built out a distributed order management system, or DOMS for short, that will enable omnichannel fulfillment at Sysco in fiscal '23. We have decoupled the frontend of our network, sales from the back end of our network operations through this project. No longer will a customer need to order just from their local sites inventory assortment. We are opening up our vast network of inventory to our customers through the DOMS implementation, while also improving the productivity of our working capital through this industry-leading project. We will be launching our first [indiscernible] soon with plans to expand and scale in '23 and beyond. Our supply chain mission at Sysco is clear, enable profitable growth by delivering the industry's leading assortment of products delivered on time and in full at a delivery frequency that meets or exceeds our customers' expectations. Our supply chain greatly enhanced our capabilities to deliver on that mission in fiscal '22. Now I would like to highlight the progress that we have made in the other 50% of our company's key work focus, food sales and marketing. We live our food credentials every day with over 7,500 sales consultants in hundreds of culinary partners and product specialists across the globe. I dare say there are a few, if any, that know more about food and food trends than our culinary teams. Our sales associates have the highest customer satisfaction scores in the industry, with NPS overall satisfaction rates, a full point higher than our competitors. Please see Chart 7. Our sales consultants are experts in everything from menus with our customers, identifying and introducing new food trends and importantly, partnering with our customers to help save them money. From a product perspective, we've the broadest assortment of food in the industry, and we have expanded that assortment strength with the recent acquisitions of Greco, Paragon Foods and the Coastal Companies. Our product assortment is second to none, and we offer fair and appropriate prices to our customers. Like I summarize with our supply chain, I would like to highlight some of the progress that we have made over the past year with regards to food sales and marketing. We implemented an intelligent data-driven pricing system to improve our ability to be what we call right on price at the customer item level. We built and scaled a customer personalization engine, which provides our customers with unique offers that their specific needs. We upgraded and improved our digital shopping platform. We improved search navigation. We made it even easier to reorder Common Essentials, and we introduced product recommendation engines that increase customer basket size. We improved what we call team-based selling, better leveraging our sales teams across broad-line and our collection of specialty businesses. Lastly, we can measure success over the past year in several ways. I'd highlight, too. Firstly, during the great resignation, our sales consultant retention in fiscal 2022 exceeded our historical average. RSEs look the new tools that we have built, and they have deeply embraced our Recipe for Growth. And secondly, we successfully grew more than 1.3x the industry in 2022. This result exceeded our goal for the year and the second half of the year performance was even stronger than the first. Our customers are rewarding us with more of their business because of the relationships they have with our sales teams and because of the new tools and services that we have deployed in food sales and marketing. Defining excellence in food sales and distribution, that is Sysco. We are confident that we have the size, scale and expertise to be the leader in these two arenas, bringing innovation to our customers every day. Topic two for today, I'd like to discuss the current economic climate and our view for the upcoming year. We're closely monitoring macroeconomic pressures and data points related to food inflation, gas prices and consumer confidence. There is no doubt that end consumers have a lot on their minds these days. We think it's important to remember the resilience of our industry and how we have adapted over the past few years. We submit respectively that food away from home has proven to be resilient and quite frankly essential. Over the last 2.5 years, our industry has dealt with challenge after challenge with three major ways of COVID, double-digit inflation and innovation in Ukraine impacting the food supply. Despite these challenges, we have delivered profitable growth. We have learned to operate in an abnormal environment and we are prepared to navigate another dynamic year ahead. While we anticipate that recent macroeconomic headwinds make REIT less robust industry-wide growth rate in '23 than we had originally planned, we are prepared to generate sales growth of at least 10% in 2023. Aaron will address guidance in more detail in a moment. There are several reasons why we believe we will deliver on our financial targets. First, as the industry leader, we're fully diversified, covering every corner of the food away from home market. We serve restaurants up and down the price point spectrum and across all restaurant types. We deliver food to health care and education facilities that are less prone to recession. We delivered to travel and recreation facilities into any office buildings. These last two sectors continue to rebound and will provide a source of growth in the coming years. Additionally, we still have big opportunities to grow in the restaurant space. Even if traffic is more muted than originally forecasted by Technomic, remember that we serve roughly 50% of the total restaurant door locations, and we have roughly 30% share of wallet with existing customers. Sysco can still grow our business even if the market growth is less compelling. And given the strict step-downs internationally in 2022, we have strong growth potential year-over-year from our International division. Simply put, we intend to win share profitably in fiscal '23. Second, regarding inflation, we continue to work with our customers to pass through the majority of cost inflation. Interestingly, the relative price of eating out has been less impacted by inflation than the cost of food at the grocery store as seen on Slides 8 to 9. When coupled with people's desire to eat out, we believe that restaurants will once again prove resilient. Third, our investments include sales and marketing capabilities through our Recipe for Growth strategy will deliver increased value in the coming years. The topics I highlighted on this call today, coupled with new programs like Sysco Your Way and Sysco Perks will drive increased market share growth. Once again, we plan to grow faster than the overall industry, with a target in fiscal '23 of growing 1.35x the industry. This trend will put us on the trajectory needed to deliver our fiscal year '24 target of growing 1.5x the industry. We are increasingly confident in our longer-term guidance provided in May of 2021 at our Investor Day. In addition to ensuring that we drive compelling market share growth, Aaron, our entire leadership team and I will be focused on productivity improvement and structural cost out. We proud of the progress that we have made in reducing structural costs over the past year and we will be relentlessly focused on improving operations efficiency in fiscal '23. Lastly, we are excited to welcome Paulo Peereboom as the newly appointed leader of our international operations. Paulo has an extensive track record of driving transformation and building high-performing customer-focused teams across multiple geographies. This includes over 30 years of experience across seven countries, all in the food business. Our international team had a strong year of improvement in '22, and we are increasingly confident in our future. Paulo will take some momentum we are building to the next level. I'd now like to turn it over to Aaron, who will provide additional financial details. Aaron, over to you.
Aaron Alt: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning. The Sysco team delivered strong financial results for the fourth quarter and the full financial year giving us many reasons to be upbeat about our business. Let's talk about some of the highlights. We achieved an all-time record for quarterly and annual sales of Sysco landing at $19 billion for the quarter and almost $69 million for the year. For the fourth quarter, our enterprise sales grew 17.5% with U.S. Foodservice Operations growing at 16.4% and international growing at 30%. At the enterprise level, adjusting out the extra week in Q4 of fiscal year '21, our sales growth was even higher at 26.5%. With respect to volume, U.S. broadline volume increased 5.4% on a 13- to 13-week comparison basis. We baked $3.5 billion in adjusted gross profit for the quarter and $12.4 billion for the year, up almost 20% versus last year for the fourth quarter and up 32.5% for the year. Adjusted gross margin improved to 18.4% for the fourth quarter with the rate rising from last quarter and up 33 basis points to Q4 fiscal '21, even with the impact of incremental inflation. GP dollars per case grew in all four segments versus prior year, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of such growth. We continue to pass along product inflation, which was around 15% in the U.S. in the fourth quarter, while passing along part of our operating cost inflation. Our snapback operating costs dropped to $29 million in Q4. Productivity gaps, however, were a continuing factor as, on the one hand, we returned to employment levels higher than fiscal '19, but on the other, we invested to cover over time to address growing demand and lower productivity of the new staff. We invested $67 million of operating expenses for the Recipe for Growth in the quarter, with supply chain investments ramping up significantly. Overall adjusted operating expenses were $2.6 billion for the quarter or 13.8% of our sales. Operating leverage improved by 55 basis points for the quarter and 117 basis points for the year. Adjusted operating income increased by 45% versus last year to $87 million in the quarter, also exceeding our pre-COVID Q4 2019 results, an excellent sign of progress. Operating income for the year was $2.6 billion. We are particularly pleased with the progress of our U.S. Foodservice segment which delivered record operating income for the quarter and with the continued sequential progress of our international operations, which once again made progress in the direction of pre-COVID profitability. At the enterprise level, we continue to have the highest EBITDA margin in the industry. Adjusted EBITDA surpassed $1 billion for the first time ever in a quarter at Sysco and we delivered $3.3 billion of adjusted EBITDA for the year, notwithstanding COVID, Omicron inflation, the invasion of Ukraine and high fuel prices. Adjusted earnings per share increased to $1.15, which is an all-time high for the fourth quarter or any quarter for that matter at Sysco. In regards to the balance sheet, we paid down $450 million of debt as it came due in Q4. We ended the year at 2.9x net debt to adjusted EBITDA, and during the fiscal year, we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders through 500 million of share repurchase completed in the fourth quarter and $959 million of dividends. Since year-end, we have also repurchased additional shares more on that to come. Cash flow from operations was $1.8 billion, and free cash flow was $1.2 billion for the year. With our focus on driving rising sales and profitability comes rising inventory and higher balance healthy accounts receivable, both the use of cash for the year. Our team continues to manage our receivables balance as well and we also benefited from higher accounts payable. We ended the quarter with approximately $867 million in cash on hand. So let's turn to look forward. In recent months and indeed at the start of my comments today, I observed that Kevin and I are upbeat about our business and that view carries through to future quarters for Sysco. The upbeat guidance we are providing is reflective of our ongoing investments and our extensive efforts to reposition Sysco as a growth company. As Kevin mentioned earlier, we are well positioned and prepared to operate through another dynamic year and are assessing whether and to what degree a recession will impact the economy and our business. It's worth repeating that we benefit from the scale at which we're operating, our diversification as the industry leader across customer types, product categories and geographies, the discipline enabled by our pricing tool, our strong balance sheet and demonstrated focus on cost takeout. We have carefully examined Cisco's results during the '08-'09 recession, and importantly, we benefit from the fact that our company has just operated through and learned from the business interruption of COVID. Here's the real punch line. We are better positioned today to address macro events than we have ever been before. So with all of that said, during fiscal '23, from a growth algorithm perspective, we expect to grow at least 1.35x the market regardless of the economic environment. While it is difficult to be precise from the current macro environment, based on initial estimates of market growth and inflation, we expect top line growth of at least 10% over fiscal year 2022, which will move Sysco above the $75 billion annual sales mark for the first time. Bolt-on acquisitions will also contribute to our growth. We are expecting mid-single-digit inflation for the full year on an enterprise basis across all categories, moderating from high single digits in the first quarter on a year-over-year basis to low single digits in Q4. We are not planning for a deflationary environment, though some categories may be individually inflationary. We do expect elevated operating expenses during the year as we continue to deal with the hiring environment that is still recovering associate tenure driven productivity issues that we expect to improve over the course of this year and continued planned investments for our transformation, all these mitigated in part by cost-out efforts. Speaking of cost out, we delivered significant cost out in fiscal 2022, helping offset incremental operating expenses this year. We have now exceeded our cumulative cost-out target of $750 million. And we're going back for more, the achievement of which is already included in our EPS growth expectations. All in, we are growing our adjusted EPS with both volume growth and profit improvements contributing to our substantial increases in earnings per share. We are guiding adjusted EPS for fiscal year '23 of $4.09 to $4.39. The midpoint of this range equals a 30% increase in adjusted EPS over fiscal year 2022. It also represents a 20% increase in our adjusted EPS from our previous high point, fiscal '19. Please take note of the fact that even the low end of our adjusted EPS range for fiscal year '23 reflects the highest adjusted EPS achieved at Sysco ever in a year. While I do not intend to debate the definition of recession with economist, the low end of our range reflects a modest recession impacting our year. And the midpoint reflects the current operating environment and the top end reflects a strong economic recovery. The macro environment, our productivity improvement efforts and the timing of our Recipe for Growth investments will impact the cadence of our earnings growth with stronger profit growth expected in the second half. For Q1, we expect adjusted EPS to be at or near our prior first quarter high point from back in 2020. The stronger earnings growth in the second half reflects continued progress with our rescue for growth, progress on productivity initiatives, lapping last year's Omicron related slowdown and the fact that Q4 is always our seasonal profit high point. You may recall that in May 2021, we provided long-term guidance for fiscal year '24 to achieve adjusted EPS 30% higher than fiscal '19. The midpoint of our fiscal year '23 guidance, which is 20% above fiscal '19 reflects that we are well on our way to achieving our previous long-term EPS guidance. The midpoint of our guidance also translates to adjusted EBITDA of approximately $4 billion in the year. We are forecasting continued strong cash generation and an increase from 2022 levels driven by profit increases, offset by investments in working capital as AR grows with our sales, and we continue to our strategy with tactical investments in inventory. Our capital allocation strategy remains sustained going forward, invest in the business, including through M&A, maintain our strong investment-grade rating and continue our return of capital to shareholders. With EBITDA growing, we expect to make further progress on our net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage in service of our target of 2.5x to 2.75x. Also note that we are positioned well in the current rising interest rate environment as approximately 95% of our debt is fixed. Just last week, Moody's reaffirmed Sysco's strong investment-grade credit rating and stabilized our rating outlook. We are committed to completing up $500 million of share repurchases in fiscal '23, and indeed have already completed $267 million of that repurchase commitment during Q1 of this year. We will be assessing the operating environment and the cash as of further M&A opportunities before committing to an incremental share repurchase activity beyond the $500 million during the year. Our status for the dividend aristocrat is important to us and we already announced the effective $0.08 annual dividend increase for our fiscal year '23. In summary, we view fiscal '23 as an excellent build upon fiscal '22 as we grow both the top line and the bottom line, while playing the long game and investing for the future at Sysco. All of these efforts are consistent with fulfilling our long-term guidance from Investor Day, which includes exceeding 1.5x market share growth by the end of fiscal year 2024 and adjusted EPS growth of at least 30% over our record 2019 levels. With that, I will turn the call back over to Kevin for remarks.
Kevin Hourican: Thank you, Aaron. As we conclude, I'd like to provide a brief summary on Slide 25. Sysco already is the industry brief summary on Slide 25. Sysco already is the industry leader from an EBITDA margin perspective. And as you heard from Aaron, we plan to build on that position of strength in fiscal 2023. Our key takeaways from today's call reflects three points. First, we advanced our Recipe per Growth strategy and grew more than 1.3x the market for the year, with the second half even stronger than the first. Second, we improved profitability with sequential progress in both gross profit and operating margin rates. And third, recognizing macroeconomic pressures as well as the resiliency of our industry, we're confident in our external guidance for fiscal year 2023. This assumes at least 10% sales growth and 30% EPS growth at the midpoint as we continue to grow with new and existing customers. We will also remain disciplined in expense management with a strong plan to drive increased operating leverage. Turning to the next slide. We are generating substantial top line momentum and accelerating market charities. Our Recipe for Growth transformation is winning in the marketplace and creating capabilities at Sysco that will help us profitably grow for the long term. We are further building the fun and enhancing our competitive scale advantages. Sysco's strength of income statement and balance sheet have enabled us to continue advancing our strategy during a difficult operating environment, while also rewarding our long-term shareholders with disciplined dividend growth and share repurchases. Lastly, we are committed to our long-term financial outlook, which includes significant sales and EPS growth and returning value to our shareholders along the way. There are bright days ahead for Sysco, and I'm both excited and proud to be a part of the journey. Operator, you can now open the line for questions.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Lauren Silberman of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Lauren Silberman: I just wanted to ask first one on local case growth, down 7% for the quarter. Can you give us that number excluding the lapping over the 53rd week, just so we understand the underlying trend? And then on a three-year basis versus '19, it looks like local case growth is down about 1.5%, pretty consistent, I think, each quarter throughout the year. So any color you can provide on what you're seeing as an independent customer.
Kevin Hourican: Thank you for the question. This is Kevin. I'll just start. To answer to your question and I'll talk a little bit about what we're seeing from a volume perspective. So flattish is the answer from a Q4 same number of weeks year-over-year. And just keep in mind, as you look at this past year, when we were comping against recovery, which Q4, we were comping against a pretty strong recovery in '21, so flattish volumes on 13 to 13 against prior year, pretty strong recovery. What we're seeing right now from a volume perspective is when you couple that with inflation that was higher than what we had modeled and expected, really strong sales results for the quarter. And obviously, that strong sales, coupled with the flattish volume for local flowed through to a profit number that was robust for the quarter, exceeded our guide. As Aaron mentioned, highest quarter ever for Sysco. As we think about this coming year, I'd point you to Slide 10 that was in our prepared remarks, that chart does include all business. It's not just local, but it speaks for itself, the performance of Sysco over time that we're pulling away from the market. I stated on the call this morning that we grew at 1.3 times the industry for the year. And I also was pretty clear that we grew in the second half even faster than the first. So in the chart shows that, if you look at the lines in the separation that's occurring. So, we're building momentum. At that moment, to answer your question just on trends is carrying through at the national level and also at the local level. We're winning more new national business at profit rates that meet or exceed our expectations, and we're having a lot of success at the local level as well. My comments in regards to macroeconomics do apply to all customer types, including the mom and pop local independent. We view cost of fuel as one of the primary drivers of consumer sentiment and that high cost of fuel that was impacting consumers began in the Q4 and is included in the business trends that we're producing, and it was thoughtful in the guide that we provided today. Last but not least, Aaron's comments of at least 10% sales growth this year and 30% EPS growth, and we're confident in our ability to deliver against those mile-markers.
Lauren Silberman: Great. And if I could just ask a follow-up on gross profit. So gross profit dollar growth per case growth has been very strong, it feels like inflation is peaking. What's your confidence in maintaining gross profit dollars? Are you seeing any signs of pushback from consumers on the inflation? And I know you're not expecting deflation in '23, but should we see deflation? I mean how do we think about that ability to maintain gross profit dollars? Thank you.
Kevin Hourican: Yes. Thank you, Lauren. We're just really pleased with the work that we're doing within our merchant organization to drive to net lowest cost for Sysco, so through strategic sourcing. Judy Sansone and our merchant team is just doing excellent work to enable Sysco due to our size and scale to provide value to our customers, point one. Point two, Sysco brand improvement in the quarter because of the value that Sysco brand provides to our customers, we're helping to save them money at high quality rates and our sales force did a really good job in the most recent quarter of introducing Sysco brand to our customers. Last point, only three, the intelligent data-driven pricing system that we are leveraging is enabling us to be very sophisticated and thoughtful on how we're passing through that inflation. So, we are confident that we can pass through inflation to our customers. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, and our sales team has been work with those exact same customers to help them be successful. Think about portion size. Think about ingredients on the menu. Think about the menu itself and how it can adjust, modify change to help that end restaurant be successful and for them to be profitable during this period of high inflation. So, we are confident in our ability to continue to pass through inflation and we are confident in the guide that we provided today. I'm going to toss to Aaron for the second half of your question, Aaron, over to you.
Aaron Alt: Great, good morning. Just to observe that we are assuming and expecting moderating into levels over the course of the year. We're not expecting a deflationary environment, although some categories may be deflationary and we've built that into our own models from a mix perspective. I want to observe as well that the inflation in our guidance is actually enterprise, not just USPL which we have typically disclosed in prior quarters. And to perhaps reinforce Kevin's point, I am quite pleased with both the opportunity we have to optimize our product portfolio, the cost structure, as Kevin called out for us, but also to work with our customers, utilizing Sysco Brand products to optimize for both of us while also being pleased with our continued ability to pass through increased product inflation costs to our customers and then on to their own customers.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ed Kelly of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Ed Kelly: I wanted to start with just the trend in underlying case growth in the U.S. Could you maybe talk a little bit about the cadence of the case growth versus sort of '19 as the quarter progressed. And then what you are seeing in July and August? Are you above 2019 at this point? And then, you mentioned consumer sort of changing or seeming like, I guess, maybe consumer risk. But are you actually seeing any impact yet?
Kevin Hourican: Appreciate the question. What we talked about on the prepared remarks is just -- and you obviously know this and know this well. Our diversification from high to low restaurants from the white table cost all the way down to QSR, we're fully diversified across that spectrum and the broad product range that we carry from good, better and best pricing strategies, we cover the gamut from restaurant customer perspective. There's no notable call-out to report on shift within restaurant sectors other than to say there are winners and losers and top performers and top companies and top brands are doing well and weaker companies are not doing as well relatively. And we're seeing that in each of the restaurant consumer sectors that strong operators are performing well, weaker operators are donating share to the strong performers, but there's not a meaningful trend or news for us to share or talk about. We provided color today relative to our overall performance versus the market accelerating and widening as it relates specifically to July, August. Our recommendation is to focus on the guide that we provided today, which is sales lift for the year. Aaron just talked about the inflation that's inherent in that sales guide and then the profit guide that we provided. So no meaningful call-outs, we're upbeat and positive on the performance of the Company and our business trends and we point you to the full year guide to talk about how we're currently performing.
Ed Kelly: Okay. Great. And then just a quick follow-up it's really around SG&A, particularly around the U.S. business. You've made quite a bit of investment this year. You can kind of see that right in your OpEx dollars versus '19 or OpEx per case, for instance, quite a bit. How are you thinking about 2003 from sort of an OpEx per case standpoint, does that continue to grow? I mean it sounds like it does. But then at some point, it seems like once this settles down, that there's real opportunity to sort of capitalize on a lot of those investments. So I'm kind of curious as to we see that period.
Kevin Hourican: This is Kevin. I'm going to start just talking about overall supply chain productivity, and then I'll toss to Aaron, who can comment on overall expense leverage and anything he'd like to share in that regard. Aaron called out in our prepared remarks where we're winning as a company. There are elements where we're doing really well. We're winning from a top line perspective. We're gaining share, both national and local. We're doing an excellent job at GP management passing through inflation, using strategic sourcing to purchase product at a competitive rate and having that impact positively our margin rates, and we had a disappointment from an expense perspective versus where we expected to be. I want to be clear on what the driver of that is. And it's just in general, our overall productivity within our supply chain being behind where we expected it to be. And I want to unpack that a little bit, make some comments about it and then toss to Aaron. I want to be clear, we are properly staffed within our supply chain at this point in time, and that has a dramatic improvement year-over-year. This time last year, with the recovery of the business was occurring and the great resignation was happening. We were understaffed as well as the industry and it created a lot of pain within our supply chain. We are properly staffed at this time. Our hiring has improved, applicant flow has improved and the training that we are providing to our new associates has simply never been better. In fact, we're heading to one of our sites this afternoon to go spend time with our training academy and celebrate the success that, that team is having on providing literally the industry's best training program to our associates. So we are properly staffed, we are investing in training at a level that we have not performed. We have a challenge in overall math, which is the simple following point. Roughly half of our supply chain associates have been with the Company for under a year. And it's that point that point alone, that results in a productivity rate that is below, therefore, our historical average. These are challenging jobs. They're skilled labor positions, and it takes time for someone to move up the productivity curve. The reason for my calling out that data point, that roughly half of our associates were in job under a year, is that is absolutely an addressable topic by Sysco's leadership, myself, our team and the driver and selector academies that I referenced on today's call. We will improve associate retention in the process of improving that retention and improving our training efforts, we will move people up the productivity curve. And in the process of moving up there the productivity curve, it will lower our logistics cost as a percent of sales and our logistics cost to serve. It's taking a little bit longer than we would have liked, but we will improve retention. We will improve productivity, and that has been included in the guidance that we provided today for fiscal '23. Aaron, I'll toss to you for additional comments.
Aaron Alt: Great. Let me touch a couple of the elements as apparent on the face of Kevin's remarks, we're going to increase volume over the course of fiscal '23. And of course, with increased incomes, increased cost of service, we would all expect that. During the quarter, we did also have to address increased costs of things like fuel, recruiting, et cetera, cost to hire, and those are moderating, right? And we have steps in place hedging or other programs to address those as well. But as we look forward, we expect those to improve in fiscal '23. Kevin has already touched on the impact of productivity. As we called out in our guidance, we expect that to improve over the course of the year. Our transformation expenses were higher in Q4. And indeed, we will continue to invest heavily in the year as we play the long game against our transformation expense, but those are costs that over time will moderate. And then snapback, they came down in Q4, and we expect them to continue to come down over the course of the year. Now the thing we haven't talked about so far yet is cost out, right? We were pleased that we had surpassed our original cost-out objective of $750 million during the year. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we are going back for more, and there is more opportunity. One of the benefits of operating of a company of the size of Sysco is where we find a good idea and we deploy it, we can recognize what works and that we can deploy to other parts of our enterprise. And so, we've actually recently revised our structure of cost leadership to go after more and are confident that we can continue to help to offset some of the costs elsewhere in the network, at least through cost out as we carry forward. The benefits, they're all baked into the guidance that we've provided for fiscal year '23. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mark Carden of UBS. Please go ahead.
Mark Carden: So you grew at 1.3x the market in fiscal '22 which topped your original expectations. There's obviously some macro challenges in place, but is there any reason why you would expect your market share glide path to slow in fiscal '23 before accelerating in '24? Is this just some conservatism built in with the 1.35 or are there specifics on that front that we should be aware of?
Kevin Hourican: Mark, I appreciate the question. Thank you for asking. The step-up is just go back to our original guide from May of '21, our Investor Day was to grow 1.2 in the year that just ended into grout 1.5 in fiscal 2024. And essentially, fiscal '23 was going to be a midpoint between those two things as we ramped up our Recipe for Growth. What happened in fiscal 2022, the year that just ended, is we had two primary contributions to our success. One was our Recipe for Growth, which I'm going to come back to in a second. The second was our ability to ship on time and in full, as I mentioned on today's call, was greater than the industry at large. And we had national customers and local customers coming to Sysco and essentially asking us to take on their business, and we were able to take on that business at above historical profit rates because of the economic macro conditions as they were. So that relative supply chain strength was a large contributor to our success and the Recipe for Growth was a large contributor to success. And what we guided today is a 1.35x market growth. As Aaron said, regardless of how the market performs, we're going to perform better than that market in total. What will happen in '23 is the relative supply chain strength contribution will be smaller because we expect for the overall marketplace to be more stable in this coming year and the relative impact of the Recipe for Growth will be greater in '23. And the reason it steps up to 1.5 in fiscal '20 again, that Recipe for Growth contribution gets bigger and stronger each year. Why is that? I'll just point to a couple of examples. We're an agile development health from a tech perspective, and we're rolling out new functionality to our website literally every two weeks. And those contributions of increasing the efficiency of placing an order, add value. The work we're doing with data and analytics to provide suggested orders to our customers get smarter and better over time, it adds value. I mentioned in my prepared remarks today, two of our newer efforts, which is Sysco Your Way and Sysco Perks, there's still an implementation mode at the current time. Here's the good news. Both programs are exceeding our internal expectations for the neighborhoods and customers that have been enrolled, and we will roll those programs out nationwide over the coming quarters and years. And so that's a relative contribution. So what we see is a sequential increase in the effective power and weight of those programs, and it's why we reiterated today our overall macro confidence in our ability to grow 1.5x in the market in fiscal '24. And we think given everything that's going on in the overall environment, the 1.35x guide that we provided today is prudent. Aaron, I'll toss to you for additional comments.
Aaron Alt: Just one final thought, which is to observe that for a company of our size to still have a 17% market share, 30% penetration and -- we serve about 50% of the independent sticks that just reinforces just how much opportunity there is out there as we deploy the Recipe for Growth to drive, particularly with the benefit of our balance sheet.
Mark Carden: Makes sense. Thanks for the clarity there. And so, separately, you noted that you're still able to pass through the majority of inflation. Are competitors acting any less rationally with respect to price the temptation for smaller players grow to get more aggressive, just to stay relevant? And then how does your pricing tool impact your positioning in this environment?
Kevin Hourican: We're seeing a rational pricing environment. I'd say all distributors understand the cost increases to them and understand the impact to their P&L, if they don't pass through the inflation. So, we're seeing a rational pricing market out there. Specific to our pricing tool and what enables one of the data feeds into our pricing tool is market price competitiveness. And it's a new muscle at Sysco. So think about every region within which we operate. We are intelligent about scraping the market to understand price, what's happening in the marketplace. It's one of -- I emphasize that, one of the data feeds. We've got other data feeds like what's our pricing strategy for that category, for that cuisine, for that customer type. And it's an algorithm that gets utilized, therefore, to provide a specific item of customer-specific price. So, we are better equipped than ever before to understand what's happening in the local environment because pricing is local in this industry than we've ever been before.
Operator: Your next question comes from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.
John Heinbockel: So Kevin, I want to start with -- you said at least 10% growth. So, you can grow 10% in a mild recession, right, and, I guess, possibly grow faster than that, if the macro is better. So I guess what would happen in a slower environment, your share gains, maybe you can comment -- your share gains relative to the market would increase beyond the 1.35 right? And where would that come from primarily? Do you think that's wallet share that 30% goes up? And what would be the one or two things that would be most impactful in driving that wallet share this year in the next 12 months?
Kevin Hourican: John, good question. Thank you. Yes, mathematically implied in what you just said is if the overall market grows less than what we expected, and we communicated today that we see our ability to deliver at least a 10% sales lift. We will then take more share. And we will do so profitably. I want to be crystal clear, I've said before, many times, I'll say again, we will not use price as a primary lever to try to win business. We think that's irrational. And we want to win through assortment, our service, our capabilities, our programs, et cetera, et cetera. If you pick just one thing to focus on to improve profitability, it would be increased penetration with existing customers. That's the direct answer to your question. If we could focus on one thing and one thing only, it's increased penetration with existing customers. We are really pleased with what we're seeing, John, with Sysco Your Way and Sysco Perks on penetration by providing customers in Sysco Your Way with late in the evening, caught off increased delivery frequency, no order minimums in a compelling service coverage model, meaning dedicated sales reps, dedicated driver, partner, et cetera, et cetera. The reward we are experiencing in those neighborhoods is increased penetration with existing customers. And Sysco Perks is a loyalty program tied to our most important customers. Essentially, it's a VIP club, you get invited into. The entire purpose of that club is to increase penetration, increase share of wallet with existing customers. So, we're bullish on those two strategic arrows in our quiver. But we believe that we can win new business as well. Our sales reps are motivated financially to win new customers. We've got the largest and most qualified sales force in the industry, and they're doing a very good job of new customer prospecting, and we continue to win net new customers at accelerated rates. So, it's actually the two together is what's causing that separation on Slide 10 of us versus the market. But if you can do one and one only, it's increased penetration with existing customers.
John Heinbockel: And maybe as a follow-up to that. What's the biggest pushback you get, right, from any restaurant where you have, right 30% on average right? So you have plenty that are under 30%. Because it just seems having fewer trucks in the back door, everything on one truck, the economic seems right, overwhelmingly positive. What's the hurdle? And I mean historically, right, we've heard the hurdle on the protein side is just a perception of quality versus specialists. I imagine that's not the case anymore? Or is that the biggest hurdle?
Kevin Hourican: Yes, I would say that is not the biggest hurdle, especially when you think about our robust specialty platform, where we have the largest specialty business, and with Buckhead in Newport, we have the largest specialty meat business as well. So, we call it team-based selling and our ability to deliver that high-end fine protein center of plate along with broadline value is second to none in the industry. And we're doing an even better job than ever before and have been able to bring that specialty price point, that specialty product, along with 50 pounds bags of rice and flower, et cetera, et cetera, that broadline is known for. So we're doing that very well. John, I'd say in the current economic environment and the reality of COVID, the biggest challenge, the biggest barrier has been product availability, believe it or not. The ability to be in stock at all times with key volume items that our customers need, and there have been challenges with long-term out on product that if you can't deliver, guess what, their customer is going to go somewhere else to get that product. And then, if they do go somewhere else, do they get sticky with that source of purchasing on that product and then you need to win it back over time. So that's not a problem that's unique to Sysco. Fill rate from suppliers, inbound distributors has been difficult over the last 18 months because of staffing issues and challenges in the supplier base. And then that has shown up with a customer telling us, "Hey listen, I need two or three distributors because if you can't fill my order, I need to be able to have my menu in stock." We're making meaningful progress on that topic at Sysco. We are leading the industry from an OTIF perspective, as I mentioned. So we don't view that as a point of weakness. We view it as a point of strength, but I'm meaningfully answering your question that, that has been for our industry, the biggest challenge, product availability. Topic two, which is the more historical answer to your question is, its price. A competitor comes in on one item and undercuts you on price with that one item and then the customer says, "Well, hey, wait a minute, I can get this product 10% cheaper somewhere else." We don't price a business just one item. It's a book of business. And so, there's this that constant, I call it ankle biters, a competitor coming in, trying to undercut you on price on a single item trying to get in the door. And that's not a new topic, people coming in and trying to undercut on a single item. But again, our pricing tool gives us the sophistication that we need to make sure that our sales reps are confident in the prices that they're representing in the marketplace are fair and appropriate, and I think we're better equipped to be able to manage that in the future than ever before. John, back to you if you have a follow-up.
John Heinbockel: No, no, that is great.
Operator: Your next question comes from John Glass of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
John Glass: My question is on international and how international pulls into your top line guidance for '23. Can you maybe frame how -- where case volumes are in absolute versus '19, for example, I don't think we've got the good sense of what inflation what the role has been there? And are there particular initiatives that you've rolled out in the U.S. that roll out maybe to those international markets that help drive sales? Any color there, please?
Kevin Hourican: Yes, John, thank you for the question. We appreciate it. We're bullish on our international business. Strong quarter for the quarter that disclosed, wrapped up a strong year versus where we expected that business to be and we're building momentum. As we think about this upcoming year, Omicron impacted the United States, and we had some softening in the business in Q2 and Q3. Well, that softening was even greater internationally. Europe was in complete lockdown. The down again during Omicron, I mean it's really different how Europe handled COVID. And in Canada, while the lockdowns weren't as robust as Europe, consumer psyche risk tolerance was much lower than the U.S. and just overall food away-from-home volumes were down. So we're bullish about the year ahead. Paulo joining our company, as I announced today on the call, is going to be just a great addition to our team, and we have confidence that this coming year will be a sequential increase in both the top line and the bottom line contribution from international. Specific to your question about initiatives, I love that question. It's exactly what we are doing. We are taking the Recipe for Growth, which is meaningfully working in the U.S., and we are bringing the best practices from now these programs to our international domain, starting with Canada. So we're deploying a new modern website this year in Canada. We are deploying a new pricing tool in Canada this year, and we will be bringing programs like Sysco Your Way and Sysco Perks to Canada as well. The same goes to Ireland and GB and France to round out our larger international sectors. We are bringing to each of those countries the main elements of our strength portfolio, including advancing Sysco brand as a represented product offering in each of those countries. So, we're thoughtful about it. We are pragmatic about it. We can't do everything overnight, but we are meaningfully rigorously prioritizing, which initiatives are taken to which country when. And obviously, that's been built into our guidance for this coming year. Aaron, I'll toss to you for any additional comments.
Aaron Alt: Great. Thank you. Just a couple of observations. We've been pleased with the contribution of the international business to our fiscal '22 delivery, as Kevin called out. And indeed, we have baked continued progress into the core or midpoint of our guidance for fiscal '23 as well. We don't separately disclose the volume numbers for the international business, so I'm not prepared to do that today other than to observe that one of the nice things about the international business as they continue to make progress is, we're upbeat on the opportunity that, that part of the business continues to present to us to improve as we carry forward. And whether it's leadership on cost out or driving maybe the Recipe for Growth initiatives that Kevin called out, we have the opportunity to do more in that part of the business. And with the new leadership we have, we're up in there.
John Glass: And Aaron, just a quick follow-up. You talked about snapback and transformation costs pertaining to '23. And in fact, that's on e of the -- maybe it's pressuring the first half. Can you give an order of magnitude? Are those bigger, smaller or similar in '23 than they were in '22?
Aaron Alt: I'm not going to comment directly on that other than I'm referring you back to my prepared remarks and in particular, the color we tried to give around the cadence of earnings given where they were. The practical reality is if you look at what we said with Q1 being at or near our high point previously and the new to the math from the absolute guide, it's apparent that the profit increases are across the year, and that's the best I can give you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Alex Slagle of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Alex Slagle: A question on the guidance and what's embedded there kind of what your high-level assumptions are around what kind of recovery you expect in some of the categories that lagged here in the U.S. like business industry and business travel, hospitality. Just your thoughts there.
Kevin Hourican: Sure. Let me offer a couple of thoughts. First, as part of going through our planning cycle for fiscal '23, we were quite detailed in looking at the what-if scenario is around not just the enterprise as a whole, but the individual constituent pieces of our portfolio. And while we don't disclose that as part of our guide, you can have some confidence in the fact that we've looked at what might be the same or different around the European business, the parts of the business in the U.S., the Canadian business, et cetera, both as it relates to the possibility of recession risk or impact to the consumer, but also on variable rates of inflation and how the pieces fit together. And so what we came out with from a guidance perspective with our $0.30 range was a balanced view, we believe, of if things continue as they are down the midpoint relative to our ability to deliver the profitability. Of course, if there is a modest impact from a recession perspective, again, looking at it across the portfolio as we do the math, you see the lower end of our guide. And indeed, if that doesn't materialize, us, some are saying it won't, not going to comment on that. We wanted to also reflect the fact that there is some further upside in the opportunity as well. And so, we believe our guidance is a balanced approach, having done some detailed work on the individual constituent pieces of the portfolio.
Kevin Hourican: This is Kevin. I'm just going to add one point. Our total business growth in health, we are seeing positive trends in travel, hospitality and business and industry sectors that historically Sysco performs very well in. We've also won market share in those sectors over the last two years, and then therefore, as those two sectors on their natural recovery curve. That's a tailwind for Sysco because of the market share that we have won over the last 2.5 years in those sectors. And then education and the health care sector. We've also won market share in those two sectors as well. And those are two very recession proof sectors for Sysco. So we're pleased with our national sales team. They've done an excellent job of winning new business over the last couple of years, profitably. And in several sectors, you called out two of them, Alex. We see tailwinds in this coming year, and that was built into and factored into our guide today.
Aaron Alt: Maybe one final thought point, which is given the number of different opportunities we have across our diverse portfolio, I just want to emphasize that the low end of our range is still the highest EPS at Sysco ever.
Alex Slagle: Appreciate that. And then just on SYGMA and the opportunity to drive a recovery in the operating profit there, it looks like you're looking for improvements in '23. Could you talk about the actions taken and how much recovery you see coming in '23? Or does this take a couple of years to get back to historical profitability levels.
Kevin Hourican: So this is Kevin. I'll start just kind of what's happening with SYGMA and then I'll toss to Aaron to answer your question about the numbers in whatever manner he would like. So just a reminder for those that are new covering our company -- just a little bit about our SYGMA business, it's very different. It's very unique in relation to everything else we do. It is a cost per case business on a multiyear contract basis. So let's just be honest and clear. It was a very difficult year for SYGMA as fuel costs rose significantly, as labor costs because of retention challenges and productivity challenges tied to that rose significantly. SYGMA got pinched and pinched hard on rising expenses, essentially the inability to pass through rising costs because of the way that business is run on a fee per case basis, challenging year. Last point is it's a stretch miles business, where the route distances are substantially longer than what I call the pedal runs or broadline where we started in D.C., do a little run come back home. SYGMA is long-distance driving in what we call stretch miles. So, the rising cost of fuel was a real particular pain point. If I look at this upcoming year, I'll just give color commentary on where we have confidence the improvement will come from, and then I'll toss to Aaron. And the higher turnover and the negative impact of that higher turnover had on our productivity and overtime rates that we were incurring because of the open jobs was a major pain point, and that is meaningfully addressable through the work that we're doing with hiring stability, which is meaningfully improving. Training effectiveness, which I've already spoken to on this call, and our ability to reduce over time, reduce the use of third-party labor and just frankly, run the model more efficiently. So, we can get back to more historical standards of cost to serve and improve the profitability of SYGMA, and that is our intention this year. Aaron, I'll toss to you for additional comment.
Aaron Alt: Just two quick thoughts. First is, we're assuming continued progress on profitability for SYGMA within our guidance, although we don't separate it by segment in that way. And then just to repeat the observation I made in previous quarters that, our expense recovery or some of our expense recovery within the SYGMA segment actually trails. And so, we'll have an expensive one quarter and we'll pick it we'll cover at the following quarter, and that's part of what's going on.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein of Barclays. Please go ahead.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much. Two questions. The first one, just a follow-up. Kevin, I know the topic earlier was brought up about the broader restaurant industry, whether it be chains versus independents or QSR versus casual dining. Was there a message to be that you're really not seeing a change in trend between the different segments? I know you service all restaurants. So seemingly, you'd be pretty well insulated if that was trade more likely to trade down. But just trying to understand what you're seeing across the restaurant industry over the past few months or whether perhaps you're not seeing any change at all? And then I had a follow-up.
Kevin Hourican: Yes, Jeff, we prefer not to get into the too detailed color on individual names. Of course, that's not our place. They report their own results. What we are commenting is that within each of our sectors, from white table go all the way down to QSR, we see winners and losers within each of those sectors. And I think you see that in the coverage that you do across that sector. There are winners and there are losers within each segment. We are not seeing meaningful shift from the top end of the spectrum to QSR are within the sectors. What we are seeing, point number two, for some additional color is that customers within each of the sectors wanting to partner with Sysco to provide value to their customers to help offset the cost of inflation. So examples of that will be Sysco brand penetration is increasing, which is a good thing for us, and we will be sticky on that. I want to be clear about that. When we make progress in Sysco brand, when customers give it a try and we do product quality cuttings, they love the product quality. They obviously enjoy the savings from a cost perspective and then we can be very sticky in that regard. So that's a key point. And then I think you've heard from some of the manufacturers, some shift from the beef category into poultry that was publicly communicated yesterday. And I would say, yes, beef has been highly inflationary. It was the most inflationary category over the last couple of years and customers of ours are looking at portion size. They're looking at alternative protein options. And that's what our sales results -- excuse me, sales consultants do. They helped our customers with that. The good news on the protein side specific to beef, beef prices have normalized, and I know you're aware of that as well. So the overall rate of inflation in beef has stabilized meaningfully and we do expect for inflation in aggregate to moderate this coming year as Aaron has called out in our guidance.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Got it. And then the follow-up, you mentioned the cost outs I know you're already above the $750 million target and you're going for more. Are there big buckets of opportunity that maybe you haven't touched before? Or is it primarily areas you've already hit, but there just -- is incremental opportunity there. Just try to figure out whether there's totally new channels that you're pursuing or just more of the existing?
Kevin Hourican: I would say there's opportunity everywhere we look, whether it's new opportunity or indeed scaling opportunities we've already identified, whether it's indirect purchase or whether it's the structure we deploy, how we resource particular parts of the business. And while it's not of our cost out per se, I want to emphasize the point that we have further opportunity to optimize our cost of goods serve as well. It's outside of the -- what I call cost out going forward. But there is goodness in the portfolio that we're going to use to help offset cost increases in the short term relative to our investments.
Kevin Hourican: And this is Kevin. I'll just add one example, which is our omnichannel project, which I talked about briefly on today's call. I haven't really mentioned it too much in prior calls. The technology for the distributed order management system goes live this quarter and what it will enable us to do is decouple the front-end sales from the back-end operations. And by doing that, we can ensure that we decrease miles driven, meaning serve the customer from the closest possible warehouse. That sounds basic and obvious, but it is a meaningful unlock technologically, but it also is going to help us with our strategic stocking of product, what product is where. Think about slow-moving SKUs and fewer warehouses that then get cross-docked through the last mile delivery location and really being strategic and optimized of increasing the ability of our inventory, but actually doing it with overall over time, less inventory, less working capital. Those are examples of that project, which is multiyear in its build, creating cost structure take out into the future. And again, built into our guide for this coming year, but that project, in particular, is one that we're excited about.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Got it. And just Aaron, to clarify or I guess, to level set for everyone on the call, I think you mentioned -- we understand the full year earnings guidance, but you said the fiscal first quarter earnings guidance would be at levels similar to the first quarter of fiscal '20. So is that the $0.98 if I'm getting that right, that you're thinking the first quarter will be in that $0.98 range?
Aaron Alt: I said we'd be at or near that $098 expense, yes. Just given the transformation investments and the productivity we're working through.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Understood. Thank you.
Aaron Alt: Thank you, Jeff.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately, we have run out of time today. So, this is going to conclude your conference call. We would like to thank everybody for participating and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-05-10 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Sysco's Third Quarter Fiscal 2022 Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. We will begin with opening remarks and introductions. I would like to turn the call over to Kevin Kim, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Kevin Kim: Good morning, everybody, and welcome to Sysco's third quarter fiscal '22 earnings call. On today's call, we have Kevin Hourican, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Aaron Alt, our CFO; and Neil Russell, our SVP of Corporate Affairs and Chief Communications Officer. Before we begin, please note that statements made during this presentation, which state the Company's or management's intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, and actual results could differ in a material manner. Additional information about factors that could cause results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the Company's SEC filings. This includes, but is not limited to, risk factors contained in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 3, 2021, subsequent SEC filings and in the news release issued earlier this morning. A copy of these materials can be found in the Investors section at sysco.com. Non-GAAP financial measures are included in our comments today and in our presentation slides. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures is included at the end of the presentation slides and can be found in the Investors section of our website. To ensure that we have sufficient time to answer all questions, we'd like to ask each participant to limit their time today to one question and one follow-up. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Hourican.
Kevin Hourican: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call. Our financial performance this quarter exceeded our internal expectations, driven by strong top line performance, accelerating market share gains, solid gross margin management and improvement in our operations expenses. Earlier today, we raised our full year guidance, and Aaron will walk you through the details in just a few moments. Our strong performance for the quarter demonstrates our focus on the customer and the advancement of our Recipe for Growth strategy. Simply put, we are winning in the marketplace. The best measure of this success is the continued market share gains that we are delivering. Our performance versus the market accelerated in the quarter, and we solidly exceeded our fiscal 2022 goal of growing 1.2x the market. I will highlight three topics during our call today: first, I will touch on our financial results; second, I'll discuss the state of the current operating environment; and finally, I will highlight progress from our Recipe for Growth transformation. I'll then turn it over to Aaron to discuss our financial results in more detail. So let's get started with our financial results displayed on Slide number 4. Our third quarter results were fueled by strong top line performance across the U.S. and international segments and progress made in lowering operating expenses as a percentage of sales. As a result, our profit results were ahead of our internal expectations this quarter. While our operational expenses remain elevated versus our historical standards, we've begun making progress in improving our productivity. We will continue to make progress in the coming quarters. Key headlines this quarter include: market share gains that significantly exceeded our 1.2x the market growth target; significant volume improvements with U.S. Broadline volume up approximately 19% versus the same period in fiscal year 2021; and our USFS business delivering volume growth versus 2019 in total. This also included another quarter of profitable growth coming from our International segment. Our expense structure is improving. As I mentioned, we still have work to do in order to return to our standard of excellence but we have begun making progress. Importantly, our snapback investments were reduced by more than 50% versus the prior quarter. Our strong sales results and continued progress in improving operating expenses drove solid profit growth. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.71 for the quarter. We achieved these results while meaningfully advancing our Recipe for Growth strategy. This included successfully closing on the Coastal Companies transaction during the quarter, further expanding our industry-leading produce business that is high growth at attractive margins. Topic two for today, an update on the current environment. The third quarter started with COVID-related disruptions from the Omicron variant. Recall that the negative impact from Omicron started in late November and the effects were felt through February. Sysco delivered a strong quarter of growth despite the headwind from Omicron. Two factors played to our favor: a strong market rebound in late February and into March and Sysco winning market share throughout the entire quarter. Combined, these factors enabled both our U.S. and international businesses to deliver volumes greater than our internal forecast for the period. As I mentioned a moment ago, volume in our U.S. Foodservice operations exceeded pre-COVID-19 levels for the quarter. The positive momentum was strong across geographies as well as across different customer types. With that said, we expect additional momentum over time from improved international volume as the recovery in the food-away-from-home market strengthens internationally. At Sysco, we have two business sectors that remain heavily impacted by COVID, business and industry, which includes customers such as office cafeterias and travel and hospitality, which is heavily impacted by conferences and large group catering events. We anticipate both segments making progress this summer and into the fall. For example, many major employers have begun returning to the office, and recent reports from airline and hotel CEOs have cited steadily improving bookings for this summer. An advantage of Sysco is that we are fully diversified across the food-away-from-home business. While high cost of fuel is being felt by our customers, we have not experienced a reduction of consumer demand. The fact that we cover all restaurant types up and down the price point spectrum provides us some protection in an unpredictable economy. Additionally, the pricing relationship between food-at-home and food-away-from-home is favorable to Sysco versus historical relationships, as you can see on Slide 6 in our presentation. With that said, we remain concerned about the long-term effect of elevated inflation, and we are taking strong actions to manage the situation. We are actively working to improve cost of goods sold inbound to Sysco so that we can pass along value to our customers. We are aggressively pursuing Sysco brand penetration opportunities as we know that Sysco products save our customers money. We are also working aggressively with our customers to help them with their menu design and, therefore, helping these customers find alternatives to step around highly inflationary items in subcategories. We're also helping them to have confidence in their menu pricing strategies. This work helps us go earn trust and respect with our large customer base. In regards to our supply chain, I'd like to report that conditions are improving. Applicant flow to open positions has increased, and our talent acquisition team has helped us make progress in improving our staffing health. As a result, we have been able to reduce associate overtime and improve our service levels to our customers over the past quarter. Our NPS or net promoter score results, this quarter improved and continue to lead versus the market. It is still a very dynamic environment, but the size and scale advantages of Sysco are enabling us to succeed in a turbulent environment. Topic three for today, I'll provide select highlights of our Recipe for Growth progress. Last quarter, I provided an update on two of our growth initiatives: Sysco Your Way and our Italian cuisine platform. These two initiatives continue to progress well, driving profitable growth for the Company. We expanded Sysco Your Way to additional neighborhoods in the quarter, and the recently added locations are performing consistent with the strong results from our pilot locations. Today, I'd like to provide an update on two additional topics, our supply chain transformation and progress that we are making in consultative sales. As I mentioned, our supply chain health has improved over the past quarter as applicant flow to our open jobs has improved and we're beginning to make progress in operations productivity. Improving the efficiency of our supply chain is a top priority for our entire leadership team. To ensure that we succeed at a higher level in the future, we are making substantial commitments to improve our associate experience within operations. A great example is our Driver Academy, which is now up and running in full swing. We've graduated our first class of drivers, and we have opened additional academy locations. We expect to be nationwide with this capability by the end of the calendar year. The Driver Academy will enable us to provide upward career path mobility for our warehouse associates and improve associate retention in this critical driver role. Our graduates are able to increase their career earnings potential by upskilling and becoming certified drivers. At Sysco, we pay a leading and competitive driver wage, and we are making the certification process easier, removing the barriers and costs of becoming certified. This action will open the door for more of our associates to advance their careers. The Driver Academy is a win-win-win for our associates, for Sysco and for our customers. Additionally, over the past quarter, we have converted our operations from an industry traditional five-day workweek to a full six-day delivery model. This might sound like a small endeavor but the reality is quite the opposite. We made the change to a full six-day model for the following reasons. The change is better for our associates. Why? We have converted our associates from a standard five-day schedule to a more work-life-friendly four-day workweek. This will improve associate retention over time. The six-day workweek increases the efficiency of our operations by further utilizing our physical assets, enabling us to better sweat the assets of our trucks and buildings. The model increases our weekly throughput and also provides us more flex capacity on each and every day, enabling us to better handle fluctuations of demand. These changes to our supply chain will help make Sysco an even more preferred employer, and that will enable us to serve our customers. As important as having an efficient and flexible supply chain, we are continuing to advance the capabilities of our industry-leading sales teams. Our sales associates have the highest customer satisfaction scores in the industry, and we want to increase that competitive advantage. We have worked hard over the past year to bring stronger digital tools to the selling process to enable the success of our sales teams. I want to be very clear that these digital tools do not reduce the importance or quantity of our sales staff. These tools are intended to assist our sales teams with their consultative selling process. Our technology team has built a system that provides each sales rep with a next best action to be presented to our customers. For some customers, this may be a conversion from a national brand product to a Sysco brand item, saving them money. For other customers, this may be the introduction of a promotional offer for a category perhaps they've not traditionally purchased from Sysco, like produce. For others still, the tool can identify items that our customer used to buy but are no longer placing in their shopping basket with Sysco. Our sales consultants are then prompted with offers and suggestions to specifically enable success against those use cases. The goal of this work is to increase the productivity of the customer visit. This work positively impacted our performance versus the market in Q3, which was our strongest volume growth quarter versus the market for the year. Slide 7 in our presentation makes a clear case of our progress in becoming a growth company. Lastly, our working commitments in corporate social responsibility, or CSR, were recently recognized by Sustainalytics and JUST Capital. This recognition is due in no small part to our recent announcement of a science-based climate goal that is aligned with SBTi. As the leader in our industry, we are proud to be the first and only U.S. foodservice distributor with a science-based climate goal. Research from the World Economic Forum suggests that companies who make progress in these important areas drive improved CSR over time compared to their peers. To ensure that we walk the walk, our Board is prepared to incorporate ESG as a part of our executive compensation program beginning next year. The work we are doing is the right thing to do, and we strongly believe that it is also good for our business and our investors. Turning to Slide 8. In summary for the quarter, Sysco is winning, leading the industry and accelerating growth. We are growing our business with new and existing customers. Our supply chain is performing better than the industry at large, and we are driving strategic initiatives to further increase that strength advantage. Our continued transformation investments are enhancing our commercial selling capabilities and we are investing in our associates. The improved profitability in the quarter is encouraging, but there is more work to be done as our team is focused on our Recipe for Growth strategy and improving operations productivity. I'll now turn it over to Aaron, who will provide additional financial details before we open it up for questions.
Aaron Alt: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning. We are upbeat on our business, and we have several notable headlines for our third quarter, as seen on Slide 10. Sales growth of almost 43% compared to the prior year, which is also up more than 15% versus 2019, reflecting resilient demand and sequential improvements month-over-month. We recorded more than $3 billion of gross profit, the highest gross profit in absolute dollar terms for any quarter at Sysco ever as we continued significant efforts to optimize our assortment in COGS while effectively managing our product cost inflation. Our investments in snapback operating costs dropped in the quarter by more than half from $73 million in Q2 to $35 million in Q3. As promised, the impact of our workforce transition on productivity improved. Incremental training and overtime is estimated to have cost us approximately $30 million in the third quarter, down from approximately $40 million in the second quarter, and we expect further improvements as we head into Q4. As an aside, I would note that the actions we're taking around productivity are actually serving to accelerate our supply chain transformation as part of the Recipe for Growth. We invested $48 million of operating expense against our strategic investments, creating momentum with our commercial capabilities. All in, adjusted operating income more than doubled and adjusted EBITDA increased almost 73% compared to last year. With those headlines on the table, I'm going to provide some details on the financials for the quarter and some thoughts on our outlook. Third quarter sales were $16.9 billion, an increase of 42.9% for fiscal 2021 and a 15.3% increase from fiscal 2019. In the United States, sales in our largest segment, U.S. Foodservice were up dramatically by 43.6% versus fiscal 2021 and up 18.8% versus fiscal 2019. Local case volume within the U.S. Broadline operations, a subset of U.S. Foodservice, increased 14.1%, while total case volume within U.S. Broadline operations increased 18.8% compared to last year. SYGMA sales were up 13.5% versus fiscal 2021 and up 16.8% versus fiscal 2019. International sales were up 64.5% versus fiscal 2021 and up approximately 3% versus fiscal 2019. Sales trends accelerated nicely in our International segment with lower Omicron cases and as government-related restrictions on our customers eased in the quarter. Foreign exchange rates had a negative impact of 0.7% on Sysco's sales results. Let me pause here and call out one point of progress for the year-to-date period. We are really pleased with the profit contribution and improvements coming from International. In the last nine months, the business has delivered an adjusted operating income swing of $265 million year-over-year. Inflation continued to be a factor during the quarter at approximately 16% in our U.S. Broadline business. We have been able to actively manage the impact of product inflation and those efforts will continue. Gross profit for the enterprise was above $3 billion in the third quarter, an increase of 42% versus fiscal 2021, an increase of 9.4% versus fiscal 2019. The increase in gross profit was driven by year-over-year improvements in volume versus fiscal 2021 and compared to the same quarter in both fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2019, increases in GP dollars per case across all segments as we successfully managed to increase costs from our product suppliers and acted to optimize our business processes and performance. Of note, the enterprise and U.S. Foodservice both reached all-time highs for Q3 gross profit dollars. Gross margin rate was 17.8% or 18% on an adjusted basis during the quarter, with the adjusted margin rate moving upward as the was still impacted by inflation. Of course, it is gross profit dollars that counts in an inflationary environment, and gross profit per case increased in all four segments. We are focused on price relevancy, being right on price and are doing the right things to cover our costs while also supporting our customers. Turning back to the enterprise. Adjusted operating expense for the quarter came in at $2.5 billion as we delivered progress on our multiyear cost-out program and improved snapback costs. As we touched on earlier and as you can see on Slide 15, operating costs this quarter were impacted by variable costs associated with significantly increased volumes, more than $35 million of onetime and short-term transitory expenses associated with the snapback, $48 million of purposeful investments to further accelerate our Recipe for Growth initiatives, and lastly, the still present but improving expense challenges associated with new hire productivity. Despite the dynamic operating environment, we expect additional improvements for snapback costs and productivity expenses during the fourth quarter as we balance cost reduction initiatives with continued transformation investments. Together, the snapback investments and the productivity-related costs totaled approximately $65 million of operating expenses this quarter. That's important because the simple math would say that these transitory expenses had a downward impact to our adjusted EPS of approximately $0.10. Further proving our point that there is further opportunity for profit improvement in the future for Sysco as Q3 adjusted EPS without these expenses would have already exceeded 2019 levels. All in, we leveraged our adjusted operating expense structure and delivered expense as a percentage of sales of 14.6%, which was flat through fiscal 2019 and an improvement of 119 basis points for the same quarter in fiscal 2021. Finally, for the third quarter of fiscal 2022, adjusted operating income increased $319 million from last year to $575 million. This was primarily driven by a 43% improvement in U.S. Foodservice and continued progress on profitability from international. As Kevin called out, adjusted earnings per share increased an impressive $0.49 to $0.71 for the third quarter. Now let's turn to a discussion of year-to-date cash flow. Cash flow from operations was $746 million on a year-to-date basis. Our company continues to transition from a period when sales, profit and working capital were all down during COVID to a period of high growth, growing profit and a focus on making the investments necessary to win the long game. A year ago at this time, we commented that we had a strategy and the balance sheet to invest in the business and support a Recipe for Growth, and that is exactly what we are doing. Free cash flow year-to-date was $434 million. EBITDA as the primary source of cash is up $900 million year-over-year in the year-to-date period as our sales increased, but we've not yet quite recovered to fiscal '19 levels. The rising sales and profitability were enabled by tactical investments and higher inventory levels this year, both in absolute cases on hand as we lap the purposeful inventory declines from the management of the COVID period and in dollar value, given inflation. And with our rapidly growing sales comes a higher balance in healthy accounts receivable, also a use of cash year-to-date, which our team continues to manage well, offset in part by higher accounts payable. In the year-to-date, we have also paid higher interest expense from COVID debt and refinancings, paid higher cash taxes, partly due to prior year refunds and deferrals and invested more in CapEx in support of the Recipe for Growth. This year is effectively a transition year from a free cash flow perspective, and we expect that future years will continue to reinforce the significant cash flow generated by Sysco as sales and profit grow and investments in working capital normalize. Let me emphasize, we are playing to win the long game and are leveraging our balance sheet and cash flow in support of the long-term growth of Sysco. Along those same lines, recall that we began the year with high cash balances, and we end the quarter with almost $900 million of cash on hand. Year-to-date, we've used that cash to invest in the business, spending $312 million on CapEx and paid for acquisitions such as Coastal with cash on hand. Our balance sheet is a key differentiator compared to our competition, and we are prepared -- we are better prepared than anyone else in the industry entering a rising interest rate environment. Why? Because we have strong cash generation, a strong investment-grade rating and a manageable debt profile, including some of the lowest rates ever achieved by Sysco in a 30-year tenure issued in December. We remain committed to maintaining a strong investment-grade rating and achieving a net debt-to-EBITDA target ratio of 2.5x to 2.75x. As previously announced, we expect to further reduce indebtedness by paying off the $450 million of debt coming due in June. And reflecting the world in which we all live, we also now have further liquidity and risk protection if we need it. Last week, Sysco announced that we successfully increased our revolver capacity from $2 billion to $3 billion with improved terms. Return of capital to shareholders is also part of our capital allocation framework. In May of 2021, our Board approved a 4% increase to our quarterly dividend, reflecting an $0.08 increase annually. And two weeks ago, Sysco's Board did it again, effectively announcing another $0.08 annual increase, reinforcing our status as a dividend aristocrat. What we want you to take away from this is that we are serious about all three parts of our capital allocation strategy. We are investing in the future growth of the business. We are maintaining a strong balance sheet, and we are returning surplus capital to shareholders. On this last point, our track record goes back decades. But as you can see on Slide 18, over the last seven years, cumulatively, we've returned over $13 billion of cash to shareholders. We will remain disciplined with our balanced approach to capital allocation and rewarding our shareholders. Now before I turn to our positive update to guidance, I should address one set of questions we've been getting upfront: the impact of the invasion of Ukraine on our business. As a reminder, Europe represents only about 10% of our net sales. Our European portfolio is geographically distant from Ukraine and focused on Ireland, the U.K., France and Sweden. In the past, our exposure to Russian products was minimal. With respect to product inflation in Europe, while we are seeing costs rise more consistently with what we've seen in the U.S. in the last couple of quarters, we were prepared and have many of the same tools we developed in the U.S. to address the impact of product cost increases in Europe. Oil and the impact of rising gas prices have also been topics of interest. We benefit from having hedged 80% of our forecasted bulk fuel volume through fiscal 2023 in the U.S. and Europe. Let's now turn to look forward. We are upbeat about our business. We have witnessed the resiliency of our business as it has responded to the impact of three significant COVID-19 variants, significant inflation, the invasion of Ukraine and now, rising interest rates. We have made great progress in Q3, and we anticipate further progress in Q4, which is why we are upbeat about our business. We are raising our guidance for adjusted EPS in the second half by $0.16 to be from $1.76 to $1.86. Having delivered $0.71 of adjusted EPS in Q3, this means that we expect Q4 to be in the range of $1.05 to $1.15. On a full year basis, this will equate to adjusted EPS of $3.16 to $3.26. During our last earnings call, we highlighted that we expected a big Q4, and that's not changed with the results of our resilient Q3 results. Our continued optimism for Q4 includes a continued market recovery, continued market share gains, continued pass-through of inflation costs, improved operating expenses as a percentage of sales from lower snapback and productivity-related costs, all as partially offset by continued investments in our transformation and working through the workforce transition. Lastly, recall that Q4 of last year included one extra week, which will impact profitability. With that, let me turn the call back to Kevin for closing remarks.
Kevin Hourican: Thank you, Aaron. As we conclude, I'd like to provide a brief summary on Slide 20. Sysco already is the industry leader from an EBITDA margin perspective. You've heard me say this before, but we are now taking that robust foundation as the market leader in creating a growth company. Our financial performance this quarter reflects three key points: first, our volume grew 18.8% in U.S. Broadline compared to last year, and we significantly exceeded our market share target; second, we improved operations expenses, reducing snapback costs by more than 50% while continuing our transformation efforts; and third, we generated strong profit performance despite a dynamic operating environment. Turning to Slide 21. These recent results are also consistent with our long-term plans. We are generating substantial top line momentum and accelerating market share gains. Our Recipe for Growth transformation is creating capabilities at Sysco that will help us profitably grow for the long term and further build on our competitive scale advantages. Sysco's strength of income statement and balance sheet have enabled us to continue advancing our strategy during a difficult operating environment while also rewarding our long-term shareholders with disciplined dividend growth and share repurchases. Lastly, we are committed to both our long-term financial outlook, which includes significant sales and EPS growth and returning value to shareholders along the way. There are bright days ahead for Sysco, and I am both excited and proud to be a part of the journey. As always, I'd like to thank all of our Sysco associates for the dedication they display to our customers each and every day. Operator, you can now turn over the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Lauren Silberman with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. You may ask your question.
Lauren Silberman: Congrats on the quarter. I first just want to ask about the market share, so growing more than 1.2x the market and above where you expected to be when you laid out the strategy last year. Where are you performing better than expected? Is it new customers, wallet share? Are your customers outperforming, so out-comping, if you will? Any color around that?
Kevin Hourican: Yes, thanks for the question. This is Kevin. Just I'd say two things. First is the how is it happening and then I'd say from where. The how is from two things. Our supply chain is performing stronger or better than the industry. And on a daily basis, we have customers coming to us asking for Sysco to become their new preferred supplier. So that implies, obviously, new customer acquisition, new customer growth. The second is the Recipe for Growth and our expectations for its capabilities to create market share capture with the existing customers. We had planned for it. It was a part of our budget for this year, and the Recipe for Growth is delivering. And that is the penetration opportunity. I mentioned on today's prepared remarks the tools that our sales consultants are now able to leverage and use to improve the effectiveness of a visit to a customer. We call it the next best action for that day's visit with that specific customer. They've got clear jobs to be done, and the data and the tools that are now available to them through our technology teams have driven significant performance. So mathematically, where it's coming from, it's a combination of accelerating new customer capture. We posted another very strong quarter of new customer wins and increasing penetration with existing customers through our Recipe for Growth. I think Aaron wants to make a comment as well. Over to you.
Aaron Alt: Lauren, just one quick add, which is we're pleased with the relative contribution to the market share gains across the portfolio. It's coming not just in Broadline but also in our specialty business and in our International business.
Lauren Silberman: Great. And then just one on the inflation pricing. It seems like you guys are having a lot of success pushing through inflation. What are you watching to see whether you might decide to delay pushing through the full inflation you're seeing? And it seems like that pricing tool would allow you to do that even more strategically.
Kevin Hourican: Yes. Thank you, Lauren, for the question. I think consumers are concerned about inflation, and you can't read the paper and watch TV and not understand that high cost of fuel is on people's minds. We're not seeing a slowdown in demand. That's the good news and a headline from today. We're not seeing an impact to our food-away-from-home business. I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we do cover the entire spectrum of food-away-from-home across all price points: industrial needs, travel, hospitality, business industry and obviously, all restaurant forms and types. So we're a bit more diversified than others and I think that provides us some advantage. And I called out on the prepared remarks, food-away-from-home pricing relative to food-at-home pricing, which I believe is on Slide 6 in our presentation, is actually advantageous to Sysco at this period of time. You hit the nail on the head though, which is the pricing tool that we have, we're better positioned to be able to be, as Aaron said in his comments, right on price. What we mean by that is that we're not going to be too high and we're not going to be too low. We're not going to use price as a strategic lever to win share. That is, what we believe, a non-sustainable strategy and not something that we're interested in doing. We want to be right on price. So as inflation is occurring, we're able to leverage the technology to ensure that we're passing through the inflation at an appropriate level. And when we make improvements on our cost structure through cost of goods sold improvement, we can share in that savings with our customers, again leveraging that same technology. So what we say internally at Sysco is there's no better time than the current hyperinflationary environment to have a strategic pricing tool, and we're leveraging it to our advantage.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Slagle with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Alex Slagle: Had a question on the earnings guidance. At the midpoint, it seems to suggest a return to the historical 40-60 cadence between the 3Q and 4Q versus the previous views that the 3Q would be below this. So was there something about the timing of the transitory costs or productivity that shifted this mix into 3Q? Or is there an element of conservatism baked into the implied 4Q view?
Aaron Alt: Alex, it's Aaron. Great question, and you nailed it. You're right, it does -- the guidance does presume the historical percentage. And it's not a comment on Q4 so much as it is the resilience that the business displayed in Q3. As we were reacting to Q2, as we were watching the early results in Q3 from the impact of Omicron, we made the best call we could on Q3 in that context, but we were pleased that the business responded even more strongly than we had hoped. We had called out, from a Q4 guidance perspective, a strong Q4, and so I don't want to leave you with the impression. Other than that, we are assuming the continued market recovery in Q4. We're assuming continued market share gains and volume growth. We're assuming continued cost improvement that snapback costs will come down, that productivity improvements will continue. And that we'll continue to invest against the range -- against the transformation rather. And lastly, just a further math point for you, it's not lost on us that if we were to hit the bottom of the range for Q4, that would be the second highest adjusted EPS quarter in Sysco history. And if we were to hit the top of the range for Q4, that will be the highest adjusted EPS quarter in Sysco history and ahead of fiscal '19. So we have a lot of work ahead of us this quarter. We're upbeat about the business. We're really pleased with the resiliency of what our entire business is showing, and we're looking forward to delivering good results for Q4.
Alex Slagle: Great. Just a follow-up question on the International business. If you could talk about the leadership transition there and tons of changes you envision taking place, if anything, in particular, you want to call out.
Kevin Hourican: Yes, Alex, it's Kevin. I'll take that one. Thanks for the question. Just a quick commentary about International. We're pleased with International. $265 million of year-over-year profit swing is notable. We're making progress not just as an entire group but individually by country. We have a strong strategy in place. We have a strategy by country. And we have advanced capabilities in our international businesses that make those countries look and feel more like our U.S. Sysco business. So modern website, bringing pricing capabilities, bringing Sysco brand to select countries, improving our selling process. These are the fundamental building blocks that is creating the opportunity in the countries with which we compete in to, again, look and feel more like Sysco U.S. We've got leading number 1 market share in three of the countries internationally that we compete within, and we're confident that we can continue to make progress internationally. The change in leadership had absolutely nothing to do with business results, hard stop. It had absolutely nothing to do with strategic misalignment, completely aligned on the strategy of international where we're headed, where we're going. I'm very pleased with the performance results and I'm really pleased with the strategy. It was a personal matter, and we're not going to make comments publicly on a call about a personal matter.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim. Your line is open.
Julio Marquez: It's actually Julio Marquez on behalf of John Heinbockel. A couple of quick questions here for you. First, I know you mentioned some of the both from existing new accounts. Any color you could provide on acceleration in U.S. market share? Is that more from existing or new accounts? And with existing accounts, is it more increased lines or cases per line?
Kevin Hourican: Thank you for the question. I'm actually just going to bridge everyone back to kind of the thesis of Sysco and why we have such confidence in the long-term growth potential of the Company. And at our May 20, 2021 earnings day, we talked about three numbers, 16% market share. We talked about 30% share of wallet and we talked about 50% of doors covered by Sysco in the restaurant space. Good news is the first number has already moved up. We're at 17% share from the most recent calendar year. We anticipate that we'll continue to make progress in that regard. And it's our Recipe for Growth strategy that will enable progress on the other two numbers, which drive the market share, which is increased penetration with existing customers and the continued pursuit of net new customers. And it's at both ends. And I'm not giving you a cop-out answer. I'm just being completely transparent and honest. We are doing more new customer prospecting than in our past, and we are successfully moving new customers up the profitability curve over time. So when we onboard them, you win X percentage of their business, and then we do what we call sell around the room, which is we penetrate additional categories. So we're having a lot of success on winning new customers. The fact that we remain the only foodservice distributor without an order minimum has helped us attract thousands of new customers. And then again, we penetrate further with those customers by selling around the room to move those customers up the profitability curve. And then the tools that I referenced on today's call that help our sales force are enabling us to win more cases and penetrate further with existing lines. So it's a both end answer. One is not more important than the other. We believe that we can significantly increase the number of restaurants that we serve and we can penetrate further. And not to repeat another point I made on the call, but the reason we converted to the six-day full delivery model is to create more flex capacity and more throughput capacity on any individual given week, which will enable us to increase the number of customers that we serve profitably.
Julio Marquez: Appreciate the color there. And next one, just very quickly. What is your current expectation for product cost inflation over the next year? And if by any chance you do see it begin to moderate, how quickly do you expect you'd want that to flow through?
Aaron Alt: Thanks. Appreciate the question. It's fair to say that for Q4, the period in which we provided the guidance, we expect continued elevated inflation, although perhaps starting to come down as we approach the end of the year. We're not, today, going to provide guidance in any respect with respect to the future year. That will come during our Q4 earnings call in a couple of months.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Jake Bartlett with Truist Securities. Your line is open.
Jake Bartlett: My first one is just on the trajectory of the business. And it obviously was stronger than you initially expected when you gave guidance for the third quarter. But if you could talk about just your kind of maybe your exit rate in April, whether you're seeing continued improvement and potentially driven by pent-up demand. Any comments there would be helpful.
Kevin Hourican: It's Kevin. Thanks for the question. Yes, the beginning of Q3 was tough, given Omicron, and I think we did a good job of explaining that on our last earnings call. This is what we were experiencing. The impact of Omicron was felt through the material part of February. March was strong. It really recovered quicker than what we had been modeling and expecting. And also, I just don't want to lose the point. We had our highest growth versus the market in that quarter than we've been able to produce thus far. We're sequentially increasing our performance versus the market and also, the market performed nicely at the end of the last quarter. Here's my statement on April. We did not make a specific comment on the call tied to April, but we are seeing continued momentum in April. We're seeing strong demand across our business segments and across geographies, including international, and we're bullish on Q4 as evidenced by what Aaron communicated to you all today.
Jake Bartlett: Great. That's very helpful. And then I had a question about -- you've talked about investing in the long term and playing the long game. And I'm just wondering, in light of concerns about an economic slowdown potentially coming up, in that context, if you saw a slowdown coming, if you can sort of -- to think that was going to happen, would you pump the brakes a little bit on some of these investments? Or do you plan to remain aggressive, perhaps maybe sacrificing margins in the near term for that kind of long-term point of view?
Kevin Hourican: Jake, it's Kevin. It's a good question. I'll just start it and then I'll toss to Aaron for any comment. This is a question that I know is on people's minds, which is the impact of inflation on the end consumer and will they choose to go out to eat less often than they had been recently. And I would say two things. One, we're seeing continued momentum in consumer demand across our business segments that we serve. So that's notable and important. If that were to moderate, my second point that I would bring you to is what I just said a few moments ago, we have "only" 17% share of a very large business. So even in a business that begins to perhaps moderate, that does not mean that Sysco needs to be moderating. We can actually take increased share at a point in time when the market itself is perhaps not growing as robustly. And I'll just call you back to Slide 5 in our presentation materials. Food-away-from-home is increasingly popular for end consumers. If you look at it across the decades that are shown on this chart, it's pretty stark actually on how important food-away-from-home is. There's obviously the large disruption that occurred in March of 2020 when people were told to go home and stay home, but it's fully recovered. Look at the intersection of the lines, food-away-from-home is now, once again, more than the purchases for food-at-home. And then on the chart right below it on Slide 6, pricing in the retail grocery environment is such that food-away-from-home is price favorable versus historical trends. So put all that together, we believe that we, Sysco, will continue to grow. If the marketplace itself is a little softer, we have the opportunity to take share, grow share. Specific to your question about investments and would we pump the brakes, I'll toss to Aaron.
Aaron Alt: Thanks. Look, I guess my reaction is this, we're wired for success in the long term at Sysco and whether it's the customer strategy and the opportunity that Kevin called out or the balance sheet and the resources we have to help us through any bump on the road, I want to emphasize we're investing for the long game. While we talk in this call relative to the quarter, relative to the year, really, we're talking about growth over the longer term, the 3-, the 5-, the 10-year period. And it kind of goes back to doing what we said we were going to do. If you go back to the Investor Day comments from, I guess, a year ago now, indeed, if you go back to our earnings calls for the last 18 months, what we said was we were going to invest in the snapback, right? We were going to do that because we wanted to be ahead of the curve. We wanted to be the Company that the foodservice operators were coming to the restaurants because we were the best partner. So we've been investing in inventory down this path. We've been investing in technology down this path. We've been investing in our fleet, and we've been investing in our distribution nodes. And none of that has changed because of the ebbs and flows. And indeed, that's where we continue to be focused as we carry forward because we are holding ourselves accountable and Kevin is holding all of us accountable to the Recipe for Growth and the recipe for profitable growth that comes with it.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Edward Kelly: I wanted to ask you about gross profit. Results are super impressive this quarter, especially within the U.S. business. Per-case profit and percent margin both up sequentially. But can you talk about how much of this is driven by inflation? How much of this is internally driven? And I think your fuel surcharge goes through gross profit, so maybe that's playing a role. I'm just -- hopefully, you could maybe sort of unpack this sequential improvement versus what we saw last quarter.
Aaron Alt: Sure. Happy to comment on it. We were really pleased in the quarter on a couple of respects. The first is to have delivered record gross profit, both in absolute dollars for the enterprise but then also GP dollars per case across all four segments, really speaks to the hard work that the teams are doing to ensure that we are both recognizing the increase in costs that we are getting and then pulling the necessary levers in collaboration with our customers to pass those costs through. Now obviously, I get a lot of questions around gross margin rate as well. And I could tell you that while we were pleased with the sequential improvement in rate, the decline from the historical period is entirely due to the simple math tied to the inflation. And we'll continue to monitor both dollars per case and GM rate as we carry forward. But here's the good news about Sysco as we carry forward, which is we continue to have opportunities to optimize our gross profit, right? We continue to work with the customers on passing through things like fuel cost. You're right, that's there. But as we think about the strength of the Sysco brand portfolio, where we have further opportunity there, as we think about how we better leverage the scale that is Sysco relative to our purchasing opportunities, we have good news yet to unlock within Sysco unrelated to the external environment that we're going to continue to pursue as we carry forward. Kevin, I'll toss to you. Anything to add?
Kevin Hourican: Yes, I'll just add one thing. Just something like a fuel surcharge, that's not a profit accretion for our company. That's just the cost offset, which I know you know. But the effort that Judy Sansone, our Chief Commercial Officer, is driving, we have a major, major strategic sourcing effort underway at Sysco, which helps us improve our cost of goods sold inbound to us. We're very pleased with the work that Judy is doing and the team that she leads is delivering good outcomes. It's hard to actually delineate specifically for you on this call the portion of our goodness, as Aaron says, tied to that versus inflation, and that's just the level of detail that we're not going to go into. But we have a major strategic sourcing effort underway. It is improving our COGS, and, therefore, obviously showing up in our positive GP performance.
Edward Kelly: Okay. And then just a follow-up. I wanted to ask you about fill rates, inventory availability, where you stand with your workforce, where you want to be. We've been hearing some issues around like maintenance on equipment, but product like part shortages, that type of stuff. How are you dealing with fill rates and how does that compare to the industry?
Kevin Hourican: Fill rates from Sysco outbound to our customers improved in the most recent quarter, and it's visible and measurable through both our internal data and also the net promoter scores that we track on a real-time basis, us versus competition. So we are outperforming the market in average. We improved in the quarter. It's coming from two actions. Our suppliers are beginning to improve. It's still meaningfully down versus historical standards, supplier inbound fill rate to Sysco, but it is beginning to improve. And Ed, we're doing an even better job at managing what we call subs and outs, substitutions and out-of-stocks. Our website improving to communicate more upfront to our customers options they have when an item is out of stock. And our sales reps and our merchandising teams are doing very good work to partner with customers in an environment where a specific item is out of stock. There's plenty of food. There's plenty of food available. It's about individual items being out of stock at moments in time, and Sysco working proactively with our customers to be able to serve their needs with something that meets the needs of their menu. So, we're doing a better job in this most recent quarter at that, and we expect continued improvement into Q4 and into our fiscal 2023. As it relates to the overall environmental conditions, our staffing health has improved. It continues to steadily improve. We're not out of the woods. We still have work to do but we're making progress. And then your point about things like maintenance of equipment, yes, shortages are impacting all forms of supply chains, not just food. So access to parts is a challenge and access to new equipment is a challenge. Interestingly, we're doing better work in that regard to centralize that activity at Sysco, to have a better control over parts inventory and purchasing of equipment. And I would emphasize one important point there. Our size and scale can enable us to have preferred advantage with manufacturers who are on limited allocation, and we'll be at the front of the line for equipment. In fact, Aaron and I have preapproved and preordered equipment to support the Recipe for Growth.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Your line is open.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Two questions. The first one, just following up on the international commentary. I know you mentioned that you're somewhat distanced from the Ukraine headwinds with your key markets. And then I know you mentioned separately something about April, that you were seeing strong demand across all geographies, which just trying to get a better sense whether maybe we're misunderstanding the headwinds we're hearing about in the international markets, or whether or not your strong performance is driven more by the delayed recovery that went on in international markets, and therefore, that's more than offsetting maybe a slowdown that might be going on underneath. Just trying to get a sense to whether you're seeing any signs of a slowdown or change in behavior from a European or international consumer perspective.
Kevin Hourican: Yes, Jeff, thank you for the question. It's Kevin. I'll just -- two points here. We're not exposed from a sales perspective was Aaron's main point to what's happening in Eastern Europe because we're not domiciled there, right? We don't have actual business in those countries. So unlike other companies that are international, we're not exposed in that regard. We had purchased product previously from Russia, and we're no longer purchasing product from Russia, and we've been able to move to alternative sources of supply, mostly in seafood. And that was the work we needed to do was to get alternative product from alternative countries to be able to support the needs of our customers. As it relates to is Western Europe feeling the impact of the war, Ukraine is the bread basket of Europe. Sunflower oils and grains are produced there. You can get product -- we, Sysco, are able to get product. What it's had is an impact on inflation in those countries. Interestingly, those countries were behind the U.S. from an inflation perspective. So what's happening in Europe right now is an increase in inflation, but frankly, it's just catching up to the inflation that was already visible in the United States. And we're managing it well. We're managing the pass-through of that inflation, Jeff, well in our International segment. So that kind of bundles in macroeconomic environment, what's happening, what's happening is inflation increasing in Europe, point two, though, is this consumer demand. We are not seeing a decrease in consumer demand in our international geographies. And I'd just remind everyone, and I think Aaron did a good job in his prepared remarks of reminding everyone, international was hit earlier. It was hit harder and international has been slower to recover. So we see our international business as a tailwind in Q4 and into fiscal '23 because there's still much more recovery in front of us, international, relative to the U.S. business. So continued progress in international month-over-month, quarter-over-quarter, and we see anticipated additional recovery happening in international.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Understood. And then just the follow-up. You guys mentioned the six-day workweek and the no minimum deliveries. Clearly, points of differentiation for yourself versus some of your larger competitors. Was wondering, how do you measure the impact of that? Or is that possible? I mean, seemingly, customers have to be quite pleased with both of those things. I'm just wondering how do you gauge the success you're having from that relative to, again, peers that perhaps don't offer either?
Kevin Hourican: Yes. Great question, and they're two very different things. The no order minimum can be measured through net promoter score satisfaction of our customers with Sysco and our ability to acquire and win net new customers. And I tried to mention a moment ago, and the only downside of that would be is if we're not moving customers up the profitability ladder over time by selling around the room, we would address that. And I mentioned, I'll repeat it. We're doing a very good job of selling around the room and increasing the net profitability of acquired customers by increasing penetration after we've acquired them. So we're really pleased with the no order minimum policy. We think having an order minimum is not a great customer policy. We need to be there for our customers when they need us, how they need us, and we don't anticipate making structural changes in that regard. The six-day workweek makes us more efficient. That's not an increase in cost to Sysco. That's actually increasing Sysco's cost efficiency by leveraging our physical assets to a greater degree. A truck going out of six days is a good thing, not a bad thing. So it leverages our capability. And what it also provides is, as I mentioned, increased flexibility for any individual, singular day, and we can continue to go out and win net new business because of the incremental capacity that we have provided. The big transition was for our workforce. And as I mentioned, we've converted that incredibly important population of ours to a four-day workweek. And what's really important is when we need them then to work overtime, they're working a fifth day voluntarily, which is much easier for someone to do than when they're asked to come in on a sixth day. It's just better for their life. Though their scheduled normal workweek is four days and when we need them for overtime, they work fifth. And obviously, there's overlapping schedules between Team A, Team B, et cetera, et cetera, to fill out the full six-day workweek. So our customers are going to see more consistent on-time deliveries. We've increased our flexibility. We've increased our capacity and we can do it more cost effectively. Those are the reasons why we did it. But it's a change that's challenging to do, and we've got it in the rearview mirror.
Aaron Alt: Maybe just one add from a financial perspective to Kevin's point about sweating our assets and increasing our capacity, it's a marvelous thing to be able to add that additional day and to be able to address the need for additional trucks as we grow by not having to buy additional trucks because we're further sweating our assets. And similar to that point, from a use of cash perspective, the incremental capacity across our network that it creates for us to grow without having to invest in additional distribution nodes or other trucks on top of that is also an excellent return on that investment.
Jeffrey Bernstein: I'm all in for the four-day workweek.
Kevin Hourican: That's funny, Jeff.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Kelly Bania: I just wanted to go back to the comment about case volumes and surpassing the fiscal '19 levels this quarter, which is a great milestone. But just curious if you could give the specific numbers where Sysco's volume is, and forgive me if I missed that. But also where you estimate the industry is on the same metric. And then also, can you dig in a little bit deeper on customer types between restaurants, hospitality, education, how those volumes compare to fiscal '19 levels?
Aaron Alt: It's Aaron. I'll take a stab and then invite anything if Kevin wants to add. Look, we were pleased that our U.S. Foodservice business versus fiscal '19, in aggregate, exceeded fiscal '19 levels. And this is the first quarter that we've been able to say that post COVID. The rest of the enterprise has not yet gotten to that level, and we are hopeful as we carry forward without committing to by quarter at this point when that will be, that given the upbeat nature of our view of the business, that we'll have good news coming in the not-too-distant future in that respect as well. Now you might ask, well, where is that coming from? I refer back to Kevin's early remarks as well around where we still have opportunity, business and industry, corporate headquarters, which is a significant part of our business, those are still not open, right? And so you can conclude from that, that there's opportunity to yet get back to historical levels. Travel is moving in the right direction but there's opportunity to get back to historical levels. And indeed, I believe we also called out International where the good news is there's opportunity for Sysco as we carry forward to help drive the growth as we push ahead. We've not broken down the industries beyond that. And perhaps with your -- jumping to your aggregate point of how are we doing versus the competitor set or where might they be? We focus on what we're doing and our -- we were pleased to see that we were exceeding our own objective of being more than 1.2x market growth and that's really the headline for us. Kevin, anything you'd add?
Kevin Hourican: Yes, just to put a bow around that last part, and since I said earlier, we're not using price as the lever to win new business. The fact that we're growing our business by more than 1.2x the market, Kelly, implies the volume is equivalent to that. There's a strong correlation between the volume trend and the sales trend, us versus others. So that's my best color in that regard. The only thing additional beyond that is we're winning big in specialty. Our produce business, our specialty meat business, we are doing very well. And I call your attention to the higher margin rates from those businesses. So specialty is a growth focus for Sysco. We're winning in Broadline. We're taking market share in Broadline and we are accelerating our momentum in specialty. And the fact that we closed on the Coastal Companies acquisition in the last quarter is a harbinger of good things to come even further in the high-growth, higher-margin produce business because that will pay dividend from a growth perspective for many years to come.
Kelly Bania: Helpful. And then if I can just add one quick one in, just a follow-up. In terms of the supply chain and the benefits that you are maybe accruing there in terms of market share, given some competitor challenges on that front, do you expect that to continue? Do you see these supply chain-driven market share gains as sustainable? Or do you see those competitors working to build back their supply chains?
Kevin Hourican: Yes, Kelly, it's a very good question. I think over time, supply chains will stabilize and improve, and the contribution of benefit to Sysco will decrease over time as the market improves. But very importantly, at the exact same time, our Recipe for Growth is advancing and the capabilities that we're building will have a bigger, more meaningful impact. And I'd just call your attention to the guidance that we provided in May of last year. We said we would accelerate our performance versus the market. This year's stated goal was 1.2x. We're doing much better than that. In the third year of our three-year plan, which was fiscal '24, we said we would grow at 1.5x and we are confident in our ability to do that. The contribution of where that market share capture comes from in our forward-facing years will be less weakness of others, it will be more strength from Sysco.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
John Ivankoe: I wonder what kind of changes you might be sensing within the market as maybe even below what some of the headline numbers may suggest, consumers really expressing a desire to move into Sysco brands, and even beyond that, moving from having more of a scratch model in restaurants to more pre-prepared or value-added products that come into their back door that obviously reduce the demand for labor. Certainly, I've seen some things in the marketplace of people bringing in pre-prepared products I wouldn't have necessarily expected. And I think there's some things kind of written in the news of, I guess, how significant of a trend that this actually may be for restaurants. So wanted you to comment on that and how you feel, if you do think that, that's going to be an acceleration and trend, how you think you'd be best advantaged to take advantage of it.
Kevin Hourican: John, thank you for the question. This is Kevin. Just I think one of the points that sometimes people forget about Sysco is that we have the, by far, largest sales force in the industry. It is a vibrant, strong, capable group of people who are culinary experts. So these are chefs, these are ex-restaurant owners, they are culinary school grads, and they are absolutely pros. And we have the highest net satisfaction rate of the sales force versus the industry, and we do not intend to reduce the size of that sales force. We intend to increase their productivity through the digital tools I mentioned. But this topic that you just brought up, which is what's happening with food trends is exactly what our sales force does. They call upon customers. They go to the restaurant. They spend time in the back room of the kitchen. They talk about food trends to educate customers on things that are happening. And yes, there is a movement towards, because of labor shortages in restaurants, more available product upstream preparation and the like, and no one is better prepared to be able to drive and leverage trends like that than Sysco. Our cutting-edge solutions brand, which falls under Sysco brand, is doing just that. And we're bringing product to our customers oftentimes exclusive for a period of time to enable them to take work out of the kitchen but have incredibly high-quality taste and consistency on the plate. There's nobody better positioned than us to be able to leverage those types of trends and capabilities, including those kitchens, which I get asked about all the time, are ghost kitchens are bad for Sysco? Not at all because guess what, ghost kitchens order food, and there's absolutely no reason why we can't over-index in our ability to serve those customers. Many ghost kitchens are actually a full-fledged kitchen for a restaurant, which actually is good for Sysco because it increases our drop size of the delivery to that door.
John Ivankoe: And if I can ask, I mean, there has been -- I mean, this is a decades-long trend towards the value-added products coming into restaurants. Do you sense a significant acceleration in the last 6 or 12 months as the labor market has become much more challenged for the operators themselves?
Kevin Hourican: I wouldn't use the word significant. I would say acceleration because the product has to meet the desires of the consumer and the chef. I'd say acceleration, not a significant acceleration.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nicole Miller with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
Nicole Miller: This morning, you talked a lot about the benefits and strength and scale of the balance sheet and investments in a lot of areas but maybe not so much in technology. What can you tell us about next-generation investments in technology? And if you think about your process, maybe just from start to end, what are focus areas?
Kevin Hourican: Yes, I'll start that. It's a great question. I gave a good example of technology deployment on today's call, which is the turbo-charging of the capability of the sales rep by teeing up on a silver platter for them the next best action for that day's visit that is using data, deep troves of purchasing data to provide a suggestion to the sales rep on something the customer will be interested in and then pre-approving for them an offer that is financially good for Sysco that would be beneficial for the customer. It's a game-changer. Our sales reps are excellent at building strong relationships with customers and they are experts in food. But what we're now providing them is an N-of-1 personalization for each and every customer on something that we know will be desired by the customer and an offer that will be compelling, again, financially for us and also for that customer. So that's a great example. We're making meaningful progress on our website improvement, which is the ordering platform, our digital ordering platform, which I want to be clear is not just a desktop. It's a mobile version. We have click-to-order through e-mails now where we can send an e-mail to a customer with an offer and/or with a suggested order. And with one click of one button, we will ship that product to them. They don't even have to go to an ordering platform. These are what we call removing points of friction, tools and capabilities, leveraging modern technology. We talked about pricing a lot. I don't need to repeat that. What we're working on now is supply chain improvement technology. We want to make the work that our supply chain associates do easier to do. And by making that work easier to do, it will improve the satisfaction of our associates for the job, will help us drive improved associate retention, which will drive improved productivity for Sysco. So without getting into the specifics on today's call for both our warehouse associates and for our drivers, we're making meaningful investments in the technology that those associates interact with to make the job easier. And by making it easier, we make it a better job.
Aaron Alt: I would just add to that from a dollars perspective, the financial commitment to our transformation and the investment technology is significant. It's a key part of the plan we're executing this year and indeed, our long-term Recipe for Growth. And as Tom Peck, our technology leader, builds a world-class team in support of Sysco as an industry leader, that technology team is integrated into everything we're doing on the frontend and the backend, and that will also lead to good dividends for Sysco as we carry forward.
Nicole Miller: And just a quick last one. Understanding the temp expense, I think, you said was cut in half sequentially. I wanted to ask about if there was an underlying drag from training new employees that may not yet be efficient, and if so, how do we think about that, the 30, 60, 90 days until they are efficient and is there a potential gap up in performance coming?
Aaron Alt: Sure. Well, let me -- I want to clarify our remarks to make sure we're saying the same thing. We were pleased that our snapback costs which is retention, sign-on bonuses, COVID-related costs, recruiting, et cetera, that those were cut in half. We also made progress on product. On the incremental productivity expense, we experienced driven by the workforce transition, which I think is what you're referring to, and that went down from 40 last quarter to 30 this quarter. And we're making good progress, and we continue to expect to make good progress as we carry forward. I don't think anyone can call it as to exactly when a workforce which is relatively new will hit the productivity mark, given the scale at which we're operating. But we are pleased with the results on the Workforce Academy that -- sorry, the Driver Academy that Kevin out earlier, the training we're doing within our distribution nodes, all of those things are going to lead to better productivity and, ultimately, a better customer experience.
Operator: Thank you. That's our last question. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-02-08 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Sysco's Second Quarter Fiscal 2022 Conference Call. As a reminder, today’s call is being recorded. We will begin with opening remarks and introductions. I would now like to turn the call over to Kevin Kim, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please, go ahead.
Kevin Kim: Hello, and welcome to Sysco's second quarter fiscal 2022 earnings call. On today's call, we have Kevin Hourican, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Aaron Alt, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, please note that statements made during this presentation, which state the company's or management's intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, and actual results could differ in a material manner. Additional information about factors that could cause results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's SEC filings. This includes, but is not limited to, risk factors contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 3, 2021, subsequent SEC filings and in the news release issued earlier this morning. A copy of these materials can be found in the Investors section at sysco.com. Non-GAAP financial measures are included in our comments today and in our presentation slides. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures is included at the end of the presentation slides and can be found in the Investors section of our website. To ensure that we have sufficient time to answer all questions, we'd like to ask each participant to limit their time today to one question and one follow-up. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Hourican.
Kevin Hourican: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining. I will highlight four topics today during our call. First, our financial results for the quarter. Second, I will provide some color on the current state of our business and the COVID environment. Third, I will detail our continued share gains despite a difficult macro environment. And finally, I will outline our approach to the long game, with some highlights of our Recipe for Growth transformation. I'll then turn it over to Aaron to discuss our financial results in more detail. So let's get started with our financial results displayed on slide four. Earlier this morning, Sysco reported fiscal second quarter results that were fueled by substantial top line momentum and an acceleration of market share gains. Our sales and volume performance success is a testament to our supply chain strength in the advancement of our Recipe for Growth. Our operating expenses for the period were elevated due to the effects of COVID on our business. And as a result, our bottom line results were below our expectations this quarter. Key headlines for the quarter include strong sales results and market share gains. We delivered growth of more than 1.2 times the market, which exceeded our expectations for the period. We delivered sales growth of 10.5% versus 2019 and sequential volume improvements throughout the quarter until the Omicron variant impacted our December performance. More on Omicron in a moment. As I mentioned, operational expenses within our supply chain were above expectations due to the challenges that COVID is presenting to our labor environment and our transportation costs. I will detail this complex operating environment in a moment. But we remain confident, these incremental expenses, driven by labor costs, are near-term challenges that will improve over time. Our strong sales results and elevated operating expenses resulted in an adjusted earnings per share of $0.57 for the quarter. We further advanced our Recipe for Growth strategy, which we believe will uniquely position Sysco to win in the marketplace for the long-term. Sysco's strength of income statement and balance sheet have enabled us to continue advancing our strategy during a difficult operating environment. That strategic and economic reality will enable Sysco to outperform the market for quarters and years to come. Topic two for today, an update on the state of the business. As I mentioned a moment ago, COVID continues to negatively impact supply chains across the globe and the effect was elevated in Q2 relative to our first quarter. The impact is being felt in product availability shortages from our suppliers and higher than anticipated labor and transportation costs. I would like to further explain some of the labor cost pressures that we are addressing. At Sysco, we have hired thousands of new associates over the past quarter to support the recovery of our industry, which is coming faster and stronger than had been anticipated. We are also winning market share across our business sectors, which adds to our hiring needs. As a result of our hiring and an industry-wide higher rate of associate turnover, we have a higher ratio of new associates in our labor population than we had originally planned. A higher population of less experienced associates has a direct negative impact on our supply chain productivity. The punch line is that our tenured associates perform at a much higher rate of productivity than new associates. With that said, we are confident that we can and will move our newer associates up the productivity curve over time. We have also incurred higher than planned expenses as COVID related illnesses accelerated in the quarter and have come into January. To provide a sense of the magnitude of this disruption, nearly 10% of our US workforce tested positive for COVID during the month of January and were out for a minimum of several days. To cover these absences, we invested in overtime and supplemental third-party resources to ensure that we properly supported our customers. At Sysco, we cannot let our health care, education, hospitality and important restaurant partners go without food because of these labor challenges caused by COVID. Our customer centric approach to ensure that we can ship on time and in full will benefit our relationship with our customers for the long-term, positively impacting retention and growth. We are confident that our service performance is stronger than the industry as measured by our Net Promoter Score. In fact, our NPS performance versus the market expanded in the quarter. Lastly, as I mentioned, Omicron negatively impacted our top line performance, starting the weekend after Thanksgiving. Our business in Europe was impacted first with the reintroduction of major restrictions on our customers. Our sales and volume performances in December were impacted by those restrictions, most notably in the UK, France and Canada. For example, restaurants in the majority of Canada began closing for on-premise dining at the end of the second quarter with restrictions slowly starting to ease in February. These types of restrictions impact our customers' performance and ordering patterns. As a result, we expect the top line impact from Omicron to continue into the third quarter. The speed of the return to pre-Omicron volume levels is uncertain, but we are seeing signs of progress in Europe as restrictions have begun easing. I would like to highlight again that Sysco's sequentially improved sales and volume performance every month compared to 2019 levels until the impact of Omicron began being felt Thanksgiving weekend, and we are confident that we will get back to that growth pattern as Omicron receives. Topic three, let's turn to our market share performance highlighted on slide 5. Despite the challenges presented by Omicron at the end of the quarter, as you can see on slide 5, Sysco delivered exceptional growth versus the market in the second quarter. As a result, we are now confident we will exceed our 1.3x the market growth target for the full fiscal year. Our performance versus the market expanded this quarter. Furthermore, looking back over the last 3 quarters, we are beginning to pull ahead of the industry. The next slide from NPD, shows how over the last 2 years, we have consistently increased the percentage of customers that purchased exclusively from Sysco. This compares to the dotted line that shows the percentage of customers not yet buying from Sysco. You can see that the dotted line is steadily declining. These slides are just 2 more proof points that our team is winning in the marketplace and that our strategy is working. Lastly, topic 4, I will highlight examples in our business transformation and how that progress will enable consistent profitable growth. Today, I will give an update on 2 of our growth initiatives Sysco Your Way and our Italian Cuisine Program. As a reminder, Sysco Your Way is a new service model that we are piloting to better serve what we call restaurant dense neighborhoods. Through this program, we are providing our customers with enhanced levels of service and sales support. We are very pleased with the success of the pilot locations, and we will be expanding the program to net new neighborhoods in the spring of 2022. In addition to Sysco Your Way, I would like to provide an update on our Italian cuisine platform work. As a reminder, Italian is one of the largest cuisine segments and Sysco historically underpenetrated with this important customer segment. We did not have an optimal assortment, and we lap the go-to-market selling strategy to win. Our Greco acquisition has changed that capability in a meaningful way. First off, Greco is off to a great start and is exceeding our Year 1 top and bottom line expectations. We are really pleased with the Greco business and the great work that they are doing. As importantly, we are leveraging the Greco product assortment and selling prowess and bringing the best-selling items to Sysco houses across the country. More on that in due course. Winning in the specialty sectors like Italian is a priority for our Recipe for Growth strategy. Turning to Slide 7. In summary, for the quarter, we are winning as a company in the marketplace. We are growing our business with new and existing customers. Our year-to-date growth is exceeding our 1.2x the industry target for the year and is being driven by our supply chain strength and our Recipe for Growth strategy. We also returned over $650 million of cash to our shareholders during the quarter. We are confident that the impact of our initiatives will grow over time, enabling us to consistently outperform the market at large. As I wrap up my prepared remarks, I want to thank all of our associates at Sysco. These past 2 years have been challenging. We continue to lead the industry from a service perspective and make deliveries to our customers regardless of the COVID conditions. I am proud of our sales, operations and global support center teams for their persistence and customer focus that they have displayed. I really want to thank them for their tenacity and I'll use another word, endurance. I am honored to serve these associates and work by their side. I would also like to welcome the recently appointed members of our Board of Directors: Ali Dibadj, Jill Golder and Alison Kenney Paul. Together, they bring deep industry experience, a modern skills inventory, including finance, consumer and digital and strategy capabilities. Our 3 new Board members will be extremely valuable to Sysco in our transformation for years to come. I'll now turn it over to Aaron who will provide additional financial details before we open it up for questions.
Aaron Alt: Thank you, Kevin. Good morning. Here are our second quarter fiscal 2022 financial headlines. As seen on Slide 9, sales growth of 41.2% compared to last year, also up 10.5% versus fiscal 2019, leading to our highest Q2 sales ever. Good management of our product cost inflation, recording the highest gross profit in absolute dollar terms for any Q2 at Sysco. A doubling of adjusted operating income and a 62.9% increase in adjusted EBITDA compared to last year, notwithstanding a cost environment, which worsened during the quarter. Continued investment against our long-term recipe for growth, with $44 million of operating expense investments against our strategic investments, creating momentum with our commercial capabilities. Proactive action on the COVID generated labor and safety environments in which we are operating, with $73 million in transitory snapback operating investments such as recruiting costs, hiring marketing, vaccination promotion, contract labor and sign-on and retention bonuses in the quarter. And while the magnitude was greater than we could foresee last quarter, we experienced productivity challenges and much higher overtime costs in the quarter, resulting from the pandemic-related workforce transition and our prioritization of customer service. With respect to our capital allocation, we refinanced elements of our long-term debt during the quarter, and we returned $657 million of cash to shareholders. With those headlines on the table, let's turn to some details on the financials for the quarter and some thoughts on our outlook. Second quarter sales were $16.3 billion, an increase of 41.2% from fiscal 2021, and a 10.5% increase from fiscal 2019. In the United States, sales in our largest segment, US Foodservice, showed excellent progress, up 45.1% versus fiscal 2021 and up 14% versus fiscal 2019, reflecting the pre-Thanksgiving and pre-Omicron resurgence in volumes and sales. Local case volume within the subset of USFS, our US broadline operations, increased 17.6%, while total case volume within US broadline operations increased 22.5%. SYGMA sales were up 16.5% versus fiscal 2021 and up 15.3% and versus fiscal 2019, even with the large customer rationalization we disclosed earlier, which we expect will be complete on a comparable basis following Q3. International sales were up 43% versus fiscal 2021 and down approximately 3% versus fiscal 2019. Sales trends were accelerating nicely in our International segment before the onset of Omicron and restrictions in our key international markets such as the UK and we are watching post lockdown trends carefully. Foreign exchange rates had a positive impact of 0.3% on Sysco's sales results. We continue to monitor the impact on our customers and on our business as international restrictions are starting to ease, including in Ireland and the UK. Inflation continued to be a factor during the quarter at approximately 14.6% in our US broadline business. Gross profit for the enterprise was approximately $3 billion in the second quarter, increasing 37.8% versus the second quarter of fiscal 2021, and also exceeding gross profit in fiscal 2019 by 4%. The increase in gross profit was driven by year-over-year improvements in volume versus fiscal 2021 and compared to the same quarter in both fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2019, increases in gross profit dollars per case across all four of our reporting segments as we successfully managed increased costs for our product suppliers while addressing some, but not all, of our increased operating costs. Gross margin rate was 17.7% during the quarter with the margin rate math impacted by product inflation. Of course, it is gross profit dollars that count in an inflationary environment. Turning back to the enterprise, adjusted operating expense came in at $2.4 billion with a combination of planned and unexpected expense increases from the prior year, really driven by four things; first, the increased variable costs associated with significantly increased volumes. Second, as you can see on slide 10, more than $73 million of one-time and short-term transitory expenses associated with the snapback, which we expect to decline in the third quarter. While we have increased wages in select locations, those increases are not material and have the opportunity to be offset by productivity and cost-out improvements going forward. Third, $44 million of purposeful operating expense investments against our Recipe for Growth initiatives, like personalization, digital sales tools and assortment capabilities, which remain on track to be elevated for the rest of the year. And fourth, the productivity expense challenges Kevin referenced earlier, including ramp-up time associated with new higher productivity in our warehouses and trucks elevated overtime and third-party labor support in the face of staff absences. I want to emphasize that the management team at Sysco has been aggressive in pursuing the cause of the cost increases. While the transformation continues unabated, the team has also pushed hard to identify in action incremental profit opportunities and cost reduction initiatives, which should help the company in the back half and beyond as the environment stabilizes. Together the snapback investments in the transformation costs totaled approximately $116 million of operating expenses this quarter, and negatively impacted our adjusted EPS by approximately $0.17. All-in, we leveraged our adjusted operating expense structure and delivered expense as a percentage of sales of 14.7%, which is flat from fiscal 2019 and down 145 basis points from fiscal 2021. Our cost-out efforts are meaningfully benefiting our P&L, and we continue to assess and execute against new cost-out projects each quarter. Finally, for the second quarter of fiscal 2022, adjusted operating income increased $262 million from last year to $496 million. This was primarily driven by a 45% improvement in US Foodservice and continued progress on profitability from International, partially offset by SYGMA. The second quarter SYGMA operating loss was driven by higher-than-expected labor costs, which will be offset in future quarters by specific actions already taken by the SYGMA management team. Adjusted earnings per share increased to $0.40 to $0.57 for the second quarter compared to last year. Now, let me share a couple of comments on cash flow and the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $377 million on a year-to-date basis, driven by our higher income and lower interest, offset by higher tax payments and a significant investment in working capital. Net CapEx was $175.9 million, somewhat lower than expected given increased lead-times on fleet and equipment. Adjusted free cash flow year-to-date was $201 million. At the end of the second quarter, we had $1.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents on hand. As seen on slide 15, our results this quarter also reflected incremental progress against our capital allocation priorities. This included the further strengthening of our balance sheet by successfully refinancing debt during the quarter at longer maturities and more attractive rates, lowering our adjusted interest expense costs going forward. We also commenced our share repurchase program during the second quarter and repurchased approximately 5.7 million shares for a total of $416 million at an average share price of $72.30. This was in addition to paying our quarterly dividend of $0.47 per share in October. We remain committed to growing our dividend and as previously communicated, planned to next address decisions around our dividend per share during our fiscal Q4. While our track record goes back decades, as you can see on slide 16, over the last seven years, cumulatively, we have returned over $12 billion of cash to shareholders. Let's turn now to the look forward. Our Recipe for Growth transformation plan is on track. However, Omicron had a noticeable impact on our December and Q2 results continuing into January and now February. As a result, we are reaffirming our long-term guidance that for fiscal 2024, Sysco will deliver adjusted EPS growth of at least 30% over our record 2019 EPS of $3.55. We are updating our view of the back half to reflect the realities of the disruption caused by Omicron and the labor environment. We expect to fall below our prior EPS guidance for fiscal year 2022. For the full year, we expect adjusted EPS of approximately $3 to $3.10. This translates to adjusted EPS in the back half of about $1.60 to $1.70. In a typical pre-COVID fiscal year, adjusted EPS for our second half is generally weighted around 40% to Q3 and 60% in Q4 due to normal seasonality of our business. This year, we expect our second half profitability to be weighted even more to the fourth quarter. We expect a stronger Q4 this year relative to Q3 as a result of anticipated volume recovery, lower snapback expenses, improved operating productivity and specific actions we are taking to offset Omicron. In offering this perspective, we are assuming no further COVID variant disruptions to our operating environment. With that, let me turn the call back over to Kevin for closing remarks.
Kevin Hourican: Thank you, Aaron. As we conclude, I'd like to provide a brief summary. First, this quarter included substantial top line momentum and an acceleration of our market share gains. We are winning in the marketplace, and we have confidence that we will continue to win share. With that said, Q2 presented challenges from Omicron on both our top and bottom line. Our sequential volume growth progress stalled post-Thanksgiving and that headwind has continued into January. More importantly, COVID-related staffing disruptions increased our operating expenses for the quarter. As a result, our bottom line results were below our expectations. Second, despite the short-term impact of Omicron on our business, we are confident that we will resume our volume improvement as soon as the variant recedes. And we can see green shoots of progress in February from a volume perspective. As it relates to expenses, we have a management plan to improve our year-to-go operating expenses. We are meaningfully focused on improving associate retention, training and productivity. These activities are a core competency of Sysco and our experienced field leadership team has a plan to deliver improvement for the remainder of the year. Third, we remain confident in the long-term trajectory at Sysco. And as Aaron stated, we are reaffirming our long-term guidance that includes significant sales and EPS growth. Our Recipe for Growth transformation is creating capabilities at Sysco that will help us profitably grow for the long term. The customer-first solutions we are developing will enable us to grow our share profitably and also enable Sysco to be more efficient. There are bright days ahead for Sysco, and I am proud to be part of the journey. Operator, you can now turn it over for questions.
Operator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Edward Kelly of Wells Fargo.
Edward Kelly: Hi, guys. good morning. So Kevin and Aaron, I mean, obviously, Omicron has been pretty disruptive to your operations more recently. Can you quantify how much additional cost you saw in Q2 related to that? Is that all in the snapback costs that you provided, or is it in addition to that? And then how do we think about those costs snap back transformation like that in Q3 and then Q4 at this point?
Kevin Hourican: Hi, good morning. Great questions. I'm going to refer you back to our earlier remarks on pieces of that and then provide a couple of additional supplements. What was remarkable to us was the progress we were making up through the Thanksgiving holiday on the top line and indeed against the overall plan. With the onset of Omicron, we start to see the impact on volumes and certainly on our operating expenses. But for the quarter, we incurred $73 million of snapback cost, which is the combination of contract labor, retention bonuses, sign-on bonuses, training, vaccination credits, et cetera. We also incurred more than $40 million on transformation costs. But what's not in those two numbers that I referenced in the script is $40 million of overtime and other productivity impacts driven by both our response, ensuring that we're serving the customer but also then us working with the labor force and transition.
Edward Kelly: Yeah, great. That's helpful. And then Q3, how do we think about – I mean, I know you gave – helped us with guidance in Q3, but how do we think about those costs as we're modeling out Q3? And then, I guess, the other aspects, and so kind of this is my follow-up, how do we think about where case volumes are running now relative to like that 5% level in the US that you talked about versus 2019 in Q2 and then help internationally there as well?
Aaron Alt: Why don't I touch the expectations on OpEx, then toss is to Kevin on volume. From an OpEx perspective, what we experienced in December continued into January, as we described in our prepared remarks. And as Kevin alluded to, we're starting to see some green shoots in February. But green shoots does not equal back to pre-Omicron run rate. We are anticipating that our snapback cost will come down in the back half. We're also anticipating that our supply chain team, given our scale will make good progress against productivity in the back half as well. But we have work to do, which is why we were purposeful in our remarks in calling out both the seasonal split on our guidance between Q3 and -- on our annual results between Q3 and Q4, the 40/60, if you will, and emphasizing that given the continued Omicron environment, not withstand the green shoots, and the work we have to do that we expect the updated guidance to be heavily weighted to Q4. Kevin?
Kevin Hourican: Yeah. Thanks, Aaron. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Just as it relates to case volume, one of my comments in the prepared remarks is we had five consecutive sequential months of improvement in case volume growth, which continues Q4 of last fiscal year. Again, we were sequentially improving each and every month, taking market share as evidenced by our slide chart, we're really beginning to pull away from the rest of the market, so winning in aggregate. December was impacted. January was impacted because the restrictions were in place for all of January. We are beginning to see some signs of progress or green shoots in February as restrictions begin to ease, but we're not fully yet back to the pre-Omicron levels. We have 50% restaurant restriction on-premise dining in Canada. We have mandatory work-from-home work orders in France and in the UK. And then in northern urban locations within the United States, still heavy, heavy work from home, which impacts daypart restaurant traffic, as you well know. So we're not quite back to where we were. What we are very confident in is, as the restrictions on our customers ease, vaccine, passports and things like that, mask mandates that impact people's psychology tied to going out. As those things ease, we see fast recovery from our customers and we're prepared from an inventory perspective, we're prepared from a staffing perspective, we're prepared from a service level perspective to be able to serve when our customers are ready, and we expect to continue to pull away from the market from a growth versus the industry perspective. Thanks for the questions. We appreciate it.
Edward Kelly: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Slagle of Jefferies.
Alex Slagle: Thanks. Good morning. 
Aaron Alt: Good morning.
Alex Slagle: What do you think are the most important changes or improvements you've made as a company to be better prepared for unexpected surges or events like this that we've been through? I mean, perhaps things that are less obvious to investors that might give confidence that the impact of future events would be less of a headwind, perhaps even more of a share gain opportunity for Sysco?
Kevin Hourican: Great question, Alex. This is Kevin. Just first and foremost, inventory management, we have perishable products. So as volume declines, we need to be super fast and agile in regards to managing shrink and risks associated with spoilage. We've gotten very good at that. And you can see it in our performance results at just, our inventory management is significantly improved from 2 years ago when COVID first began. The second is in labor strategy, one of the things that, I made the call with full support of our Board back in December when Omicron began impacting, we were not going to furlough associates our staff. That would be a penny-wise, dollar-foolish decision. Pennies that we could save from furloughing staff in December and January, would cost us twice as much as we attempted to restock the bench and bring people back off furlough because in today's labor environment, we furlough someone, they're going to get a job in another industry at another company. So we made that very purposeful choice to not furlough any staff, not a single person over that period of time, December and January. That will pay dividends for our company. My guess would be smaller, less capitalized companies are not fortunate enough to be able to make those types of decisions. In fact, not only did we not furlough anyone, we hired thousands of people in our Q2 and have continued hiring December into January. At this moment in time, we literally have hundreds of drivers in the passenger seat of a truck getting trained on Sysco standards, Sysco processes, and they will be ready to be driving their own truck as the volume recovery begins.  Because keep in mind that there's an entire sector that we serve that isn't yet even back in business sufficiently, and that's what we call business and industry. We had been anticipating that the business and industry sector would have kicked in, in January as most companies were planning a return to work after the holidays. That has not occurred, as you know, and that's future tailwinds to the Sysco recovery as business and industry will begin kicking back in here. It's hard to predict when, but we will be prepared, we'll be ready. Those are just a handful of things that are on the different from March of 2020. And we've gotten pretty agile at dealing with these curveballs. But back to you if you have a follow-up.
Alex Slagle: That's helpful. A follow-up just on the Sysco branded product mix. How is this impacted by the supply chain challenges versus customer preferences? And how do you see that progressing through the calendar year?
Kevin Hourican: We view it as an opportunity to increase this cobrand first factual. Our Sysco brand fill rate and in-stock is exceeding national brand. That's important. Our ability to keep those very profitable products for Sysco in stock is an important priority for us. And the partners that we work with to produce that product, they're doing well. And again, Sysco brand in aggregate has a higher rate of in-stock than national brands. That's point one. Point two, because of inflation being elevated and everybody knows it's currently elevated, Sysco brand has an even bigger punch than it normally would. So we view Sysco brand as an opportunity to save our customers' money with a high-quality product and we are doing a good job with our sales team of introducing customers to products that they perhaps have not purchased before. And we did see progress in fact, 250 basis points of progress from Q1 into Q2 on Sysco brands penetration, and I would view further tailwind in that regard in the coming years.
Alex Slagle: Got it. Thanks.
Kevin Hourican: Thanks a lot.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Partners.
John Heinbockel: So Kevin, let me start with your thoughts on elevated inflation an impact on unit demand, right, food away from home. And then if you guys -- can you grow faster than that 1.5% goal for 2024. What would it take to do that -- and for example, could you get close to two times if the market grew slower and to get to where you want to get to share gains have to play a bigger role? What's your thought on that?
Kevin Hourican: John, thanks for the questions. Tied to inflation, it's double-digit at this time. As you know, it's been double-digit now for longer than any of us in the industry would like. We have not seen yet a reduction in consumer demand tied to that higher inflation. And it's hard to predict how long that will be able to persist, but we're not seeing elasticity of pricing impact consumer purchasing and that is a positive. It has obviously helped our P&L. In the most recent quarter, as Aaron said, we increased GP dollars per case in each of our reportable segments. So we're doing a good job of passing through inflation. We're also doing a good job of helping our customers find lower cost alternatives. So menu suggestions, narrowing the number of items on the menu, so they can increase their profitability. Portion size, as you know, optimization so that they can keep their ticket on the menu the same and do so from a lower COGS to them. So those things are going well. Protein is even higher than the overall basket of inflation. We need to see progress on supplier availability in protein. It's a priority for Sysco. We are working with our supplier partners in the protein category to work on longer-range forecasts so they have consistency or purchase volume from Sysco, so that they can be efficient in their production. And we are working as hard as we can to find additional sources of supplies in the protein category because we need to bring the protein inflation down. John, that's the number one focus for us from an inflation perspective. As it relates to the second half of your question, which was can we grow faster than 1.5, yes, we're pleased to report today that we are exceeding our goal for this year, which was 1.2%. Prior quarter, we had said we are on track to deliver 1.2. So those words matter. We changed our words from on track to exceed. We are confident we will exceed the 1.2 this year. Our third year goal of our three-year plan, which is fiscal 2024, it remains at this time at 1.5. Do I have confidence we can do better than that? And we'll talk more about that at Investor Day. But we like our strategy. It's winning in the marketplace. If you look at the chart in our prepared remarks, you can see the pulling away from the industry, and I don't anticipate that slowing down.
John Heinbockel: And maybe just as a quick follow-up. When you think about 2024 now, right, versus maybe six months ago, do you think your thought now is revenue will be higher and profit margins lower than you thought six months ago, or it's too early to make that call?
Aaron Alt: John, good morning. It's Aaron. I really like your question because like you, we are very focused on the long-term. And we were purposeful in reaffirming our 2024 guidance. We believe it, we can see it, right? And we're going to get there. And I would take you back to something I said at our Investor Day back in May, which was the opportunity is everywhere at Sysco and what I would describe it now is progress is everywhere at Sysco. And we're going to get through the current volatility driven by Omicron. I'm quite pleased with what I'm seeing from a disciplined perspective in the business, and we are putting all the pieces in place so that by the time we get to 2024, we're talking about the upside, right? But for the moment, we have to stay focused on getting through Omicron getting through the quarter, getting through the half, but we are quite confident in the future.
John Heinbockel: Thank you.
Kevin Hourican: Thank you, John.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jake Bartlett of Truist Securities.
Jake Bartlett: Great. Thank you for taking the question. My first was on Omicron and kind of understanding the near-term impacts that had on your staffing in demand. But I'm wondering if there's any longer-term impacts in your view and whether that's pushing out the supply chain disruptions materially? Have you a longer impact there? And did you see any disruptions maybe closures, for instance, with some of your independent customers? Anything that might just last longer than as we look at the cases come down sharply here?
Kevin Hourican: Jake, it's a good question. I'll answer directly as asked and then I'm going to add one point that we believe is on investors' minds tied to this. First and foremost, scale matters in this industry meaningfully. So, purchasing scale matters so we can get best possible costs so we can share value with our customers. Scale matters from a physicality perspective. So, we have more distribution centers in the United States, our primary country than anyone else, which means our last mile delivery is a shorter route, a more dense route than others. And as we continue to grow, Aaron and I will make appropriate investments in incremental physical capabilities to put us even closer to the customer, which will lower our cost to serve. And you can see the flywheel that comes from the size, breadth and scale of Sysco, and we believe that will become an increasing strength capability over time because of the cash generation of this company and our strong balance sheet, we have the ability to invest in net new facilities to lower that cost to serve last-mile delivery. So, we believe it will be an increasing strength formula for our company. One of the questions that we believe is on investors' minds is, Kevin, aren't you worried about labor costs? Everyone we talked to is talking about labor costs going up. I just want to be clear on this topic. Labor wage rate is immaterial to the cost pressure that we experienced in Q2. I'll repeat that, the labor wage rate was immaterial in our Q2. Our wage -- excuse me, our operating cost pressure in this past quarter, if you had to single it down to like the biggest thing was the percentage of people working for us that are new tied to the hiring and there was more turnover that occurred this past summer than is typical in our industry tied to what some people call that great resignation. So, we are working feverishly on improving associate retention, improvement training of our associates, improving the productivity of our associates. As I mentioned, this is our core competence. This is what we do, and we are confident we will move up the productivity ladder. As Aaron said, that will be more Q4 impactful than Q3 because it takes time. As I mentioned earlier, I gave a decent piece of color. When you started as a driver in our company, you're in the passenger seat for weeks, learning Sysco standards, learning our customer relations interface because that driver is the face of this company and also, of course, learning the challenging type of driving, which is mostly backing up to restaurant locations that our drivers have to do. So those investments we're making will reduce over time, which is why we are confident that we will improve our productivity, which will then begin to flow through to improved EBIT percent margin. So I just want to be clear, labor rate increase is not something that is causing our current operating cost pressure. As you look to the future, will that change? We do anticipate when we do our annual review process that we will have a nominally higher wage rate increase provided to our associates. They work hard. They deserve to be paid fairly and appropriately, and we have productivity improvement efforts that can help offset those types of increases.
Jake Bartlett: Great, great. Thank you very much. And just really a quick follow-up to that. Last week, Brinker, you talked about interest in rehire rates and seeing an increase in the rehiring of former employees. And I'm just wondering, whether -- I mean, that's something that's, I think, it’s a sign of an improving labor market, but also could really help with productivity. Is that something that you're measuring or seeing any material change there as people might have left for whatever reason are coming back to Sysco?
Kevin Hourican: Yes, Jake, it's a great question. I think I said a couple of quarters ago, we've rehired 100% of people that we furloughed back in March from a supply chain perspective. So we've been fully open for business now for a long time, and we're growing. So we're taking market share. We're winning new customers. Our sales are obviously well above 2019. Our volumes, we anticipate will be back to and then above 2019 in the not-too-distant future. So we've got the open to hire shingle out there. In fact, we're getting much more effective at recruiting for open positions. Our marketing team is getting more sophisticated on how to target applicants, and we're getting better and better at training them. But in the future, to specifically answer your question, Jake, we're actually going to have to go to people from outside this industry, to meet the hiring needs and higher demands that we have. It's why we formed our driver academy. Just a little bit of color on that. We're now live in two physical driver academy locations. Our first CDL class has graduated from our driver academy and we think we're going to have to eat our own cooking, pun intended, where we're going to have to find people who aren't today CDL class drivers, teach them to trade, train them and then have them work for a long time for Sysco. And again, that's an example of size and scale matter. We pay people to participate in that program; whereas today, if you were an average person wanting to become a driver and you enter driver school, you actually have to pay the driver school. So think about that flip, from having to go, from having to pay to attend and lose time working, to we actually pay you to attend the Sysco Driver Academy, and we're bullish about that and expanding that opportunity across the country. Thank you for the questions.
Jake Bartlett: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein of Barclays.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much. Kevin and Aaron, I think you both mentioned green shoots. I believe that was in reference to just more recent February -- early February trends. I'm just trying to assess whether that's more on the sales side starting to recover, which I know we've heard some talk about starting in mid-January things are getting better? Or whether you're referring to more inflation, because we've seen spot prices maybe start to ease sequentially on commodities and maybe, as we've talked about earlier, maybe a little bit easier to do some hiring. So just trying to assess what you think comes first as you talk about the green shoots through the fiscal third quarter.
Kevin Hourican: Good morning, Jeff. Thanks for the question. The green shoot comment that I made was actually tied to cases -- excuse me, case volume, therefore, and sales beginning to improve. That's what that comment was tied to. As restrictions begin to ease, Canada just in February has relaxed. They still have a very onerous restriction in place, which is a 50% on-prem dining, but it was like literally restaurants were closed in Canada. In the GTA, Greater Toronto area, in Quebec province, you couldn't eat in a restaurant for the month of January. So those restrictions that began easing. In the UK and France, the restrictions have been very heavy, mandatory work-from-home. We're seeing restrictions ease there and the green shoot comment was tied to as those restrictions ease, we can see a recovery of the business and a return of volume. And then in the US, I didn't give this color commentary. The Southern one-third of the United States continues to perform very well. The headwind in the US is in the urban centers in the north, and we anticipate recovery being made in those environments as, again, restrictions in these -- that's mostly a city mayor decision as the restrictions they're putting on customers ease. Point two, that -- where else will progress come from? So we do expect volume and sales to make progress in Q3 and certainly into Q4. But operating expenses, we have a plan. We have a management action plan to address our operating expenses. It's a five-part plan. I'll cover three quickly, and then I'll toss to Aaron, who’ll cover two. First and foremost it’s about retention, training and productivity. We need to move the new hires up the productivity curve, and we are maniacally focused on improving that new hire productivity. Topic two is transportation efficiency. There's Golden Nam Hills, we like to say on ensuring that the trucks are being routed most optimally. There's work we can do. It's pick and shovel work to ensure that our transportation efficiency is operating at the highest level. The third is Sysco brand. The question that came up earlier in today's conversation from Alex. We are making progress in Sysco brand. It will be a big focus in the year to go, and we anticipate profit improvement in the year to go tied to increasing penetration of Sysco brand. And then I'll toss to Aaron for the two other topics we're addressing. Aaron, over to you.
Aaron Alt: Thanks, Kevin. Of equal importance are our progress against COGS. We have opportunities to source better. Our strategic sourcing efforts are gathering steam, and we're bullish on where that will take us over time. And then, of course, being relentless on cost out and accelerating our efforts and frankly, finding new projects. We have a big goal out there from May. We are accelerating that goal, trying to bring the goodness forward to help us offset what we've been experiencing over the last couple of quarters. I do want to cross out one modeling point just for clarification. I want to point out to those who are working in their models that January is a seasonal low for us, even in the absence of Omicron, right? And so while the green shoot you're hearing us talk about green shoots, those are largely coming in February and beyond.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Understood. And then my follow-up, I guess, relates to that profitability point you just made. I know for a number of quarters now, you guys have referenced improving profitability starting in the second half of fiscal 2022, which we're finally here, seemingly as I guess, investments ease a little bit, profitability improves initiatives on that front. Just wondering whether you still see that thesis intact or whether there's been delays to that. Obviously, you reiterated the fiscal 2024. So it seems like the end zone is still at the same spot, but just wondering whether there's a concern that there's more of a hockey stick type recovery or whether you still believe that starting in the back half of fiscal 2022, a lot of the initiatives you put in place are really going to start to bear fruit putting aside kind of the Omicron variant.
Kevin Hourican: I appreciate the question. Let me offer some perspective. Everything we have said we are going to do, we are doing. What has changed is the environment in which we're operating, right? And so while we got out of the box early at the end of fiscal 2021, working on aggressive cost-out efforts and working on GP sourcing efforts, right? The visibility of those things in the P&L has been impacted by the environment in which we're operating. So we do have strong confidence in our long-term guidance. We have visibility to the actions that we had planned to take internally on cost out and gross profit recovery actions. And we aren't backing away from those. And those efforts aren't slowing down. If anything, they're actually accelerating. So while, I'm going to refer you back to my earlier comments about the back half guidance and what the short-term environment means for us. Kevin and I and the entire management team are locked hands, and we're going to deliver on fiscal '24 of being at or above our all-time EPS high from fiscal 2019.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Understood.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Glass of Morgan Stanley.
John Glass: Thanks very much. I wanted to go back to the health of your customer base and looking at the difference between your overall Broadline case growth and your local case growth. Is it fair to say independent restaurants have been more negatively impacted by the things like you mentioned about staffing shortages, etcetera? And inside of that, is there any growing concern that inflation is impacting their financial health? Is there any negative reads that you're seeing in terms of independent restaurants viability in this inflationary environment or not?
Kevin Hourican: John, that's a really terrific question. Let me just go back to this health of the customer component. If we go back to the beginning of COVID, fast food QSR drive-through meaningful share winner. And you could see that in our SYGMA reportable segment for last year, SYGMA had a record year in both top line and bottom line. In part because SYGMA indexes towards obviously serving that customer type. That was year one of COVID. Year two of COVID, the big winners are the sophisticated restaurant chains that have a digital app that allows to go ordering, that allows paperless, contactless payment, I meant just frictionless ease of purchase and really loyalty. One of the things we're working on at Sysco is personalization. Well, there are select retailers -- excuse me, restaurants, I won't name the names of them that are pretty fantastic loyalty program that prompt their customers to buy more from them and come back to their restaurants more often. Those are the big winners at this point in time. As it relates to Sysco and how we can help the mom and pop. This is the sweet spot of who we are? So we are helping independent restaurants, figure out how to connect to a delivery partner. We help them with a creation of a mobile version of their venue so that customers can shop remotely and pick up or take out and also, we're helping them with things like contactless payment in the restaurant. So we have the largest sales force in the industry, and that literally is what they do. They don't just sell food. They consult with mom-and-pops to help them compete more effectively with some of the larger companies. And we believe that will earn loyalty to Sysco over time. We believe that will increase Sysco's stickiness. And I refer you back to the chart in our slide deck that talked about the percentage of Sysco customers now buying just from us and then the percentage of customers that weren't previously buying from us in both of those indices are improving steadily. So we're confident in the long term of the mom-and-pop independents. There are many of them out there, and we can help them succeed. And we believe that Sysco's independent customers are going to outperform the mom-and-pop that does not partner with Sysco. In fact, we've got data that shows that, in fact, is the case and our sales reps use that in their selling process. Point two, is well inflation more negatively impact mom-and-pops. I would say yes, but then I would call it back to the Sysco thesis. And why does the national chain perhaps have more mitigating buffering? Many of them have long-term supplier contracts with fixed pricing and/or scales tied to inflation and the mom-and-pop has less of that. But that's what we are. We are essentially their purchasing agent. We are pushing back hard on cost increases, as I mentioned in one of the earlier questions from the other, John, is what are we doing about this inflation component. We are working aggressively to find alternative suppliers, alternative items, lower cost items that could be substituted too. And again, that's what motivates us at Sysco is to serve that mom-and-pop. And we've got a lot of good things happening to help them with their inflation, which includes Sysco Brand and our mom-pop restaurant customers love Sysco brand for the fact that it saves them time and saves them money and we anticipate making progress in that regard as well.
John Glass: Thanks for that. And then just on inflation on the comment, do you think the second quarter here was the peak of inflation as you look into what you're seeing in the third quarter? Do you think the rate of inflation begins to cool off, or do you not see that yet?
Aaron Alt: We are continuing to see elevated levels of inflation. And as much as I would like to call when the down point will be impossible for us to do. And so we are assuming elevated inflation through the rest of the fiscal year, if modestly down in Q4 versus Q3.
John Glass: Thank you.
Aaron Alt: Thanks, John.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Carden of UBS.
Mark Carden: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. So not too long ago, you guys noted that you've seen a 10% increase in local doors served against the 10% decline in overall local doors open. These numbers still largely hold true as the variant disruption had much of an impact on this front? Thanks.
Kevin Hourican: Yes, Mark, it's holding true. So in fact, we're continuing to make progress. We kind of pivoted on how we reported it this quarter. The answer to your question is, yes, it's holding true. This quarter, we chose to provide you even more color by putting a chart in our prepared remarks that shows the percent of customers buying unique from us going up and then the percentage you do not buy from us going down. You put those two together, and it's resulting in the number of unique doors that we're serving continues to go up. And I would say the bankruptcy rate of independent customers continues to be lower than what many had predicted. And I think mom-and-pop operators, they see a light at the end of the tunnel and they're prepared to benefit from an industry recovery that's still in front of us.
Mark Carden: Okay. Great. And then thinking more from the food distribution industry perspective, has Omicron impacted the competitive landscape in the sense of as the combination of another wave of restrictions and continued labor pressures impacted their ability to stay in business either in the US or internationally and thinking about the smaller independent distributors there?
Kevin Hourican: Hey, Mark, I appreciate the question. I would just kind of call back to my answer to one of the previous questions, which is that size and scale matter and have become even more important in this COVID environment. Supply chain resiliency is the newest buzzword if you think about places like World Economic Forum and what our CEO is talking about, it used to be supply chain agility and -- people now are talking about supply chain resiliency that you can weather storms of environmental conditions, political unrest and then things like this, which is a healthcare tied topic. So size and scale matter meaningfully when you're talking supply chain resiliency. We have the inventory to be able to support our customers as they recover. Aaron and I have invested to ensure that we have more inventory on hand at the present time than we did pre-COVID. We also are investing in labor, as I mentioned earlier, and some less strong balance sheet and income statement competitors of ours aren't able to do that. They're holding on to get through, and we're hiring thousands of people, while Omicron is in our midst and that's intentional. And yes, it impacted our operating expenses in Q2, but it will position us to be able to serve our customers in a proper way, win new business. In that business, we intend to keep forever. So, those are our ambitions. We are confident in our ability to do so. and yes, size and scale matter. Last comment for me is digital before I toss to Aaron. One of our transformation investments is to improve our digital capabilities. So, modern pricing software, substantial improvements to our website. We've made substantial improvements to our sales force guiding tool, which we call Salesforce 360, which literally guides the sales rep on what the job to be done is at that restaurant on that given visit. We've made substantial improvements to that tool, which have increased our sales consultant success rate on penetrating new cases and winning new lines of business with existing customers. So, those types of investments, which are not immaterial, as Aaron quoted on the call today, $44 million worth of investments in those types of capabilities, we're going to distance ourselves from those that we compete with. Cost, Aaron, for additional comments.
Aaron Alt: Kevin, I just want to ladder back to one of our earlier answers, which is this is why we're confident in our long-term guidance because we are willing to support the customer now, right? Short-term, it will have an impact on profit, but we're doing the right things by the customer when they need us while investing for the long-term, and this is going to be part of the ecosystem and the algorithm we build to meet or exceed that guidance for 2024.
Mark Carden: Great. Thanks so much guys.
Aaron Alt: Thank you, Mark.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Silberman of Credit Suisse.
Lauren Silberman: Thank you for the question. Just first, to follow up on the snapback and transformation costs. How much of these costs are going to carry forward in the fiscal 2023 cost base? Should we see the full sort of $73 million of snapbacks fall off in fiscal second quarter of 2023 and really the $44 million of transformation costs to be in the base? Just trying to understand how to think about the structural.
Aaron Alt: Sure. Great question. So, of course, I haven't provided you with fiscal 2023 guidance, so I'm not going to do so today. We're going to get through the back half of this year and then we're going to work towards the long-term guidance. That important qualifier aside a couple of observations. The first is that the snapback costs we're calling out, they're transitory, short term are onetime in nature. And so we do not expect those to be long-term or even medium term increases to our capital structure, and I want to emphasize our cost structure. And when I emphasize -- I want to emphasize something Kevin said earlier, which is wage rate increase increases are immaterial to our current results. And so there's not a -- those don't include structural changes, so to speak. With respect to our transformation investments, we do -- we will continue to invest against the transformation -- and we'll provide more clarity on what that looks like in 2023 when we get to 2023 guidance. Important caveat, though, I think I've said before, let me say it again now, our -- we will continue to invest in the transformation and in the back half, assumed in our guidance is that the transformation OpEx investments will be at or above where they were in Q2.
Lauren Silberman: Okay. And then separately, seeing double-digit inflation, you've talked about effectively managing the product inflation. Can you talk about the dynamics between inflation hitting the cost line versus the price that you're pushing through on topline? Just trying to understand the pricing power opportunities to recoup some of the elevated OpEx costs. I know some are transitory, some are permanent. So, just said more clearly, can we assume you were pricing above the 14.5% inflation in U.S. broadline?
Aaron Alt: Great question. The math, because our cost -- our gross profit dollars per case is up, would imply that we are indeed able to pass through and manage our product cost inflation if we weren't as -- if that wasn't going up, we would be stable, right? As far as how far we go, it's a choice we have to make in the context of the environment where we're in, as far as how much of the operating costs we passed through on a regular basis. We are committed to supporting the customers and doing the right thing in the short-term environment as we focus on the long-term guidance. Kevin, anything you want to add to that?
Kevin Hourican: Yes. Just one thing to add. It really is a good question, Lauren. I want to be clear on something that might not be obvious outside our company. There are certain customer types where our transaction with them is purely through the purchase of the food and how much the food costs. So Aaron just described that very well. And we're doing a good job in that regard for that customer type. We also have other customers that we transact from a fee per case basis. And it's in those contracts that -- there are times are provisions for food cost increases, but when our operating cost increase, like they did in the most recent quarter, that's where we get pinched. And we are working aggressively on that. In fact, our SYGMA sector -- excuse me, SYGMA reporting segment, our operating cost increased in SYGMA in the most recent quarter tied to the same reasons that I described earlier. We've got a plan to meaningfully improve the productivity within SYGMA, as our staffing is improving. And also, we are looking at the long-term contracts that we have in those types of fee-per-case arrangements, so that we have fairness and partnership with the customers that we work with in that reporting segment. So I hope that gives you some color where it's item price, yes, we can do what you described. And if it's a deeper case, it's actually a conversation with our customers and that partnership, long-term relationship management that I referenced a second ago.
Lauren Silberman: Thank you, guys, very much.
Kevin Hourican: Thank you, Lauren.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Mullan of Deutsche Bank.
Brian Mullan: Hey. Thank you. Just wondering if you might provide an update where the volume recovery stands at present for some of the non-restaurant sectors in the U.S. relative to the fiscal 2019 level of business. If you could just talk about hospitality and health care. Kevin, you referenced business and industry as well in the prepared remarks. Just looking for a sense of magnitude, in terms of how much there is to go when we get back to normal.
Kevin Hourican: Yes, Brian, terrific question. I hinted at this a little bit ago. We have two primary sectors that are still down meaningfully. We're not going to quote a percentage, but I'll say it down meaningfully and that's business and industry, and we're the leading food provider in that space. So we partner with foodservice management companies, and we are the primary distributor to those companies for offices, catering and the rest. So that sector is still down meaningfully. We had anticipated that, that sector was going to really kick in, in January, and that did not occur. Most companies are still currently working from home. Most companies have actually stopped trying to predict when they’re going to go back to working from the office. But we do anticipate progress being made in the year to go, but it’d be slower progress than we thought. On the optimist longer-term view, it's additional tailwind fuel at Sysco. And what we've said is, we'd be getting to flat volume to 2019 kind of inclusive of our current business performance and trends that got delayed because of Omicron, as Aaron said very well in his prepared remarks. But we have tailwinds still in front of us on that business and industry. And the second is travel and hospitality. Again, we are a very large player in the travel and hospitality space. Business travel currently down significantly. Leisure travel performed quite well last summer. We anticipate this summer will be a very strong leisure travel summer. But business travel conferences and the like that drives a big portion of that business isn't meaningfully recovered yet, and that will also be a further tailwind for us into the future.
Brian Mullan: Okay. Thank you. And then as a follow-up, just a question on the loyalty program pilots in the US. Are there any early learnings you might be able to discuss and then at a high level, could you talk about what you're envisioning for the program? What are some of the longer term benefits if you get it right? And then conversely, what are some of the challenges in terms of getting this done the way you want, driving widespread restaurant customer adoption?
Kevin Hourican: Hey, Brian, that's a great question. I love it. Today, I chose to focus on Sysco, your way and Italian cuisine, just to keep my prepared remarks short, but we've got progress happening on all five elements of our recipe for growth. And for sure, we're making meaningful progress in personalization. It starts with data. Treasure troves of data of purchasing patterns and purchasing behavior and that data is now in the cloud. We've got machine learning and artificial intelligence technology going against that data to provide customers with offers that are unique to them, and those offers are now showing up through our Sysco shop platform. And the customer almost doesn't even know that it's happening. And that's what's brilliant about end of one personalization. And when we say one, I mean, each specific customer getting an offer that's unique for them. I can assure you we're the only food service distributor that is doing that. The second point, though, is our sales rep activation, which I mentioned briefly a moment ago. We've got the best trained sales team in the industry, and they are experts in food. These are chefs. These are former restaurant owners. We're now though teeing up for them, hey, as you're heading into the Bar & Grill on Main Street, this is specifically what they haven't been buying from us. Here's an offer specific for you for today only that you can talk to that customer about. There's a sample that will be on the next truck. There's a Sysco brand selling opportunity to save them money. And just the power of that data being provided to our sales reps and also to the customer through Sysco shop, it's going to increase penetration with existing customers, which is the best way to improve profitability for a distributor like us, but it's also going to enable us to win new business. As it relates to Sysco shop now being able to provide pricing at the item level for someone even before they have begun ordering from Sysco. That's a first for us. Tied to your customer adoption question, that's a very good one. In the future, we will talk to you about our loyalty program. It's called Sysco Perks. That is an actual loyalty program that we are enrolling people into and today, I'm not prepared to give an update on that endeavor other than the pilot is going well, and more to come at a future update on the expansion plans of that pilot.
Brian Mullan: Thank you.
Kevin Hourican: Thank you Brian.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania of BMO Capital.
Kelly Bania: Hi, good morning. Thanks for fitting us in. Wanted to just ask about another question on hiring aside from the near-term illness related staffing pressures. Just curious how much more hiring you need to do by the end of the fiscal year? And can you talk about the level of talent you're able to find? And just any quantification of that wage rate figure. I think it was noted as not material, but are we talking low single digit, mid-single digit? Any help on that front would be helpful.
Kevin Hourican: Kelly, thanks. We're not going to quote a year ago hiring number. That's not something that we're going to do here. Aaron provided an outlook, I just reference you to the outlook that he provided. As it relates to the wage pressure, we were pretty clear today to talk about that's not actually material and should not be something that is concerning as it relates to our long-term expense algorithm. We do anticipate this summer that it will be elevated versus our norm, but it's an amount that will be manageable in our ecosystem. We've got compelling projects that we're working on to improve driver productivity. We're purchasing a piece of material handling equipment that we are equipping our drivers to use on their routes that help them with managing their days, and those are the types of things that we're talking about. So again, our expense pressure that we've experienced in the most recent quarter are the things that we described with wage increase not being material.
Kelly Bania: Okay. Fair enough. And then, Kevin, you talked about this a little bit in terms of the contract side of the business. But I guess, investors are just really wondering how the contract negotiation process is going? And just in general, the competitive for contracts and how, if at all, the cost environment is being kind of factored into contracts as you're resigning those and moving forward.
Kevin Hourican: Kelly, it's a really good question. And it's obviously, I'm going to keep private between us and our key customers and suppliers, the contract negotiations that we have and the relationship discussions that we have. But I would say the following: we are appreciated even more now than ever before tied to our size, scale, our ability to ship on time and in full. You can infer what that means vis-à-vis contracting language, but we are appreciated even more now than ever before. There is a scarcity of supply. There is a lack of ship on time and ship in full capacity on the market right now. And we're not going to 'take advantage of that.' That's not who we are as a company because we look at long-term partnerships and relationships. But we're going to have fair and balanced contracts with the people we do business with, and Sysco has appreciated more now than probably ever before. Hopefully, that was clear.
Kelly Bania: Thank you.
Kevin Hourican: Thank you. Appreciate the question.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q1  (2021-11-09 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to Sysco First Quarter Fiscal 2022 Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. We will begin with opening remarks and introductions. I will now like to turn the call over to Neil Russell, Senior Vice President of Corporate Affairs and Chief Communications Officer. Please go ahead.
Neil Russell: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Sysco's First Quarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings Call.

To ensure that we have sufficient time to answer all questions, we'd like to ask each participant to limit their time today to one question and one follow-up. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Kevin Hourican.
Kevin Hourican: Thank you, Neil. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. This morning, I will discuss Sysco's steadily improving financial results, I'll provide an update on our business transformation, and finally, I'll provide some color on the current state of our business environment. I'll then turn it over to Aaron, who will discuss the details of Sysco's first quarter financial results. Let's get started with our financial results displayed on Slide 4. Earlier this morning, Sysco reported first quarter fiscal 2022 results that were fueled by substantial top-line momentum that continues to exceed our expectations. Our top-line results sequentially increased each month of the quarter, despite the presence of the Delta variant, and have continued to improve into October. Our sequential improvement in sales and volume is a clear statement of our supply chain strength and our ability to win meaningful market share in this climate.  We're pleased with the top-line results and our flow-through to the bottom line exceeded our expectations for the quarter. This strong start gives us confidence in reaffirming our guidance for the full year. Key headlines for the quarter include a growing top-line than improved sequentially throughout the quarter and continued growth through October as seen on the right side of Slide 4. Q1 represented another period of strong net new business wins for Sysco at both the national and local level. These customer wins will fuel our success in quarters in years to come. Customers are responding to Sysco's relative supply chain strength, our new purpose platform, and our improving capabilities driven by our recipe for growth strategy. All told, we delivered sales growth of 8.2% versus 2019.  We outperformed our fiscal 2022 growth goal of 1.2 times the market in the first quarter, delivering the strongest growth versus the market in the last 5 plus years. We believe additional growth is still in front of us at Sysco as our volume is yet to fully recover in certain segments such as Hospitality, Business and Industry, Food service management, and International. As these segments recover, additional momentum will be added to our business. We are preparing now for select segments to further recover in early 2022 by strategically placing inventory and bolstering our staffing levels. For example, we anticipate that our business and industry segment will see upward momentum in January as select customers plan to reopen their offices at that time. International travel restrictions are beginning to ease, which should benefit our hospitality selector in specific regions of our business.  Our operational expenses for the quarter increased due to higher volumes, elevated overtime rates, and an intentional expenditures that were targeted to improve our staffing health. We invested in incremental marketing to advertise open positions. We provided new associates with sign-on bonuses and provided referral and retention bonuses to existing staff. We anticipate that these expenses will continue in our second quarter and that we can make progress in reducing the level of investment in the second half of our fiscal year. Our profit flow-through from the top to the bottom line should improve as a result in the second half. Gross margin for the quarter was impacted by high rate of inflation, which increased to approximately 13%. We expect inflation to continue at a similar rate through the second quarter before beginning to taper later in the fiscal year.  Given current trends in the industry, we expect the tapering will begin further into the fiscal year than we had initially modeled. Our international business continues to show strong improvement. We have improved from posting a loss in Q3 of 2021 to breaking even in Q4, to making more than $60 million of adjusted profit in our Q1 of fiscal 2022. It is important to note that our international business is skewed to large contract customers that are still heavily impacted by COVID. For example, we over-index in Europe in the business industry, in travel segments that remain constrained versus 2019 levels. As such, the relative sales performance in the international sectors still lags that of the U.S. segment. However, it also conveys that we have additional recovery still in front of us internationally.  Our recipe for growth strategy will enable our international business segment to improve how we serve local customers overtime, and we anticipate a shift in our customer mix to the more profitable local sector as we progress on our 3-year strategic plan. In summary, we delivered very strong top-line results, increased profit per case shift, and experienced elevated operating expenses that increased our cost to serve. The combination of these results delivered a strong adjusted operating income for the quarter of 685 million and adjusted earnings per share of $0.83. Both results exceeded our expectations for the quarter and positioned Sysco to deliver our full-year guidance.  Aaron will provide more details on our financial shortly, but we're pleased to be off to a strong start in the new fiscal year. Topic 2, let's turn to our business transformation, which is highlighted on Slide 5. As important as a strong quarterly financial results, our business transformation remains on track, and I will highlight a few examples of our progress this morning. Our pricing project implementation is now substantially complete. The centralized pricing tool enables Sysco to strategically manage the high levels of inflation we are currently experiencing with disciplined and strategic control. We can determine that the customer-item level exactly what level of inflation to pass through. We can optimize the pass-through to balance profitability and sales growth. There is no better time than the present to have this powerful capability.  Longer-term, the pricing tool will enable us to accelerate sales growth profitably, as we optimize pricing to increase share-of-wallet and increase pricing trust with our customers. Our work on the personalization engine continues to advance. This innovative, industry-leading program will enable Sysco to further penetrate lines in cases with existing customers, and will improve our sales consultants ability to win new accounts. We will supplement personalization with increased service levels for top customers through an innovative loyalty program that we'll discuss more in future quarterly calls. Our sales transformation is proving to be very successful, as our sales teams continue to win new business at record levels.  As I mentioned in my financial narrative, our local and national sales teams delivered strong wins in the quarter that will help fuel our future growth profitably. Lastly, we're continuing to improve the efficiency of our organization as we further reduce our structural expenses to fund our strategic initiatives. Over the past few quarters, we regionalized the leadership structure of our specialty businesses, FreshPoint and SSMG, and we follow the playbook of our U.S. broadline regionalization, and have now implemented the more agile and efficient model for our two main specialty businesses. As shown on Slide 6, during our first quarter we successfully closed on the Greco and Sons transaction, which we expect to deliver over $1 billion in incremental sales to Sysco in fiscal 2022 ahead of our deal model expectations.  More importantly, we plan to leverage the Greco business model to build a nationwide Italian platform, that is the best in the industry, which will further deliver incremental sales beyond the 1 billion just mentioned. In addition to closing the Greco transaction, we acquired a produce distributor in October that will operate as a part of our FreshPoint business segment, and will improve our ability to provide fresh produce and value-added fresh-cut capabilities to the Pennsylvania and Ohio markets. You may not realize that Sysco is the largest specialty produce distributor in the U.S., these are the purpose point platform. Our produce business has a high-growth CAGR, and attractive margins.  Growing in the specialty sector is a priority for Sysco, enabling us to gain more share of wallet from customers by combining our broadline capabilities with the premium service levels, selling scales, and product assortment availability of specialty. Our recipe for growth is still in the very early innings, but we can see the benefits of our developing capabilities in the new customers we are winning and the progress that we're making in market share gains. Importantly, our first quarter results exceeded our 1.2 times market share growth target for fiscal 2022. More importantly, as the recipe for growth matures, the impact on our top-line growth will accelerate. As such, we remain committed to growing profitably,1.5 times the market, as we exit our fiscal 2024.  Topic 3 for today is an update on the state of the business. During our last earnings call, I highlighted the critical importance of staffing health due to the supply chain challenges that are well-documented across all industries, As covered on bullets on Slide 7, we have made progress throughout this quarter in improving our staffing levels. Our leadership team, top to bottom, has been extraordinarily focused on improving our staffing health. A good example of our efforts is the execution of our first ever nationwide hiring event in the second week of October. We leveraged extensive digital marketing and a streamlined hiring process to net more than 1,000 new supply chain associates to bolster our troops. When coupled with our year-to-date hiring success, we are making solid progress on increasing our throughput capacity. Additionally, during the quarter, we opened our first driver academy.  Our first academy class is in session, as we say at Sysco, and we are training our next-generation of Sysco drivers. We're bullish on expanding this program across the country in the coming year and we are confident it will make a meaningful difference in generating a solid driver pipeline. From a product availability perspective, although our fill rates still lag our historical standards, we were able to deliver a higher fill rates for customers than the industry average. We have strong relationships with our key suppliers and a merchant team that is extremely focused on finding and sourcing product substitutions. I've personally engaged with top suppliers to ensure solid partnership with Sysco and I'm cautiously optimistic that our suppliers performance will improve through the remainder of the year and into our fiscal 2023.  Supplier improvement will be a key to improving customer fill rate and customer satisfaction. Lastly, you may have seen the recent announcement regarding the Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health administrations requirements for employers with 100 or more employees. I'm pleased to inform you that Sysco began a weekly COVID testing regimen in September, and as such we are already compliant with the majority of the OSHA stated guidelines. The safety of our associates and our customers is our number 1 priority, and we remain steadfast in protecting our team. In summary, Sysco continues to lead the industry in how we are supporting our customers during this challenging supply chain environment.  Our Net Promoter Scores are outperforming the broad-line distribution industry and our ability to serve customers remains best-in-class. We remain the only national distributor without system-wide minimum orders, and we will endeavor to increase the flexibility and service that we provide our customers in the coming quarters in years. The impact of our relative supply chain success can be seen in our results. We sequentially increased sales throughout the quarter and expanded our market share capture. We now have more than ten consecutive months of gaining market share, and we are on track to deliver our stated goal for the year growing 1.2 times industry and our recipe for growth strategy will enable us to accelerate over the next three years and grow at 1.5 times the industry by the end of our fiscal year 2024.  I want to thank all of our associates for their tremendous hard work over the past quarter. As Sysco experienced unprecedented growth and supply chain challenges. We are winning in the marketplace and that would not have been possible without the dedication of our sales, logistics, and merchandising teams. I'm honored to serve these associates and work by their side. I will now turn it over to Aaron, who will provide additional details on our financial results for the quarter before we open it up for questions. Aaron, over to you.
Aaron Alt: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning. Our strong first quarter of fiscal 2022 financial headlines are growing demand with sales exceeding one fiscal 2019 by 8.2%. A profitable quarter exceeding our plans with EBITDA comparable to pre-COVID 2019 levels. Aggressive investment by Sysco against hiring the snap back allowing Sysco to lead the industry in otherwise turbulent times. Purposeful investments in working capital to continue to lead in product availability. A strong return to profitability by our international business, and great progress against our balanced capital allocation strategy, including continued investments against the 5 pillars of our recipe for growth, an upgrade to Triple B of our investment-grade rating by S&P. The elimination of all debt covenant restrictions on our ability to repurchase shares or increased our dividend in the future, and a decision that we are announcing today, namely that we have satisfied our internal criteria to commence share repurchase.  In the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we will begin our repurchase of up to $500 million of shares over the course of the fiscal year. During today's call, I'm going to cover the Income statement and cash flow for the quarter, and then I will close with some observations on our guidance for fiscal 2022. First quarter sales were $16.5 billion, an increase of 39.7% from the same quarter in fiscal 2021 and an 8.2% increase from the same quarter in fiscal 2019. In the U.S., sales for our largest segment, U.S. Food Service were up 46.5% versus the first quarter of fiscal 2021, and up 11.6% versus the same quarter in fiscal 2019. SYGMA was up 11.8% versus fiscal 2021, and up 5.1% versus the same quarter in fiscal 2019.  You will recall that in SYGMA the increase in sales in the quarter is more modest because of the purposeful transition out of an unprofitable customer, which we announced in our third quarter of fiscal 2021 earnings call and because during the quarter, some consumers are switching from their favorite QSR, drive up back to some of the excellent sit-down restaurants served by our more profitable U.S. Food service segment. Local case volume within a substantive USFS, our U.S. broadline operations, increased 23.8% while total case volume within U.S. broadline operations increased 28.1%. With respect to our international business, restrictions continue to ease across the International operations in the first quarter.  International sales were up 34% versus fiscal 2021, while also improving sequentially over prior quarters to down less than 1% versus fiscal 2019, indicating that we have more upside to come. Foreign exchange rates had a positive impact of 1.1% on Sysco's sales results. Inflation continued to be a factor during the quarter at approximately 13%. The good news is that we continue to manage our profitability well in the inflationary environment. Let me call a couple of numbers, and then we'll discuss inflation further. Gross profit for the enterprise was approximately $3 billion in the first quarter. Increasing 33.9% versus the same quarter in fiscal 2021, and also exceeding gross profit in fiscal 2019 by 2%. The increase in gross profit was driven by year-over-year improvements in volume versus fiscal 2021, and compared to both fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2019, increases in gross profit dollars per case across all 4 of our reporting segments.  That's a real sign a health in our business. [Indiscernible] is gross profit dollars that count, inflation did impact our gross margin rates for the enterprise during the quarter as a decreased 79 basis points versus the same period of Fiscal 2021, and finished at a rate of 18.1%. The rate was flat sequentially with Q4 of Fiscal 2021. The gross margin decline versus the prior year was driven by accelerating inflation and margin changes at our higher-margin U.S. businesses, with the larger U.S. [Indiscernible] businesses growing volume at lower margin rates. We continue to manage the inflationary pressures with both our suppliers and our customers, and thus far have not seen much push back on our ability to pass along pricing. In addition, the fact that we are now substantially complete in our rollout of our Periscope pricing system means that we have more tools than ever before to manage our profitability while being right on price.  Turning back to the enterprise, adjusted operating expense came in at $2.3 billion with expense increases from the prior year, driven by 3 things. First, the variable costs associated with significantly increased volumes. Second, more than $57 million of one-time and short-term transitory expenses associated with the snapback, and third, more than $24 million of operating expense investments for our recipe for growth. Together, the snap back in investments and the transformation costs total approximately $81 million of operating expense this quarter and negatively impacted our adjusted EPS by $0.12. Even with those significant snap back in transformation, operating expense investments, we leveraged our adjusted operating expense structure in delivery expense as a percentage of sales of 13.9% and almost 200 basis point improvement from fiscal 2021 into 64 basis improvement from the same quarter in fiscal 2019.  Doing the simple math, if we removed the transitory snap back investments and the transformation investments I referenced earlier, total OpEx would have been at 13.4% of sales. That is a real [Indiscernible] of the power of our earlier cost-out efforts. To repeat what we said before, during fiscal 2022, our cost-out helps us to cover snap back and transformation costs. Finally, for the first fiscal quarter adjusted operating income increased $320 million from last year to $685 million, putting us basically on par with adjusted operating income for fiscal 2019. Even with the snap back investments and the transformation investments. This was primarily driven by a 58% improvement in U.S. food service and strong profitability from international. Adjusted earnings per share increased $0.49 to $0.83 for the first quarter.  Perhaps pointing out the obvious, if we extract the $51 million of incremental interest expense, we're carrying in Q1 of fiscal 2022, resulting from the COVID related precautionary bonds we issued in 2020, our adjusted EPS results for Q1 of fiscal 2022 would have been more in line with our pre-COVID adjusted EPS results for Q1 of fiscal 2019. If you go a step further and exclude both the Interest expense and the $81 million of snapback and transformation costs you really begin to see why we believe that in the long-term, Sysco has significant earnings potential. But let me share a couple of comments on cash flow and the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $111 million during the first quarter.  As we responded to rising sales and purposely invested in inventory in support of management product availability during the snapback, better than the industry. We also purposefully invested in longer lead inventory to support customers such as k-12 schools and healthcare facilities during the snapback, consistent with Sysco's purpose statement. We also saw manageable changes in receivables levels that we expected to acCompany rising sales and arising from the mix of business and Sysco execute its recipe for growth. Our net CapEX spend was $79.4 million and is ramping up. As teams submit business cases for investments against the recipe for growth. We will manage those investments over the course of our 3-year plan to ensure our growth. Free cash flow for the first quarter was $31 million.  At the end of the first quarter after our investments in the business, payments on the acquisition price for Greco and our dividend payment, we had $2.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents on hand. In May, we committed to supporting a strong investment grade credit rating with a targeted net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio of 2.5 times to 2.75 times, which we continue to expect to hit by the end of fiscal 2022. Later this year, we plan to pay off the $450 million of notes due in June of 2022 and May should the circumstances warrant it, take further action against our debt portfolio. S&P recently acknowledged the progress against our leverage ratio by upgrading us to Triple B flat. We also paid our increased dividend of $0.47 per share in July and again in October.  Given that we paid our increased dividend starting in July, consistent with our status as a dividend aristocrat, we expect to next address decisions around our dividend per share sometime during calendar year 2022. As I mentioned earlier, we plan to commence share repurchase activity under the $5 billion share repurchase authority we announced in May at Investor Day, beginning in the second quarter. As I stated a moment ago, that will take the form of the repurchase of up to $500 million of shares by the end of the fiscal year. That concludes my prepared remarks on the fiscal first quarter. Now before closing, I would like to provide you with some commentary on the outlook for fiscal 2022. As Kevin highlighted, we expect to continue to grow at or above 1.2 times the market in fiscal 2022. We are operating in a dynamic environment with significant inflation.  While we do expect inflation to moderate by the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2022, it may take longer to taper than originally anticipated, though it is hard to predict. We expect to pass through the vast majority of our costs' inflation. We are assuming continued heavy step back and transformation investments in Q2, at levels at least equal to the investments in Q1. We're reaffirming our EPS guidance for the year. Fiscal 2022 EPS will be in the range of $3.33 to $3.53 reflecting the $0.10 increase that we called out last quarter. As always, our EPS guidance does not assume changes to the federal tax rates. All-in-all, we have confidence for the rest of the year. In summary, we've had solid quarter and the fundamentals of our business remain strong. We are excited about the future as we continue to advance Sysco's recipe for growth. Operator, we're now ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Mark Carden of UBS.
Mark Carden: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. It sounds like you've made some good progress on reaching your hiring targets, which is great to hear. One of your competitors recently noted that it started implementing some more base pay raises. Without necessarily commenting on that competitor, is this some alignment that we've been seeing in the broader environment? Could we be seeing some more structural pressures here? Thanks.
Kevin Hourican: Morning, Mark, it's Kevin. I'll start with answering your question. This macro just where things are from. A staffing health perspective. They said in the prepared remarks; We've made a lot of progress in the quarter. We are definitely leading the industry from a health of staffing perspective and health of a supply chain, which is what's enabling us to win market share, and what I would say is that the situation steadily improved through the quarter. August, I would submit was probably our toughest spot of the calendar year from a staffing perspective as our volume was really recovering and our staffing needs were most significant. In September, 23 states opened up the government supplemental benefits were retired and we did see an increase in applicant flow. We actually weren't anticipating that because our base pay wages are well above the $15 per hour break even component.  Our selectors get paid in the mid-20s, our drivers get paid in the mid-30s. We weren't expecting improvement tied to that, but we did experience an improvement in September tied to the retiring of those benefits. Most notably or even more importantly, we've gotten a lot better at recruiting, hiring, and training of our staff. We're really pleased with the efforts to digitize our marketing efforts tied to our open jobs. We've streamlined the hiring process, and as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we conducted our first ever nationwide at every single states in the country hiring event and netted over a 1000 people joining our team in just 1 week alone, which will see a big progress for us. We're doing really well from a recruitment perspective. To answer your question specifically, as I said on my remarks, we have not had to resort to quote-unquote, meaningful base pay change.  The vast majority of the expenses that we are putting forth are what we call transitory or two-way doors; you can go through, you can turn around, you can come back. So what does that mean? Hiring bonuses, retention bonuses, referral bonuses, advertising. We are spending money on places like Facebook to advertise the awareness in creation of visibility to these jobs. Aaron called out those expenditures will continue into Q2 and then we will have the opportunity to begin to taper some of those investments because they are transitory. We've had selected locations, a very small number of them that we did a wage review and needed to make some adjustments, but that was not meaningful or material for Sysco. Aaron wants to add something. [Indiscernible]
Aaron Alt: One quick add, which is as Kevin called out, the vast majority of our Q1 and ultimately Q2 snapback costs are transitory, and we have the opportunity to cover the rest through further productivity efforts that we already have underway.
Mark Carden: Awesome. That's great. How do you guys think your fill rate currently compares to the broader industry? Presumably, you're still stronger than most, but any changes in the gap here? Thanks.
Kevin Hourican: Mark, thanks for the follow-up. So we use external reporting and internal reporting through net promoter score to gauge our full rate and how it's trending. Ours has been improving over the last quarter, our merchant team has been working extremely hard for items that have what we call long-term out situations to find alternatives, find new suppliers, find alternative products that we can submit and suggest to our customers, provide those customers with suggestions on how to get those items cut into their menus, etc. Our team has worked harder than ever before on ensuring we can improve our rates. The answer to your question is yes, our performance is stronger than the industry, and yes, that gap widened in the quarter. We believe it's one of the components of our market share capture, but it's not the only reason. It's three reasons which are throughput capacity is higher because of the staffing health. Yes our fill rate is stronger. The third though, is our sales teams are just doing an extraordinarily good job of being out in the market, acquiring new customers and winning more share of wallet with existing customers.
Mark Carden: All right, thanks so much and good luck.
Kevin Hourican: Thanks Mark.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Slagle of Jefferies.
Alex Slagle: Hey, good morning. I may have missed something, but the local case growth on a 2-year basis versus '19 seem to decelerate more sequentially into the fiscal first quarter than the U.S. broadline trend even as you adjust for the tougher comparison. Wonder if we could discuss the dynamics you observed during the quarter where the local case momentum they had dragged a bit more? If I'm reading that right.
Kevin Hourican: Our local business is performing really well, Alex. we're pleased with the progress that we're making. We continue to win new customers at the local level, partnering and supporting our existing local customers with menu expansion in the like. If it's a percent of total that you're referencing, We've had a lot of success winning net new business at the national level within the education sector and within the healthcare sector, and perhaps the percent of total component that you are seeing is actually fueled not because of deceleration in our local business. We accelerated our performance at the local level. It's the national sales and steamy business. We've just done extraordinarily well with winning new business and to be crystal clear, this isn't the guns or butter choice. One success at the national level does not hinder our ability over the long term to win at the local level. We're going to win at both national and local level, and again, our staffing, health and supply chain strength is what's enabling us to be able to do that.
Alex Slagle: That makes sense, and then if you could offer any color into the underlying trends in the various segments into October and just some thoughts on potential for that progress relative to '19 but moderate as we get into the holiday period. Just some tougher compares obviously, and in many ways can you get up against that?
Kevin Hourican: Alex, thanks for the question. I'll start with the headline, which is as you saw on our chart, October was continuation of acceleration of our total performance. So each month of our Q1 accelerated in October continued that strength and that's despite the presence of the Delta variant during the quarter. So we're really pleased to be top-line, strong, compelling, continued growth fueled by a recovering market, but even more fueled by our market share capture. As I said in my prepared remarks, we're growing at more than 1.2 times the market, which is the highest rate of growth at Sysco in more than 5 years. The sectors that are still constrained versus '19, that's the language that I would use. Travel and hospitality for sure, food service management international, as I called out on my prepared remarks, and there's some softness in healthcare vis-a-vis long-term care tied to COVID, which is new starts or new bed patients, as they call them, are constrained.  We're not concerned about health care for the long term. With the aging of America they call this over tsunami, we actually view healthcare as a growth opportunity for our Company for the longer term. We see the opposite of what you just said, Alex. We see our customers contacting us in the traveling industry, in business, in travel, and hospitality, excuse me, in business and industry sectors, gearing up for what they believe to be a January step-up in volume, and mostly that's driven by corporations that have been mostly working from home beginning the process of bringing their employees back to work in January. We do very well on that space partnering with food service management companies, and we're working right now to preposition inventory to be prepared from a staffing perspective. As far as rolling over tough comp compares for holiday season that that's not something we're concerned about. Aaron wants to say something. Aaron over to you.
Aaron Alt: I would just add, you should take great note of our announcement of our results for October and understand that we are accelerating across our portfolio and we have significant opportunity both in our fiscal Q2 and as Kevin called up particularly, into Q3 and Q4.
Alex Slagle: Great, thanks. Congrats.
Aaron Alt: Thanks, Alex.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly of Wells Fargo.
Edward Kelly: Hi, good morning, guys. Kevin I wanted to just revisit one thing that's been talked about a little bit here, but I know you've talked about your fill rates beating competitors, but it does sound like generally there's still some headwind here related to sort of inventory or even labor. Is it possible to quantify what you think is being left on the table associated with that, and then that gets into the second part of my question, which is, is it also possible to talk about where some of the segments are running versus 2019? And I ask all this because your case volume is still modestly below '19 in the U.S. which is obviously understandable. But I'm curious as to what all of this is saying about where your case volume can be. Let's call it by the end of this fiscal year or so or early next year, when life is obviously hopefully a lot more normal. So any color that you could add there would be super helpful, I think.
Kevin Hourican: Morning, Ed. Thank you for the questions. Kevin. I'll start with fill rates. My language that are used in prepared remarks is we're performing better than the industry average, and that is the most accurate descriptor of our performance. We are below our historical fill rate standards. We set a very high bar for ourselves on ship on time and ship in full, and we are below our historical standards. The why is our inbound fill rate from our suppliers to us is well below our historical standards. Our output to our customers is actually significantly higher than the inbound fill rate to Sysco, and the how and why behind that, is the work we do to find substitutes to bridge customers to alternative products, and that's what's creating the relative strength of Sysco versus others, is the good work our merchant teams are doing to find product substitutions. I think your question is more like, is there even more sales to be had for fill rates improve? I would say, yes. How long it will take for fill rate to improve is subject for debate.  So what we're doing, because we want to take ownership of what we can directly control is to be even better at managing fill rate. So we're improving our website to provide dynamic visibility to out-of-stocks and provide suggestions at point-of-sale to the customer on things that can be bought alternatively, and our sales teams and merchandising teams, when we find ourselves as I mentioned earlier, in a situation of long-term outs are being very proactive, providing quick selling bulletins to our sales teams, digital marketing pushes to our customers, including emails on suggesting to them alternatives in the likes. It's a core strength of our Company. I meaningfully desire for the inbound fill rate to Sysco to improve are working very closely with our suppliers on that, and we think it will improve, but not quickly.  It's going to be a sequential steady slow improvement in fill rate into our fiscal 2023. As it relates to volume in the second part of your question, what I would say is we expect that the end of our fiscal Q3 to be back to 2019 from a volume perspective and we have the segments that will be at that level in Q2 of this fiscal year. Within our existing fiscal year, we will be back to 2019 volume levels. I'm not going to break it down by sector, it's not something I'm prepared to do this morning. But go ahead, please back to you.
Edward Kelly: Yeah. I got it, and when you say fiscal Q3, is that total Company volume or is that U.S. per outlines volume?
Kevin Hourican: Total Company. All Sysco combined at the end of our Q3 will be at 2019 volume levels.
Edward Kelly: Great, and then just a quick follow-up for Aaron, I guess. Can you provide any additional color on fiscal second quarter? Historically, you have a little bit of a seasonal step back versus Q1. Just kind of curious as if we're going to see that again here. I look at consensus number; it's not far off of what you just reported for Q2. Any incremental thoughts there?
Aaron Alt: I would offer 2 thoughts, which is we are enthusiastic about the continued positive trends we're seeing in the top line as we move into what historically pre-COVID may have been a seasonal period. But this year is like no other in that respect. But also then mitigated somewhat by the call out around the fact that we do continue to expect to invest heavily against snap back and the transformation in the second quarter. For us, we have confidence in the year. We have come to the long term, and we are quite excited about the progress the operational teams are making in service of fiscal '22 in Q1 and certainly in Q2.
Edward Kelly: Great. Thank you.
Kevin Hourican: Thank you, Ed.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Partners.
John Heinbockel: Hey, guys, let me start with you've had a nice pick up, your performance versus the industry since the second half of last or rather, I think you're probably up in 20 or 25?debt state?. Where is that coming from predominantly? New versus existing accounts, pieces per stop, lines per stop. What are the 1 or 2 biggest drivers in that acceleration in share gains?
Kevin Hourican: Good morning, John. This is Kevin. The predominant reason for the market share capture is net new customers serve at Sysco both at the national and local level. So we're winning more new business than at any other point in time in Company history. The why breaks down to 2 pretty fundamentally basic things. First is the compensation model that we changed as you know, June of last year. We're now compensating our associates to be more prospecting versus cultivating, and that is paying dividends. So they drive the behaviors that we expect and we're seeing significant benefit in dividend from rewarding those associates for the good work they're doing in winning new business. The second reason is the supply chain health. We have customers almost on a daily basis, large and small coming to us, and asking for Sysco to take on their business. I won't name the State but we had a very large education customer come to us this week actually and say, we're not getting the support we need and can Sysco take on our business and we're finalizing the details of the contract which is why I'm not going to quote the where, but we expect that business to come on board by January 1.  So that is a signal of our strength, the confidence that large and small customers have in our ability to ship on time in full, at rates greater than the market. Jon, specifically what competitors segment that's coming from, I think it's all the above. But stronger players with broader access to inventory, clearly performing well. Back to prove that point, we have more inventory on-hand at this moment in time than we did pre-COVID. So are there select product shortages? Yes. But we've been able to invest in inventory. We have more inventory on hand than pre-COVID and our staffing levels are where we need them to be but every time we bring on more people our demand increases and then we have to go hire even more people, which is proving that there's continued runway, this was Aaron's point a moment ago, on our ability to grow our topline. As we continue to make progress on our staffing in through put capacity. John, back to you for any follow-up.
John Heinbockel: Maybe second question, right? If you think about lookout to '24, '25, take a longer-term view, are you more confident in gross margin being better than it's been historically or that the cost structure of the business will be less in light of a lot of the macro dynamics we're seeing today. Which one of those 2 is more likely to drive higher long-term profit margins?
Kevin Hourican: John, what we've articulated is we're really bullish on our EBIT margin expanding, that we will move that needle. I do not believe that that growth will come primarily from product margin expansion. It's going to come from continued disciplined expense optimization by taking structural cost out and investing in capabilities that drive the top line. So while the EBIT margin grows, as, A, the top line will be accelerating, B, we'll be taking structural cost out of the business, and those two levers in combination is what expands the EBIT margin. But sales growth and cost reductions; not for margin rate growth.  Aaron, I'll toss to you for any additional comments. I would just add in supporting Kevin's point that I am also excited by elements of our merchandising in our supply chain transformation, that over time, as we work through this very inflationary period, should provide us with opportunities, and particular, I'm excited with work that is underway in connection with Sysco's private label, brands and other elements that will be supportive of our overall financial profile. To answer your question, while the short-term certainly were challenged or it's lower than we would have hoped from a gross margin perspective because of the impact inflation over the longer-term, the '24, 'the 25 [Indiscernible]
John Heinbockel: Thank you.
Kevin Hourican: Thanks, John.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nicole Miller of Piper Sandler.
Nicole Miller: Thank you. Good morning. First question is around the centralized pricing tool. So intuitively, I think about pricing power and price going up. But you have a lot of commentary about taking market share with the pricing tool, which makes me think about the value proposition of maybe not price down but neutral. So how do you balance that tension?
Kevin Hourican: Nicole, it's a great question and you're right that my recent narrative of our pricing software has been about managing inflation. It's just because of the unprecedented environment that we're currently in, double-digit inflation is unique, and what the tools helping us in the current period is being very strategic and thoughtful about how to pass through that inflation in a responsible way, and being confident that when we make those decisions that they're executed well. We used to do that work manually through a large sales force, we can now do that through a strategic pricing office and when we make the decision it's executed immediately. Then we can monitor the impact of those decisions and update it on a daily basis if need be. So the reason for my narrative on inflation is just because of the environment we're in.  For the longer term, the goal of the pricing project is to be a pricing system, excuse me, is to move to a strategic price optimization. I'm not going to name the category because I don't want to telegraph it, but we've got select categories where we are above-market from a pricing perspective, we make decent, very high-quality margins and we're going to run price optimization tests. If we lower slightly our prices in that category. Does the sales growth more than offset the margin dilution? With a pricing software, you can do test versus control geography-based tests to optimize for the right price and how I've described that work is the following.  We will make investments in certain items that are key value items, KVIs, and we will raise prices nominally in the tail of the inventory SKU, which is less visible to the customers, which therefore results in flattish margin rates by growing top line as my term is, right unpriced at the item customer level, which allows us to win more market shares. That's the longer-term goal of the projects. However, this system has been extremely useful during this early part of our fiscal 2022 and how we manage inflation.
Nicole Miller: That's very helpful. Thank you. Second and final question, it's very helpful to understand the hiring and that some of that is coming back, but I am wondering about the underlying turnover thinking that could be a leading indicator. Could you speak to how turnover is trending, both like at the distribution facilities and for drivers as well.
Kevin Hourican: Yeah, retention is extraordinarily important to our staffing health, and during the first quarter of this fiscal year, we were extremely focused on hiring because, again, the winning of the new business that we've been able to post over the last 2 years requires us to continue to increase our throughput capacity. We are spending an extensive amount of time on improving retention. Retention is lower than historical run rate averages, to answer your question, but it's getting better as we are putting even more focus on retention. The most important population for us is our driver population. I's a highly skilled job. It's our customer facing role, and one of the investments that we've made Aaron and I together is in a driver retention bonus. We paid it in Q1, we're going to pay it again in Q2 and that retention bonus for our drivers is working. It had a noticeable and visible positive impact on retention, and that's the type of investment that I referred to as a transitory type investment.  We will do that investment for as long as it takes, but we do expect as we improve our overall staffing health, that the need for those types of investments will go down, and here's why, overtime rates are running very high currently at Sysco versus our historical standards. I called that out in my prepared remarks. Over time is actually the thing that drives our retention down. If we're spending or excuse me, providing our associates too much overtime daily. We're working extremely aggressively to boost our staffing troops, such that we can have overtime back to historical standards and that will improve retention. It also Improving the P&L because overtime rates are pretty punitive to the overall P&L, and I called that out in my prepared remarks where I said our second half of this fiscal year, we should expect to see improvements in overtime, reductions in some of the transitory expenses that I stated, which will help the P&L. Aaron, to you for any further comments?
Aaron Alt: I have nothing further to add.
Kevin Hourican: Thank you, Nicole.
Nicole Miller: Thank you. Thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of John Glass of Morgan Stanley.
John Glass: Thanks very much. Just, first, back on gross margin. I understand your comments about gross margin, dollar s per case or gross margins per case or higher. Do you see demand restructuring that within certain categories that maybe factoring gross margin prices are too high. So your consumers or your customers are switching?
Kevin Hourican: So far, no.
John Glass: Thank you, and Kevin, you open the door on loyalty and I know you want to talk about it in the future, but how do you think about loyalty in this business? Is it akin to what a consumer loyalty program is or is this more nuance? Is it more about adding value-added services versus discount? How would loyalty work in this industry do you think, at a high level?
Kevin Hourican: We've proven that a mom-and-pop independent restaurant operate similar to a consumer and retail, they decide based on value, they decide based on price, they decide based on services that you mentioned a moment ago. The value in the unlock of the loyalty program that we're building is making that customer specific what the offers are to them and making it indelibly clear to them the value that's being brought to them by Sysco. We're going to talk about more in the future because it's in pilot, as we speak, and we'd like to have actual factual results before we talk about things publicly. We're very pleased with the initial progress steps forward in our loyalty program.  We are building the data and the plumbing from an IT perspective to execute against that effort nationwide and we are piloting it currently in select geographies and we will refine it, optimize it, iterated, but it will be similar to the types of loyalty programs that you're familiar with as a customer. The data is in the cloud, we're able to use machine learning to optimize against the data, and yes, there are value-added services that we will provide for those customers that are part of the program, that they will be able to take advantage of to improve their business results and outcome. So we're excited about it, we're bullish on it, and we'll talk more about it in future quarters.
John Glass: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Lauren Silberman of Credit Suisse.
Lauren Silberman: Thanks for the question. First on capital allocation, you announced plans to resume share repurchases and I think up to $500 million for the year. Can you just talk about your capital allocation priorities and how we should be thinking about the use of cash from here?
Aaron Alt: Sure, happy to do so. We are remaining loyal to the capital allocation strategy we called out at our Investor Day in May, which is our first focus is on driving the growth. Getting to the 1.2 and 1.5 times market growth, and so our first use of cash is to invest in the business either organically or inorganically, as you recently saw with Greco and a couple of the other small fields that Kevin called out. Once we've invested against the business for the business cases that are in front of us. We're also very focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet and the actions we took, particularly at the end of last year, it certainly facilitated that, and we're feeling good about the strong balance sheet that we have and the recent upgrade of the rating by S&P. We have continued opportunities to improve that, of course, given the interest levels we're carrying versus prior years.  But we're feeling good about our capital allocation against our debt portfolio so far, and that leaves us with the return of capital shareholders. We increased our dividend as, as you heard me call out, we've now paid that twice, we'll touch it again during calendar 2022, and with the benefit of cash on-hand, we decided it was time to start returning capital to shareholders as well and our first step there is the announcement of the $500 million share repurchase beginning this quarter. So all in, very consistent with what we had telegraphed we were going to do at Investor Day and that's how we continue to manage the recipe for growth.
Kevin Hourican: I think Aaron described it very well. I think the punch line is we're ahead of schedule on that activity, which is why Aaron updated our guidance on when we would begin to stock buyback to this quarter.
Lauren Silberman: Great. Thanks, and if I could just do a follow-up on that transitory nature of the elevated costs. Can you talk about what gives you the confidence that OpEx expenses and some of those investments can taper in the back half of the year, is it primarily reflecting expectations that staffing levels are closer to target and then within those incremental investments, snapback or transformation that what do you see as more transitory versus permanent? Can you expand on any of your initiative?
Kevin Hourican: Happy to. Let me give you some visibility to what's in our bucket of step back, and it is things like retention programs, hiring bonuses, sign-on bonuses, the incremental recruiting support for the massive hiring we're doing right now. The incremental marketing third party contractors we're bringing into help on a temporary basis relative to staffing. Those things are transitory onetime while Q1, Q2, but are not permanent cost structures. What's not in there for instance, is increased overtime costs. That's not one time, but we also have the opportunity to bring it down over time and are actively working that. So now you have a sense of what's in the bucket. Why do I have confidence that we can address it over time.  It's two-fold, first is we got started early relative to cost-down efforts, and so to a degree we put some money in the bank, in advance of need, and that effort will continue as we carry forward. Second element, as you heard Kevin and I alluded to this earlier, the benefit of all the investment we're doing against our supply chain transformation is incremental productivity which helps us to manage the overall cost structure as we carry forward, and finally, if I can add one, which is just the nature of the categories I called out, they are by definition onetime or transitory.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein of Barclays.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much. I have two questions. The first with the follow-on and it's been mentioned a few times, the sales momentum in the market share gains, which are ahead of the 1.2 times in the fiscal first quarter that you were targeting for the full year. It's harder, I guess to assess from the outside. So I'm just wondering, how do you arrive at success on that front? Maybe you can share what you believe the industry growth is. I know some of your peers large and even small often make similar claims to growing faster than the industry. Just trying to gauge how you're able to assess that maybe what the industry's growing relative to yours in the first quarter, if we should expect that type of commentary going forward on future quarterly calls?
Kevin Hourican: Yeah, Jeff. The 1.2 statement is specifically tied to Technomic's data. We get that data from them once per quarter and that is a data point that I can only report upon once per quarter as a result of that. We can see on a weekly, monthly-basis our relative growth. We can generally see the markets relative growth through other sources of data, but once per quarter we get the legitimate data feed from Technomic and that is where that data comes from.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Understood, and then the follow-up is just on the pricing in the margin percentage down, but the dollar is up, which I guess is what's important here, and I know you mentioned the ability to pass along inflation to customers, which I think it has historically been the big benefit in the drawer for investors to food service distribution and obviously with inflation right now, even more attractive. Just wondering your confidence and the ability to continue to pass through. I think there was some mention of maybe not much pushback, but wondering where the pushback is accelerating or you'd expected it to accelerate if the inflation is going to remain in the double-digits or whether you're really confident in the ability to pass it on for however long the inflation lasts. Thank you.
Kevin Hourican: Jeffrey, the punch line is we are confident that we can pass on the inflation. However, an editorial comment and then I'm going to provide some color comments. We don't think that double-digit inflation in perpetuity is good for the industry. It's not something we desire, it's not something we accept, and we're working very aggressively to push back on cost increases, find alternative suppliers, find alternative items that can lower the net landing cost for our customers, and we do believe that inflation will begin tapering. It's just going to take longer to begin tapering than what we originally expected back at the beginning of the year, which Aaron talked about accurately and clearly during his narrative. But with that said, we are not experiencing push back from our customers.  The primary reason is end consumers aren't slowing down in their consumption of food away from home, in fact the opposite is true. We continue to see sequential improvement in our overall results tied to volume growth, and also obviously inflation at high levels, just to call out with their specificity. What we do with our customers, we have built a proprietary inflation tool calculator where we can take a inbound raw material to us that is significantly elevated from a cost perspective, and we can highlight for our customers what items on their menu are directly impacted by that inflationary item to then suggest to them that type of menu price changes that they should make, and that's what we mean with things like Value-Added Services, and I'm not talking about an obvious thing like meat and poultry, and talk about things like fats, shortenings, and oils are highly inflationary right now, and there are many different products on a menu that are impacted by particular raw ingredient costs increase.  Our sales reps have been trained and equipped to be able to work with our end customers to educate them that this raw materials is increased. Here's our suggesting to you on what you can do with your menu price, and it's for that reason that our customers aren't pushing back to the degree that you might suspect externally because they view us as a partner and that's what we are. We're partnering with them to help them be successful and profitable and the good news for this industry is that the end consumer has remained robust and strong. Jeff, back to you for any further comments.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Very thorough. Thanks very much.
Kevin Hourican: Okay. Thanks, Jeff. Have a good day.
Operator: Our last question comes from the line of Kelly Bania of BMO Capital.
Kelly Bania: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking our questions. I just wanted to go back to the discussion of case volume, particularly versus 2019. Where exactly was that for the quarter, focusing on U.S. broadline, and within that, can you share any detail on the volume versus 19 for those core restaurant customers versus the non-restaurant hospitality business and industry segments?
Aaron Alt: Good morning Kelly, it's Aaron. We're getting into an area that we don't typically disclose at that level of detail. I guess what I would offer up to you is that as Kevin either alluded to or said out loud, we're not yet back to fiscal '19 levels within the enterprise or the U.S. business, but quickly approaching it, and as we get into the back-half of our year, starting in the U.S. or North America, then broadly beyond that. We do have confidence that the Enterprise will be returning to positive volume leverage across the portfolio. Now, there will be some mix of that. We're talking aggregated numbers. We're not calling out. We are one country, or one class of customer to that respect. But in aggregate, we have confidence with the volume trends based on what we've seen so far, what we saw in October, and how we expect this to carry out over the year.
Kevin Hourican: This is Kevin, just to bolster. We're not breaking it down by segment. We've been clear which segments remain behind. We have Travel and Hospitality, Business and Industry as two notable examples that from a volume perspective, remain down versus 19 levels. The good news is there's obviously significant offsets in strength within our restaurant sector, specifically, independent local sector, which is our most profitable sector. So ultimately that's the ultimate positive strength here is that the restaurant in volume is the core strength at this point in time, and as Aaron said, the enterprise level will be at 19 levels by end of Q3.
Kelly Bania: Okay. That's helpful, and just wanted to also follow up on the comment that you've talked about for several quarters now with the 10% new local independent customers. Can you provide just an update on the penetration or share of wallet with these accounts and how that's progressing and the trajectory from here that you're expecting.
Kevin Hourican: Yeah, thank you. John asked a question earlier, which are the primary drivers of the growth. Share of wallet has been steadily improving, but it has not been the primary source of the growth. The primary source of the growth has been net new customer wins, Kelly, over the last, let's call it, two years. I believe that we'll pivot in the future where the personalization work, pricing work we're doing, the work we're going to do on the loyalty program that I alluded to earlier. We will pivot to more of the growth coming from increased share of wallet, and mathematically, it's why we are confident that we will go from the 1.2 times market growth that we're currently delivering to the 1.5 times growth which will be the growth target we have for the third year of our 3-year strategy that we call the recipe for growth. So the percent contribution of the growth will pivot more towards share of wallet in the coming fiscal years.

 At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Kevin Hourican. 
Kevin Hourican: Thank you, Neil. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. I'm pleased to report that Sysco had a strong fourth quarter to close out a fiscal year unlike any other in our company's history. I'm proud of our team for their hard work, the results we delivered and the unrelenting support that we have provided to our customers.
 I'll start my comments today with a few key points about the quarter. First, our business recovery is stronger than anticipated in the U.S., and the recovery is taking hold in our international markets. Our sales growth exceeded our internal projections and has continued to accelerate into our Q1 of fiscal 2022. Second, our profitability for the quarter was stronger than anticipated, driven by the aforementioned strong sales and disciplined expense management. Third, our strong results drove improved cash performance, exceeding the cash flow guidance that Aaron provided in our last earnings call, which allowed us to pay down more debt than originally planned. Fourth, we made meaningful progress in advancing our Recipe for Growth strategy. I will highlight our progress on select initiatives during our call today.
 Sysco's results for the fourth quarter reflect the strength of the overall market recovery, Sysco's ability to win new business and some early wins coming from our Recipe for Growth. Sysco's sales for the quarter across all of our businesses were up 82% versus 2020 and up 4.3% versus 2019. Our sales results in our U.S. business were up 7.7% versus 2019. Sales results in June benefited from accelerating inflation, which Aaron will discuss in detail.
 The restaurant sector of our business is near full recovery with local sales and cases shipped up versus 2019 volume levels. The volume recovery has happened much faster than the industry predicted despite the presence of the Delta variant. The U.S. foodservice industry in total is now within 5% of 2019 levels. As you can see on Slide 7 in our presentation, according to SafeGraph data, foot traffic is up in restaurants since March and continues to be up more than foot traffic in grocery stores. Most notably, Sysco increased market share in a rapidly expanding market. These 2 factors of a rapidly expanding market and Sysco's gaining of market share resulted in a strong sales quarter. We anticipate that these trends will accelerate further in fiscal 2022.
 Consumer spending power, as featured on Slide 8, is robust and strong. The key message is that food away from home is not permanently impaired. It is vibrant. It is healthy. Sysco is best positioned to support the rapidly increasing demand due to our balance sheet, our large physical footprint and our substantial human capital investment in salespeople and in supply chain resources.
 The momentum shown in the fourth quarter has continued in the first period of fiscal 2022 where our July results have further accelerated. We see a sequentially improving market as additional sectors of recovery kick in: international, specialty, schools and colleges, business office cafeterias, just to name a few. There is ample additional recovery beyond the robust business we are currently experiencing with restaurant partners.
 Sysco's success can be directly attributed to the proactive steps we took to be ahead of the COVID business recovery. The Net Promoter Score of our delivery operations continues to lead the industry. With that said, we are working aggressively to increase staffing levels across our operations so that we can maintain our leading service position and win additional net new business. The distributors that can ship on time and in full at this critical period have an opportunity to take market share for both the short and the long term.
 One proof point of this success is demand of net new national account wins since the onset of the pandemic. During the fourth quarter, we won another $200 million of business with national customers, bringing the cumulative total to $2 billion of net new wins since March of 2020. While we don't plan to report on this number moving forward as we transition to a more normalized financial reporting cadence, it is a strong indicator of our capabilities as the industry leader to gain share during a period of disruption.
 As you can see on Page #12 of our slides, in addition to the large national account wins we have delivered, we have grown our local customer count by about 10%, which is a pace of 2.5x greater than the broadline industry. In June, we increased our market share by 60 basis points and posted our sixth consecutive month of market share gains. Our sales force is very motivated to win. Our supply chain continues to lead the industry from a service perspective despite the substantial hiring challenges, and our Recipe for Growth strategy is beginning to benefit the business and our customers. Our top line results during the quarter were positively influenced by higher-than-normal inflation. During the fourth quarter, our inflation rate was approximately 9.6%. Aaron will discuss this in more detail in his prepared remarks. 
 Our performance in the non-restaurant sectors of our business trailed the success of restaurants for the quarter. With that said, we are beginning to see improvements in the travel, hospitality and FSM sectors of our business as restrictions ease, and leisure travel has commenced this summer. As businesses begin returning more to an office environment, we expect our FSM segment to further improve.
 Our international segment improved sequentially throughout the fourth quarter as restrictions on businesses began easing in late May and into June. Notably, our international segment broke even for the quarter, reflecting a $92 million profit improvement over the third quarter. The improvement displays the positive impact that increased sales and disciplined expense management will have on our international P&L. We expect to benefit significantly in fiscal 2022 from the improving international financial statements.
 I would like to take a few moments to provide an update on our Recipe for Growth transformation. Please see Slide 13 in our presentation. You will remember our introduction of the Recipe for Growth at our May 20 Investor Day. I will quickly provide an update on the main pillars of our growth strategy. 
 Digital. Our first pillar is to become a more digitally enabled company so that we can better serve our customers. We continue to see excellent utilization of our Sysco Shop platform by our customers, and we are enhancing the website with new features and benefits every month. Our pricing system is now live in over 25% of our regions, and we remain on track to complete the implementation by the end of this calendar year. Our personalization engine, which is currently under construction, remains on track, and initial manual tests of the capability with pilot customers are proving beneficial.
 Products and solutions. Our second pillar is to improve our merchandising and marketing solutions to grow our business. In this regard, our team is doing good work in developing improved merchandising strategies against specific cuisine segments. I'll speak more about the Greco acquisition in a moment and how that acquisition accelerates our efforts to better serve Italian customers.
 Supply chain. Growth pillar #3 is to develop and create a more nimble, accessible and productive supply chain. As I mentioned earlier, we are better positioned to support customers in their recovery as our supply chain network is better staffed than the industry at large. We remain the only national distributor with no order minimums for our customers at a time when competitors have been increasing their order minimums and select competitors are releasing customers who can't get those raised minimums. Lastly, our strategic projects to increase delivery frequency and enable omnichannel inventory fulfillment remains on track. 
 Customer teams. Our fourth growth pillar is to improve the effectiveness of our sales organization. As we have said many times, our sales consultants are our #1 strength. The Net Promoter Scores our associates receive is the best indication of their impact on our business. Meanwhile, our efforts to better leverage data to increase the yield of our sales process are paying dividends.
 Future horizons. Our final growth pillar is to explore and develop future horizons. This work has 2 major parts: assessing new business opportunities, including M&A; and becoming a more efficient company so that we can fund our growth. We are pleased to report that we will close on the Greco and Sons acquisition in the coming weeks. Greco's business is highly specialized in the Italian segment and brings net new capabilities and products that are accretive to Sysco. Sysco is excited to expand the Greco Italian specialty platform to new geographies across the U.S.
 As I mentioned, our future horizons work also includes our becoming a more efficient company so that we can fund our growth. We are making substantial investments in technology and infrastructure capabilities to strengthen the company. Our discipline across that work is funding those investments. We are on track to deliver $750 million of structural cost reductions, inclusive of what we delivered in fiscal 2021. Aaron will discuss this program in more detail in a few moments.
 As I stated at our Investor Day, the power of our Recipe for Growth comes from our ability to deliver all 5 of the growth elements that are displayed, not just from 1 key element. We believe only Sysco has the breadth, depth and expertise to leverage each of these 5 elements to better serve our customers.
 Before I wrap up my remarks this morning, I want to acknowledge the reality of the current operating environment. The food-away-from-home supply chain is under significant pressure. A robust customer demand environment is outpacing available supply in select categories. Our supplier partners are struggling with meeting the demand of Sysco's orders, and certain product categories remain in short supply. I'm confident that Sysco is performing better than the industry at large in delivering what we call customer bill rate, but we are performing below our historical performance standards. Our merchant teams are working closely with current suppliers, actively sourcing incremental supply from new suppliers, and we are working with our sales teams to offer product substitutions to our customers. This work is challenging, but we can execute this work better than others in this industry. I thank our suppliers for all they are doing to increase production, and I also thank our customers for their patience.
 In addition to the challenges we've experienced with product supply, the labor market has been challenging. We mentioned in a previous earnings call that we would hire over 6,000 associates in the second half of fiscal 2021. I am pleased to report that we have successfully achieved our hiring target, but we continue to have hiring needs as the business recovery is happening faster than we had modeled. It is a very tight labor market out there, and we are working extremely hard to ensure we can fill all of our warehouse and driver positions.
 While we are in decent shape nationally, we have hotspots around the country that present challenges. The product and labor shortage situation is undoubtedly putting some pressure on our cost to serve at this time. I would describe these incremental costs as mostly transitory as we are making responsible decisions on where and how to invest. I am confident we will see a return to a more balanced supply-and-demand equation in the future which will return inflation to more normal levels. I cannot predict the specific by when date on inflation normalization, but I am confident it will eventually normalize. In the meantime, we have robust sales results that are offsetting the margin rate pressure introduced by elevated inflation.
 In regards to labor costs, we are being very judicious to avoid creating a structural cost increase going forward. What that means specifically is that we are being very aggressive in adopting mostly temporary wage actions, like hiring bonuses, referral bonuses and even retention bonus programs, all of which can be leveraged extensively while the hiring process remains challenging and then reduced or eliminated as conditions improve. We intend to be responsible and judicious in structural increases to base pay that cannot be easily removed when the labor market improves. We will work aggressively to offset these cost increases in wage through improved productivity. 
 We are also taking aggressive actions to improve the labor market itself by investing in our future. I'm excited to announce today that we are investing in our first Sysco Driver Academy. The Driver Academy will enable us to recruit our own drivers and train them in the work we do at Sysco. We will be better able to source drivers from our own warehouse associate population and teach them to become drivers to this unique industry program. We will pay trainees to attend our academy, and we'll cover all of their licensing and certification fees. These associates will sign a contract to work for Sysco for an agreed-upon period of time. I am excited for what this Driving Academy will do for our recruitment pipeline, and I believe we are likely to expand the program nationally once we have worked through the learning curve of our first location.
 In summary, we had a strong fourth quarter that exceeded our sales and profit expectations. The results during the quarter sequentially accelerated, and they bode well for a successful fiscal 2022. During fiscal 2022, we expect to achieve growth at a rate of 1.2x the industry. That rate of growth is expected to accelerate across the 3 years of our long-range plan, and we intend to deliver 1.5x the market growth in fiscal 2024. We expect to expand our leadership position while we grow profitably, and we intend to return compelling value to our shareholders. I want to say thank you to all of our Sysco associates who continue to help our customers grow and succeed each day. The business recovery has presented challenges that our business associates have embraced head-on. I thank them for their commitment and their tireless work ethic that they have displayed during this labor-constrained environment. 
 I'll now turn the call over to Aaron Alt, who will discuss our financial results, along with some additional forward-looking details for the upcoming year. Aaron, over to you. 
Aaron Alt: Thank you, Kevin. Good morning. Our key fourth quarter fiscal 2021 headlines are strong demand; increasing sales; a profitable quarter, increasingly reminiscent of pre-COVID operations; and stronger cash flow than anticipated. Our fiscal fourth quarter results provide excellent proof points that consumers continue to seek relief from food-at-home fatigue, that the restaurant industry recovery is in full swing in the U.S. and that the international restaurant industry has the potential to come roaring back.
 During the fourth quarter, we did what we said we were going to do at Investor Day as we balance 5 financial priorities: early and tactical investments in labor and inventory to be better prepared than anyone else in the industry for the chaotic industry recovery; thoughtful strategic investments and capabilities and technologies to advance our Recipe for Growth over the long term; continued focus on our cost-out program to fund both the snapback costs and our growth agenda; accelerated reduction of our debt levels; and increased return of capital to shareholders.
 Today, I'm going to lead off with the income statement for the quarter, briefly discuss the cash flow and balance sheet, and then I will close with a positive update to our guidance for fiscal year 2022, which reflects the rapid acceleration of the recovery of our business and other factors. For full year results, I will refer you to our press release and our 10-K.
 As Kevin noted, fourth quarter sales were $16.1 billion, an increase of 82% from the same quarter in fiscal 2020 and a 4.3% increase from the same quarter in fiscal 2019. Please note that this year, our fiscal year had a 53rd week, which included 14 weeks in the fourth quarter as compared to only 13 weeks in the fourth quarter of each of fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019. That additional week was worth just under $1.2 billion in sales.
 Sales in U.S. Foodservice were up 88.4% versus the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and up 7.7% versus the same quarter in fiscal 2019. SYGMA was up 45.3% versus fiscal 2020 and up 20.9% versus the same quarter in fiscal 2019. For the quarter, local case volume within a subset of USFS, our U.S. Broadline operations, increased 74.3%, while total case volume within U.S. Broadline operations increased 71.4%. Given the interest in the recovery curve from COVID-19, today, we are disclosing that our July fiscal 2022 sales were also quite strong. Sales were more than $4.9 billion, an increase of 44.3% from the same period in fiscal 2021 and a 7% increase over the same period in fiscal 2019. 
 Kevin brought up the top of inflation. The headline is that inflation during the quarter was up 9.6% for total Sysco. Manufacturers passed inflation to us, and we successfully passed it on to our customers across categories and customer types. Let me call out a couple of numbers, and then we'll discuss our response to inflation further. 
 Gross profit for the enterprise was $2.9 billion in the fourth quarter, increasing 86.2% versus the same quarter in fiscal 2020. Most of the increase in gross profit was driven by year-over-year increases in sales; the 53rd week in fiscal 2021 worth about $208 million; and margin rate improvement at our largest business, USFS. 
 Gross margin as a percentage of sales during the quarter actually increased 41 basis points versus the same period in fiscal 2020 and finished at a rate of 18.1%. The gross margin increase was driven by business mix with the higher-margin U.S. Foodservice businesses growing alongside improvements in higher-margin countries in our international segment. Importantly, the enterprise margin rate improvement was also driven by 17 basis points of margin rate improvement in our largest business.
 Now I'm sure you think I'm calling out the obvious when I say that in an inflationary environment, what counts at the end of the day is the health of our dollar gross profit, that which we put in the bank. The good news for us is that in the U.S., as our sales have been rising, in part, due to inflation, our dollar profit per case has also been increasing. Notably, in the U.S., our dollar profit per case is higher now than it was in fiscal year '19.
 You may ask, "Why do we have confidence that we can protect gross profit dollars in the short term and rate over time?" The answer is that Sysco has some advantages. We have significant scale in purchasing, which is an asset which our suppliers will be hearing more about as we leverage the power of buying as One Sysco. In addition, the majority of our customer contracts contain cost escalation clauses. Finally, our merchandising transformation includes implementation of center-led pricing technology and other changes which allow us to navigate through the inflationary environment. No one tactic should be viewed in isolation, but the combination of our efforts arms us to deal with what we expect to be continued inflation in categories like poultry, beef, paper and disposables. That said, you can expect that we will be careful and tactical as we keep our eye on the real prize: execution against our Recipe for Growth. 
 Let's now turn to our international business. Restrictions started to visibly ease in key jurisdictions towards the end of the quarter. For the fourth quarter, international sales were up 83.4% versus fiscal 2020 but down 14.6% versus fiscal 2019. Foreign exchange rates had a positive impact of 2.9% on Sysco's sales results. What we see in our largest international markets gives us additional signs of confidence for fiscal 2022. Local consumers are eager to get back to normal. And importantly, with the playbook established and significant operational change behind us, we do not expect that the reimposition of additional COVID restrictions would, if it happened, have a severe of an impact on our business as was the case during the past year. Just like our efforts in the U.S., the international operations have been sourcing inventory and hiring staff aggressively to move up the recovery curve.
 Turning back to the enterprise. Adjusted operating expense increased 44.5% to $2.3 billion with increases driven by the variable costs that the company significantly increased volumes, onetime and short-term expenses associated with the snapback and investments against our Recipe for Growth. Our expense performance reflects the great progress we have made against our $350 million cost-out savings goal as well as the need to invest in both the current demand recovery and the long-term initiatives that Kevin mentioned earlier. In fact, we exceeded our $350 million cost-out goal during the full year.
 As we have highlighted in prior calls, the majority of the savings are coming from SG&A, but there are some savings from cost of goods sold as our teams continue to improve our capabilities to better optimize supplier relationships. Within operating expenses, key examples of the cost savings efforts are regionalizing first our Broadline operations, and most recently, our specialty produce operations. Other examples of areas where we achieved good cost savings would be indirect sourcing, technology cost savings and sourcing of freight contract costs.
 As I called out in Q3, we are investing heavily against the business, both in support of the snapback and in support of the transformation. During the fourth quarter, we estimate that we spent more than $36 million against the snapback, including incremental investments against recruiting, training, retention and maintenance. We also estimate that we spent more than $50 million against our transformation initiatives, such as our customer-centered growth, pricing, supply chain and technology strategic initiatives.
 Even with those significant investments, our adjusted operating expense as a percentage of sales improved to 14.3% from fiscal 2020 and moved to within 30 basis points of fiscal 2019's 14% as a percentage of sales for the fourth quarter. If we adjust out the purposeful snapback and transformation investments we are making as temporary, we can better see the savings as our OpEx as a percentage of sales would have been 13.8% on an adjusted basis.
 Here are a couple of points of emphasis for you. Part of the future horizon's component of our Recipe for Growth is achieving cost-out to fund the growth. We are leading with the cost-out before we make the investments. The savings are structural. We are not counting variable expense changes. Our statement's goals are owned by our entire executive leadership team. The savings are intended to increase over time. Recall that we raised our objective to $750 million with the incremental savings coming largely over the course of fiscal '23 through fiscal '24. Kevin and I must approve all new spend on our developing capabilities that offset these savings. Remember, it is these capabilities that are generating the market share gains of 1.2x to 1.5x through fiscal 2024. All in all, we view cost-out as a good news part of our long-term story.
 Finally, for the fourth quarter, adjusted operating income increased $639 million to $605 million for the quarter. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 20.2%. Adjusted earnings per share increased $1 to $0.71 for the fourth quarter. The primary difference between our GAAP EPS and our adjusted EPS was the impact of our debt tender premium payment. 
 As I noted at the start of my remarks, in the interest of time, I am not going to cover the full year results as part of my prepared remarks. The information is in our press release, and we are happy to take questions, of course. We are pleased with the improvement each quarter as our business has recovered from the onset of COVID over the course of the last year or so.
 Let me just wrap up the income statement by observing that for the year all-in, we delivered $1.02 of GAAP EPS and $1.44 of adjusted EPS. 
 Now a couple of comments on cash flow and the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter was $424 million. Net CapEx for the quarter was $180 million or 1.1% of sales, which was $79 million higher compared to the same quarter in the prior year. Free cash flow for the fourth quarter was $244 million, significantly above our anticipated free cash flow, even while we grew and maintained inventory at a level $400 million higher than Q4 fiscal '19.
 At the end of fiscal 2021, after our investments in the business, our significant reductions in debt and our dividend payments, we had $3 billion of cash and cash equivalents on hand. During the year, we generated positive cash flow from operations of $1.9 billion, offset by $412 million of net capital investment, resulting in positive free cash flow of $1.5 billion for the year. 
 As you know, at Investor Day, we articulated our debt paydown plans: $2.3 billion of deleveraging already accomplished during the fiscal year through May 2021; plans for an additional $1.5 billion of further debt reductions by the end of fiscal year '22. Because we have sized the headline on our Q4 tender offer to $1 billion, we are already tracking $150 million ahead of our debt repurchase commitments. 
 Lastly, we returned almost $1 billion of capital to shareholders in fiscal year '21 in the form of our quarterly dividends. We were pleased to announce at Investor Day a $0.02 per share increase to our dividend, on which we made the first payment in July. This brings our dividend to $1.88 per share for the full calendar year 2022 and enhances our track record of increasing our dividends and our status as a dividend aristocrat. That concludes my prepared remarks on the quarter and year-end results. 
 Now before closing, I would like to provide you with some updated guidance for fiscal year 2022. In May, I laid out our growth aspiration of growing at 1.2 to 1.5x the market. Also recall that we said, in fiscal year '22, we expected adjusted EPS of $3.23 to $3.43. We also called out that in fiscal year '24, we expect adjusted EPS of 30% more than our high points in fiscal year 2019, call it more than $4.65. Our projections and guidance were tied to the Technomic market projections as they existed at the time. Frankly, the speed of recovery of consumer demand has been nothing short of remarkable. We are seeing the positive impact broadly across our business. Sales are recovering more quickly than we or the market trend experts anticipated. That means that to hit our 1.2x market growth in fiscal year 2022, we have to grow faster, and we are. As a result, we are raising our sales expectations and now expect sales for the enterprise to exceed fiscal '19 sales by mid-single digits, adding roughly $2.5 billion to our top line guidance.
 Every segment of our business, other than our other segment and the FSM component of our USFS business, is now forecast to exceed fiscal '19 sales by the end of fiscal year '22. Inflation is more of a factor than we had anticipated for the first half of fiscal '22, and we expect it to continue into the first half of our new year. But our business is proving that it can pass along at least the increases necessary to preserve dollar per case profit. As a result, while margin rate may be weaker than originally expected in the first half of the fiscal year, we expect strong gross profit dollars growing with sales and are holding to our Investor Day guidance that gross margins will improve over fiscal '21 and move toward fiscal '19 levels for the full year. 
 Regarding the cost-out program, we are working it aggressively. We expect to invest most of the fiscal '22 savings into the snapback, including the transitory incremental costs that Kevin discussed earlier and important transformational initiatives. From a tax perspective, we expect our overall effective rate to be approximately 24% in fiscal 2022 as we are not assuming changes to federal tax rate in this guidance. And based on the early strength of the recovery that Kevin mentioned during his remarks, as impacted by inflation and our continued progress against managing through the snapback and investing for growth, we are increasing our guidance on adjusted EPS by $0.10 for fiscal year 2022 by moving the range up to $3.33 to $3.53.
 Now let's be clear, no one can forecast the unknown. The Delta variant is out there, and our updated guidance does not bake in a shutdown case. We are providing this guidance based on what we can see in our business right now, and we will follow with further updates, positive or negative, as the environment evolves around us, and we continue to execute against the transformation and the snapback.
 In addition, with rising sales comes an increase in operating cash flow. We continue to maintain the balanced capital allocation strategy that we highlighted at Investor Day. First, investing in our business for long-term growth and increasing our industry-leading position. Capital expenditures during fiscal 2022 are expected to be approximately 1.3% of sales, reflecting the increased sales levels. We continue to look for further sources of smart inorganic growth as we laid out at Investor Day. Second, we plan to maintain a strong balance sheet and expect to hit our announced net debt-to-EBITDA target during fiscal year '22. 
 And finally, recall that, in May, we announced the conditions to the initiation of share repurchase, resulting from the new $5 billion share repurchase authorization. Here they are: the market recovery must be robust. That is happening. The investments in the business must be fully funded, including M&A. We expect to have more than adequate capital for our planned investments. Our debt reduction must continue, and our investment-grade rating must be preserved. As I discussed, we are ahead of schedule on reductions of debt and expect to hit our leverage target toward the end of the year. Excess liquidity must exist to fund the repurchase program. It is early days, but with the accelerating recovery, we anticipate available cash to exceed our earlier forecast. Applying the criteria we announced in May, if business trends continue, then we will consider options to return more capital in fiscal '22. However, having said those words out loud, I want to be clear: Our decision tree is based on our balanced capital allocation strategy. 
 In summary, our performance over the past year has been strong, and the fundamentals of our business are solid as we look to the coming year. We are excited about the future as we kick off fiscal year 2022. Operator, we are now ready for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Nicole Miller with Piper Sandler. 
Nicole Regan: Two questions. I was going to ask you first to help us out on the industry overall. So if we think about some, I'll call it, purging of accounts, right, where you just can't get there, not saying Sysco is doing that, but just very broadly high level, I was wondering if you could talk about how material that is. Is it too early? I mean, it just seems reactionary, as like you said, July, the recovery is ongoing. And then where does that account go? I mean, does it go to another broadliner? Or do they head to cash and carry? 
Kevin Hourican: Nicole, this is Kevin. I'll take the question. So just to be clear, I said in my prepared remarks, we remain the only national distributor that does not have order minimums, and we have stayed true to that throughout this entire crisis, including during the COVID recovery. I communicated even more clearly in regards to that, that we remain in a better staffing and inventory position and the inventory at large, and that's been a huge positive for Sysco. Our July results, as we communicated on the call, continue the sequential momentum of increased sales and case performance, and we are not seeing a slowdown in our performance in the month of July. 
 I don't like commenting on what others are doing. I don't think that's my place. I think it is public knowledge that select distributors are, in fact, raising order minimums. And they are, in fact, deciding to not ship to select customers. Where that customer goes, it would be a combination of a distributor that has the availability to ship and cash and carry. Those would be the 2 places that the customer would go. 
Nicole Regan: Fair enough. And then just for your team specifically, on inflation, obviously material. Could you talk about some key commodities in terms of exit rate or real time? I'm thinking along the lines of poultry, pork, beef, and we're hearing maybe that moderating a bit. 
Kevin Hourican: Yes. We're not seeing a moderation in inflation. That is not something that is occurring in our book of business. Where it's coming from is pets, poultry, as you communicated, and pork, and that's consistent in the most recent period versus how we exited Q4. What we said in our prepared remarks is that inflation accelerated sequentially each month in quarter 4. I would say July has been flattish to the exit velocity of inflation from the month of June, and we've not seen a slowdown. 
 Now what I did say in my prepared remarks is I do anticipate inflation will eventually slow down. Supply will come back into harmony with demand. And when that occurs, the price inflation that we are experiencing, and then, therefore, we're partnering with our customers to pass it on, will begin to normalize, but it has not meaningfully begun to do so yet at this time. And I'll pass to Aaron for any additional comments that he wants to make. 
Aaron Alt: Thank you, Kevin. A couple of quick thoughts. First, a little -- modest inflation is not a bad thing in the industry, so long as we can pass it through, and we have proven in the last quarter that we expect to be able to pass it through. Kevin already called out that we were high single digits from an inflation perspective in Q4, really, across our categories, and we are forecasting that will continue certainly into Q1 of our new fiscal, if not the first half, and then moderate thereafter.
 It's also important to point out that we're dealing with a 2-year stack. Fiscal 2020 was actually modestly deflationary, and so we're reacting to that. And I just want to point out again that, given our scale, given the advantages we have, right, we have been successful and expect to be successful in passing through whatever inflation throws at us by commodity type as we carry forward. Thank you. 
Operator: And your next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. 
Jeffrey Bernstein: Great. Two questions. The first one, just looking at fiscal '22 more broadly. I know you mentioned the culmination of your earnings guidance bumped $0.10. Looks like that's effectively the 4Q beat. But otherwise, the commentary you made, the strong sales that's beating '19 levels and the solid management inflation and cost, I'm just wondering what kept you from raising that guidance seemingly more than the 4Q beat. I'm just wondering whether you're tempering expectations on thoughts that maybe things do slow down. I think you mentioned that you're anticipating the trends continue the way they are. So just wondering what are the headwinds that potentially or the push and pull that will potentially limit you from raising the guidance on fiscal '22 more than the 4Q beat? And then I had one follow-up. 
Aaron Alt: Sure. Well, let me respond to that great first question, and I would answer it this way. We believe in a cautious and pragmatic approach to our financial guidance to Wall Street. The practical reality is that there's a lot going on, right, with the continued COVID recovery as well as the significant transformation that Kevin is leading across Sysco. And so both, as we laid out during our Investor Day in May and now with this update 90 days later, we're taking a cautious and pragmatic approach to it. 
 Things that could change, of course, is the speed of the recovery curve, right? It could accelerate or moderate, right? We're taking the best view we've got in the business as we are today. Similarly, from a profitability perspective, we have talked about our significant cost-out objectives, balancing out the snapback costs as well as the investments we're making in the transformation. And so we believe that the guidance range we've provided today, the $3.33 and the $3.53, is a cautious and pragmatic update to the guidance we provided at Investor Day, and that's what we're going to go get done. 
Jeffrey Bernstein: Understood. And then the follow-up was just on the industry as we're hopefully in the later stages of the COVID pandemic. I know going in, there was excitement around a few things: one, further penetrating existing accounts, also adding new accounts and then adding growth via M&A. So I'm just wondering, Kevin, maybe your thoughts versus the start of COVID, whether you'd say there's any positive or negative surprises. I think you gave us some color around the $2 billion of adding new accounts, so that one seems pretty successful. But any thoughts around where you are for the penetrating existing accounts or adding growth via M&A would be great. 
Kevin Hourican: Jeff, thanks for the question. I'll just cover kind of the 3 sources of growth and just repeat a couple of key messages, add a little bit of additional commentary. Yes, from a national sales wins perspective, we posted an additional -- substantial quarter, net $200 million additional on top of what we've already won. So that's more than $2 billion of net business in the national sales. To be clear, we're not going to report that number going forward. That's something that we were doing during COVID to give a sense of confidence on what was happening kind of under the water because the overall water level was lower than what it should have been because of COVID, but we're going to pause, going forward, on reporting on that. 
 But we had another great quarter, and we don't anticipate that slowing down. We have the ability to continue to win national contract business. The why is that those customer types have tremendous confidence in Sysco's breadth, depth and expertise to be able to ship on time and in full. I get asked the question all the time, "Why are you winning on the national sales basis?" It is not because of rates. We do not "underbid" the market to try to win new business. We bid appropriate market rates, and we win because of our service experience and our capabilities of our national sales team to represent Sysco in a compelling way. So that trend has continued.
 I would say the surprise, and it's a very pleasant and positive one for the industry at large and also for Sysco, is that the independent restaurant customer who is predicted to go out of business just simply has not. We are shipping 10% more unique doors than we were pre-COVID, and that factoid alone conveys the health of the independent customer, but it also conveys that Sysco has won big in net new customers in the independent space because the industry is down about 10%, so we have a 20-point delta in our performance versus the industry at large and the ability to serve that customer type.
 The why that has occurred is because we have changed our compensation model for our sales reps. We make it worth their while now to more significantly prospect new customers, and we have improved the customer onboarding process in a meaningful way. And we've eliminated order minimums, which eliminates, again, another barrier of our new customer joining our mix.
 I would say in regards to customer lines of penetration, that's something that our Recipe for Growth is going to address in spades, and I anticipate additional momentum on cases per operator in fiscal 2022, and that gives Aaron and I the confidence in the guidance that we just provided. As it relates to acquisitions, we're proud and pleased. Very soon, we will be closing on the Greco acquisition. It's a terrific business focused on the Italian segment, unique products, unique service model, delivery frequency that is substantial, and we're going to grow that platform. We believe that there are additional acquisitions out there that are tuck-in, fold-in. We do not have plans at this time to do any substantial M&A. 
Operator: And your next question comes from Mark Carden with UBS. 
Mark Carden: Can you quantify how much of an impact inflation had on your gross profit and EBITDA in 4Q? And how should we think about the impact of that on financials over the next few quarters? 
Aaron Alt: Thanks for the question, Mark. What we've disclosed is that from a gross profit perspective, right, we were -- gross profit grew over fiscal '19. We've not disclosed, and we are not proposing to disclose the actual impact broken out across the lines of the P&L. But I want to go back to what I said before. Modest inflation is a good thing for our business, so long as we can management -- manage it as we carry forward. And from a fiscal year '22 perspective, we do expect inflation to continue in the first half at the elevated rates and moderate thereafter. 
Mark Carden: Got it. That's helpful. And then you noted that to date, the Delta variant hasn't had much of an impact on demand. Just curious how this compares to what you saw in the U.K. with respect to consumer behavior, understanding the restrictions are a bit different out there, but whether there are any learnings that you can bring to the U.S. from it. 
Kevin Hourican: Mark, it's Kevin. I'll take that. I'll just start with -- repeat the positive. We are not experiencing sales impact in the month of July tied to Delta. We're not. That is the fact. That is the headline. We can't predict the future. We do not know if things will change. If governments choose to impact dining, on-prem dining, that would have an impact. That is not in our forecast because we can't predict whether that will occur or not occur. 
 What I can, I guess, provide from a color perspective is the country of France has been pretty aggressive with implementing a vaccination passport to be required to eat on -- at a restaurant, and we're prepared to execute against that. And we're working very closely, obviously, with our French operations to be ready for that. That goes into effect in about a month. I would say there are some that take the position that, that vaccine passport will increase people's confidence in going out to eat. There are others that suggest that it might have a foot traffic impact. I guess I would put forward that those 2 things offset each other, and it's awash. 
 I don't know is the honest answer. And many of you live in New York and know that New York has communicated a similar vaccine passport which will be leveraged in Manhattan. It's too soon to tell. What we can say at this point in time is Delta is not having an impact on our business trends. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we're prepared. Aaron said this well. If, in fact, there were some form of a government shutdown, we're prepared to execute against it. We have the ability to execute against it. 
 And I just want to reemphasize one other positive. We've got sectors that -- of our business that haven't yet moved up the recovery curve that will be doing so as schools come back online, both K-12 and college, in a more meaningful way. When we compare to 2020, for sure, that will be a positive. And then as companies return to work, and I know select companies have announced a delay of that, but many companies are, in fact, returning to work post Labor Day, that's another tailwind to our business because we partner with FSM providers as the lead distributor of food to those types of companies. And that is another potential tailwind, along with leisure and business travel picking up in our hospitality segment. 
 So there's a lot in there. That's why we have provided the forecast that we have provided. Going back to Jeff's question, why not more aggressive? It's because we can't predict the unknown. What we can see are the trends that we have, and we're confident in our ability to deliver on the forecast update we provided today. 
 I'll toss to Aaron for any additional commentary. 
Aaron Alt: Thank you, Kevin. Two brief thoughts, just to reemphasize, as Kevin called out. There are parts of our business, notwithstanding our great Q4 results, that still have opportunity to come up the recovery curve: education, FSM and significant parts of our international business. 
 But I also want to point out what perhaps is obvious, forgive me for that, during the last couple of quarters, we've been managing a global business where the restrictions are different by city or different by state. And so as we look forward, part of the strength of our portfolio is that it's a portfolio. And we will have regions performing differently than others as various cities, counties, states or countries react differently to their situation, and that creates a great diversification for us from a portfolio result perspective. 
Operator: And your next question comes from Alex Slagle with Jefferies. 
Alexander Slagle: I wanted to follow up on the staffing. I know you made good progress on the hiring initiatives, but it sounds like more to go. So kind of curious how much of this incremental supply chain and labor inflation hit in the fourth quarter relative to last quarter and how to think about the magnitude into the first quarter and '22 as additional channels come back. I know you provided some metrics, but if you could clarify that. 
Kevin Hourican: This is Kevin. I'll start. I'll talk about just the state of the state, and then I'll toss to Aaron for answering the quantification part of your question. The good news is we've declared we would hire over 6,000 people in the first -- excuse me, second half of our fiscal 2021, which is the first half of this calendar year, and we succeeded. We hit that target. We are in decent shape nationally. We are definitely in better shape than the industry at large. The good news/challenge is that the recovery is happening faster than we had modeled, and that is a good thing for the P&L, and it puts pressure on our hiring. We absolutely have incremental drivers and warehouse selectors to be hired. We are working very aggressively to do that. We're moving any and all obstacles that get in the way: recruiting bonuses, retention bonuses. We are increasing the number of recruiters that we have. We're doing marketing to create awareness of what are very high-quality, high-paying jobs. And we are -- we literally have a daily standup where we talk every day about our staffing health. 
 Neil and I talked about this last night. We have 76 warehouses in just the United States alone, which is, by far, the biggest count in this industry. And we have a handful of sites that are in a challenged status. However, we have the vast majority of our sites that are not, and we have buffer capacity. So as a single building has challenges, we can flex product demand and volume to all locations. And if you're a smaller company, you just don't have that flex capacity. We have 300 warehouses across the globe, and it's just the breadth and depth and scale of this company in times like this that give us advantage.
 We're working very hard. This is the #1 priority for our company is to increase our staffing health, as I call it. There's more new business to be had and more incremental business to be had as we improve our staffing health, and we're committed to doing it. 
 I'll toss to Aaron, who will answer the financial impact part of your question for Q4 and any comments for 2022. 
Aaron Alt: Sure. I'm not going to give you a number, but allow me to provide a couple of points of context. First is the cost, while increasing, as Kevin called out in his remarks, are largely transitory. We expect to work through them over the course of fiscal '22. Second, they will be funded by our cost-out. And again, over time, that will also present us with further opportunity.
 And lastly, and this -- I found this to be an interesting data point without giving you the number. I was looking at our driver cost as a percentage of our OpEx. As between Q4 of '21 and Q4 of '19, it was flat. Now I expect some modest increase in the first part of the year as we work through the situation that we've been discussing in this call, but that gives me some confidence that we will be able to manage through this. Thank you. 
Operator: And your next question comes from Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. 
Edward Kelly: Kevin, can I just -- I just wanted to ask one follow-up on the labor cost inflation side, just because it's been such a big point of contention, I think, for investors in the space right now. But your view of this being transitory, how do you think about the risk to that at this point? And what are the data points that you have today that kind of confirms that view? I'm just kind of curious as we take -- sort of take a step back and you have obviously have much more visibility than us, how you think about the risk to that view? 
Kevin Hourican: Yes. It's the question to ask, and I totally understand it. And I'd be asking the question, too, if I were you. And what others say may be inconsistent and different than what we say. All I'm going to describe is the realities at Sysco, what we're doing. I encourage you to go back to our prepared remarks. I was really careful and thoughtful about how we characterized it, but I will give you additional color and also be as crisp as I can possibly be about what's going on. 
 In our Q4, and it's definitely continued into July, we are spending money on what I call the transitory basis to improve our staffing health. Those things are retention bonuses, hiring bonuses, recruitment bonuses. We're compensating our sales consultants to help us find drivers that are out in the industry. Those expenses are in our P&L in Q4, and we had a very solid quarter because the sales growth we are experiencing is more than covering those "transitory" incremental costs. And we will continue to do those things until the staffing health gets to our level of satisfaction. 
 Where we will be judicious, prudent and careful is in structural wage permanent cost increases. We will do it if we have to, but we will only do it if we have to. And the why is, as you well know, and in your models, this is why you're asking us this question, you live with those costs forever, and they're compounding. I guess trust that I've come from an industry that had labor shortages for more than a decade and experienced substantial cost increases, that's the pharmacy industries that doesn't -- those that don't know me well enough. And we will be extremely prudent to prevent that from happening in this industry. 
 With that said, we will have to make some investments in base pay because the market has moved on us in select locations, and we're prepared to move so that we don't find ourselves in a position of disadvantage. What I said in my prepared remarks, however, is -- and we will find productivity improvement offsets to offset those cost increases that are, in fact, structural and permanent because Aaron and I can see in our business where and how we can be more efficient. So even if there's some wage increase as a percent of sales, we can run our trucks more efficiently to reduce miles delivered on an annual basis as just an example to find offsets. 
 Aaron, I'll toss to you if there's anything you want to say about 2022 from a cost perspective. 
Aaron Alt: I think it's well said, Kevin. 
Kevin Hourican: Ed, hopefully, I answered your question. And by all means, if you have a follow-up, go right ahead. 
Edward Kelly: Yes. No. That's good. And then the other thing I wanted to ask you about, Kevin, just in terms of the challenges that there is just out there for you and the industry, right, in meeting market demand, given inventory and labor shortages, I'm just kind of curious how much is actually being left on the table today. I know you were up from the industry, but I think everybody is in this situation. Does this improve in the coming quarter or 2? So does your outperformance relative to the industry continue to grow? And if we were to have some slowdown related to Delta, does that also say that maybe there is some cushion in that slowdown for you, just given the gap between demand and supply for the industry? 
Kevin Hourican: That's a great question. Here are the facts. We have the data to prove that we're performing better than the industry at large in both fill rate and in delivery on time, and we're not meeting our own personal internal expectations for those 2 important metrics. So there is additional upside to be had as we improve our staffing health at large and then specifically in select challenged locations. And we're moving mountains to be able to do that.
 So yes, there is more upside as we improve our health. And we've worked to incorporate those types of thoughts into our forward-facing logic, which Aaron has covered. You asked how long will it take to get back to a healthier position. I would say it's within the next 6 months is when we can definitively say we are in a better, healthier position than we are right now. It's the most challenging labor market I've experienced in my career. That is fact, but we do believe we are in a better position. 
 We do believe to answer one of your discrete questions: Can Sysco expand its leadership position? The answer is yes, definitively. We believe we can expand our leadership position. How much additional upside is out there is something I'd prefer not to comment upon. 
 You offered an interesting query about Delta slowdown as a potential -- 2 things offsetting each other. I would just repeat, we're not seeing a Delta headwind at this point in time. This is not in our actuals that we are seeing a Delta headwind. The thing that would impact the business is if governments put restrictions back on operators, and let's be optimistic that, that won't be necessary. And toss back to you, Ed, if you have any other questions. 
Edward Kelly: No. 
Operator: And your next question comes from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Partners. 
John Heinbockel: A high-level question here. When you think about the impact of this ongoing inflation to dampen demand, so how do you get your arms around that philosophically and maybe by what types of businesses? And then what can you do to mitigate that pressure for -- to your customers without taking a margin hit, right? I imagine it might be pushing certain lower-cost products, but your thoughts on that would be helpful. 
Kevin Hourican: Thank you for the question, John. I just want to make sure I heard the first part of your question. I thought I heard you say, does the increased inflation dampen demand? If I did hear that correctly, I just want to be -- I'm sorry, go ahead. 
John Heinbockel: Yes. Go ahead. 
Kevin Hourican: I just want to be clear on what's happening right now, and this is why this was gross profit dollars favorable for Sysco in our Q4. The increased inflation is not dampening demand at this point in time. Our restaurant partners are succeeding in making their own menu price adjustments. The consumer pent-up demand on eating away from home is -- and the robust consumer spending power that exists out there. That's why the elevated inflation which would normally be problematic. I think we've kind of trained the industry and trained ourselves that 2% to 3% inflation is a healthy zone, and above that becomes challenging. This is a unique time, and the elevated inflation that we're experiencing is not decreasing demand. And because of that, while it's having a slightly negative impact on our gross margin rate percentage, we are definitely putting more gross profit dollars in the bank. And therefore, it helped us with a strong quarter. 
 To your point, if it continued forever, that would be problematic, and we are working to answer the second part of your question very aggressively with our supplier partners. Are their alternative products, different cuts of meat? As I mentioned, this is a fast poultry and pork problem, most aggressively at this point in time, and you know that from the coverage of the universe. And we're working really hard to find incremental sources of supply. We believe that is our responsibility for our customers to help decrease COGS over time. And Judith Sansone and our merchant team are working extraordinarily hard to help us reduce COGS so that we can provide great value to our customers and therefore continue successful, profitable growth for both them and for us. 
 Aaron, anything you want to add to that? 
Aaron Alt: I would just add one data point, which is the proof point in Kevin's observations is that foot traffic in the restaurants are up, even with the increased menu prices. 
Kevin Hourican: John, do you have a follow-up? 
John Heinbockel: No, no. That's good. 
Operator: And your next question comes from Lauren Silberman with Credit Suisse. 
Lauren Silberman: Given your stronger-than-expected sales near term and what looks like accelerating market share, can you help contextualize where you see your results versus the industry today as we think about that 1.2x the industry market rate target in fiscal '22? And then given all the national and local customer wins as well as your initiatives, more orders, better staffing, better inventory, do you think that 1.2x could be conservative? 
Kevin Hourican: Lauren, thank you for the question. This is Kevin. Go back to May 20 when we talked about our 3-year plan. What we described at that time for both '22, '23 and '24 was this is what we have received from Technomic, that's the company that we use for this, is the view on what the market recovery will be and that we will grow 1.2x that in our first year of the 3-year plan and 1.5x that in fiscal 2024. Both Aaron and I did a caveat that as the market grows faster, we need to grow faster, too. And if the market underperformed versus those forecasts, we commit we will grow 1.2x.
 I would actually take the view of the industry recovering much faster than what we expected, could put pressure on that 1.2x, but we are not communicating anything other than we are fully committed to delivering that level of growth. The total, for sure, will be higher for 2022 than what we originally thought, which is why Aaron announced today a lift of $2.5 billion of incremental sales. And we're on track to deliver the 1.2x for this first year of the 3-year plan, and we're on track to be able to deliver the 1.5x as well for the third year. So trying to be as transparent as I can. The market is growing, which is why we lifted sales by $2.5 billion, and we're on track to deliver the 1.2. 
Lauren Silberman: Okay. And then just on the case volumes accelerating into July. Can you expand on what's driving that acceleration? And are you seeing that broad-based across markets? 
Kevin Hourican: We are seeing it broad-based across markets. It has continued into July. We have not seen any form of a slowdown in July on a week-by-week basis. Aaron did a nice job of betting cleanup on one of my commentary. He reminds -- international. International was mostly closed in Q4. Our largest countries of operations internationally, specifically in Europe, didn't even begin reopening until late May and into June. And there's additional recovery still to be had in international because we have not fully recovered in international. We had a substantial profit improvement quarter-over-quarter with a breakeven performance in Q4, which is a $92 million profit increase from our Q3. And we see continued momentum in front of us as the market continues to reopen: a, international; b, foodservice management; c, hospitality. And we have not seen a slowdown in the restaurant sector in our largest U.S. business. 
Aaron Alt: I would just add to that one, Lauren, that we have -- one of the nice things about us getting started early and planning for the recovery is we have the inventory to handle the case growth that we're expecting. 
Operator: And your next question comes from John Glass with Morgan Stanley. 
John Glass: I just wanted to go back and make sure I'm clear on the growth you're expecting, the 1.2x the industry. What is the industry expectation or your view or whoever you look to for that advice, what are they assuming the industry is growing at in '22? And is there a comparable number we can look to for the fourth quarter, what your growth was relative to the industry? 
Aaron Alt: Sure. Here's what we said, and I would encourage you to go back and look at our May 20 Investor Day presentation. Our external guidance, if you will, or our long-range plan was that we would grow faster than whatever the market performance is. It's not dollar-based, it's industry-based, if you will. And our commitment was that in fiscal '22, we would grow 1.2x market, consistent with the transformation investments we're making. And that by the time we get to fiscal '24, again, because of the investments we're making and then increasingly achieving the ROI on those investments, we'd be growing at 1.5x the market growth as we carry forward.
 We've disclosed in the past that we have used Technomic as the source of industry data for us. And so as their forecasts adjust, we adjust our own expectations accordingly. But as Kevin said, we are -- and as you can see from our fourth quarter results, right, we are growing. We are on track relative to our expectations for fiscal year '22 relative to that 1.2x growth, and we're excited about both the organic and the inorganic initiatives that are going to help us to meet our commitments. And then we'll -- and Neil can also follow up with you on some of the details around it off the line, if you'd like. 
John Glass: Yes, that would be great. And then, Aaron, you said you overachieved your savings goal this year, I think $350 million. Maybe just by how much? And as a longer-term question, you talked about another $400 million opportunity at some point in '23 and '24. Have you thought about, is this savings really going to reinvest in the initiatives you've talked about? Or do you think about a net versus gross savings? Or is that too far off to really get that kind of granularity? 
Aaron Alt: Let me come at it from the back end. We expect our investments -- sorry, we expect our cost savings in the short term to fund 2 things: first, the transformation investments we're making, which are substantial across every element of our business, but then also the snapback, the transitory cost that Kevin has been referring to before. The good thing for us is we got started early with the cost-out before we started the transformation investments and indeed before the snapback incremental costs occurred, and so we have the fuel before we need to burn the fire relative to that.
 What you should take away from that as well, though, is that, over time, as we move past the snapback, as we get past the transition, as we move past the transformation investments, that becomes good news to our income statement. We expect to drop more of the savings to the bottom line. I've been very careful not to cite percentages, right? What we have given you is EPS guidance and indeed the update to EPS guidance today, which is an all-in look at our business overall. 
 Kevin, would you add anything to that? 
Kevin Hourican: It's good. 
Operator: And your next question comes from Kelly Bania with BMO Capital. 
Kevin Hourican: Kelly, you might be on mute. We can't hear you. 
Kelly Bania: Can you hear me? 
Kevin Hourican: We can. We can hear you now. 
Kelly Bania: Perfect. I just wanted to go back, Aaron, to the cost that you talked about, totaled $86 million. You mentioned $36 million for recruiting and retention and $50 million for transformation. I was just wondering if you could elaborate more on those. And if those were specifically called out because they were transitory or just so we can understand how those impacted the quarter, and then what you're expecting in those buckets in the upcoming year. 
Aaron Alt: Great, sure. We are monitoring our costs 2 ways -- well, 3 ways. Let's talk about the spend for a second. We have a specific, identified list of strategic initiatives that are tied to our transformation for which there are specific business cases, which lead to the ROI over time that comes from sales and that -- the profit that comes from the incremental sales that result from them. So when I talk transformation investments, it's the spend against those initiatives in the quarter.
 In contrast, the snapback expenses, we are very carefully monitoring that which we believe to be onetime or short term or transitory in nature, and it goes to are we paying recruiting firms more money? Are we doing more recruiting marketing than we were doing before? Are we doing incremental training because of the velocity of new associates we have in coming into our buildings? Are we paying retention, et cetera? And that's what you will find within those -- within that disclosure.
 As far as -- I think you also asked me for trajectory. And what I would tell you is the trajectory for the transformation strategic initiatives, that is built into our expectation. And you can see it close -- you can see it the growth numbers that we've put out there for the next 3 years as well as the guidance we provided in the short term and the long term. 
 With respect to the snapback, because we're managing that every day, I can just leave you with the confidence that we believe we can manage it in the context of the cost-out that we're taking, and we'll be more aggressive on cost-out to help fund those -- fund the cost if they increase as well. But we believe we are -- we can land within the updated EPS guidance that we provided on the call today. 
Kelly Bania: Okay, that's very helpful. And just one last one, I guess, on the local customers. You've talked about the 10% increase in local customers you're serving, and I was just curious if you could talk about the contribution that you're getting from those customers. I assume they start out much lower than maybe a more mature customer. Just curious how that is progressing. 
Kevin Hourican: Kelly, it's a great question. This is Kevin. You're absolutely right that a new customer starts out as a lower cases per drop than a mature, tenured customer, and that's to be expected. My commentary would be our new customers are performing equal to or slightly better than historical new customers. We are tracking it by tenure, and we're seeing them move up the penetration growth expectations.
 So all things are on track. We have not acquired "small, unprofitable customers." I know that select folks may have tried to interpret that, not people on this call. I'm just saying that is not a problem. We are confident in the new customer wins and our ability to move those customers up the profit ladder, and we're on track. 
Operator: And our last question will come from the line of John Ivankoe at JPMorgan. 
John Ivankoe: The question is on the $400 million of cost saves. Obviously, those aren't this year, but I wanted to get a sense in terms of what type of major buckets that you've identified. Obviously -- I'm sorry for the background noise. Obviously, I'm asking this in the context you're a very growth-oriented company. You plan to take market share. There's a lot of investments that you're making overall. I mean, just give us a sense that, that $400 million can be cut without it affecting your infrastructure or service levels or future investment in any way. 
Aaron Alt: Great question. Here's the context I would give you. Before we announced the goal, we had a specific and defined list of initiatives that we believe we could execute over time, taking into account the timing, cadence and depth of our transformation across key elements of our enterprise. I can get there. The buckets will be relatively familiar. They will go to how do we operate as an ongoing concern the most efficiently, followed by how are we supporting our customers the most directly.
 Reflecting our growth aspirations, you're right. There will be areas where we will need to invest in marketing and merchandising and areas as well. But if we take the list of cost initiatives, we believe that it enables the growth objective we have out there, and it is specifically actionable as we move through the period of time. 
 Now I want to go back and emphasize something I interpreted you were acknowledging your question, but let me just say it for the group as well, right? We've over delivered against the $350 million. That was our expectation for fiscal year '21, right? Our cost saving efforts will continue through fiscal '22, but what we're saying as part of our guidance is we have both the transformation of the snapback to deal with in the short term. But over the longer term, over our LRP period into '23 and '24, there's an incremental $400 million that will largely come out in '23 and '24 in service of our long-term guidance. 
Kevin Hourican: This is Kevin. If I could just add on 2 things. Just nothing that we're doing in our cost-out will hinder our ability to serve our customers. In fact, we will add sales reps over time, and we are going to increase delivery frequency to our customers over time. So the cost-out is not variable. It's permanent. It's structural. 
 You have, for example -- some examples. We sold a corporate headquarters that we determined we didn't need because we have more people working from home than we had previously. That's just the asset sale, and it reduced our operating expenses. We restructured our field organization to become more efficient, more agile, more lean and to be more center-led from a strategy perspective. And that work is done. It's in the rearview mirror, and those costs are permanent. They're structural, never moved. 
 And we've got many other examples but it's -- and Aaron covered one other in his prepared remarks, which is indirect sourcing. So our purchasing of tires, our purchasing of select IT contracts, there's meaningful, meaningful dollars to be saved for our company as we get more aggressive in how we're strategically sourced. And Aaron personally and his team are doing terrific work in taking out costs in that regard. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Kevin Hourican.
Kevin Hourican: Thank you, Neil. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. I hope that you and your families are staying safe and healthy. I would summarize our third quarter performance with 4 important points. First, our industry's COVID business recovery is here, and the pace of the recovery is accelerating, especially in our domestic U.S. business. Second, we are making excellent progress in our business transformation to better serve our customers and differentiate from our competition. Third, we are winning market share at the national and local customer level. Fourth, our financial results for the third quarter were strong in light of the market conditions, mostly due to improved sales and disciplined expense management.  As we have previously communicated, we can see in our performance data that once restrictions placed upon our customers are eased, our business results quickly improve. We see tremendous pent-up demand in the food-away-from-home sector. Our data confirms that consumers are eager to eat at restaurants as soon as restrictions are reduced. Strong sales results and long wait times are common in restaurants operating within geographies that have limited restrictions.  The third quarter can be aptly described is difficult at the beginning and robust at the end. Our January performance was negatively impacted by meaningfully tight restrictions on our customers during the winter COVID lockdown. In February, a substantial winter storm adversely affected our performance in our strongest domestic markets. In contrast, the March sales period exceeded our expectations and bodes well as a strong indicator for the business recovery within our sector. As a result, we exited the third quarter with promising sales trends.  The improvement is most notable in the Southern third of the United States, where reduced restrictions and warmer weather are generating strong performance results. The results in reopened markets met, and then late in the quarter, surpassed 2019 levels in the important local independent restaurant sector. These results are a positive harbinger of things to come as the Northern regions begin to benefit from easing restrictions that are mostly still in place today.  The independent restaurant sector exceeding 2019 sales levels in reopened markets is positive outcome and a rebound timing that is faster than the industry had predicted.  In Europe, however, restrictions remain firmly in place. Our European countries are experiencing restrictions even stronger than those experienced in the U.S. in April of 2020. Our sales results in Europe reflect those tight restrictions and remain down meaningfully compared to 2019 levels. We remain confident in our ability to succeed in the European markets and expect improvement to begin in the latter half of our fiscal fourth quarter.  In addition to the softer European performance, our business in the travel, hospitality and foodservice management sectors remain down. Our business penetration in Europe and in foodservice management pre-COVID is creating a lingering delay in the full recovery of our business results in comparison to select other distributors. We are confident that these sectors will recover, but their recovery will be at a slower pace than our core restaurant sector.  As a result, when these geographies and segments more fully recover, it will add strength and sustainability of Sysco's recovery, giving us fuel to grow in quarters and years to come.  All told, we delivered a sales decrease of 13.7% for the quarter. While sales were down compared to 2020, our results reflect an improvement over our second quarter decline of 23%, which is another clear signal that the industry is recovering. The most compelling outcome of the fiscal third quarter is that the local independent restaurant sector was performing well above our expectations as we exited the quarter, with many restaurant partners running sales increases compared to 2019. While our third quarter fiscal results were down compared to the prior year, I am pleased to report that we once again delivered a profitable quarter, delivering $437 million of adjusted EBITDA. Sysco was doing more than anyone in the foodservice distribution industry to ensure the success of restaurants and prepare for the return of foodservice demand, which can be seen in our overall market share growth throughout the quarter.  Sysco gained overall market share versus the rest of the industry, reflecting the progress of our recent investments. Our sales teams are actively engaged with new customers and helping existing customers maximize their business during this recovery period. We continue to win business at the national and contract sales level. We have now posted over $1.8 billion of net new wins since the start of the pandemic with another strong quarter of new contracts signed. I've said on prior calls, the contracts we are writing are at historic profit margins. We are winning the new business due to our supply chain and our service capabilities.  In addition to the national contract sales wins, we onboarded more new local customers than ever before during the third quarter. Fueled by our Restaurants Rising program and our new sales associate compensation model, our recent industry report confirmed that the number of local restaurants was down approximately 10% to 2019 levels due to permanent closures. The 10% closure is better than most experts had predicted for the industry. After posting the strongest quarter ever of new local customer wins at Sysco, you can see on Slide 6 that we are now serving 10% more local customers than we did in fiscal 2019. The fact that we have increased the number of customers that we serve during this pandemic bodes well for our future top line growth when the industry is fully recovered. Our increased customer count positions us well to take market share as the business returns to the food-away-from-home sector in our fiscal 2022 and beyond.  As we discussed on our last call, we began making several strategic investments in preparation for the business recovery. These investments increased throughout the fiscal third quarter and will continue in our fourth quarter. We have focused our investments on our customers, our people, our inventory, our technology and our community. These investments have helped position Sysco ahead of the curve for the return of foodservice demand.  Our investments in our customers, including our Restaurants Rising campaign, make it easier for restaurants to succeed and strengthen their business for the future. During this uncertain business environment, we have made it easier for our customers to do business with Sysco by waiving delivery minimums on regularly scheduled delivery days. We are making investments in our people, including increasing our efforts to proactively staff in advance of the business recovery curve to ensure we have the right number of people in the right locations at the right time to be able to ship on time and in full to our customers. At Sysco, we expect to hire over 6,000 associates in the second half of our fiscal year. We have a full court press on hiring warehouse selectors and drivers. Throughout our industry, drivers are indeed in short supply, and hiring is a challenge. We are pulling every lever to ensure we meet our hiring targets. While this hiring investment will increase our operational expenses in the short term, over the long term, it will help ensure that Sysco is able to maximize our share gains during the business recovery.  We are also making investments in inventory to properly position our warehouses to support customer demand. Currently, Sysco has inventory on hand and on order in a combined amount that is greater than our inventory position before the COVID crisis began. Our ability to ship product on time and in full during the upcoming period of volume recovery is a core element of what makes Sysco the strongest broadline distributor in the industry.  Due to our strong balance sheet, we are uniquely positioned to be able to make investments in inventory to ensure we can accelerate growth faster than the overall recovery. We are seeing pressure and constraints in the supply chain as select suppliers struggle with meeting increased demand levels. This is known as the supply chain bullwhip effect as market conditions rebound. At Sysco, we have seen this constraint coming and have been partnering with our top suppliers for more than 90 days to pre-position inventory at our warehouses. We view this as an opportunity to grow our business and take additional market share.  We are continuing our strategic investments in our technology to improve the customer experience. Our technology platform is being meaningfully improved so that we can better serve our customers. We're making it easier for our customers to order products through our Sysco Shop platform, and we are implementing a best-in-class pricing software. We will discuss both of these topics in detail at our Investor Day.  Lastly, our corporate social responsibility initiatives in 2025 goals are progressing well. Our industry-leading CSR efforts are setting the standard for care and progress across 3 pillars of people, product and planet. We are making great strides on this very important work, as evidenced by our recent announcement with Cargill, which is a critical partnership, along with the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation to improve sustainable grazing practices across 1 million acres of grassland. This effort helps to improve soil health, promote biodiversity and increase carbon storage and safeguard the livelihoods of ranchers and the communities in which we serve.  This progress is also good for our business as our customers can buy Sysco product with confidence, knowing the environmental and social benefits we bring to their table.  At Sysco, we are working to maximize our opportunity to recover faster than the industry. We have an opportunity to gain market share given our financial strength and our compelling business transformation. We are prepared to do more than any other food service distributor in the industry to ensure the success of our customers and our customers' success will generate business growth for Sysco.  I would like to invite everyone to our May 20 Investor Day. At that important meeting, we will provide you with the details of our strategic growth plan and how that plan will deliver compelling financial results. Please plan to join us virtually on May 20, and we will provide you with the details and logistics.  I want to give a heartfelt thanks to all of our Sysco associates who continue to help our customers grow and succeed in this challenging environment. I am proud of their dedication during this dynamic operating environment.  I'll now turn the call over to Aaron Alt, who will discuss our third quarter results along with additional financial details. Aaron, over to you.
Aaron Alt: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning. Improving sales trends, a profitable quarter and strong cash flow, those are our key headlines.  Our fiscal third quarter presented us with the beginning of a restaurant recovery in the United States, countered by continued business disruption in the international and foodservice management parts of our portfolio. As a result, we balanced 5 financial priorities, tactical investments in inventory, team and equipment to get ahead of the business recovery; strategic investments in capabilities and technologies to advance the transformation; careful cost control to mitigate the impact of the COVID environment on our bottom line; purposeful reduction of our indebtedness; and of course, continued return of capital to shareholders through our dividend payments, totaling $689 million so far this fiscal year.  As Kevin called out, we were delighted to see the improving sales trends and the progress on profit, and I will speak more on the income statement shortly. I would like to start today with an emphasis on the strong position we are in as we move up the recovery curve and how that strength is impacting our view of the cash flow and the balance sheet.  Recall, at the end of the second quarter, we had $5.8 billion of cash. During the third quarter, we generated positive cash from operations of $543 million, offset by $83 million of net capital investment, leaving us with incremental positive free cash flow for the third quarter of $460 million.  Working capital was a source of cash for us in the quarter even though we invested heavily in inventory. And as Kevin pointed out, we ended the third quarter with inventory on hand and inventory on order exceeding pre-COVID levels. And we benefited from a significant increase in payables at quarter end. We saw rising normal course receivables balances as our customers started purchasing more. But we also made excellent progress on obtaining timely payment from our customers on both pre-COVID and post-COVID bills.  For the 9-month period, even the face of COVID-19, Sysco generated an impressive $1.2 billion in free cash flow. This strong cash flow was approximately $300 million better than we had forecast earlier this year, driven by the combination of higher sales and profit, working capital benefit and lower CapEx than forecast back in the first quarter.  All in, we ended the third quarter with $4.9 billion of cash on hand. We expect that the fourth quarter will bring continued progress on the EBITDA line. It is also expected to bring investments in working capital as we continue to invest in inventory and as the payables, which provided us with benefit in the third quarter, come due in the fourth quarter. As a result, we are forecasting flattish free cash flow for the fourth quarter, leaving us with free cash for the year of approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion.  Given our balance sheet, our strong cash generation and our optimism for the business recovery, early in the third quarter, we announced that we were continuing the process of reducing our debt levels. We paid down $1.1 billion on that date funded by cash on hand, and you will see that change in leverage reflected in our third quarter financials.  What you will not yet see in the financials is that subsequent to the end of our third quarter, we repaid an additional GBP 200 million on the outstanding amount of the U.K. commercial paper program. And we will, later this week, pay off the remaining GBP 100 million balance on that program, which will bring our debt levels down by approximately $1.5 billion since the start of the third quarter and down by $2.3 billion since the start of this fiscal year.  Stay tuned for a discussion of our capital allocation strategy at Investor Day. Okay. Let's turn to the income statement. Given the interest in the shape of the COVID-19 recovery curve, for the next couple of quarters, we will disclose sales comparisons against both fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020. Third quarter sales were $11.8 billion, a decrease of 13.7% from the same quarter in fiscal 2020 and a 19.3% decrease from the same quarter in fiscal 2019, but with the important qualification that in the last 2 weeks of the quarter, we began to lap the onset of the COVID-19 crisis.  Indeed, looking at the monthly progression, measured against fiscal '19, our sales were down 23% and 14% in January, February and March, reflecting the impact of COVID across the quarter. February would have been better but for the impact of the winter storm in the U.S. during the last week of February.  We are also disclosing today on a onetime basis that our April sales were approximately $4.4 billion, up 102.1% from prior year and improving to only down 8.8% from fiscal 2019. Our United States sales in the U.S. foodservice segment were down 5.3% versus fiscal 2019, and SYGMA was up 12% versus fiscal 2019, reflecting the increase in restaurant traffic and orders as the lockdowns eased in the U.S. We will continue to benefit as the U.S. reopening advances.  In contrast, Europe, Canada and Latin America regressed in the third quarter as a result of strict lockdowns that are now expected to continue in some cases until the end of May and as a result of slower progress in vaccination. The slower international recovery will continue to impact our fourth quarter results and may carry into early quarters of fiscal 2022, depending on vaccination progress by country.  However, we see good news in the recent reopening taking place in the United Kingdom. Here are a couple of additional metrics. For the quarter, local case volume within U.S. Broadline operations decreased 9.7% while total case volume within U.S. Broadline operations decreased 14.1%. Foreign exchange rates had a positive impact of 77 basis points on our sales results.  As we move down the P&L, gross profit was $2.1 billion in the third quarter, decreasing 17.2% versus same quarter in fiscal 2020. Most of the decline in gross profit was driven by lower volumes due to COVID. However, we did see modest gross margin dilution at the enterprise level of roughly 77 basis points versus the same period in fiscal 2020 as our rate came in just a touch shy of 18%.  The primary reason for the gross margin dilution is business mix. Our sales and our generally higher margin European business were down, so lower gross margin at the enterprise. Along the same lines, our sales in our lower-margin SYGMA business were up, so lower gross margin at the enterprise. We also saw a modest margin dilution in each of the business segments with varying causes from product mix shift, the timing by market of the interplay between passing along inflation and implementing our transformation initiatives.  Adjusted operating expense decreased 14.7% to just under $1.9 billion, and we saw a modest improvement of operating expense leverage, even with lower sales to prior year. Our expense profile reflected the counterweights of good cost-out achievement, balanced against our investments for the recovery curve and our investments against the transformation agenda.  As part of this, we targeted and achieved increased significant cost savings. We are on track to surpass our fiscal 2021 goal of $350 million of cost savings. We expect to drive continued cost savings opportunities to help fuel our future growth agenda, a topic I will discuss more at Investor Day in 2 weeks.  Finally, at the enterprise level, adjusted operating income decreased 32% to $256 million. For the third quarter, our non-GAAP tax rate of 14.3% was favorably driven by the impact of stock option exercises. Adjusted earnings per share decreased 51.1% to $0.22 for the quarter. I'll say a few words on our third quarter results by business segment, starting with U.S. Foodservice Operations. Sales were $8 billion, which was a decrease of 12.8% versus the prior year period. In the rapidly evolving environment, the business again acquired a record number of new customers as our sales teams hit the streets, and we deployed digital tools.  We also saw growth in our national accounts customer base. This business, our biggest business, is moving up the COVID recovery curve rapidly. Within the business, Sysco brand sales for the third quarter decreased 116 basis points to 37.3% of total U.S. cases, driven by customer and product mix shift. With respect to local U.S. case, the Sysco brand sales decreased 234 basis points to 44.5%, which was driven by product mix shift into prepackaged and takeaway-ready products. Regaining Sysco brand sales levels and the healthy margins that come with them will be a focus for fiscal '22 and beyond.  Gross profit for U.S. foodservice decreased 13.7% to $1.6 billion for the quarter. The segment's adjusted operating expenses decreased 16.1% to $1.1 billion, and adjusted operating income decreased 8.3% to $525 million. Product cost inflation was 3.5% versus prior year, driven by deflationary categories in fiscal 2020.  Moving to the SYGMA segment. For the third consecutive quarter, sales increased during the third fiscal quarter to $1.6 billion, a 15.9% increase over fiscal 2020 and a 3% increase over fiscal 2019, driven by the success of national regional quickservice restaurants servicing drive-thru traffic.  While we are pleased with the team's efforts during COVID, SYGMA is our lowest-margin segment, and our team is carefully calibrating our efforts in that business, particularly as it relates to negotiating agreements with customers. As a result, starting during our fiscal fourth quarter, we will be taking an opportunity to transition away from a large existing regional customer. The financials of that relationship do not meet our preferred profile, and we will be focusing on freeing up capacity for more profitable customers.  Going forward, we will continue to be diligent in our contract review and approval process across the enterprise. Gross profit increased 12.3% to $133 million for the quarter while gross margin was down 27 basis points compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating expenses increased 11.1% to $121 million, and adjusted operating income increased 24.1% to $13 million all at SYGMA.  Moving to the international segment. As I mentioned earlier, our European, Canadian and Latin American businesses continue to be impacted by COVID lockdowns. The International Foodservice Operations segment saw sales of $1.7 billion, a decrease of 31.3%, while gross profit decreased 35.1% and gross margin decreased 110 basis points. The gross margin decline was a result of country mix, customer mix and product mix.  For the international segment, adjusted operating expenses decreased 15.8%, leading to an adjusted operating loss of $92 million. We are confident that international will be a significant recovery opportunity for our company in fiscal 2022.  Our other segment, which includes our Guest Worldwide business, remains in the COVID recovery starting blocks as hospitality occupancy rates remain low compared to prior year levels. While still in turnaround mode, the business improved its underlying profitability during the third quarter. Additionally, our Guest Worldwide business signed a substantial new customer contract during the quarter that will be very beneficial to the segment as the travel and hospitality sectors recover.  That concludes my prepared remarks on the third quarter. We are not providing further guidance for the fourth quarter, other than to observe that we continue to monitor our operating environment carefully. While operational challenges remain for many of our customers, we are seeing excellent demand in our core business in the key markets in the center and the south. And we are seeing green shoots on the coast as markets reopen.  Let's be clear. The upswing has begun, and we expect continued progress across the largest parts of our portfolio in the fourth fiscal quarter. Our team remains resolutely focused on driving our businesses, aggressively managing the business recovery and building customer-centric capabilities to accelerate long-term growth. As we did in the third quarter, we will continue to deploy our balance sheet to invest in inventory, technology and our people to stay ahead of the recovery curve while also reducing our indebtedness.  During our Investor Day in 2 weeks, Kevin and the executive leadership team will offer more detailed perspective on the business, on our growth plans for fiscal 2022 and beyond and provide further specifics on our transformation efforts. We will comment on our post-COVID capital allocation strategy, including the breadth and depth of our organic and inorganic investment plans, our plans for further debt reduction and how we're thinking about continued shareholder returns. We look forward to seeing you participate in that virtual event.  Thank you for your attention. Operator, we are now ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Alex Slagle with Jefferies.
Alex Slagle: Question on the local case growth and the new customer wins. It continues to be remarkable. Just wondered if you could dive a little deeper behind the drivers, first, what you think the biggest driver was; and then two, specifically, if you could dimensionalize how you think the change in delivery minimums impacted the top line margins during the quarter, if that's a meaningful driver you want to keep around or something temporary that you see shifting back shortly.
Kevin Hourican: Alex, thank you for the question. Just on the new customer prospecting, we're very proud of those results. As I said in my prepared remarks, largest single quarter ever in the history of the company from a new customer wins perspective. For those that are keeping score, I said the same thing in Q2. We actually just upped the performance that we posted in Q2. So we've got 2 consecutive quarters of record levels of new customer prospecting.  The why is pretty straightforward: a, we made it a big priority for our sales force. We're a company that manages what we expect and we manage what we measure, and we have impact on the things that we focus upon. The second is, as I've spoken pretty openly about, we removed a barrier in our prior compensation program that got in the way of prospecting. So we changed our sales consultant compensation late last summer. It took a quarter or 2 for that to really kick in and get the change management going and get to a level of understanding of the key components of that program. And we've made it now financially beneficial for our sales consultants to prospect because it's good for us, and it's now good for them equally.  So two basic reasonably simple premises, which is we've made it a priority. We're tracking it. We're measuring it. We have goals specifically by sales consultant on new customer prospecting and the financial compensation rewards them for that activity. And it obviously rewards our company as we are able to win new business profitably and grow over time. As I said in my prepared remarks as well, it's less visible on our total top line because in many cities in this country, there are still significant restaurant restrictions. But those new customer wins are going to pay dividend and fruit for us as this recovery that we are now a part of begins to further accelerate in our Q4 and then into fiscal 2022. So we're really pleased with it.  Second part of the question was about Restaurants Rising. Do we expect it to continue? And was it a big driver of the wins? I would say yes, that would be my point #3, which would be Restaurants Rising was a barrier that previously got in the way for a new customer coming over to Sysco. We had pretty strict and rigorous delivery days and minimums. And we've eliminated that barrier.  Will that stay? We'll talk more about that on our May 20 Investor Day. I'm not ready this morning to make an announcement in that regard.
Aaron Alt: Alex, it's Aaron Alt. I'd add one thing to that as well. While we don't spend as much time on these calls talking about the other segments in our business, there is further goodness out there, which is whether it's in Europe and the U.K. in particular, that has gained large foodservice management contracts during the crisis, but the sales are not yet on display or indeed, in the Guest Worldwide business, where, again, they gained a large customer. Oftentimes, getting in the door is the hardest part. The good news is our teams have kicked open the doors, and as the recovery happens, we expect that to bring goodness to our results as well.
Operator: Your next question is from Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo.
Edward Kelly: I wanted to ask you, Kevin, about post-COVID customer mix and overall volumes. Just kind of curious, how do you think -- you've won business on the independent side, you've won business on the contract side. How do we think about when the world normalizes how much higher your case volume will be than 2019? And what does the mix end up looking like? Is it possible with the independent wins you've seen that your independent mix could actually be higher? Is that too much to ask for? Just kind of curious as to how you're thinking about all that.
Kevin Hourican: Yes, thank you for the question. I would say for fiscal '22, I would expect for our independent mix to be higher for a couple of factors: one, the number of wins that we're talking about; two, and we did say this in our prepared remarks, foodservice management, hospitality, travel are down still pretty significantly and have a slower recovery curve. So I think those 2 factors put side by side would indicate that the balance of our total would be shifting.  One counterpoint to that is one of our strongest sectors, this is our SYGMA sector, we're running double-digit increases to prior year in SYGMA. And that is margin rate dilutive because of the fact that SYGMA's our least profitable rate business. So Aaron can talk more about that on May 20. He's prepared to talk about where we're headed as a company, Ed. So those are comments for fiscal 2022.  If I look over the longer term, our expectation is each of the sectors that we play in will recover to pre-COVID levels. They're each going to recover on a different curve, which we've tracked, and we've mapped. We're using the Technomic data to predict when that will occur. What we said from a point of optimism perspective is each of those businesses is actually ahead of schedule versus what Technomic had predicted, which is a positive harbinger of what's to come in fiscal 2022 and beyond. We expect to take share in each of those sectors. That's my best way of putting a kind of period at the end of the sentence. We have growth strategies in place for how to win in each of those sectors. So as each sector recovers and we take share, if you're asking me 2 years from now, 3 years from now, will we see a meaningfully different balance of sale by customer, I wouldn't suggest that. I would say each of the sectors will grow. And it's hard to predict 3 years from now what the precise balance of sale will be. But hopefully, post-Investor Day, there'll be more clarity to that.
Edward Kelly: And then just a quick follow-up on that. You did talk about investment in the recovery and about some pressure on drivers, warehouse workers. Can you just talk a little bit about that? How will that impact P&L? And does it have any impact on your ability to drive higher post-COVID EBIT margins when the dust settles?
Kevin Hourican: It's a great question in regards to the labor availability challenges that are being faced across the industry -- frankly, across all industries. You've read obviously about the restaurants themselves and how much they're struggling with filling their jobs. And then drivers, in particular, are in short supply nationwide, and frankly, in multiple countries within which we operate.  Here's one meaningful point of difference between Sysco in, let's call it, the restaurant. Our jobs are excellent paying jobs. We do not have a wage challenge. We do not have a minimum wage challenge. Even if the nation went to a $15 minimum, we do not have pressure in that regard. Our driver jobs are excellent paying jobs, strong benefits, they're attractive positions.  Our issue and what I spoke to you on the call today is creating awareness to those jobs. So we've had to do things in this quarter -- in the quarter we're in, Q3 and Q4, to increase advertising to create awareness. We've had to do some things, to create sign-on bonuses, retention bonuses, referral bonuses. So the incremental expenses that I was referring to were more of that ilk than structural permanent increases to the wage, which would dilute margin. So I view this as actually a little bit more of a transitory activity where we're needing to hire over 6,000 people in our second half of our fiscal year. And there are select pockets within the country that are really tight, and we're doing some things to create awareness of our jobs.  So we're confident in our ability to improve our profit ratio in the future. We have a cost takeout program that is substantial. That will help offset any pressures we would see in wage. We've said previously that we've taken $350 million of permanent structural cost out of our business, and that's also something that Aaron will talk about in more detail on May 20.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Kelly Bania, BMO Capital.
Kelly Bania: I was curious if you could go back to the $350 million in structural cost savings. I think there was a mention of being maybe set up to surpass that target. And was just curious if you could talk about where you're finding incremental savings or where you're feeling better about that, if there's any potential to increase that as you move forward.
Aaron Alt: Great question. We are quite excited about our progress against our cost savings effort. Just to go back for a second, what we had targeted for fiscal '21 was $350 million of cost out through a combination of savings and COGS as well as in operating expense. We are ahead of our forecast in that respect, and we certainly expect to meet or beat our $350 million target for fiscal '21.  I'm particularly excited this quarter because the savings are more visible than they have been in previous quarters. And at the sake of distracting us a bit, I thought, well, we might do some simple math on the call today just so I could illustrate the point of how we can see the savings having an impact on our P&L and kind of prove the point that they're real, they're there.  And in particular, as sales go back up and we have the opportunity to have a cleaner view, it will be more obvious to everyone that we're out there. So bear with me a second, I'm going to actually walk you through some simple math. It starts like this. To go back a year, Q3 in fiscal '20, our adjusted OpEx was $2.187 billion, sorry for the decimal points there but we've given the levels we're talking about. This quarter, the comparison period, our sales were down 13.7%. So if for the sake of argument, we assumed that our costs were fully variable -- they're not, but if we did, OpEx should have been down about $300 million.  But Joel guided you in the past that our cost structure is 1/3 fixed and 2/3 variable. So the variable cost would have been just under $200 million of that $300 million. And we should have suffered from stranded fixed costs of $100 million absolute cost savings actions. That would have put us at $1.98 billion, right, just to continue the simple math as we push ahead. Everyone's hopefully still with me.  Our adjusted OpEx for this quarter, though, was $1.867 billion, down $320 million, meaning not only did we reduce the variable cost consistent with sales, but we also took out $120 million of fixed costs, which is the whole point of our cost-out effort, right, being able to go quarter-over-quarter before investments, right, be able to take the fixed cost out of the structure. And the nice thing about this quarter is sales are down, and we're able to show that.  Now I should point out a couple of other things as well. The first is that we did get, call it, $40 million of good guys that are onetime or other benefits that weren't part of the cost-out structure. What you can't see is those good guys offset $40 million to $50 million of purposeful investments we made against the recovery against the transformation in OpEx for the quarter as well. We've always committed that we are going to invest against the business. We're going to use some of the savings to advance our agenda. That's what we've done. This quarter just gives us a good example of how we can show the math, showing that it works out.  On Investor Day, I will have more to say about cost-out. And it will talk about, really, Kelly, to the point of your -- part of your question of where is the cost-out coming from, how it's coming from the way we've restructured and regionalized our business, how it's coming from a culture of frugality that Kevin is leading, how it's coming from prioritizing our investments and insisting on business cases as we push ahead, really core discipline that you would want and how it's helping us to offset some of the trends or headlines around employee cost or inflation, et cetera, as we carry forward.  So thanks for the question, a long answer, but I hope that's helpful.
Kelly Bania: Very helpful. I appreciate that detailed answer. Just also wanted to just ask if I can just about food inflation and maybe what you're seeing so far into your fourth quarter, if you're seeing those costs accelerate, just how do you feel about passing those on. I think you have some new tools and software to manage that. But maybe just update on what you're seeing there.
Kevin Hourican: Kelly, thank you for the inflation question. It's definitely accelerating, but I would say that's more of a Q4 fiscal happening than it was a Q3 happening. We all read the paper every day. We're seeing what's happening not just in this industry but in every industry. Certainly, the economy is becoming more inflationary. Basic economics are at play here. We have significantly increasing demand, unfortunately, simultaneous with some supply challenges that are pretty well-known out there in the food industry.  So what is the impact of that? We are seeing sales increasing. We will most likely in our Q4 see a slightly dilutive impact on margin rate. And GP dollars, however, hopefully, would be in a growth mode, but to be determined on our ability to pass through this inflation to our customers. So here's what we're seeing, consumers, people who are actually going to the restaurants themselves, are showing a willingness to pay a higher ticket. I think you've heard other restaurant people that you personally cover talk about that.  We are seeing restaurant partners being willing to increase their menu prices, and we're working with them. That's a part of what Sysco does. We consult with them, we teach them, we educate them on the impact of the inflation on the COGS that we are all experiencing. And we're providing suggestions on alternative product to offset the cost. And also, we're providing suggestions on where some price increases on the menu could take place.  Important though and notable point, food-away-from-home right now is a very competitive on a price basis versus retail grocery. I think you all know that this time last year, retail grocers did a good job managing their business. And they essentially eliminated promos because they didn't need them anymore, and they are running double-digit comps. So prices at the retail grocery have gone up on a year-over-year basis. Prices actually had gone down during the COVID crisis within the menu of a restaurant. And I think we're seeing some kind of reestablishment of cost. I heard someone on Squawk this morning actually say this term, reinflation, which is last year was deflationary, and we're actually now kind of getting back to where we would have been if 2020 wouldn't have been what it was. So let's call that a catch-up.  Last point for me, and then I'll talk about what we're doing with our customers. I do expect for the supply-to-demand equation to normalize over time, meaning suppliers will be smart and they'll ramp up demand. And then therefore, some of this inflation pressure will decrease. I just don't know how long it's going to take. What we're doing is we're closely, closely managing this. I think you know we have many contracts that if contracted, it's a percent of COGS or it's a fixed spread to COGS. And also, we have many contracts, local independent customers to be specific, where we do not have contracts.  And Kelly, that's where today, it's mostly manual, done by our sales teams. And we're providing guidance on how to manage it, but it's manual. To your point, the Periscope system that we are deploying will help us greatly on these types of things. We will be much more scientific and specific on how we call specific choices by category on what we want to pass through and what we don't want to pass through and then we can guarantee it is showing up in Sysco Shop in front of the customer.  Unfortunately, as you know, we're still in the middle of that rollout. In fact, we're not in the middle. We're in the beginning part of that rollout. Since last quarter, we've expanded Periscope to 5 additional regions. And we're, in the second half of this calendar year, going to complete that rollout. So yes, Periscope will be a tremendous benefit to these types of environmental conditions in the future. It's exactly why we need the tool. Good question. Thank you for asking.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim.
John Heinbockel: Kevin, one thing that COVID did right is drive existing account vendor consolidation. So what are you seeing in reopened markets? Is that sticking? Are restaurants going back to dealing with more vendors? How are they behaving? And then what are you seeing with sort of your existing account share gains?
Kevin Hourican: Yes, John, thank you for the question. Probably still a little bit too soon to tell. There was definitely a distributor consolidation that took place during COVID. My goal for our company will be, yes, keep it. And I'm sure that will be the goal of all of those that were winners during this market share gain that we have experienced.  I think what you're asking, and I'll just say it pretty bluntly, the biggest players in this space have been net winners since the beginning of this pandemic. And I've been asked point blank, the question is, Kevin, you're saying -- and 2 other big companies are saying you're winning share, how can that be true? How that can be true is if you have the market share of those 3 companies. Together combined, we're less than half of the total in the marketplace. So I think the thesis remains accurate that the strongest and biggest players are succeeding during this environment, and we have no intentions of giving back the market share that we've gained.  Things that we're doing to retain those customers, the Sysco Shop tool is becoming much easier to use, suggested orders, easy reorder button. Other customers like you are buying the following things, work we're going to talk about on Investor Day on something we're calling personalization to improve the relevance of the offers that we provide our customers. They're specifically targeted towards increasing penetration with the customers that we currently serve. There's gold there in them hills, as we like to say. And so again, the biggest players have been successful, us being the largest in this space. We believe we can even further leverage our scale of our purchasing economies, our supply chain economies, and as we get better and smarter, on the promotional offers we provide to our customers. We intend to increase share of wallet and increase customer retention.
John Heinbockel: And secondly, do you have a good sense, the 10% increase in independent customers since '19, where they fall in terms of your average share with them? Is it sort of a ramp-up process? So they're below average? Or have they come on average or above-average in terms of your share?
Kevin Hourican: Yes. Excuse me, that's right. But I apologize, John. I know who you are. I know you live in Staten Island. My apologies for the name slip. Independent new customer wins that we have, are you saying what is our share of them? And how does it compare to our normal book of business?
John Heinbockel: No, I was going to say the 10%, right, that you've picked up since '19, how are they behaving, right? Is there a ramp-up process where they're below average compared to more tenured accounts? Or because of COVID, if they come on and are actually -- your share is higher with those?
Kevin Hourican: Yes. John, thank you for the question. Yes. It's what you said in the first half. They come on smaller. We win X number of lines and cases, and then we earn the right over time to increase it. So that industry historical fact pattern remains to be true. And again, we're plowing through that because we know we can, in fact, succeed in selling around the room. So if we win center of plate, we can sell around the plate. If we win with produce, we can then introduce center of plate. And we're confident we can do that. So the profit per case is fine. It's just the number of cases per unique stop are -- tend to be lower for a new customer win, as you indicated.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley.
John Glass: I wanted to follow-up on the independent comment, Kevin, just a couple of ways. One is you talked about a strategy of going after new cuisine or individual cuisine types. How much evidence was that in this quarter in these new wins? Or was this just broader because the sales force has been refashioned? And similarly, on your pricing tool that you've talked about, I know you're not rolled out yet, but is the net result of that, that you're going to be sharper on pricing? Or is it not that it's simply a pricing transparency, and that just gets you more wins because of that?
Kevin Hourican: Yes. John, great question. I love them both. The first one, which is the cuisine-based selling, what percent of our wins are coming from that. I would say the majority of our new customer prospecting activity is more: a, because we made it a priority; b, the compensation change; c, would be relevant offers to be provided to those customers. And I would put our cuisine-based selling into that third bucket.  I view the cuisine-based selling upside opportunity to be just as much for existing customers. We serve thousands and thousands of Mexican restaurant customers, Asian customers, Italian customers. And what we're doing with our cuisine-based selling program is improving the category strategy to serve those customers, the marketing and merchandising, promotional strategy to serve those customers and then serving them up and teeing them up in a very clear, coherent, cogent digestible manner, both in Sysco Shop and through our sales force. It's kind of a best of both digital and human capital.  We're still in the early innings of that work, to be clear. And we're going to talk about that quite extensively on May 20, what that program looks like, how we will roll that program out. And we look forward to being able to share that with you on that day.
John Glass: Okay. I'm sorry, the second part of that was just on the pricing. You -- is it a sharpening of pricing given the new pricing tool? Or is that just a customer acquisition vehicle to create that transparency that maybe was the block?
Kevin Hourican: Yes, great. As it relates to our strategy, we've been reasonably clear on this one, which is the primary point of our pricing software is to be right on price at the item customer level, to be right on price, which means for KVIs, known value items, we need to be sharper on price. We actually need to lower our prices for those items, which will result in sales increases at a slightly lower margin rate, which flows through to GP dollars being put into the bank.  Simultaneously, we have the opportunity on what we call the tail over our assortment or inelastic SKUs to nominally increase price to be able to offset the investments we're making on the KVIs. So how we've described it in aggregate is, for the most part, margin rate will be flat constant. And this is a sales gain growth opportunity for us as we are right on price, sharper on known value items. And we know that the number one reason why a customer leaves the distributor is because of trust in pricing and fairness in pricing. And we need to tackle that head on.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Great. Actually, just following up, kind of bringing your last discussion together in terms of profitability. We've heard a number of restaurants and some of your distribution peers talking about doing more with less when the sales do recover to prior full strength, presumably leading to upside to, I guess, prior operating or EBITDA margin, whatever you focus on.  But wondering how you specifically think about that, especially as you talk about, in the near term, picking up more SYGMA chain business, which is lower margin. I know you talked about the pricing tools, which you're raising some, maybe lowering others. And I'm just wondering how you think about your operating or EBITDA margin in coming quarters and years post-COVID when sales presumably do get back to full strength, if not beyond. And then I had one follow-up.
Kevin Hourican: Sure. Let me give you the broad answer of our aspiration, which is we expect to grow sales and to increase our profitability over time. Now the down click from that is, of course, we are in a transformation, and we are investing against the portfolio while also taking significant cost out of the business. And so I don't want you to take any one of the factors as far as investing in a SYGMA relationship as indicative of we have any intent other than to grow sales and grow our profitability over time.  At our Investor Day in 2 weeks, since I'm going to ask you to be patient with us at our Investor Day in 2 weeks, we'll give you more visibility to our points of view on fiscal '22, which is approaching rapidly as well as the longer-term algorithm about how we think all these pieces come together.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Got it. And then the follow-up. Aaron, you mentioned a couple of times, debt paydown, which I know over the past few quarters, people were questioning what you're going to do with your stockpile of cash. Just wondering how we should think about whether there's a goal or a time frame in terms of that debt paydown, what that implies for your cash usage. I know you talked about -- talking about cash priorities in a couple of weeks. But just directionally speaking, what are your thoughts on the time frame and the goal for the debt and whether that has any change to how you used to prioritize your cash usage?
Aaron Alt: Sure. Well, as you look back over the last 9 months, what you can see is significant debt paydown in Q1, paydown in Q2. And indeed, we led with the fact that we have paid down debt in Q3 as well. As I look back over the crisis, we did exactly what we should have in the face of the unknown and increasing our balance sheet cash, add-in expense. And as we focus on the longer-term and the overall profitable profile of the business -- profitability profile of the business, given the strong cash that we generate, we have -- I'm not hiding in here by saying we have the opportunity to optimize our capital structure. I'll give you the details of that during Investor Day, but you can take from what we've done a pretty good signal on where we're going.
Operator: Your next question comes from Lauren Silberman with Crédit Suisse.
Lauren Silberman: A little bit of a follow-up to John's question. The 10% more local customers' wallet share gains, and we're seeing improved broad industry same-store sales growth among restaurants. So can you help dimensionalize how much the new customers and wallet share gains are offsetting same-store sales declines amongst existing customers? And then just overall, what are you seeing with respect to recovery for chains versus independents?
Kevin Hourican: Lauren, you were breaking up in the first half of your question a little bit. So I'm going to try to answer what I think was the spirit of your question, but I'll end -- I'll start with the ending, which is chains versus the local independents. The chain universe is covered pretty prolifically publicly, and I think you all know that data. Certainly, the fast food QSR space has been on fire. Anything with a chicken sandwich has been on fire. Our SYGMA sector reflects that double-digit increases to prior year from a sales perspective.  The pleasant surprise in our Q3 and then it's accelerating in our Q4 is the strength of the local independent customer in the fully reopened markets, producing results that are above 2019. That exceeds our expectations. That exceeds Technomic's prediction by about 18 months, frankly. But there are still major geographies that are still closed. I just want to be clear about that. New York, Boston, Chicago, most of California is still confronted with major restrictions. Our European business is still dealing with major restrictions. So we're very optimistic about the health and strength of that local independent customer. It's our most profitable segment, as you well know. And when you combine just the general recovery curve of what independents are doing, coupled with our 10% increase in the number of doors that we serve, when an industry is down 10%, so we have a 20% delta, our number of unique doors versus the industry's overall performance. As we see more markets opening up, reducing restrictions, we have a strong tailwind here in front of us.
Lauren Silberman: Okay. Great. Hopefully, you can hear me better. Just anything you're willing to share specific to April? I think you said U.S. Broadline is down a little over 5%. Local customers in the South running positive sales, together with the new customer wins. Can we assume local case volumes are running about flat at this point?
Kevin Hourican: Well, I think we've shared the level of detail we can for purposes of this call. One of the things we're going to talk about at Investor Day is how we think about the individual components of our customer base. What I would have you take away is certainly with foodservice management still being slow, hospitality not having recovered, the strength -- where you can see the strength in the portfolio is in the independents coming back and in the chains that have been stronger over the course.
Operator: Your next question is from Nicole Miller with Piper Sandler.
Nicole Miller: I wanted to ask first about labor, like an internal reflection, if you would. It's very positive to hear how you're helping your team and then how they help the community on average. I'm curious if you could share a spectrum, meaning I'm sure there's still areas of challenges and offsetting clearly areas of successes. So when I think about labor, clearly, sales is just crushing it out in the field. And then we hear, for example, maybe on the other end of the spectrum, it's hard to get somebody to drive a truck overnight or something like that. But where does -- like the night shift to fill the truck before that truck pulls out, where does that fit in?  Can you just kind of talk through the nuances of how all of this happens and where there's challenges? And I think you've clearly outlined the successes. So thank you, if you can fill that in.
Kevin Hourican: Sure, Nicole. Thank you. It's Kevin. We have 3 major functions in our field. There's the sales function. We call them selectors. Those are the folks that work in the warehouse and then drivers. We're actually going to change the name of the driver piece to be more reflective of the work. We're actually going to start calling them delivery partners because they actually partner with our sales team to activate sales at the local level. But for now, sales consultants, selectors, drivers.  Sales consultants, we're -- that team is just killing it out there right now, as we talked about earlier. We will be in a position of actually adding sales consultants in fiscal 2022 based on the investments we want to make in our team-based selling model. We've said publicly, and we'll talk about it more on May 20, we're going to add more specialists to be able to complement our existing broadline sales consultants.  Warehouse selectors again, as I said a little bit earlier, we pay a very fair wage for those jobs. Those are excellent jobs. And we have a ton of hiring to do. I mentioned that we're going to hire over 6,000 people in total for our spring season. How I would describe our warehouse selectors is we're on track. We manage it day-to-day, week-to-week with hiring goals by site, by location. And we are green, meaning in a good position, green -- not red on our warehouse selector hiring.  The more difficult job to fill at this point in time is our driver job. And it's not because of wage. As I said earlier, our wage for our driver role is terrific. It's about creating more awareness of those jobs. The overall macro impact on drivers is the age of the driver in this country is getting up there. People are retiring, and there's too few people going into that line of work. I would say I'm actually inspired by what United Airlines has done. They have the exact same problem with pilots, and they've just purchased and are going to in-source a pilot school. While I'm not announcing anything today on this call, what I would submit to all of you is Sysco is going to be very progressive and be the industry leader on creating a pipeline of drivers for our long-term success. And we're not going to let it get in the way of our growth.
Aaron Alt: If I could add to that, just to go back to some of the core themes, which is, look, we have significant scale across the industry, and we have capabilities, whether it's with our -- in our buildings with our selectors, with the pipeline on the drivers, with the sales teams. We're an attractive employer in so many ways from a wage of benefit perspective. We don't have the issues that many do in the industry. We have great retention rates in the employees that we have. And as it relates to cost, we have the opportunity. We've already proven, that we can bring -- and we are bringing our costs down so that both we can improve the bottom line, but also we can invest where necessary. And in Q2 and Q3, you've heard us talk about the fact that we are investing in the recovery and investing against our team to be able to drive our successes in enterprise going forward.
Nicole Miller: If I can just sneak in a second and last question, like more of an external reflection, a day in the life of a restaurant that you deliver to. I'm curious about fill rates and the predictive nature of the time window and how that's changing. So again, on average, it's amazing. This is where we do have a little bit more insight. When we look at restaurants, it obviously is mapping and correlating to what you've shared. But some are better off and some are lagging naturally. So if -- I'm tempted, and this is how I'm going to ask because it's probably wrong. I'm tempted to think, "Oh, suburban chain restaurants get everything they need, fill rate, at the window they want and maybe urban local restaurants don't." So again, can you just speak to the spectrum of how it is in the day in the life of a restaurant you deal with?
Kevin Hourican: Cool, thanks for the question. I'll just break it down into 2 parts. One is just the fill rates, as we call it, outbound to our customers, we're experiencing supplier fill rate challenges to Sysco, as are all distributors. We track it by supplier. We are very, very rigorous on our ability to improve those performance data. And for those that can't improve, we move volume from supplier A to supplier B in order to ensure that we can ship to our customers. And we are doing that aggressively right now. We partner with our suppliers. We give a joint business plan. We provide rolling forecasts. But if they can't meet our demand, we're going to find a supplier who can.  The strength of Sysco is because of our size and our scale. We can do that work more effectively than anyone else in this space, which allows us to ship on time and in full to our customers. There are some specific unique products that are really challenging right now, chicken wings, shortening, to be specific, just to provide 2 examples. But we are doing an enormous amount of work to ensure that we can fill customers' orders.  As it relates to on-time delivery, meaning the truck arriving within a window that our customers want, we're actually going to talk about exactly that topic on May 20. Marie Robinson, our Chief Supply Chain Officer, is doing a tremendous amount of work. We're excited about the progress that we are making to be more agile, more flexible and more customer-focused supply chain. We're bringing a mentality of customer-first to work our way back versus what's good for Sysco and fit them into our designed model. So more on that on May 20, and we're excited about talking with you about that.  As it relates to metro versus suburban, yes, I don't think that you should draw a bright line there to say on-time rates or preferred windows are better suburban versus metro. What I would say is something I actually talked about a year ago when we put that project on pause because of COVID and now we're reinvigorating it. Small restaurants in an urban setting have really small backrooms. And they actually need more frequent delivery. And we're going to talk to you about that on May 20.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.
John Ivankoe: So I think, Kevin, in your prepared remarks, you made a comment about independent restaurants or local accounts that were actually outperforming chains in the markets that had reopened '21 versus '19. I guess, did I hear that correctly? And then I'll go from there.
Kevin Hourican: Yes, John, I didn't mean it to come across that way. What I said was local independent restaurants in fully reopened markets are performing better than local independent restaurants in 2019. That, by itself, is a pretty powerful statement.
John Ivankoe: Yes. Well -- okay. Yes. I mean, certainly, I understand that and I didn't mean to screw up the transcript. So forgive me for that. And in terms of the independent restaurants that you have added, it's obviously up 10%. It's a huge number. I mean, do you think there's something different, and maybe I can anticipate your answer a little bit, that makes them much stickier in '21? I mean it used to be, "Hey, these are local accounts. They're not in contract. It's a street fight every day basically to maintain this business." Is it your sense? And are you seeing through your experience of some of your technology initiatives and what have you that are leading to a more predictably sticky consumer -- restaurant consumer than maybe you had at the beginning of your tenure or, I guess, more appropriately, than before your tenure?
Kevin Hourican: It's a great question, and we're going to talk about precisely this topic on May 20. What we're going to unveil at that Investor Day is our strategy to increase retention, increase the stickiness of existing customers that we win and also how we will prospect new customers on an ongoing rate at the level that we currently are. It's an end comment on the independent local customer level, for sure. It always has been, it always will be. But the tools that we're bringing to the industry related to being right on price, having a promotional offer that's relevant and specific to that individual because we know more about them than anyone else because of the amount of data that we have and to provide a merchandising and marketing strategy that meets the needs of those each individual customers, we can do better on all of those things as a company. And we are doing better. And I respectfully and humbly submit, we'll be the best in the industry at doing that. And we look forward to talking to you more about it on the 20th.
John Ivankoe: That's great. And finally, a complete non sequitur. Europe, I don't think there were many, if any, questions on this call about that. Obviously, it's been a challenging market overall. It's been a challenging market for Sysco even before that in terms of integration and what have you. Do you have an opportunity with your balance sheet and the fact that you already have people and assets on the ground to make a bigger bet in Europe? And if there aren't necessarily consolidation opportunities that exist in the U.S. for you to buy distributors, might there be some significant opportunities to really change the landscape of your exposure in Europe and the U.K. and basically buy scale that otherwise you wouldn't be able to get at current prices?
Kevin Hourican: John, thanks for the question. In our prepared remarks for Europe, we spoke of the fact that it is recovering slower, and it's not because of health of restaurants. It's the restrictions. I can go country by country by country if we had time. But essentially, Europe has not yet reopened. We're looking at mid-May of the earliest as to when the restrictions will begin easing with one exception. U.K. opened up outdoor dining 2 weeks ago, and you need a reservation to get an outdoor dining appointment in the U.K. It's being so warmly received. So mid-May to late May is when most of the European countries are going to begin the process of easing restrictions. So it's still a struggle in Europe, but we do anticipate a recovery. There's certainly pent-up demand in Europe for eating at restaurants. And we're confident actually that our ability to succeed in Europe is increasing, not decreasing.  Aaron talked about one. We have a very notable FSM win in the U.K. that we've signed during this pandemic. That will pay dividend in the future when that business begins to recover. We can talk about that more in the future.  As it relates to M&A, we're not going to comment on any M&A activity unless there was activity to comment on. I would say our European strategy is more fix the things that were broken. France, we had some self-inflicted wounds. We have used this crisis to meaningfully stabilize our performance in France. And I would describe France as we're ready now for the reopening of restaurants to be able to win back lost business and to take a significantly expanded product range and go out and start winning business.  In the U.K., our biggest opportunity is to win new independent local customers, and we're going to talk with you about that on May 20. Our new international leader, Tim Ørting, will go actually country by country, explaining our strategy to win in each country.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.

Kevin Hourican: Thank you, Neil. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining our call today. I hope that you and your families are staying safe and healthy. During this morning's call, I will spend time discussing Sysco's recent performance, I will provide an update on our business transformation and I'll share some highlights of our preparation for the pending business environment recovery. I'll then turn it over to Aaron, who will discuss Sysco's second quarter fiscal results. As we have discussed during prior calls, Sysco has taken swift and decisive action throughout the pandemic, to help our customers succeed during a time of disruption. We have carefully managed our associate productivity, inventory productivity and business investments. To that end, we initiated a bold business transformation to strategically transform our Company for long-term success. I am pleased to confirm that our business transformation remains on track and we are confident that the strategic initiatives will enable profitable future growth and will differentiate Sysco from our competitors. The COVID environment has placed substantial restrictions upon the customers we serve in the food away from home sector and has disrupted our marketplace. In light of those realities, we are pleased with the financial results that we delivered in the first half of fiscal 2021 and for the second quarter, we performed generally in line with our expectations adjusted for the environment. While our second quarter financial results were down compared to prior year, we delivered a profitable quarter, despite 23% decline in our topline sales and funded investments to enable our transformation. Our customers experienced increasingly restrictive conditions on their operations during the second quarter, which were most notable in December, when restaurant traffic and sales declined. Additionally, our International segment has been hard hit due to tougher restrictions in the countries in which we operate. At Sysco, we are not taking the restrictions on customers as a gravity issue. We are doing more than ever before to help our customers navigate this challenging environment. I am pleased to report that during the second quarter, Sysco gained overall market share versus the rest of the industry, reflecting the early progress of our transformation and the success we are having in winning new business. We continue to win meaningful business in the national account space and signed an incremental $200 million of net new business in the quarter, which totals more than $1.5 billion of net new contracted business since the start of the pandemic. Additionally, throughout the second quarter, we began making investments in preparation for the business recovery that we believe will begin in calendar year 2021. Those investments will increase in the third fiscal quarter and Aaron will speak more to this in a moment. Examples of investments during the second quarter include investments in our customers, in our people, in our working capital and in our technology. I'd like to highlight some examples of each of these purposeful choices. Investments in our customers, including our new Restaurants Rising campaign, which makes it easier for restaurants to succeed and strengthen their business for the future. A visual representation of our Restaurants Rising campaign can be found on Page 6 of our presentation. Most notably, we announced in November that we are eliminating minimum delivery requirements for regularly scheduled delivery days, which provides operators significant flexibility in managing their business and makes it easier to order what they need, when they need it. In addition, we are not eliminating delivery service days during the second wave of COVID. On practice, we know what select competition is currently doing. We see the light at the end of the tunnel and as such, we are prioritizing customer service. A little incremental expense right now is a small price to pay for customer loyalty and partnership. Our sales consultants are leveraging the Restaurants Rising program to retain current customers and help Sysco attract and serve new ones. In addition, to the no order minimums commitment, Sysco sales consultants are assisting their customers with setting up touchless menus, optimizing delivery and takeout operations and helping with marketing programs to create awareness of our customers' operations, just to name a few of our value-added services. I am proud to report that our net promoter score increased by more than 1,000 basis points in the quarter. Due in large part to the connections with our customers generated by the Restaurant Rising program. The NPS increase was our largest quarterly increase in our Company's history. Importantly, as you can see on Page 7 in our Slides, the incremental closure rate of Sysco's customers is 50% below the industry average. And lastly, we on-boarded more new local customers in Q2, than in any single quarter in the last five years. In addition to investing in our customers, we are making investments in our people. We are intentionally retaining drivers despite the volume decline in December to ensure we have them available for our pending volume recovery. Drivers are in short supply across the country and while this investment will drive some incremental transportation expense in the short-term, over the long-term, it will help ensure that Sysco is able to maximize our share gains during the upcoming business recovery. As you know, we made changes to our sales organization and sales compensation during the summer. Our associate retention has improved compared to historical retention rates and our improved retention will help with sales productivity metrics in the future. We are beginning to make investments in working capital to position the right products, in the right locations in preparation for the upcoming business recovery. Sysco has the broadest inventory assortment in the industry. Our ability to ship product on time and in full during the upcoming period of volume recovery is a core element of what makes Sysco the strongest broadline distributor in the industry. We have the financial strength and capacity to invest in products and in inventory, while other Foodservice distributors may struggle with sufficient cash flow to make similar investments in the coming quarters. We are also offering payment plans in partnership with our customers to ensure their continuity. Lastly, we are making strategic investments in our technology to improve the customer experience. This includes our Sysco Shop technology, our new pricing software and improvements we are making in our supply chain systems. Sysco's ability to invest in our customers, our people, our inventory and our technology, while delivering a profitable quarter during this pandemic, is a testament to the strength of our balance sheet and our leadership team. I'd like to turn now to providing an update on our business transformation. First, as we have shared previously, we are focused on advancing our customer-facing digital tools to improve the customers' experience with Sysco and drive incremental sales. Priority number one, is improving our mobile ordering platform, Sysco Shop. Notably, we are now on-boarding new customers in less than 24 hours, a step change improvement. The number of customer orders placed through Sysco Shop continues to meaningfully increase throughout the quarter. Additionally, our new pricing software is now live in our first test region. We are learning a lot through this regional pilot and we remain on track to rollout the pricing system across the country. The goal of this effort is to improve pricing transparency with our customers and drive incremental sales in gross profit growth by optimizing prices at the customer item level. Additionally, by automating customer-level pricing, we will free up time for our valued sales consultants to spend with customers on value-added activities, such as menu design, Sysco brand penetration and other drivers of sales and margin. Second, we are improving our go-to-market selling strategy by transforming our sales process. Through our sales transformation, we have an improved, more customer-centric organizational structure. Our sales transformation is progressing well and the team-based selling approach is gaining traction. We have created and built new specialist selling positions, we have implemented a sales quarter back position that helps guide the collective sales teams across a given geography. As I mentioned on our last call, we have launched our first cuisine segment go-to-market selling strategy and we are seeing initial signs of success with that customer segment through incremental market share gains. We will roll out this program to additional cuisine segments in calendar 2021. Lastly, Sysco completed the regionalization of our field leadership structure at the start of our second quarter. I am pleased to report that our new regional Presidents are in place and are finding quick wins to improve our business. The average tenure of our market and regional leaders is over 20 years and these experienced and talented leaders are highly capable of driving top performance within Sysco. Examples of quick wins include, optimizing our inventory assortment across multiple physical sites and optimizing the servicing of key customers by ensuring the most efficient physical location, services, each customer location. To be a great Company, you need to have a world-class leadership team. I am pleased that during the quarter we made important progress in strengthening our leadership team. Aaron Alt joined Sysco as our Chief Financial Officer. Aaron, is with us today and you'll be hearing from him next. Aaron is a proven finance leader with over 20 years of experience in Foodservice and retail leadership positions. He has a track record of transformation in a value creation at large organizations in multiple industries. Additionally, Tom Peck has joined Sysco as Chief Information and Digital Officer. Tom has experience leading Enterprise Information Technology Strategy, Services, Operations, Risks and Cyber Security for large global enterprises. In his most recent role, he worked for a global B2B distributor in the electronics industry, experience that is directly applicable to the transformational journey at Sysco. Additionally, Tim Orting has officially started his position, leading our International division. Tim will be based in our London offices and will be responsible for driving profitable growth and operational excellence across our international geographies. With Tim joining Sysco, I was able to reduce the number of my direct reports by four, which allows me to focus more of my time and energy on managing the strategy development and execution of the Company. Joel Grade has begun his new role leading business development and is actively engaged in identifying new sources of growth for Sysco. I'm pleased to say that the transition of Sysco's leadership team is now complete. We have a strong management team, that balances Sysco and Foodservice industry expertise, with best-in-class experience from other industries. Our new leaders join a talented and experienced Sysco leadership team. Greg Bertrand, the leader of our U.S. business, has over 35 years of industry experience and 30 years specific with Sysco. Greg's expertise and steady hand in running our largest business during the COVID disruption, has been invaluable. I appreciate his leadership and the strong impact he has on our results. Great leadership teams work as a team on a common agenda. Our transformation strategy has galvanized this leadership team around a common purpose and I am honored to work with them to set the standard for Foodservice distribution for many years to come. I report to you today with strong confidence, that our pending business recovery sits before us. As vaccine administration makes progress across the globe, the restrictions currently placed upon our customers will begin to ease. We can see in our performance data, that once restrictions ease, consumers are ready and willing to eat away from home. At Sysco, we are working to maximize our opportunity to recover faster than the industry. We have an opportunity to gain market share, given our financial strength and our compelling business transformation. We are prepared to do more than any other Foodservice distributor in the industry, to ensure the success of our customers. And our customer success will generate business growth for Sysco. In closing, I'd like to give a sincere thank you to all Sysco associates, who are working hard to help our customers grow and succeed in this challenging environment. Our industry-leading salesforce has been inspired by the Restaurants Rising campaign to support our customers at levels higher than any point in our proud history. Our warehouse and delivery associates are the best in the business, working hard every day to ensure we ship to our customers what they want, when they need it. I am proud of their dedication during this challenging operating time. I also want to thank our customers for their resilience. The grit that they have shown and the fight that they have displayed during this pandemic. At Sysco, our customers are an inspiration to us and we will show them just as much determination in how we serve them. I will now turn the call over to Aaron Alt, who will discuss our second quarter results, along with additional financial details. Aaron, welcome to Sysco and over to you.
Aaron Alt: Thank you, Kevin and good morning. I am really excited to be at Sysco. Before I joined Sysco, what I could see from the outside, was a Company with global scale, a strong competitive position and great profitability and liquidity for the industry. Now that I'm on the inside, I see all of that, in addition to a driven leadership team relentlessly focused on being ready for the business recovery and then driving a customer and capability-led transformation. In short, I see many opportunities in front of us to create shareholder value. I will start today with second quarter results for the enterprise and our business segments, followed by an update on cash flow. Second quarter sales were $11.6 billion, a decrease of 23.1% from the prior year, but flat to the prior quarter. Sales had been trending ahead of Q1 through October and November, as restrictions eased. But new lockdown restrictions during December reversed the earlier progress, particularly in the International segment. There are a couple of additional metrics. For the quarter, local case volume within U.S. Broadline operations decreased 19.7%, while total case volume within U.S. Broadline operations decreased 23.7%. We do know that there is keen interest in the continued impact of COVID. The answer varies by region. Europe went into lockdown in December and is expected to remain in varying degrees of lockdown for a significant portion of the second half. However, since the week after the holidays, we have been seeing signs of light, from volume improvements in our U.S. FS business and SYGMA continues to grow. This battle will be fought week-by-week, region-by-region for the next couple of quarters, until the vaccination is widespread and the business recovery takes hold. The only commitment we can make is that we will be ready and more competitive than ever. As we move down the P&L, gross profit decreased 25.8% to $2.1 billion in the second quarter. Most of the decline in gross profit was driven by lower volumes due to COVID. However, we did see modest gross margin dilution at the enterprise level of roughly 67 basis points, as our rate came in at 18.2%. A couple of thoughts on that. First, we typically see a seasonal decline in gross margin sequentially from the first quarter through the second quarter as we did this year. Second, our largest segment, U.S. Foodservice and its partner segment SYGMA each had a flat gross margin rate versus the same pre-COVID quarter, which is frankly remarkable given the market dynamics. Given the growth of our national accounts business at SYGMA, which is lower margin, we did see business mix shift, which accounted for the vast majority of the margin rate change. Our enterprise margin was also impacted by the International and other businesses, as both showed gross margin decline in the quarter for reasons which are being addressed. Our expense profile changed over the course of our second quarter, as adjusted operating expense decreased 15.3% to $1.9 billion. This expense profile reflects a deleverage of our cost structure as sales remain down 23%. These results arise from some purposeful choices. First and on the positive side of the equation, we targeted and achieved increased productivity in key areas such as our warehouse network. We also maintained our key transportation efficiency metrics despite significant swings in case volume. Second, we continue to make excellent progress against our $350 million of cost savings initiatives in fiscal 2021. I can see the savings in the detailed income statement and we continue to identify and pursue more opportunities. Third, but on the other side of the equation, we have made the purposeful choice to leverage our financial strength, to prepare for the business recovery before it happens. As previously announced, we changed our sales consultant compensation to include both our fixed and variable component to drive retention and focus on key operational metrics. We can see that change working in our market wins. Additionally, we brought back hundreds of associates in the second quarter in support of our business model. In the third quarter, and indeed the back half, we anticipate we will hire thousands of additional sales consultants, new business developers, culinary experts and operations associates in anticipation of the pending business recovery. We plan to be ahead of the recovery curve, not catching up and we have the financial resources to do just that. Finally, as Kevin mentioned, we continue to make purposeful investments in our capability builds, in support of our transformation, pricing, customer experience, sales, vendor management and personalization. While we expect significant returns on these efforts in future quarters, the investment dollars are offsetting part of our savings in the second quarter and will do so in the back half. When combined with the impact of slower openings in our International segment, we expect our third quarter results to be more challenging than originally anticipated. However, as volume returns and grows, whether due to market recovery or our purposeful investments, we expect to move up the sales curve more rapidly than others and expect that over the next several quarters, the impact of the cost savings efforts separate from the ongoing investments, will be more visible. Finally, at the enterprise level, adjusted operating income decreased 63% to $234 million. For the second quarter, our non-GAAP tax rate of 16.8% was favorably driven by the impact of stock option exercises. Adjusted earnings per share decreased 80% to $0.17 for the quarter. Now, let's turn to our second quarter results by business segment, starting with the U.S. Foodservice Operations. Sales were $8 billion, which was a decrease of 23.9% versus the prior year period. Notwithstanding the difficult environment, the business acquired a record number of new customers, as our sales teams set the streak and we deployed digital tools. We also saw growth in our national accounts customer base. Within the business, Sysco brand sales for the second quarter decreased a 165 basis points to 36.5% for total U.S. cases, driven by the customer and product mix shift. With respect to local U.S. cases, Sysco brand sales decreased 455 basis points to 42%, which was driven by product mix shift in the prepackaged and takeaway ready products. Gross profit decreased 24% to $1.6 billion for the quarter. And as I called out earlier, gross margin was flat for the quarter at 19.7% as the business very successfully managed through the puts and takes of the COVID environment and addressed headwinds such as aged inventory for customers like cruise lines and product mix shift out of higher margin categories like PP&E. The segment's adjusted operating expenses decreased 18.9% to $1.1 billion and adjusted operating income decreased 33% to $472 million. Moving on to the SYGMA segment. Sales increased 4% to $1.5 billion compared to the prior-year period, driven by the success of national and regional quick service restaurant servicing drive-through traffic. This is the second consecutive quarter of sales growth in this segment. We continue to see new business wins in the SYGMA segment and are pleased by the overall improvement. Gross profit increased 4.1% to $129 million for the quarter and gross margin was flat to the prior year. Adjusted operating expenses increased 4% or $118 million and adjusted operating income increased 5% to $11 million. Moving to the International segment, our European, Canadian and Latin American businesses have been substantially impacted by recent lockdowns, which are more aggressive than lockdowns in the U.S. The International Foodservice Operations segment saw sales of $2 billion, a decrease of 32%, while gross profit decreased 36.2% and gross margin decreased a 128 basis points. The gross margin decline was a result of adverse market mix, customer mix, product mix and aged inventory. For the International segment, adjusted operating expenses decreased 16% and adjusted operating income decreased 175% for an operating loss of $55 million. Our other segment, which includes our Guest Worldwide business remains challenged, as hospitality occupancy rates remain low compared to prior year levels. However, the business is in better shape than many of its competitors and has achieved a number of recent customer wins, including being named a preferred distributor for Renaissance hotels, JW Marriott and Western hotels via a new contract with Avendra in both the U.S. and Canada and been given access to all Marriott properties in North America, Central America and the Caribbean. While still in turnaround mode in a difficult hospitality environment, the business improved its underlying profitability during the second quarter. Cash flow from operations was $937 million for the first half of fiscal 2021. Free cash flow was $788 million year-to-date, which is in line with our previously noted guidance. Net CapEx for the first half of fiscal 2021 was $148 million, which was $235 million lower than last year, as the Company carefully assessed its capital investment choices in the face of COVID. Sysco remains financially strong from a balance sheet perspective. At quarter end, we had balance sheet cash of $5.8 billion plus access to $2 billion of available borrowing capacity for a total of $7.8 billion. Our cash and available liquidity ensures us the stability and flexibility to make decisions that are in the best interest of the Company. We continue to monitor our operating environment carefully and as we assess reopening timelines and investment needs, consistent with the transformation, we will be updating our views of our levels of cash and capital structure opportunities in future calls. Although this is a tough operating environment for our customers, which will impact our results for the next quarter or two, Sysco remains resolutely focused on managing its businesses, aggressively preparing for the business recovery and building customer-centric capabilities to accelerate long-term growth. We believe our strategy and our transformational initiatives will drive future value for our associates, shareholders and customers. Operator, we are now ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Alex Slagle with Jefferies. Go ahead please. Your line is open.
Alex Slagle: Kevin, a question for you with full year under your belt now, congrats on that. Interested in your high level assessment of the progress made in the transformational to-date versus your expectations. Obviously the pandemic was a major curve ball, but if you could talk about what elements of the transformation surprised you the most, in terms of the level of progress or the size of opportunities that you may be didn't fully appreciate when you started?
Kevin Hourican: Well, good morning, Alex. I appreciate the question. In regards to the where we are one year later, I'm pleased with where we are. I would actually say from a transformation perspective, we're ahead of schedule. I've said this many, many times in our Company town hall meetings and in private conversations with investors as well. The COVID crisis has obviously been tremendously difficult on the customers that we serve and our environment overall. The silver lining in that dark cloud is, we've used it as an opportunity to accelerate our transformation. I've mentioned before, our regionalization program, we had a plan to complete that over two years and it's now done as you heard me say on our prepared remarks on today's call. So our ability to accelerate change management, the buy-in from our experienced team on the impetus for change meaningfully improved. And so when you look at our selling model, our leadership model, our technology tools, I would say we're ahead of schedule on those activities and I'm pleased with where we are and we're very confident that these transformation initiatives are going to enable our Company to be very successful. What we need obviously, the overall business environment to improve for all of those activities to be more visible in our results than they currently are. But we can see the internal data and it's promising. Alex, the last thing I would just say is, we're a team. To have a great Company, you need to have a great team, and I said in my prepared remarks. We have a really strong team now that we've built at Sysco which is a combination of extremely experienced leaders like Greg Bertrand, who runs ours by far largest business and new leaders that have joined our Company that can help bring best practices from other industries and frankly key capabilities that we need at our Company, like Judy who has joined us as our Chief Commercial Officer, Tom Peck, who has joined us from a technology perspective. And then obviously Aaron, who you heard from today, who is just a really terrific talented financial executive in transformation executive to help accelerate our results. So, in summary, Alex, I would say, I think we're ahead of schedule and I'm looking forward like all of you are, to have COVID behind us, so we can prove it in our outcomes.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. Go ahead please. Your line is open.
Edward Kelly: Kevin and Aaron, this is a particularly tough period to sort of model your Company. So, obviously you're positioning for the recovery, which makes a ton of sense, that's hurting near term results, especially when the industry sees some setback. I guess what I'm trying to figure out is how to better sort of frame what's going on in the outlook. So, I don't know if you can tell us sort of what level of sales, your cost base is positioned for currently? How you see this ramping from here? I don't know if there is a way to sort of frame that for us, as we sort of think about Q3. You did mentioned that Q3 will be lower than initially thought. I'm not really sure what that means relative to Q2. So, I'm just kind of curious as to whether you could sort of help us along with any of that to help the modeling in the next few quarters.
Kevin Hourican: Great Ed thanks, this is Kevin. I'll start and I'm going to toss it over to Aaron for comments specific to Q3. And we understand that this was a difficult quarter to model and a difficult year to model. And we also have respect and empathy due to the fact that we haven't given guidance this year. And the reason obviously is because it's choppy and the recovery is not linear. So, we're going to do the best we can to give you color commentary on where we are and what we're seeing. And Aaron will provide that in a moment for Q3. As it relates to what we're investing in, if you put it into two buckets, we have some key initiatives that we are investing in, which is the building of capabilities and in many instances technology, that will advance our ability to be a better Company in the future and that's our pricing project. We're building a customer personalization engine to improve the type of offers that we provide to our customers using machine learning and predictive analytics to help our sales force being - be more effective. We're going to talk with you more about that in Investor Day that we plan on holding in May. Neil will send out more details on that Investor Day. We know we owe you more specifics on our transformation, the size of that price and we will cover those details with you at that May Investor Day. As it relates to the other half of the quote investments, we do see a pending business recovery. We see a light at the end of the tunnel. And it's not a train coming towards us, it's the dawning of a new more promising day. We can see it in our data. Here are the facts behind what happens. As soon as restaurant restrictions are eased, our business immediately pops and how do we know that. We know that because states like, Florida and Texas with the limited restrictions, our business is substantially better than our national average. We can see it in states like California, which just allowed for at the state level, the reopening of outdoor dining, which is important in a state that has quality weather and state of New York has now begun the easing of restrictions, with New York City reporting this week that Valentine's Day in restaurant dining will be authorized again. So we see immediate jumps in our business when that happens. The reason you're hearing some tempering of enthusiasm from us, specific to Q3, is we have an International business that is under severe lockdown. You probably all know this, but I just want to be really clear about this. In International, specifically Europe, restaurants are closed. Europe is currently in operating conditions that are similar to what the United States was experiencing back in April and May. In London, for instance, you can only leave your house for an hour a day, you can only go to the grocery store and to the park and you need to stay within 5 kilometers of your home. I mean, it's that locked down. And they don't have drive-through's to the degree that we have them in the United States. So in the Europe business, our sales have been significantly impacted. Most notably, the European governments have come out and said that they don't anticipate easing those restrictions until roughly Easter. So, we're going to be really careful and thoughtful in Europe. We will move at a slower pace in Europe and we will meet our investments in that business, tied to that businesses recovery. But in the United States, we believe that the progress that's being made in vaccination is substantial, the at-risk population being protected, now moving on to category-1b, 1c and eventually categories two and three. As vaccines make progress, as the death rate comes down, as ICU bed capacity improves, that will give governors, the confidence to ease restrictions and when that happens, our business immediately pops. So, we need to do things in preparation for that and that's what Aaron is referring to. We need to get inventory back into our facilities. We need to staff up in both warehouse and in driver positions to ensure that when our customers are ready to place orders, we're not putting out a job-req and trying to fill a job and then the time delay that comes along with that. So, we have the financial strength to do that. It's a purposeful choice. And I'll just leave you yet with this last comment, then I'm going to toss to Aaron. And choices in service right now, we had to cut delivery frequency back in what is our period of April, May and June of last fiscal year. We've purposely chosen not to do that at this time. We are servicing our customers 6 plus days a week. We're not cutting delivery frequency, we waived order minimums. All of these things are to help our customers during their difficult COVID wave two, and that's a choice we made, we believe that's a choice that will pay itself forward with loyalty and future growth. And that 1,000 basis points of NPS improvement that I covered in my prepared remarks, that is a notable notable reflection. And those that understand NPS, understand that that is a pay it forward metric, that will benefit our Company into the future. So, Aaron, I'll toss it over to you specific to Q3, if there's anything you wanted to add to that.
Aaron Alt: Great. And good morning, thanks for the question. We don't provide quarterly guidance per se. But what I'd like to do is take a moment and give you some context on Q3, by talking a bit more about Q2 and what we saw there, I believe there are some parallels. As you will have observed from our release and from the comments, we experienced deleveraging during the second quarter as sales dropped 23% from prior year. And you will recall from prior earnings calls, that Joel had previously observed that our cost structure is approximately a one-third, two-third split between fixed and variable costs. And you can do the math on what that could mean for the quarter versus our prior year. I would comment that we benefited extensively from efficiency efforts and I called up some of them during the call. And specific identified and executed cost savings during the quarter. The quarterly component of the $350 million that the team has been talking about for the last couple of quarters. I commented during the results, that we could see the savings in the P&L. And let me give you a couple of examples of that. People, overall across the enterprise, we have 15,100 fewer employees today, than we did a year ago and that includes a significant cut at our corporate headquarters, as well. We've identified and executed specific COGS cost savings that I can see in the P&L. We've rationalized our technology investments to be more forward or focused. We've identified indirect cost savings, professional costs, etc. So, what I want you to take away is the cost savings are real. And while we haven't disclosed the exact level of what it is quarter-to-quarter, it's material and they're out there. Now, the cost savings are important because they offset a combination of two things going on and I would have you think about it is really call it a 50/50 spread. The first is, as Kevin just talked about, we did make incremental investments against both the business recovery and the transformation in the quarter. We purposely used some of our savings from those cost savings initiatives to fund the investments against these short-term recovery and the long-term transformation. And then there was a mix of other one-time expenses or additional fixed cost deleveraging that we experienced. In those corporate what was going on in Europe and other parts of our network. To summarize, we do believe that some incremental expense now is worth it and it gets us ready for the recovery to come. Some of the investments in cost that I called out earlier will continue into the back half, particularly into Q3. We want to be transparent about that. But importantly, as we get into the true end of the year and into next year, those same savings they are structural, they're recurring, they are real and they will become much more apparent as we reverse the sales decline and get the early investments and they recover in the transformation behind us.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Go ahead please. Your line is open.
Jeffrey Bernstein: I had one question and then one follow-up. The question just, when we get through COVID at some point sooner rather than later. When you think about the largest Foodservice distributors, including yourselves, I'm just wondering whether you think you'd achieve greater benefit on the revenue or the expense line. I know you've targeted on both, but just wondering your thoughts on where the bigger opportunity is? And if you could just offer some context on the small and mid-sized competitors, especially as you talk about these market share gains, it is very difficult on our end to see the market share gains. But any qualitative color on those competitive sets that would be great. And then I had one follow-up.
Kevin Hourican: Sure, Jeff. And it's Kevin. I'll take that one. Just, it's a both end on the strength of the stronger players, right, strength gets stronger during times of adversity and crisis. And what Aaron was just referring to is the $350 million of cost takeout is real, it's concrete and we can track it. And as our volume gets back to pre-COVID levels and it will, that's going to flow straight to the bottom line. The reason it's less visible now is because we have all these other things happening vis-à-vis investments and the recovery, investments and new capabilities, etc, etc. But that $350 million is hard real and it will be visible as our volume recovers. So, and we're not done. We've said that before too. We are not done with structural cost improvement. There is more to be attained. And again, that's something we can talk about more at our May Investor Day. Specific on the revenue side, the number we've quoted explicitly as the national sales win, it's impressive, it's material, $1.5 billion of net new wins in the National Sales segment. You can see it in our performance results in SYGMA and also you can see it in our performance results in just our general overall case growth. But what we haven't explicitly quantified for you because it's challenging with what's happening in the marketplace, is the wins we're having at the local level. In my prepared remarks, I said the following. We won more new customers at the independent local level in Q2, than at any point in time over the last five years. That's just concrete and specific as I can be and it's real, we can track it. We use a tool called Sysco 360 to track every customer activity. Those wins are going to be visible again as our volume recovers. The reason it's less visible on topline growth is because the average order per customer is currently down because of COVID. In a takeout and delivery world, customers order fewer advertisers, fewer desserts, they spend - they focus more on that main entree. And so the average volume per customer is down, but we've added a substantial number of new customers. And that's not just in the U.S., that applies to Canada, that applies to all of our businesses in Europe as well. So that will be a pay it forward activity. And what we anticipate we will be able to show you at our May Investor Day is, what is the size of the prize of all of these activities were. The trajectory that we are on from a sales growth perspective. And then these key enabling transformational elements what they're worth from a market share capture perspective. And then how that flows through to the bottom line. Before we go to your follow-up, I'll just ask Aaron, if there's anything he wants to add, to what I just said.
Aaron Alt: No Kevin, I think the two thoughts are, a rising tide lifts all boats, and we're going to experience that as the sales recovery continues and to the point on profitability, I think we should just remind the team that, look, as I believe the team commented earlier, we're profitable as sales are down even 30% to 35%. And so, we have incredible financial strength and opportunity to get ready for that sales lift.
Kevin Hourican: Thanks Aaron. Jeff, do you have a follow-up?
Jeffrey Bernstein: Yes. Thank you very much. So I know it's difficult in the short-term and not keen to necessarily give third quarter or second half guidance. But you did make a couple of comments, I was hoping for a little color on, I know you mentioned regional sales structure, quick wins and menu segmentation success kind of quicker wins I guess. And I think you even said U.S. Food and SYGMA has been growing of late. I was wondering if there is any quantification you can provide on any of that, just so we can kind of gauge early success? Thanks.
Kevin Hourican: Yeah, Jeff, I know it's frustrating that we're not giving guidance. And we're going to resist that doing so, again for Q3. I can however, put a little more color around the examples that I was just providing. And I also realize that the second half of your first question, which was tied to the smaller competitors, how are they performing. I didn't sufficiently answer that on the first question. There is no doubt that the bigger players are getting stronger. I have been asked to directly before, Kevin, how is it true that each of the major players are reporting that they are winning market share. Well, it is true. That is what is happening. And what that mathematically implies is that smaller players are currently donating share. Most likely because they don't have the ability to invest in inventory during a period of volume growth. We know for a fact that select competitors are cutting delivery frequency, they cut Saturday first, they cut Wednesday second. We have not done that, Jeff. So, we have not canceled Saturday, we have not canceled Wednesday. In fact, as you well know, we eliminated order minimums. We are seeing improvement in our trends for the customers that we serve as those programs have been launched, which is Restaurants Rising. And we are seeing retention of customers, because we're not cutting back on service. A data point that I've quoted before is, for those customers that have joined us on this Restaurant Rising campaign, leveraging our menu services, leveraging our ability to help them with takeout and delivery, they are performing 20% on average, better than the customers that choose not to engage. Our priority obviously is to get more and more and more of them engaged and we're working on that. The second one, I just take you to Page 7 in our deck and that is the closure rate of Sysco customers. So this chart has been normalized to - normal year would be at zero and our closure rate of our customers is 50% lower than the national average. And this data doesn't come from our internal systems, this data comes from the out. So, as I put a 1,000 basis points improvement in NPS, we have won more new customers in this quarter than in 5-plus years. When I put the closure rate of our customers, it's 50% less than the industry average. And then we can see market share gains. These things give you confidence that Sysco will be a net winner in the business and when you layer on the future periods, where others are going to meaningfully struggle, Joel made this point many different times, others are going to going to really struggle with building inventory in advance of the sales actually hitting their business, because that's a period of balance sheet stress. We have the capability, because the strength of our balance sheet to build inventory in advance of the customer ordering, Jeff, that's a big deal.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nicole Miller with Piper Sandler. Go ahead please. Your line is open.
Nicole Miller: Two quick questions. I'll pose the first one. I believe the prior run rate on the $350 million of cost saves was about 80% flow through. So, what I think I hear you saying this quarter is, you reinvested more against that and we can understand why. So, what was the approximate flow through? I just haven't been able to work with the numbers at this point? And you also mentioned one-time expenses, how material are those one-time expenses, so we can factor that into our forward estimates?
Kevin Hourican: Hey Nicole, I'll toss it to Aaron for that question. Thank you for the question.
Aaron Alt: Nicole, good morning. Great question. I would refer you back to some of the thoughts I had earlier around how to think about this. We have not disclosed the build rates of the $350 million plus of synergies. Our cost savings that we are identifying as we carry forward. As you're trying to model, what I would encourage you to do is to look at or reflect on my comments that, approximately 50% of what we saw in the quarter was our investments against the transformation and against the business recovery and 50% was one-time expenses or additional fixed cost deleveraging in product portfolio. That's interesting, but the really important point is that, look, the one-time costs, they are one-time and will go away and any fixed cost deleveraging as the tide rises with sales, that will also disappear and the investments against the recovery and the against - our investments against the transformation, while they may occur for a couple of quarters, they are also transitory in nature and we will have the - we'll have the benefit of achieving the run rate savings that Joel had called out previously, in future quarters. Our situation has evolved. We're continuing to evolve to bob and weave, reflecting our financial strength, because we're going to be ahead of the curve.
Nicole Miller: I guess that was previously asked and answered. I guess I just didn't understand it that way. So, we can do the math on that 50%. A bigger picture question. Trying to understand if retention of your own employees and net promoter score should be tied together. So, I guess the question I would pose is, you talked about retention being improved and I'm wondering if that's the right way to ask or to tie those two things together. So this question might sound challenging, it's literally not meant to be. But, when you're forced to turnover right and where what anyone else go, so I mean indeed retention by definition always has to improve. So, I was wondering if, are people making more or less? Are you offering more benefits, what kind of feedback? And is that the correlation to net promoter scores? If it is, as net promoter scores go up, what happens then? I mean I know it's sales, but could you tie that for example to wallet share of independents, which is 30% versus 40% chain. Did local independent wallet share go up? I just wanted to see how it kind of ties together, if that makes sense? Thank you.
Kevin Hourican: And Nicole, it's a great question. And by no means is it a challenging question. It's the spirit of your question is excellent and I appreciate you're asking it. I'm going to unpack that in two ways. One is, NPS is our customers voice to us and we have a large sample size, we track it real time and we take action on it. And we see in our NPS data, where we have strength. The by far biggest strength of Sysco is our sales consultants. We massively over index our competitors in the quality and support given to our customers through that audience. By far our biggest strength is our sales consultants. Such a strength we will continue to leverage and I'm going to get to that in a minute, when I talk about what I meant by associate retention. So, we need to continue to harness impact further leverage our biggest strength. And Nicole, what we need to do on NPS to make it overall improve and that is address the pain points right. So, here are things we were hearing through this COVID crisis, as a pain point. Kevin, my volume is down, but yet you have these order minimums. You're willing to come one-time per week during this period of time when my volume is down, because you cut Saturday delivery. So, we just leaned into it and we addressed it hard. What we did is, we ensured that this COVID wave two, we were not going to cut delivery frequency. And the biggest pain point we heard was from our restaurant operators. I can't predict what my order volume is going to be, and I'm really worried about your minimum orders and we eliminated that problem for them. We just took it off the table. From now, through the end of this crisis and it very well might be permanent, we are not asking for order minimums. We're here to ship what they need, when they need it, regardless of the order volume on a regularly scheduled delivery date and we're not going to cut delivery frequency. So, Nicole here is what happened. The associate piece of the NPS Survey got even higher, because our sales consultants are leaning into helping restaurant operators with menu design and takeout and delivery, and hooking them up with a delivery partner. And then the pain point of delivery, we meaningfully improved, you put the two together, we saw 1,000 basis points there. What that will do for our business, in the future is higher customer retention and higher share of wallet. If you study the NPS, it's a lag, right. So as you improve NPS meaningfully, it is in the forward facing quarters and into years, when that results in higher retention and higher share of wallet. It's not an immediate A than B. But we're confident that we're doing the right things in support of our customers and they will reward us with business. What I referred to in my script as it relates to associate retention was tied to our sales consultant compensation change that we made this summer. So why we made the sales compensation change was twofold. One, we had some disincentives in our old structure that motivated our sales consultants to do some things that were inconsistent with our Company's strategy, point one. Point two, we had too much turnover, especially in our newer associates. They were on a full commission previously and they just simply in those early years couldn't earn enough when they were on full commission, to make it through their learning curve as they built their business. In our new model, we have a base plus bonus structure, where they make a livable wage off of their base and then they have the opportunity to make a very healthy income through their bonus. That was implemented this summer. Change is hard, when you implement a new tool like that. But statistically and significantly, statistically, excuse me, statistically significant, I meant to say, we are seeing improvements in retention and it's not just because we reduced the number of people earlier in the year. It is because actually the folks that we're tracking that have been here before, during and after COVID, we're seeing retention at a higher rate attributable to that change in comp. But Nicole, I'll toss it back to you to see if there is any follow-up to anything I just said.
Nicole Miller: That actually helped me out a lot. I appreciate that color. Thank you for taking my questions.
Kevin Hourican: Thanks, Nicole.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead please. Your line is open.
John Glass: Kevin, just going back to this wallet share issue and I think you talked about that 30% historically with the local cases. Has that changed meaningfully recently during this pandemic? And if you - inside of that, when you talk about these value-added services in the restaurants have done much better using those, is your wallet share meaningfully higher? Is there a way to gauge how high it could go if they - customers fully engage in all the services you provide to them?
Kevin Hourican: Yes, John, great question. I'm not going to report out on share of wallet percent by month or by quarter. There's too much volatility in that type of a metric to be that specific on the call. What I can definitely say however is that for the customers that have engaged with us, on the Restaurants Rising campaign, yes, we win more share of wallet with them and we retain them. There is a lot of churn in this industry, many customers use multiple distributors, two or three distributors and there are reasons why they do that. And what we're seeing in the Restaurants Rising campaign and the work we're doing with our transformation is that our customer is less needing to have multiple distributors. I'll introduce one of our other strategic initiatives, which is our pricing initiative. The number one reason why a customer leaves Sysco to go to a competitor and vice versa frankly, is because of price. And specifically, transparency for price. They think they can get a price somewhere else or they want to keep their distributor honest by taking portions of their business and bringing it to a competitor. As we implement our pricing software and we give customer items specific pricing, pricing that's right at the item level, we believe that we will lose less individual lines to competitors tied to price. And frankly, the opposite, we'll have the opportunity to win incremental cases with existing customers, because we will be light on price for the items that matter, which will drive volume growth and how to keep margins neutral is on - in the elastic items that are on the tail of the inventory assortment, you can take some nominal increases on price to offset the margin dilution. All in, we are bullish on our ability to increase share of wallet. When we meet in May at our Investor Day, we'll be able to explain in more detail. And what we believe is possible from a share of wallet growth perspective, but we have customers to answer your question specifically that are well north of 30% with Sysco.
John Glass: That's helpful. If I could just ask one follow-up, on the International, how much of the programs you've implemented the U.S.? Whether it's Restaurants Rising or the price tool. How many of those are applicable to the international business? How many have been implemented? Is that a real opportunity there or is it just a very different market and those things don't always apply?
Kevin Hourican: Oh it's a huge opportunity for International and it's why we hired Tim. Tim is here, he is now on board. He is based in London as I said, he will be full time focused on improving our strategy and our execution in International. And remit will be exactly what you were just implying to your question, which is, okay, you're deploying a best-in-class pricing tool, one where and how do you deploy that to your European businesses. We're working on a new team-based selling strategy, when and where and how do you deploy that. Each of these key initiatives are applicable in our International business segments hard stop. What is unique in these countries is the cuisine type and specifically the penetration mix of local versus contract bid. But the best-in-class strategies of how to sell, how to engage customers with a mobile ordering platform, improving COGS through a global purchasing scale. We're in the early innings of these things in International and actually that gives me big confidence that we can improve the profitability of our International segment. It's something that Aaron, myself and Tim will be very focused on.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Partners. Go ahead please. Your line is open.
John Heinbockel: So, Kevin two questions related. Number one, you talked about bringing back or bringing on thousands of sales related folks. What's the timing of that? Where will they come from, right. And then secondarily, if you think about the rollout of pricing right, so tested in one region, what's the pace of that roll out? Then how do you think about the interplay between bringing on a lot of folks, managing the recovery and rolling up and expanding pricing, can that all be done simultaneously?
Kevin Hourican: John, good question, as always. I just want to clarify one thing on the thousands comment, that was in Aaron's prepared remarks. That thousands applied to each of the things that we're after, what he said, he said, sales associates, warehouse associates, drivers and support resources. So, the thousands declarative applies to the team, the cumulative of all of them. So we're not going to be hiring thousands of new sales associates. We will hire new sales associates. We're hiring new specialists. We're hiring national business developers. I'm sorry, new business developers, NBD's is what they call them, to grow our business. But the majority of the thousands comment is actually in the warehouse and driver populations, simply tied to the business volume recovery that we anticipate. As Aaron quoted, we have 15,000 fewer people working for us today, than we did pre-COVID. And we will and expect to get back to pre-COVID volume levels down the road and we need to hire up to be able to staff up, to be able to support that business recovery. I just want to be really clear, it's not - today, it's zero and tomorrow, it's thousand, it's a week-by-week staffing plan and we will be able to throttle that up and throttle it down based upon what we see and our data. But they need to be trained. It takes X number of weeks to become productive in our warehouse and it takes X-plus even more to become productive as a driver. And as you know, it takes time to become productive as a sales associate as well. So, we're building the restraining durations of time into our staffing model, John. And when we say invest in advance of the recovery, what I'm specifically referring to is the training window. If it takes X weeks to get productive, we need to hire that person X weeks before they're needed and then we have a week-by-week-by-week expectation of what we anticipate the volume recovery will be, to tie to that staffing plan. If the volume recovery doesn't materialize, the way that we anticipate, we will slow down. If the volume recovery is faster than what we anticipate, then we'll speed up. The good news is, we have the financial capability to do both of those two things. And then John, your second part of your question was on pricing, as always, it's a good one, but that'll be a staggered rollout. So we're in our first region right now. We're not going to go from one region pilot to a national rollout. We learned a lot at Sysco over the years on how to roll out new tools, new software, change management and the like. The good news is that this pricing software is being warmly embraced by our sales consultants. It takes a significant component of the work off their plate, time that they can then reinvest back into their customers, as I said in my prepared remarks. And I just want to be really crystal clear about something. We will not be reducing sales consultants, because of our pricing tool, because time is freed up for them, it's the opposite. We will take that time that gets freed up on their work week and invest it back into our customers. And John, we're optimistic that that will help from a sales growth perspective as well. So we're going to do our regional pilot that we're currently in, we will expand to four additional regions in this Q3 period. And then we will read and react based on the business results, the change management learnings and then John we will determine the pace with which we will bring it to the rest of the country. And I don't have a declarative end date for that project, because I want the success of the project and the change management learnings to determine the speed and pace with which we go. John, I'll toss it back to you, if you have any follow-up.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Silberman with Credit Suisse. Go ahead please. Your line is open.
Lauren Silberman: Thanks and congrats on the new role. You talked about the very strong wins at the local level. Are there any differences in the behavior among new local customer cohorts relative to what you've seen historically? Whether that's initial wallet share, Sysco brand penetration, digital utilization. And to what extent do you think that's Company specific initiatives versus the competitive environment? Just trying to understand how you're thinking about the sustainability of these wins, given some unique dynamics in the environment like smaller distributors pulling back on frequency, delivery drops and less need for multiple distributors.
Kevin Hourican: Lauren, good question. There is the behavior change that drove it and it's really clear, we changed their compensation. In the prior compensation model, they were paid more on increase the profitability of an existing customer, than they were on win new business. That's what I meant earlier when I said we had a disincentive in our system. That was never our intention. We didn't want for them to not be out prospecting. But if they had an hour to spend, they were going to spend that hour on increasing the profitability of an existing customer and they weren't going to spend it on prospecting. In our new compensation model, which is the base plus bonus, the bonus metrics are configurable, we can make them whatever we want them to be. In fact we can change them quarter-to-quarter, month-to-month on what matters and we've been doing exactly that. So, now we have a better balance between improving penetration of lines with existing customers, which is a profit driver and it's super important and we need to better balance it with new customer prospecting. So, the biggest reason for our improvement in our performance, Lauren, and new customer growth is a behavior change. Our associates are spending much more time with new customer prospecting than they were previously. And the point you made which was now, how do you retain these customers is paramount. Partly it's the reason why we're investing in service, why we're investing in no order minimums, why we're investing in not cutting back on delivery frequency. Things like that matter. I don't think I've talked about this yet, we're also investing in payment plans. So, that we can help our customers with their credit balances through this difficult period of time and not cutting them off because they're having some challenges. We negotiate with each customer one-by-one using a predictive model on risk for that customer. And we're helping them, we're helping to make payment plans spread out, smoothed out, so that they can stay with us. And it will be imperative, Lauren to do what you said, which is we need to retain these new wins. We need to work on things like Sysco brand penetration for these new wins to increase the profit rate of each of them. We need to add more lines. And that's where our new selling model comes in and this is the last thing, I'll say. We need to penetrate other additional categories. They could be buying dry and frozen from us and they've never considered a broadliner for fresh produce. Guess what, we have one of the best fresh produce businesses in the United States. We turn that inventory on a weekly basis and we can penetrate produce if we introduce the right sales person to that customer. So, those are the activities. Win the new customer through improved prospecting. Once that customer has been won, penetrate Sysco lines, increase additional categories, provide them with tremendous service and retention will meet or beat expectations. Lauren, back to you, if you have a follow-up.
Lauren Silberman: Yes, just one quick one. On Sysco brand sales as a percentage of local cases, the down 450 basis points. Can you expand on the factors that drove that decrease in the private label penetration and do you expect that to be largely transitory?
Kevin Hourican: It's a 100% transitory, Lauren. The reason for Sysco brand penetration being down is explicitly the customers that we're serving, and also the balance of sales by category. So, the business that's down the most for Sysco right now is actually our biggest business - our biggest customer businesses. So, it's the FSM and hospitality categories. We have an excellent Sysco brand penetration with those customers and those businesses are down more than our average and therefore that's just a gravity issue on Sysco brand. And then, believe it or not, within the businesses that are doing well right now, like takeout products, to go products, there isn't a lot of brand - Sysco brand product in that space, to the degree that we have in other categories. So, it's simply balance of sale. And we have the opportunity to not just to recover where we've been, our merchant team is working on new products in innovation within Sysco brand and we absolutely anticipate that to be a source of profit growth into the future.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital. Go ahead please. Your line is open.
Kelly Bania: Wanted to just ask a little bit more about International gross margin. It sounds like some mix pressures there but also maybe some inventory. Just curious if you can manage that gross margin better? It was just a little surprising that it was lower than it was even a couple of quarters ago, when sales were even worse. So, just curious how we should think about what you can do to manage that margin in International? And if there is anything different either thinking about in terms of the longer term potential recovery for International versus the U.S.?
Kevin Hourican: Yes, Kelly, great question. I'll start and then at the end, I'll toss it over to Aaron for color commentary, in addition to what I cover. So, International margin we called it out. I mean, it was a difficult quarter from an International perspective. There's two reasons why. One is the customer mix, just to be very clear. Restaurants are closed in France, in the U.K. and in Ireland. They're closed. Unlike in the United States where on-prem dining is allowed and delivery and takeout and drive-throughs are robust, our most profitable customer segment in Europe is closed. They can do takeout and delivery but takeout and delivery are much, much less activated, than they are in the United States. And we anticipate they will be closed until April. So we've got a meaningful headwind in that regard. I'm going to weave in here the point you made about long-term. I just want to remind everybody that rate before CVOID wave two, the best business in our entire book of business was in France. We are minus 5% in France, right before the challenges of this secondary lockdown. So we fully anticipate that the International business will respond just as fast, if not even faster than the United States, once these lockdowns are eased and again it's frustrating to us that we think that they're talking Easter. But we can focus on what we can control. So, the margin percent is mostly driven by customer penetration mix. We did have some inventory spoilage challenges, Kelly. It's appropriate to call it out. Our business results in Q2, I think about it from this perspective, France goes from minus 5% to minus 55% in a week. We have fresh inventory. There is challenges when that happens. And the pace in speed with which Europe went into lockdown was significant. Similar to what happened If you remember back in Q4. You remember my narrative Kelly from back in Q4. Here's what I said. Europe entered the lockdown earlier and swifter and came out later and slower. And I anticipate that same thing is going to happen with this second wave. But we have full expectations that we will come out strong, it's going to take longer. Aaron, I'm going to toss it to you, if there is anything you would like to add or if I missed anything.
Aaron Alt: Thank you, Kevin and good morning, Kelly. Three quick adds. First, Kelly, as we all know what's really important is dollars in the bank. Gross profit dollars in the bank and so, our first objective with Europe is just to get the business back up and running and contributing to the bottom line. Kevin did an excellent job of covering two of the primary drivers on the rates impact of International. But I do want - when he talks about the customers being closed on the inventory obsolescence. But I do want to call out two additional elements. One is product mix shift, where across our International operations, on-premises dining is not available, but takeout or takeaway is, right, we do have a product mix shift into products and support of that is lower margin. And then lastly, perhaps most materially, we have some business mix shift going on where with France closed and other operations in Europe constrained, we've actually mixed into our Canadian contract business, which is lower margin for within the International segment you're seeing there in some of the numbers.
Kelly Bania: And then if I can just follow up with one more on market share, a lot have been addressed there already and it sounds like more will become visible in May with respect to the local side of that equation in U.S., but in terms of the $1.5 billion for National Accounts, which is pretty substantial, I guess the question is, how much of that is a function of what Sysco is doing and the strategy that you're pursuing versus the function of the circumstances with competitors and National Accounts, looking for solution and with at Sysco
Kevin Hourican: Yes. Kelly, great question. The majority of our transformation is at the local level, because that's where the profit is the highest, it's where we have the greatest opportunity to profitably grow and that's where our new business operating model will have the greatest dividend and we'll be clear about that in May on the vectors of growth, how each of these transformation initiatives drives improved business performance. At the national level, to oversimplify, the reason we're doing so well with new business capture is, these large national customers are looking for a distributor that they have confidence in, that they believe in, that can ship - and this is simple - I know this, on time and in full and be able to stock. The inventory that they need to be able to deliver for their thousands of locations. They have tremendous confidence that Sysco is that partner, and we have been very successful in the contract bids this summer and into this fall and Kelly, one reason why we've been able to be more successful there is, we put focus on it. We use this expression, fish where the fish are, we can see the restaurant ticket data from all the banks and the credit cards, seeing how well QSR is doing and we needed to win where the growth was happening and we have the capacity to do it, Kelly, because our overall business volume is down and as our business volume recovers, you might be thinking, well Kevin, what's that going to do to your storage and throughput capacity, we're working aggressively on that. And there are several things that we can do to make more room in our warehouses for this incremental volume, so that it is flowing through to the bottom line, like Aaron said, the way they needed to. Skew rationalization between sites, slower moving inventory being pulled out of forward facing locations, etc. These are things we can do to improve the throughput of our warehouses, to allow us to be able to support the substantial business win that we've had, $1.5 billion net, since the beginning of this crisis. So, it is as simple as, they trust us, we can do the business at a national level. And that business is available for us from a winning perspective. What we need to do is, make sure it's sufficiently profitable business for us. And here's my commitment to all of our investors, we will not bid on business that isn't profitable for our Company and we have been very, very disciplined in the contracts that we've underwritten since the beginning of this crisis.
Operator: And our last question of the day comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Go ahead please. Your line is open. And John Ivankoe, your line is open. If you're on mute, please unmute your line.
John Ivankoe: Can you hear me?
Kevin Hourican: We can John.
John Ivankoe: Excellent sorry, now you're on speaker, I don't know what's wrong with my headset. Of the 8% or 9% of customers, that closed to roll and obviously your share was 50% better than that. Can you kind of bucket them in any types of categories, whether it's region or city or suburb or - or customer type, is kind of the first point. And do you see distributors in particular that disproportionately serve those types of customers that may finally get the consolidation in the delivery space and a lot of us thought would have happened at some point in 2020 and I have follow-ups on that as well.
Kevin Hourican: Yes, it's a great question. I think it would be fair to say the following, the hardest restricted markets, so the urban areas are where the closure rate is higher than the places that have fewer restrictions, which would be the Southern third of the United States and more rural geographies. So, I think that would be a fair thing to communicate and it's obvious, right, where the restrictions are the greatest, that's where the closures are the highest. John, we're not seeing any specific cuisine type having a higher rate of closure and again, on the closure side, is it temporary, is it permanent, what I've been pretty consistent from the beginning of this crisis to communicate, is we believe there will be an elevation in churn over this tumultuous period. But from an overall bankruptcy rate perspective or the number of doors in the market two years from now, I don't believe it's going to be meaningfully different than the number we have now. There'll be an elevation in churn, but there is not going to be a substantial, substantial reduction in customer doors. I know that select agencies have come out and said bold statistics like 30% to 40% bankruptcies. It's just not what we see, it's not what we see in our data. As I've said before, if a person owns their family restaurant and this is what they've done for 25 years, they're not going to close and become a plumber, they may have to temporary close, when they have to close that business to restructure their debt and that's what, they're probably going to reopen a restaurant at some point in time. So, we believe the independent restaurant customers are fighters, as I said in my prepared remarks and they're doing a terrific job in light of the conditions that they're dealing with, to stay in business and we're proud of the work that we're doing. You said you had a follow-up John, so I'm going to toss it back to you.
John Ivankoe: Yes. On that first question, then also I'm going to point about Europe, given your cash flow, given your cash, when does it or does it make sense to be opportunistic in a difficult to enter urban markets from a Foodservice distributor perspective and maybe by some share as opposed to just winning it organically. First question, in the United States. And secondly, I mean I would think there would be some conversations with Europe right now what's either, hey, let's scale out of a market that's always more difficult to do business than the U.S. or maybe it's time to double down in Europe in some way, where is your current thinking in terms of the continent?
Kevin Hourican: Okay, John. Thank you. Two part question, I'll do the first part. I'll say a couple of comments on International and Aaron, I'm going to toss it to you, if there's anything you want to add to the International part of that question. Your question, John on the first part was, metro markets where, I've told you previously we under index as a percent of our total. In fact, it was a year ago today that I told you that, that was going to be a big focus of our Company, that we could win in the metro markets. And John, that still exists, that is still absolutely an opportunity for this Company. I put that project on pause, given places like New York and Chicago and LA are wholes for business, figure of speech only, and it wouldn't have been a prudent time for us to do that. We have a couple of pilots going, we can talk more about this in May. This is one of our vectors of growth, is to improve our performance in those metro markets. We have a very significant financial opportunity, when we close the gap at those metro markets to our national total, from a sales and profit growth perspective and it's more John of a supply chain opportunity than it is anything else. We need to deliver more frequently to those customers. We need to do same-day next-day delivery to those customers, as you know, they've got these tiny back rooms, they can't have big bulk storage, they need produce delivered on a daily basis and we've got the capability of doing that. I don't want to let the cat out of the bag, but we've got a couple of pilots undergoing that are showing promise. And you're going to see more from Sysco in that capability. A more insightful part of your question was, and so when is the right time and I heard you loud and clear and we're working on that. I don't have anything declarative to say today on the when, other than, we have the ability to invest when we see an activity that will be promising for us and that will be an area where Sysco improves our capabilities and we fully expect to be able to win profitable business. The good thing about that business is, as you know, that is a higher profit percentage than other customer types. So, it's a pretty attractive market for us. On the International side, I haven't talk as much about the new customer wins in International, because that business is right now doing poorly in aggregate versus the rest of our business, because as Aaron said, the fixed cost deleverage and the overall sales being down, but just in the last quarter, not included actually in the $200 million that I quoted, we have a notable win with a very large customer in Europe - excuse me, in the U.K., we have a notable win in Sweden, we have a notable win in Ireland, John we're starting to make traction on new customer wins of substance and what we need to do in addition to that though, is win at the local level. And that's been challenging during this crisis, because most of our customers in places like Paris, actually closed. The government schemes are so robust in France, that it's actually more profitable for the restaurant in France to actually temporarily close than to stay open. So, it's pretty hard to win new customers when the customers you are trying to serve are closed. But, we're going to go after it hard when those markets reopen. A combination of wins at the national level and then incremental wins at the local level. The question I was asked, 10 minutes ago on, can you bring some of these U.S. best practices across the pond and we fully intend to do that. Aaron, I'll throw it to you for final word. And then, I have one comment I want to make about our Q3 trends that I didn't get a chance to cover yet, to close out the call. Aaron, over to you, please.
Aaron Alt: And here's what I would say, given our strength across the portfolio, Sysco has every right to win Internationally, the way that it does domestically. From a sense of magnitude perspective, our International portfolio is Canada, the U.K., France, Sweden, Ireland and then Latin America from a scale perspective. That's just a contextual point. And from what I can see in early days is, we have real pockets of strength in Canada, the U.K., Sweden and Ireland and parts of Latin America. But we also have some opportunities to improve and the team is working hard against those, notwithstanding the COVID crisis. I'm still getting to know the teams in the businesses, that would be unfair for me to comment on any one part of the business. But, one commitment, I can make is that, our management team will regularly assess our portfolio and where we need to, we'll take some action. And you saw us do that recently - most recently in Spain when we divested the Davigel business. So, I'm excited to get know the business better and as I said, we have every right to - every right to win Internationally as well.
John Ivankoe: Great. Thank you.
Kevin Hourican: John, I appreciate the question and I know we're over time. We appreciate everyone's patience and staying on past top of the hour. Thank you for that. Thank you for your interest in Sysco and I just want to leave you with one statement of optimism. I know we talked about December being a really tough month for us and that the quarter had sequentially been decelerating, we're seeing the opposite in Q3, which is a good thing. Our January month which just closed performed better than December and we are seeing sequential improvement in our business trends. I'm even more optimistic into these forward facing months as there is a restrictions that are placed upon our customers ease. And it's all going to be tied to the progress that we make in vaccine administration. I think you all know, I worked in healthcare for eight years, before I came here, that the news is giving a doomsday scenario on vaccine administration. It's going better than the news is covering it. And what happens next is, vaccines are going to begin to be distributed in places like Walmart and Walgreens and CVS. And when we can get 40,000 places in this country administering vaccines and can make meaningful progress on fighting this COVID crisis, we're going to see governments be much more willing to ease restrictions. And even places like U.K., who are in complete lockdown, U.K. as a country is doing a terrific job with vaccine administration and that's going to provide an opportunity for our business recovery in calendar 2021 and we're poised and ready to take advantage of it. Neil, I'm going to toss it over to you, if there's anything else to close out the call.
Neil Russell: Thank you, Kevin and I just want to reiterate your thanks to our investors and analysts who have joined us today. Thank you very much for your interest in our Company. If you need anything else, please feel free to follow up with us. So, James, the operator, over to you to go ahead and close this out.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, once again, we do want to thank you for attending today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q1  (2020-11-03 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to Sysco's First Quarter Fiscal 2021 Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. We will begin with opening remarks and introductions. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Neil Russell, Vice President of Corporate Affairs. Please go ahead.
Neil Russell: Good morning everyone and welcome to Sysco's first quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call.

And as an additional remainder fiscal 2021 is a 53-week year for Sysco. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Kevin Hourican.
Kevin Hourican: Thank you, Neil, and good morning everyone, and thank you for joining our call. I hope that you and your families are staying safe and healthy during these unprecedented times. During this morning's call, I'll spend time discussing Sysco's management of the COVID-19 crisis, how we are strategically transforming the company to better serve our customers and grow the business and finally I'll update everyone on the current state of our business environment. I'll then turn it over to Joel, who will discuss Sysco's first quarter financial results. Earlier this morning, Sysco reported first quarter fiscal year 2021 results that included substantial free cash flow and $365 million of adjusted operating income, despite a 23% sales decline. We are pleased with these financial results in light of the significant constraints that are being placed upon our customers due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Sysco is doing more than anyone in the food service distribution industry to ensure the success of the restaurants and customers that we serve. The impact of these efforts can be seen in the success of customers that we serve, relative to the broader industry. Sysco customers are closing at a lower percentage and are generally outperforming the broader food-away-from-home industry. Our leadership team is focused on managing the day-to-day business, supporting our customers and delivering upon the largest business transformation in our company's history. This is important as our transformation will enable Sysco to further differentiate from our competition and better serve our diverse customer segments. Examples of Sysco's management of the crisis during the first quarter include more than $8 billion of cash and available liquidity, which ensures we have financial flexibility in this difficult operating environment. Sysco is leading the industry with the work that we are doing to help our restaurant customers succeed, delivering holiday toolkits for restaurant tours, creating marketplace pop-up shops, providing solutions to extend the outdoor dining season and finally our culinary experts are helping restaurants narrow their menu to increase profitability and tailor their offerings for takeout and delivery effectiveness. Since pictures are worth a thousand words, I call your attention to page number five of our presentation. The right hand side of the chart shows an example of what we mean when we say extends in the patio season. This is one of many solutions that our sales consultants are presenting to our customers to help them extend their outdoor season. The left hand side of the page is a visual of one of our latest foodie solutions, a holiday seasoned selling guide for our customers to leverage to maximize sales during what will be a unique time holiday season in 2020. Importantly, we added $300 million in net new business in the first quarter, which totals more than 1.3 billion of new national business since the start of the pandemic. In addition to these wins at the national level, we are winning new customers at the local level at an accelerated rate compared to prior year, due to an increased focus on prospecting new customers across our salesforce. At Sysco, we have the salesforce strength and supply chain capacity to continue winning new business at both the national and local level. These customer wins will enable Sysco to recover faster than the overall market as economic conditions improve. This is evidenced by our current share gains in the overall marketplace. Most importantly, we are leveraging the crisis to transform our company and I am proud of the work our associates have done to accelerate our strategic transformation. Here at Sysco, we are successfully navigating through the biggest crisis in our industry's history, and we are substantially transforming our company for the future. Our business transformation is on track. We are continuing work on our bold transformation that improves how we serve our customers, differentiates Sysco from our competitors and transforms the industry. We are making substantial progress against the four crucial priorities we have shared with you previously. We are accelerating efforts across our customer facing tools and technology, which includes improving our digital order entry platform, Sysco Shop, our CRM tool in implementing a centralized pricing tool. Through these technologies, we'll improve the service to our customers. By the end of the first quarter, the percentage of orders being placed through Sysco Shop increased to approximately 60%. This substantial increase is a direct result of the improvements we are making to the Shop platform combined with the consultation that our salesforce has been providing customers on how best to utilize the tools that we have built and soliciting that customer's feedback on what customers most wants to see in the Sysco Shop platform. This is a great example of how we leverage the power of a human and digital capital. Additionally, we are on track to begin piloting our new pricing software later this month. Our sales transformation is centered around elevating our selling effectiveness with an improved more customer centric structure. We will utilize data and analytics to help identify customer sales prospects and have a new sales leadership structure that will allocate our talented resources most effectively against those opportunities. Later this fiscal year, we will be leveraging our new sales process to pilot our first meaningfully improved customer engagement strategy. This program will better address the needs of specific customer segments, which will enable us to grow share. Regionalization within our U.S. Broadline business is also on track. It is the key enabler of our other U.S. transformation initiatives and we are happy to say it is now complete. Our new leadership team is fully in place, and we are seeing early wins from this new structure as a result of the strength of the leadership team that was selected for these important roles. Lastly through our structural cost-out efforts, we are making significant progress in becoming a more efficient company. We are on track to deliver the $350 million structural savings we communicated in our most recent call. As a reminder, the vast majority will flow through to the bottom line. We are committed to returning value to our shareholders and funding our growth agenda, and we have a line of sight to additional savings starting in fiscal 2022 and beyond. I am pleased today to welcome Judy Sansone to Sysco as Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer. She is an experienced and highly talented leader, who consistently delivers results and drives transformative change. This newly created leadership role will bring marketing, merchandising, pricing strategy, customer loyalty and e-commerce together under one leader, creating a compelling opportunity for us to develop a commercial organization focused on profitably growing sales and inspiring customers to buy more from Sysco. Judy started with the company in October. Additionally in August, we announced our new international business leader, Tim Orting, who will be joining the company soon. Tim is an experienced and highly talented European leader, who has spent his career in the food industry. He will be responsible for driving profitable growth and operational excellence across our international geographies. It is clear that we are strengthening our leadership team and increasing our organizational capabilities for the future. I will now transition to the current business environment in the pace of our recovery. From a top-line sales perspective, the rate of sales for the quarter was consistent with our internal projections for business recovery. We saw a steady week-over-week improvement in sales at the beginning of the quarter and the leveling of the improvement as we exited the quarter. Our road to full recovery will be non-linear. We remained vigilant in the current environment as new restrictions on our customers in the second quarter are stalling the recovery at approximately minus 20% compared to the prior year with potential for worsening results due to the additional COVID restrictions. Where restrictions have eased however, consumers are showing that they are ready to eat away from home. Southern states and more rural geographies continue to meaningfully outperform national averages. Restrictions on customers, plus or minus, will be the primary driver of the pace of our business recovery until vaccines are more broadly available. Subsequent to the end of the first quarter, select geographies are experiencing increased restrictions on restaurant operations. We expect these restrictions to impact second quarter sales results, particularly in Europe. I will note that at Sysco, we are more prepared now than ever to handle business disruption. From inventory management, debt collections and operations efficiencies, we are better prepared for the potential impact of a second wave on our business. As a reminder, despite the profound impact of COVID on the business climate during the first quarter, Sysco produced positive adjusted operating income and very strong positive free cash flow for the first quarter. Sysco is focused on supporting our customers throughout this fluid operating environment and our strategy is to continue to provide robust support to our customers to help them succeed. We have hosted hundreds of webinars with customers and our industry leading salesforce has conducted tens of thousands of business reviews to help our customers succeed during this challenging environment. Recent business consultations are focused on succeeding during the upcoming winter season. We fully recognize that we must go further to ensure our customers' success and there is no company doing more to help independent restaurants succeed than Sysco. As a result, our customer closure rate is lower than the industry average. The customers that have engaged with Sysco on these consultative services are outperforming the general market from a sales perspective, and we are winning overall market share during this challenging environment due to our focus on new customer prospecting. I wanted to give you a heartfelt thanks to all of our Sysco associates, who continue to help our customers grow and succeed in this challenging environment. As essential workers, I am proud of your dedication and resolute focus on our customers during these challenging times. I'll now turn it over to Joel, who will discuss our first quarter results along with additional financial details. Joel, over to you.
Joel Grade: Thank you, Kevin. Good morning everyone. I want to start-off by reminding everyone that fiscal year 2021 is a 53-week year for Sysco. We will begin prepared remarks with first quarter results for Sysco and results by business segment followed by an update on cash flow and capital spend for the quarter. Our total Sysco results for the first quarter include a sales decrease of 23% to $11.8 billion. Local case volume within U.S. Broadline operations decreased 21.6% while total case volumes within U.S. Broadline operations decreased 25.8%. Gross profit decreased 25% to $2.2 billion and gross margin decreased 39 basis points. We had a relatively flat exit rates for gross margins in the quarter, which was driven by favorable margins in the paper and disposables category and specifically in PPE. There's an impact to our margin comparison primarily driven by increased sales of PPE products with some margin favorability. Margins within this category have now normalized as demand has begun to stabilize. Adjusted operating expense decreased 16% to $1.9 billion. Expense management during the first quarter was strong due to the initiatives that we've executed thus far. We remain on track to meet the $350 million of structural savings we communicated in our fourth quarter earnings call. And as a reminder, the vast majority of these savings will flow through to the bottom line, while a push into the cost savings will be reinvested into our growth agenda. Adjusted operating income decreased 51% to $365 million. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the first quarter was 19.7%, which is lower than usual, and it was driven by the favorable impacts of equity compensation and other factors. Adjusted earnings per share decreased 65% to $0.34 for the quarter. During the second half of fiscal 2020, Sysco recognized $323 million of excess bad debt expense due primarily to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. That amount represented our best estimate of what we expected the charges to be at that period in time. During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we experienced better than expected collections as both the resilience of our local customers has been stronger than expected, and our teams have done tremendous work to improve processes around collections. As a result, we recorded a net reduction of $77.8 million in our allowance for bad debts in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Regarding an update on our customer segments, during the quarter we saw better than expected performance from local customers, specifically independent customers as they're growing at an accelerated rate compared to total customer growth. Additionally, restaurants performed better than expected including improved performance throughout the first quarter in SYGMA, as we're seeing continued resiliency in the industry. Healthcare performed well throughout the first quarter, which was offset by continued weakness in our food service management and hospitality segments. I’ll now transition to our quarterly results by business segment starting with U.S. Food Service operations. Sales for the first quarter were $7.9 billion, which was a decrease of 26% versus the prior year period. Gross profits decreased 25% to $1.6 billion for the quarter and gross margin increased 7 basis points to 20.2%. Sysco Brand sales for the first quarter increased 15 basis points to 38.8% of total U.S. cases, which was driven by customer mix shift in brand penetration in certain categories. With respect to local U.S. cases, Sysco Brand sales decreased to 106 basis points to 46.3%. Our adjusted operating expenses decreased 19% to $1.1 billion and adjusted operating income decreased 37% to $503 million. Within our International Foodservice Operations segment sales decreased 26%, gross profits decreased 26% and gross margin increased 4 basis points. Adjusted operating expenses decreased 15% and adjusted operating income decreased 81% to $19 million. Our European business performed well throughout the first quarter considering COVID. However, we continue to be cautious of new regulations and changing restrictions throughout France, Ireland and the United Kingdom. In Canada, the business performed within expectations for the quarter. Within Latin America, business was on-track as local economies slowly reopened throughout Mexico, Costa Rica and Panama. Moving on to the SYGMA segment, sales increased 5% to $1.5 billion compared to prior year period, as quick-service and drive-through restaurants continue to thrive compared to other restaurant types and we are winning new business. Gross profit increased 4% to $132 million for the quarter, and gross margin declined by 7 basis points. Adjusted operating expenses increased 4% to $120 million and adjusted operating income increased 15% to $12 million. In the other segment, our hospitality business, Guest Worldwide, remains challenged as the customers in that segment continue to see lower hospitality occupancy rates compared to normal levels. Lastly, as you may recall, during the quarter, we sold a non-core asset, Cake, as we choose to narrow our business focus. As such Cake will no longer be in the other segments going forward. Turning to cash flow and working capital. For the first quarter, cash flow from operations was $931 million; free cash flow was $862 million, which was substantially higher than the same period last year. Historically, the first half of the fiscal year provides lower cash flow for Sysco. However, this year, we saw a positive DSO and working capital environment, which included a benefit from accounts payable and a diminished use of cash in both accounts receivable and inventory. We are pleased with the work we have done to improve the cash cycle throughout the past two quarters. This includes work we have done to tighten up terms on new sales to customers, as well as through supplier term extensions. Net CapEx for the first 13 weeks of fiscal 2021 was $102.4 million lower compared to the prior period. As a result of our substantially reduced capital expenditures that were directed only to urgent projects and targeted strategic investments that you heard Kevin talked about earlier in his remarks. I am pleased with this strong cash flow performance during the year quarter. Looking ahead, the free cash flow for the remainder of the fiscal year, we anticipate that free cash flow will initially decline for the next quarter or two due to the building of inventory and ongoing investments in the business. That will be offset by anticipated free cash flow generation in the fourth quarter. Free cash flow for the full fiscal year is expected to end flat to slightly positive compared to the end of the first quarter. Lastly, I'm proud to say that Sysco remains financially strong from a balance sheet perspective. As of November 3, 2020, we have more than $8 billion of cash and available liquidity, which ensures us the stability and flexibility to make decisions that are in the best interest of the company. We continue to take definitive steps for the cash we have in our balance sheet. We redeemed early $750 million of our outstanding senior notes in September, and paid down $1 billion on our revolving credit facility since the start of the pandemic. This leaves us with a remaining outstanding balance of $700 million or $1.3 billion in available borrowings on our $2 billion revolving credit facility. Throughout the first quarter, we maintained our strong liquidity position and were able to fund the redemption of the senior notes with the free cash flow generated in the quarter. With that said, I want to remind everyone that Sysco went into this crisis in a position of strength. Although it has been a tough operating environment we have managed well through the crisis and have taken advantage of the opportunities that crisis presents to make bold transformational changes. We have prioritized supporting our customers in this dynamic operating environment, and we believe our strategy will continue to drive future value and growth for our associates, shareholders and customers. And with that operator we are now ready for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Kelly Bania from BMO Capital. Your line is open.
Kelly Bania: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking our questions. Joel and Kevin, I was wondering if you could maybe just talk a little bit more about the underlying assumptions in those free cash flow projections that you just talked about for fiscal 2021, especially in light of way; maybe what you're seeing right now in the business?
Joel Grade: Sure, Kelly. It's Joel. I'll take that. Thanks for the question. A couple of key points I think that are important to remember as we talk about the free cash flow and specifically the modeling. Number one, we've continued to have positive improvement in our working capital trends. And I think, one of the things that we've done a really good job of adding that that's really across all different categories of working capital, Kelly. Our payable terms as we talked about, our collections on our receivables, and our overall cash cycles has gotten better throughout this crisis, which is I think really important. And so in addition to that, we've done a really good job managing our inventories in terms of being able to have product availability, but also do so in a way that is again working capital efficiency. So we do anticipate many of those trends to continue, but I'll make a point there. As the year continues and as our business continues to build back and as we certainly do anticipate some of those trends continuing to improve and then obviously as we head into a fourth quarter, where we're certainly anticipating a sizeable year-over-year improvement, that's going to require a working capital investment. And in some cases again fairly a substantial one of this business comes back, and that's one of the things we talked about early in the crisis as one of the areas where Sysco has a significant opportunity to do some things. And I think others in this industry are going to struggle with. As that business comes back, we'll be able to make those investments, but that is certainly something that as you think about the overall working capital trends that are reflected in the cash flow forecast going forward. I think a couple other quick things I would point out. There's one of the things that you do see in the first quarter in addition to some of the working capital trends that happened, that are not necessarily something to repeat through the year. First quarter is when we typically pay our incentive payments from a cash perspective and that was clearly something that we had less of this year than in previous years. On the flip side of that, we also have a higher interest payment throughout the course of this year that will be factored into our cash flow. And then in Q2, one of the things we also expect is in prior years you may recall that we have had tax deferrals from floods that we've had in Houston and we've had that for a number of years actually. And that actually allowed us to delay the payment of our taxes that would normally have been doing in the second quarter that was paid then in the second half of the year. We're not anticipating that this year. And so, there is going to be a cash tax detriment to cash if you will as we head into the second quarter. So those are few of the puts and takes that I'd call out Kelly. I think generally speaking again, we're very pleased with the way we're managing the cash against sizeable improvement from working capital's perspective. And again, as we said, anticipate the end of the year being flat-to-above where we ended up here in the first quarter.
Kelly Bania: And can you just help us think about just CapEx plans for the year?
Joel Grade: Sure, of course. So I'd say with the following. And as we've talked about, we have cut back some of our CapEx to what we can call those specific, and again, kind of a mission critical projects in a general sense, but what we've also done is made targeted and strategic investments. And we'll continue to do that. I think some of the things that you've heard Kevin talked about in terms of the ways we think about really and truly accelerating our growth, those areas like investing in our stock platform, investing in pricing tools, investing in those areas that are enhancing our sales organization and the way that we go to market. Some of those really important pieces are areas we were making and are continuing to make strategic investments in. So Kelly, I think, certainly obviously our CapEx number as a percent of sales is less than it has been and will continue to be that as well. It will also be a contributor to some of the cash flow that we just talked about. But nonetheless, again, our priority of this company from the use of cash does continue to be those investments that are going to fund future growth in this organization and certainly during this crisis we've continued to make those investments. But clearly we'll end up the year at a lesser rate than we typically have. If you recall, we've run a number that is somewhere between 1.2% to 1.3% of sales as total CapEx as we'll certainly be well below that for over the course of the total year.
Kelly Bania: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Edward Kelly: Hi, guys. Good morning. Kevin, I was hoping that you could provide a bit more color around that what you're seeing out there from a sales trend standpoint, you talked about, I think, stalling out it sort of like down around 20, but how does the U.S. and international look within that? And then just thoughts around how you're thinking about the fall and winter in each of these regions right now?
Kevin Hourican: Ed, thank you for the question. Happy to go a little bit deeper there. From a quarter perspective, we're reasonably pleased with the performance overall and I'd say met or slightly exceeded our expectations broadly across all regions of the globe. And quite frankly, Europe in Q1 was the strength of ours, certainly versus Q4, but also just in aggregate. What I alluded to in our prepared remarks is obviously you've been reading about the increased restrictions in Europe. We've all been reading about it and it is going to impact our restaurant customers in Europe. It's a little bit too soon to tell is the honest answer. I know you want more than that, but this is late breaking and happening as we speak. I would say that did not impact our October results. October was reasonably consistent flattish to the exit velocity of Q1, which is a good thing. November, I would anticipate there to be softening our performance coming from Europe. The restrictions at this time are pretty significant. I do want to call out some detailed nuances, however, on what's different in Q2 of our fiscal versus what was happening back in Q4 at the beginning of the pandemic. Restaurant operators in Europe, in the countries that we are operating within, Ken continued to take out in delivery. Its on-prem dining is what has been closed down. That is very different than what was happening in Europe back at the beginning of the pandemic, it was a hard shutdown in Europe back in March and April. And if you remember Europe didn't open back up until our July 4th here in the United States. So Europe meaningfully entered the crisis earlier. Lockdowns were substantially more significant and lasted much longer. It's a fluid situation, Ed. What we know at this time is that this particular lockdown, the goal of most of the government leaders dispersed to be roughly one month that's what they've explicitly stated. We'll see if that is in fact the timeline, but the desire is a pretty hard lockdown in November to reopen in December. They desire for holidays to have some form of normalcy and they're trying to really bend the curve the second time here in November. So two pieces of positive, the duration should be quite a bit shorter. We'll see if that's the case. And more importantly, restaurant operators are capable of doing takeout and delivery, which many of them are proving good at doing, because we've been at this now for seven, eight months. As I pivot to the United States, as you know, it's state by state. Now that might change. But for now in the United States, that state by state, I mentioned in our prepared remarks, our Southern States and our rural geographies are performing quite well substantially better than the national average, the major urban centers, California as a state are struggling. And it's directly tied to the restrictions that are being placed on operators. The third piece, which comes up often I'll just lean into it here, is pending cold weather and the impact that that will have on outdoor dining. We've been working on that for months, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. Our sales consultants are going customer by customer by customer enabling an extension of that outdoor patio dining and helping our customers in locations like Chicago, which are now not able to do on-prem dining again, maximize takeout, maximize delivery. I think the biggest takeaway here from my narrative is our customers are more prepared to keep their business up and running and vibrant during this second wave. And we certainly are more prepared from an inventory management perspective, expense control perspective, and we're really leaning in to make sure that every customer has a website that is usable on a mobile phone that takeout and delivery are logical intuitive. And if they don't have a delivery partner, we're connecting them with one. So November to be determined, I wish I could share more about what's going to happen in the future, but these restrictions are changing on a weekly basis and we're doing everything we can to maximize the support of our customers during this difficult time.
Edward Kelly: Okay, that's helpful. And maybe just one follow up on that probably, maybe for Joel, but how do we think about the level of EBIT that you generate with sales down 20%? And I asked this because it actually seems a little bit more complicated just looking at Q1, right. Because your gross margin performance was good, you had a flat exit rate, which is certainly encouraging, but it sounds like gross margin might not be flat sort of going forward. So I'm kind of curious as to how you think about that? And then you've been cutting costs, which may be are still ramping in. So, anyway you could sort of help us around how to think about what the performance of the business with total sales down 20%?
Joel Grade: Yes, sure. A couple of things I'll start and Kevin could chime in if anything he wants. Clearly, I mean, obviously on a positive note, we've certainly had again the $365 million of income we generated was on 23% down business. And obviously – so certainly our ability to be profitable at levels of business well below where we'd previously have been obviously is very strong. I think a couple of puts and takes to think about that in general. So from a margin perspective, a couple of points I would call out. And one of the things that we talked about in the script was the fact that from a business mix perspective, our local and even more specifically independent restaurant customers, which is our highest margin business are those that are actually performing at a rate that is in excess of the rate that our overall business is performing. And so, when we often talked about the business, the wins that we've had in the national account space and certainly obviously again those generate growth rate, gross profit dollars, which I'll take every day of the week. We had a slightly lower margin rate, but again broadly speaking our independent businesses performing well and better than our overall business. So that's a positive on the margin side. Another part of that to think about when you think about our margins is the fact that our food service management, hospitality customers, which are areas that are actually lower margin business are actually struggling as we've talked about in a higher way. So I think from a customer mix perspective, there's some decent parts of that that in terms of how we think about our overall margin. From a product mix perspective, we talked about there was some from paper disposables a little bit, and it's really related to just the fact that we sold a lot of those products during the fourth quarter, and we're expecting demand to moderate some there. But overall from a margin perspective, I think our year-over-year rate variance, Ed; we anticipate the remaining relatively consistent. So you should think about that over the next couple of quarters. From an expense perspective, we've talked about the fact that we're well on track for this fast takeout, the $350 million that we've talked about for this year. We talked about the fact that the vast majority of that is going to our bottom line. I would think about that as somewhere on north of the 80% range of that is actually going to the bottom line. And the reminder of that about two thirds of our cost structure is variable where as the rest would be – the other third would be fixed. And so, I think, those are some of the things I would think about as we head into these next few quarters. Again, I think this work that we've done both from a margin perspective, again, we've got people in our [indiscernible] area, our finance area, our sales teams that are aggressively working to continue the work that we've done in the margin area, which has generally been good. Again on track for cost takeout as we discussed and a lots of great stuff there. And I think all those things are how I would think about the EBIT performance, which again, continues to be positive even as our sales obviously are down.
Edward Kelly: Great. Thank you. That's helpful.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel from Guggenheim. Your line is open.
John Heinbockel: Hi, just two things. Let me start maybe one – with one for Kevin. The segment oriented sales effort, what does that entail broadly speaking product pricing service and when do you think that can move the needle? During COVID is that an opportunity? Or is this sort of setting up for the recovery?
Kevin Hourican: John, thank you for the question. It is exactly what you just articulated from a segment perspective. So I'm not on today's call actually going to declare, which the segment is because we want to introduce it to our customers before broadly to the marketplace, but we have chosen a specific customer segment, and we have a dedicated focus team that's working full time on how Sysco can better serve that customer profile and it's across everything you said, tailored assortment – tailored pricing, promotional offers that are unique and bundled for that specific customer type that are time bound, and then introduced to those customers through a specialized dedicated sales expert in that category. So it's our first, let's call it, national effort tied to really winning within a given specific customer type and what's different from the past because I know you have a lot of history with understanding Sysco as we have a dedicated full-time team working on how do we maximize our ability to serve that specific customer type. So I think it will be during and after COVID. During COVID, I believe we have the opportunity to win more of the unique customers or doors in that segment. We believe we can increase our penetration with that segment, but I really do believe this is from a post-COVID perspective, a tailwind that will help us for the long-term. And this is the first John of what will be many. We're going to do this in many different sectors, Mexican, Italian, Asian and the like. We'll do it across essentially all of the major sectors, but we've chosen one, an important one to Sysco and we're going to be piloting it this fall. We're going to learn a lot. And then we will take the winning elements of that pilot and expand it nationwide. And that's the power of Sysco. We can pilot things with dedicated experts. And when we find the winning recipe, when we find the winning formula, we can expand it out. And our new regional leadership structure, which we know a lot about, is more prepared than in the past to be able to absorb that type of a best practice and implement it in a more agile and timely manner.
John Heinbockel: And then maybe secondly, right, you think about share gains both and I'm thinking more local, right, so you think about new customers to you and then you think about existing customers with higher share those two buckets. As one of them outperformed the other, when you think about your share gains and how – either of those compared to what you thought maybe a couple of months ago, as you thought or other share gains greater or lesser than you envisioned in those areas?
Kevin Hourican: Yes. I must often just our restaurant closure is going to have a permanent headwind on Sysco's results. And I have a different view on that. First of all, I think restaurants are resilient and the bankruptcy rate is showing to be less than what many had modeled, which is a favorable item. More importantly Sysco has a meaningful ability to grow even if the pie were slightly smaller in the future. But John, the two elements that you just said, 30% share of wallet on average today for our independent customers, we have the opportunity to move that upward in a meaningful way through our transformation. And the second is we serve less than half of the available doors out there in the marketplace from an independent perspective. Those two data points are substantial. We have the opportunity to meaningfully increase the number of unique doors we serve above the – on average 50% we have today. And we have the ability to grow our share of wallet with existing. You asked the straightforward question, which is in this current environment, which has been the bigger lever? Winning new customers John has been the bigger lever in the current environment. We are doing more new customer prospecting than at any other point in time in our history. We've updated our sales compensation model to actually pay for that behavior for those outcomes and it's having an impact. People do what they get paid to do, and they're motivated by it. And so our sales force which is the largest in the industry has been skilled up and trained up on how to do new customer prospecting. They're doing role play with their supervisors, and they're going out boots on the street, knocking on doors and we're winning new customers at the local level at an accelerated rate versus prior years. So currently it's from winning new customers. I would say for the long-term, John, the bigger lever will be the 30% share of wallet, but both of them pack a pretty powerful punch.
John Heinbockel: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Silberman from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Lauren Silberman: Thanks. So just a follow-up on the last question, are you willing to quantify the relative impact of closures, new customer acquisition comp decline from the restaurant side? And I guess wallet share expansion though it doesn't seem like much right now with respect to what you're seeing with local case growth.
Kevin Hourican: Yes, we prefer today not to break out that data. One, there's a lot of moving parts on the closure side. Are they closed temporarily? Are they closed permanently? Customers communicate their closing and then two weeks later they reopen. We've got in some select northern geography, people are closing for the winter, but they're planning to reopen in the spring. So there's a little moving data there that we would prefer not to convey. What we can clearly articulate is we are winning share. We're winning share at the national level through the $1.3 billion worth of national sales wins that we have posted since the beginning of COVID and net new $300 million since the last time we spoke. What we did not communicate on prior calls, which we are communicating today, is we are winning share at the local level. And I believe that that will actually accelerate over time as our sales force gets better at doing that type of work, the sales compensation model that I just spoke to is still new in driving the behaviors, which I believe will continue. As it relates to closures, I would say it's in the single digits, high single digits, whereas you've heard industry reports that were substantially higher than that. So beyond that one data point, I'd prefer not to get into more details.
Lauren Silberman: Okay, that's very helpful. And then just on the gross margin, you've talked about the accelerated growth among local customers. It sounds like that'll really be the focus going forward, some benefit from elevated PPE at better margins. So do you see any opportunity for sustainably higher gross margins coming out of this? Should local customer mix settle at a higher percentage of Sysco sales?
Kevin Hourican: Yes. One of the strengths of Sysco is that we over-index at the local level, and I would believe that that strength will continue over time as evidenced by the new selling model that we have, the compensation change that I referenced. And yes, that would be a stated intention of Sysco as to increase the percentage of our total business over time in the independent local customer business, which comes at a much higher rate. But that does not mean that we won't pursue national sales. I think at times in the past, people have tried to box us into, is it A or B. It can be A and B. So we're going to grow at the local level we believe at a rate that will lead the industry. And we have this supply chain flexibility and capacity to win business at the national level as well. So, right now, we're seeing some favorability in gross margin rate because of business mix. Joel covered that very well. His point on the PPE was in Q1 we had some time-based favorability in that category, which is normalized because supply and demand have come into alignment. In Q2, you would expect a more normal run rate of gross margin and we're not highlighting any specific concerns.
Joel Grade: Yes, Lauren, I think I would just add – I'm sorry. I would just add really two quick things to that even your question on the ability to add to that customer mix, if you will, through the local. Again, some of the work that we're investing in from a pricing perspective is also some of that work that we do believe over the long-term will be significantly beneficial both from a margin percentage as well as a growth percentage and again all for that category. So, certainly, we do believe that the other part just to build on one thing Kevin said, it certainly doesn't mean we're not interested in growing in the national space. I think at the end of the day, always recall I like percentages, I like margin dollars even better. And so, I mean, I think the – those customers do drive significant gross profit dollars into our business. And so, just a couple, just again small builds on something Kevin says as it relates to your question.
Lauren Silberman: Really helpful. Thank you so much.
Kevin Hourican: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Slagle from Jefferies. Your line is open.
Alex Slagle: Thanks. Good morning. Just wondering if you could talk a little more about your success with new customer prospecting activities and accelerating digital platforms still seems like it's early innings and any more color on what the pipeline looks like and margin profiles of the new business wins at?
Kevin Hourican: Alex, thank you for the question. I'll start. This is Kevin. I haven't spoken about the digital activities yet on the call. So I'll go there first and I'll answer the margin profile and then I'll end with kind of what's resonating with the customers that we're winning and why Sysco and why are we winning. We're really pleased with our progress in the shop digital platform. We communicated on today's call that we have approximately 60% of our orders now being placed through shop. That is a substantial increase from where we've been. And it's not because we're forcing that too on our customers. That's a big difference. We are seeing that increase because the tools becoming easier to use, more inspiring from what our customers should be buying, or providing a suggested order or providing them other customers like you are also buying the following things, Sysco Brand penetration opportunities, menu design options and suggestions. Click here if you like this menu and everything you need will be on your next truck. It's a really powerful vehicle and our customers are responding. We've also scaled up our sales force to embrace it. And we believe, as I said in my prepared remarks, that this is the combination of the human capital that we have, which is the largest sales force in the industry and this powerful digital tool. The digital improvements are not in competition with our local sales force. That is a very significant point. We do not leave this as a means to reduce our sales force presence. We view it as a means to get our sales force more focused on consultative selling and less time being spent on manual things like hand keying and order or changing pricing every Friday in a manual way. We're automating pricing. We're automating order entry through the shop tool, which is really unleashing our sales force to spend more time on value-added activities. So we're really pleased with the progress that's happening in that space in a really short order. We've moved to an agile development methodology. We're deploying new code on an every two week basis, really positive outcomes. What that's resulted in is more time spent on that new prospecting activity. To answer your question on margin rate, we are winning the new customer rate equal to our historical averages, both at the national level and the local level. That's the answer to that question. On the [indiscernible] Sysco, it's a couple of things. One as Joel said, we have the financial strength to be able to be in stock and have the inventory available to ship on time and ship in full, and that is not actually happening in the industry at large. That's why we're winning at the national level for sure. We even have customers coming to us, expressing concerns about their ability to get what they need, when they need it and they're confident that Sysco can support them and that's the biggest unleash at the national level. At the local level, many of these customers are just doors that we've never knocked on before, and they don't actually or didn't actually understand the breadth and depth of the capabilities of Sysco then that we desire to serve them. Some perceived that maybe they were too small for Sysco to be interested in them. And the reality is our supply chain is flexible that we can support both big customers and small, and we can do so profitably. So that's a bundle around why they're choosing to do business with Sysco, and again we see that accelerating over time.
Alex Slagle: Helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nicole Miller from Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
Nicole Miller: Thank you so much and good morning and thanks for the update. Two quick questions; the first one is on the local and independent commentary around performing better than the overall system. And I'll admit, I just don't remember that level of detail nor that that performance frankly. And so I was wondering when did that pivot occur for the locals and independents? And do you think it's just a function of time? Or is it because of some closures and they have less competition? Is that the last man standing essentially?
Kevin Hourican: That's a good question, Nicole. Thank you. It's Kevin. I'll break it down into two parts and we've not publicly communicated the percentages, but with confidence and with accuracy we can quote these two points. The first is closure rate and it comes from – so it comes from a third-party source, not internal data. Sysco customers are closing at a lower rate than the national average of closure. Is it a chicken or an egg? We'd like to believe it's because of the significant work that we're doing to help ensure their success with menu redesign for takeout we've connected tens of thousands of customers through a delivery carrier on and on and on to help them fight through. And that is a fact based data point that our customers are closing at a lower rate than the national average, point one. Point two, the second data point we've said, and I'll just be very clear on what it was. Those customers that we've succeeded with engaging with them on what we call our value-added services, which would be takeout, delivery, menu redesign, optimization of their web experience in-restaurant cleanliness improvement to be able to make customers be safe – feel safe with on-prem dining. That's what I would bucket all of those things into the value-added services. Those customers that have engaged with us or we've engaged on those things are meaningfully outperforming those customers that have chosen to be more passive; that's fact-based. And our objective during the second wave of COVID is to touch every single one of our customers with those services because we know when we do them, when we improve their website, when we have contactless menus, perhaps you've been out to eat recently I'll just do a quick one there, I had the opportunity to go out on Saturday night and there was a QR code on the middle of the table. Just take your phone, take a picture of the QR code, brings up a contactless menu. You can order your meal without even speaking to a waitress or waiter. You can actually pay through your mobile phone. You don't have to touch your credit card or payment device and you get up and leave. And it's outdoor dining or it's on-prem dining where that's allowed and it's clean, it's safe, it's comfortable and we've helped many, many thousands of our customers with those experiences, even small customers that have less sophistication in that regard. So for those that we've engaged and we're being very proactive about this they're meaningfully outperforming national average.
Joel Grade: And actually, Nicole, if I could just address one part of your question on sort of as – think about this as we're not only servicing the restaurant industry remember, this is what we're talking about here. And it isn't really new; it's just really the first quarter we've decided to call it out here specifically throughout as this crisis has evolved. But the hospitality sector clearly is an area that's been challenged. The area of the food service management sector has clearly been an area that's been challenged. There's parts of education obviously that have been challenged in these ways. And so are over-indexing in this business area is something that's starting to come through when you combine that with the resilience of the industry and the work we've done that Kevin has talked about as the reason from a mix perspective, you're seeing what you're seeing.
Nicole Miller: I appreciate the finer points on that. Thank you very much. And just a second and last question, I couldn't agree more about the strength of the restaurant industry and how it will come back. So I'm trying to think past this. And what I'm seeing before, during and now again – well still, I guess, in the pandemic is restaurant consolidation. So it's not closure, it's not bankruptcy. There's some of that, but it's consolidation, strategic buying somebody and putting portfolios together. And so as we see that happening, I'm extremely curious about the impact of distribution. So whether or not they're public or private, but more so you're putting a bunch of brands together like we see announcements even this week of big brands, what happens when I come back to you as the distributor? Clearly, you could be getting more doors, more stores, more concepts as they do that, but do they also push to get a better deal?
Kevin Hourican: Yes. It's a good question and I'll start with one of your premises, which is well there'd be a reduction in the number of doors and will the strong gets stronger? I think that's a logical hypothesis. It's one that we've been communicating for a while. What Neil says well is what we know is food-away-from-home fatigue – food-at-home fatigue, excuse me, is real. And people want to go out to eat. We can see it. We see it in the data as soon as restrictions are eased, the consumer is back out and they're out of their home and experiencing a dining experience. We can see it in the data. In the United States because it's so varying what the restrictions are, I can tell you state-by-state, the states that have fewer restrictions are meaningfully outperforming. That gives me optimism that as this pandemic begins to abate the customers ready, they're willing, they're able, and they do it quickly. There's not a meaningful latency between the restrictions improving and their ability to get out of their home and experiencing a good meal. As it relates to the number of doors, yes, I would anticipate there will be fewer doors in the future in aggregate. That is a good thing for Sysco. Our drop size will improve, which increases our efficiencies of both our order selectors in our warehouses and the drivers doing delivery. The most time consuming part of a delivery is actually the stop, the opening of the truck, putting on the ramp, they're getting the product to the customer's door. And as we can increase drop size, that's a meaningful benefit. In aggregate, that's a positive thing for this company as it relates to negotiations with key partners. And we'll keep that private with our key partners, but in aggregate, I would say reducing the number of doors overall to positive for this company.
Joel Grade: Yes, I do think…
Nicole Miller: Yes. And just to put a finer point on my question, sorry to interrupt, but let me just be speak, Dunkin' right, its going private. It's going into a portfolio. So I don't know if you had Dunkin' before or not. It's not about Dunkin' let's say, but they were standalone and once they get put into the portfolio with four other brands, and this happens all day long, private-to-private, public-to-private, the portfolios are growing, right? So the doors don't close, and that's – I didn't clarify consolidation. I'm saying a standalone company getting put into a portfolio now the whole bunch of concepts and they're pitching to a scale. And part of that scale is beating up on the distributor. Does that happen? Or is it good for you because it's easier access to all of those brands?
Kevin Hourican: I would say Sysco would be uniquely positioned to be successful in the environment that you're describing. Our breadth, our depth, our national scale, our ability to pivot or support a customer like that coast-to-coast is viewed favorably by them. And long-term, I would say that's a positive for this company. And I prefer not to get into margin discussion vis-à-vis negotiations, but I think you understand my answer and I'm being quick.
Nicole Miller: Yes, absolutely. And I apologize for the interruption, I don't think I asked the question right the first time. So thank you.
Kevin Hourican: Yes. No problem. Thank you for the question.
Nicole Miller: Thanks again.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
John Glass: Thanks and good morning. First, can I just ask about the $350 million of cost saves? Is that – would that fully resident in this quarter like a quarter of that is that high to think about it or does that stays in through the quarters? And if it does stays in, how we should think about that? And I assume it's all contained within 2021. In other words, it's not a run rate at the end of 2021, but it's $350 million in this fiscal year. Thanks.
Kevin Hourican: Sure. I'll start with the last part of your question. Yes, that is an amount that's contained in FY 2021, but what I would also emphasize is we certainly have a line of sight to cost that is over and above that is that we would look at moving forward. So that's certainly an important point. But as it relates to that, I mean, I would say that the distribution of the cost is relatively consistent across the borders and I think some of it is ramping up as we go throughout the year. But I would say generally speaking, since the beginning of this pandemic, you'll recall that we took some really, really swift and decisive action both from a permanent and temporary cost out perspective. And so some of the work we've done on structural cost that is leading into that $350 million, it was well underway as we headed into this year. So again, I would tell you, again it's relatively well distributed. Again as we talked about earlier on the call, the vast majority of that is going to go down into our bottom line, but some of it will also be reinvested as well.
John Glass: And then if I could just ask on the M&A outlook, I understand this is a tenuous time, and there's a lot of buyers and sellers may not be on the same page, but how do you think about both domestically tuck-in acquisitions? Is this the right time to start re-engaging? I know now that we're off the bottom, we have some visibility and anything about the European business in particular, since there's probably even greater runway there, et cetera. Is this an opportunity to also take advantage of this period of time? Or is it too early?
Joel Grade: Yes. Well, I'd say a couple of things. First of all, from an engagement perspectives, both from I would call on the inbound and outbound calls perspective, we have had a fairly significant level of engagements relates to this. Clearly as this thing has evolved and clearly if it continues the drag on for longer, there has been a continued re-struggles within that industry. And so, there have been plenty of discussions. I think I would just say that it has to make sense for us. It has to make sense that – and when we think about, you said buyers and sellers not necessarily on the same page, I think that's still true in the sense that multiple expectations are so quite high in this idea that we're – I always joke it's like the housing crisis back in 2008 or 2009. People were kind of holding on to site, how long they can try to sell their houses at a higher price. And so I think there's some of that happening here in the M&A space domestically. And as it relates to Europe, I think certainly our first priority in Europe is to continue to stabilize our existing business. And that doesn't mean we don't have discussions or eyes out for opportunities, but I would say that it is not our primary focus in our business in Europe at this point.
John Glass: Thank you.
Kevin Hourican: This is Kevin. I just do one build if I could. And I've said before, we wish ill upon no one in this business. But another piece of this puzzle is the buyer, or do you just jump right over a competitor and go straight to their customer and win the business, which has a higher financial return. So we're modeling all of those things. And we've had some substantial wins this year where, yes, we could have perhaps bought a company, but the more cost effective way was actually to go direct to the customer and win the business. And I do not mean we're buying it through rate. We're being market competitive, the wins that we have there have been at our historical average margin ratios, but they see the confidence in Sysco, Joel covered it well with inventory availability and our cast ability to fund the growth. They see it. It's real and we're able to win business because of that. And if the opportunity is right and the company is right and the price is right, and yes, there will be opportunities for acquisitions and Joel is very active in that regard.
John Glass: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
John Ivankoe: Hi, thank you. There's a lot that was said, and I think it was all very good color around the above average survivability of your independent restaurants that you serve. So I guess that's just reiterating what you've already said. And, it got me thinking about, how you could potentially help some of these customers or potentially even new customers survive and even thrive at an increase rate in the future. So at certain markets like Chicago as you cited entering to reducing on-premise dining and the potential elsewhere or the fact of capacity in New York and other places are going to be added back to 100% anytime soon. In different periods, whether it's months or it's quarters, does Sysco consider extending its working capital facilities to restaurants? And does it make sense or could it potentially be the case that you could enter into some short-term working capital agreements with independent restaurants that could potentially translate into medium and long-term business for you. And I did hear Joel in the prepared remarks that you said that terms are tighter for new customers. Could you elaborate on that? And whether that would be something that would be ongoing or it's a trend or it could potentially go the other direction?
Kevin Hourican: Hi, John, it's Kevin. I'm going to just start at the higher level, and then I'm going to toss to Joel specifically to talk about the good work his team is doing on our customer payable side. Your question is more of a what more can Sysco do to ensure the success of our customers? Trust like every day, every meeting, every employees Sysco wakes up everyday thinking about that exact question. And we have a whiteboard bigger than the room that we're sitting in with ideas. So, we're not even close to done on all of the things that we can do. Obviously, I can't talk yet about things that aren't public, but know that we're turning over every rock to determine how best to help our customers. I just want to ensure we have a ton of gas still in the tank on things that we're doing that many, many customers haven't yet engaged on. That example, I gave earlier about a contactless menu with a mobile app version of a menu, that's easy to use, directly linked to a delivery partner at a cost-effective delivery rate. There's a lot there and a small percentage of independent restaurants are doing that let's call it exceptionally. I viewed as our imperative to have every one of our partners do that work exceptionally. And we can do that work to help them better than anyone else. As it relates to working capital, I'm proud of Joel's team as he said we actually had a strong quarter from a receivables collection perspective, and he can walk you through both of the – what we're doing on our P&L side and also what we're doing to help our customers, Joel over to you.
Joel Grade: Sure. Thanks, Kevin. Yes, a couple of key points here. First of all, when we talked about pre-COVID receivables, John, and the work that we did, you heard us talk about lowering our bad debt reserve, a lot of that had to do with the fact that we're continuing to make collections, significant collections over and above what we anticipated even on those pre-COVID receivables, many of those are essentially payment plans with customers. And so when we say how we used our working capital to help our customers that's really what we're talking about. And so, again, we're in a good place there with those customers. It's certainly helped them. And again, we've collected at over and above rate. The other point I would make as it relates to talking about moving forward and helping customers, if you recall maybe about a year ago, we talked about the fact that we rolled out a new centralized credit and collections process and we had some bumps along the way. But, Kevin and I were talking about this the other day and it's like, wow, thank goodness we have that today because what has given us now is the ability to use, again essentially managed technology predictive analytics to essentially separate customers into different tiers to develop specific targeted strategies for each of them. So for customers where we feel terms needs to be tighter, we were actually, again communicating between our centralized organization and our fuel organization in order to execute that. For those though that actually we do have opportunities that we can help continue to do so, we do that. So there's no one size fits all, but again, the centralized management's predictive analytics improved technologies has allowed us to actually have that – do that work in a way that's been really effective through this process and I think will continue to allow us to do both of the things that you said.
John Ivankoe: Very helpful color. Thank you.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Your line is open.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much, two questions. Just one on the new business side, I think you mentioned, right, $1.3 billion annualized up from $1 billion previously, and I think you noted that it's primarily national, but I just wanted to confirm that. But any color on whether it's quick-service or it's casual dining and would you expect the new business dollars to continue to ramp from the $1.3 billion, I think you noted no capacity constraints, perhaps that's part of your theory around pushing that 30% wallet penetration. So I am just wondering maybe where that 30% could go ultimately. I'm going to have one follow up.
Joel Grade: Yes, sure. On the $1.3 billion, it is national customer wins. I'm tried to be clear about that in my prepared remarks, but I'll be even more clear now. So the $1.3 billion is national. And you asked is there more a definite thing? The answer is yes. We have a pipeline of customer opportunities that is robust that we are pursuing. It's a combination of existing customers where we could expand the geographies that we serve with them and net new customers. It's mostly in QSR, but not QSR. We have few healthcare wins that are notable in there as well. And we have the fulfillment capacity and the transportation capacity to continue to win in that regard. And as I mentioned, we're not buying that business with that historically strong margin levels. I have not quoted the local growth other than to say we're winning market share as Sysco. And so we're trying to parse it out that way, because at the local level, there's a lot of noise with select restaurant closures with overall ticket for restaurant being down because of restrictions on their on-prem dining. But I can say with confidence that we are winning more new local business than at any other point in Sysco's history, it's a significantly elevated rate versus prior years. And the new compensation model plus the fact that we're focused on it from, as I mentioned, role play and sales leadership perspective, and I believe there's an accelerating opportunity in that regard as well. So at the national level, there are still many sales prospects available from an opportunities perspective. At the local level, it's about our sales force which is the largest in the industry ability to win new business. And I'll toss to you for your follow-up.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Okay. And then well actually just to clarify, what do you think that 30% wallet penetration can go to? I mean, it would seems like customers don't necessarily want to put all their eggs in one basket. So I guess customers are torn between giving more share to you versus being protected by having a diversified supplier base. So just wondering, based on maybe some accounts that you've seen that has much larger than 30%, where you would say that goal would be for that 30% today?
Kevin Hourican: Yes. I'm going to save that question for our Investor Day, because one of our key components of our long-term strategy is how we will increase that share of wallet. I'm going back to John Heinbockel's question. He asked me for the current versus the long-term, which lever is the bigger lever. For the long-term increasing that 30% is the biggest lever and we are bullish on that. Our long-term strategy, which we will unveil and talk about in much more detail at Investor Day, we'll explain that how we will actually put some size of the prize math on the table at that point in time, where we can articulate for you each of the key components of our strategy, what the work we have done that math. We've just not gone public with it yet given the fact that COVID is unpredictable and restaurant restrictions are unpredictable and how long it will take for us to get through this, this pandemic is unpredictable. So we believe we can move that number meaningfully higher. We have many customers, independent customers where that number is meaningfully higher. It comes back to one of the reasons why to your point they don't choose to do more with us. Pricing is the number one reason why a customer chooses to do business with more than one distributor and transparency and lack of trust in pricing is the double click into that topic. We will make meaningful progress on that customer pain point with the deployment of our national strategic pricing tool. We will increase transparency. We will increase trust by being right on price on the items that matter most. And we believe that is a very significant lever to improve share of wallet, which Joel mentioned briefly earlier. Assortment is topic to increase the availability of fresh and premium, and we're making significant efforts to increase our availability and access and ability to deliver fresh, best at fresh is something we talk about internally and our ability to be able to increase share of wallet by being better at fresh and best at protein and we're confident in our capabilities. The third bucket would be supply chain services, and I'm going to save that one for our upcoming Investor Day.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Got it. And then just the other question was just on cost savings and your ability to do more with less. You highlighted how your adjusted operating income was quite strong despite sales down 20 plus percent. So I'm just wondering whether you would be able to quantify the reduced breakeven level. And then you mentioned having a lot of set on additional savings beyond the $350 million some, I think you said starting next year. So I'm just wondering to what magnitude are we talking about something similar to $350 million or now we're talking about smaller pieces in out years? Thank you.
Joel Grade: Yes. So I'm not going to answer that [indiscernible] to Kevin's point that would be something we rollout further at an investor event. Regarding the breakeven point, I mean, that certainly is something we've talked about. As we exited the last fiscal year, our business was down again in nearly the 30% range. And if you'll recall, we've talked about the fact that we actually exited that quarter, which again was our Q4 positive from an operating income and cash flow perspective. So, clearly our breakeven point has moved to somewhere beyond 30% down. And that certainly is significantly different than it had been even at the beginning of the crisis. So, that's the color I'll give you on that.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Understood. Is there a date for this Investor Day or is it kind of pending based on COVID?
A – Kevin Hourican: Yes, pending.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you everybody for joining the call today. That concludes the first quarter of 2021 Sysco Corporation earnings call. You may now disconnect.

Kevin Hourican - Sysco Corp.: Thank you, Neil and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call with us this morning. I hope that you and your families are safe and healthy. As we continue to navigate through this unprecedented environment, our first priority will always be the health and well-being of our associates. I want to thank all of our associates for their tremendous work during a period of high stress at both work and at home. I want to especially thank our warehouse associates and our drivers who as frontline associates showed up every day during this crisis to take care of our customers, including those customers in the healthcare sector that needed our support more than ever. During this morning's call, I will discuss the state of the current business environment, Sysco's effective management of the COVID-19 crisis, and how we are strategically transforming the company to be even more effective in how we service our customers and grow our business. I'll then turn it over to Joel, who will discuss Sysco's fourth quarter and fiscal 2020 financial results. Lastly, I'll make a few closing remarks before we turn the call over for Q&A. It has been five months since the effects of COVID-19's pandemic began to significantly impact our industry and Sysco's business directly. As we discussed during the third quarter call, immediately after the onset of the crisis, Sysco took swift and decisive action to reduce variable and structural costs to ensure liquidity and to pivot our business to maximize sales during a period of disruption. I am tremendously proud of the work that we have done during this crisis to help our restaurant partners be as successful as possible during immensely difficult operating conditions. I will highlight a few of these wins in just a moment. Most importantly, we are not just managing through a crisis, we are transforming our company during this crisis. While others are focused on survival, we are transforming our company to improve how we serve our customers and differentiate from our competition. I will highlight the progress we are making on our transformation during today's call. Before I cover our transformation, however, I would like to give you a quick update on how we have managed the crisis to-date and the general state of our business. First, Joel and his team took swift action to further strengthen our overall liquidity, which affords us financial flexibility during this difficult operating environment. As Joel will describe further, we have approximately $8 billion of available liquidity, which enables us to manage through the crisis and position Sysco for long term success. We are unique in our ability to invest in our business to transform the company during a time of tumult. Second, we have worked rapidly to stabilize the business by taking out cost. In the fourth quarter alone, we removed approximately $500 million worth of operating expenses, which includes more than $300 million of structural and permanent costs on an annual run rate basis. We are working to remove even more structural expense, something I will discuss further in a moment. Third, we created new sources of revenue, which included the extensive work we have done to help our restaurant customers be successful. I am very proud of the work our sales force has been doing to help our customers during this uncertain time. We have helped our restaurant customers pivot to new selling models, which includes helping them with pop up shops in the front of their dining room, and provides additional revenue streams for these customers. A powerful example of this is the fact that the restaurant operators that have engaged with Sysco on concept like a restaurant marketplace, are performing over 20% better to prior year than those who have not engaged. Our sales consultants importantly have helped over 16,000 of our customers set up marketplaces. We have also helped our customers with alternative reopening plans such as patio extensions and outdoor dining options. We have provided customers with the technological support to start a website if they did not already have one. Additionally, we have helped connect them to preferred delivery partners and set up takeout menus and have provided them with the much needed to-go containers needed to support a delivery model. We've helped our customers narrow their menus to a more focused assortment to help them maintain profitability on that narrower menu selection. Lastly, we have provided products for cleaning, sanitation and personal protection, without disruption, so that our customers may continue business operations. We believe that these overall actions will help us retain customers and win net new ones in the independent restaurant customer space well beyond the pandemic. We can measure the impact of these actions through our Net Promoter Score with restaurant operators. I am proud to say that our NPS has increased 900 basis points during this crisis when compared pre versus post. For those that know NPS, a 900 basis point improvement in 100 days is a dramatic improvement. Increasing NPS has proven to increase sales and customer retention over time. This improvement is a perfect example of the Sysco we are becoming. We are not just selling food products, we are delivering products and valued services. Separately, we have shifted sales of products to regional and national grocery retailers to help alleviate the strain in the food supply chain. Although some of those sales through our larger retail partners will be opportunistic in nature, we have in fact created long term relationships with select regional grocers where we can add value through items such as quality proteins or fresh produce where our buying advantage is helpful to them. On our last call, we announced a $500 million on an annual basis new business win. Since that time, we've secured an additional $500 million worth of incremental new business. The reliability of our operations and the capability of Sysco have enabled us to win over $1 billion annualized of new business during this crisis. We have the capability and the sales force to win new customers at the local and at the national contract level simultaneously. As it relates to the current business environment, I would like to highlight the pace of our business recovery. For May through June, we experienced steady and consistent week-over-week sales improvement. As countries and states began reopening, we experienced a swift business recovery. Unfortunately, as cases have begun increasing in certain locations, the business recovery has somewhat stagnated. With that said, it is clear that food at home fatigue is real, and that consumers are ready to reengage with restaurants when it is safe to do so in their community. The speed and pace of that reengagement will be dictated by the restrictions that are placed upon the industry. As long as there are safe ways to access restaurant quality meals, consumers are ready to eat away from home. Until then, our best customers are succeeding through things like takeout, delivery and extensive patio dining. I'm glad to say that the rate of Sysco customer closures is less than the industry average, illustrating the value that we can bring to our customers through value-added services and advice. Joel will go into further details about the business environment by geography in just a little bit. Our business improvement throughout the quarter was significant, which we feel good about. We are pleased to communicate today that our results came in notably better than expected. We exited fiscal 2020 with a profitable adjusted operating income rate, which bodes well for fiscal year 2021. Additionally, Sysco was able to generate positive free cash flow during the last period of the quarter. Both the positive free cash flow and adjusted operating income were achieved despite a sales decline of approximately 30%. We anticipate sales in fiscal 2021 to be stronger than that exit rate of fiscal 2020 even with a choppy recovery, and therefore, we have increased confidence in regards to fiscal 2021 profitability. I will now shift to highlight some of our progress against our transformation initiatives. We are undertaking a bold transformation that will improve how we serve our customers, differentiate Sysco from our competitors and help transform the industry. First, we have accelerated our work to become a more digitally enabled company. We are investing to improve our digital order platform called Sysco Shop. This tool makes it easier for customers to do business with Sysco, allows Sysco to increase sales with those customers and increases customer retention. Examples of these digital technological improvements include the following: improving the search function capabilities so that relevant and compelling results are returned to customers, which will help increase lines per customer order. We have also implemented a suggested order function for our customers, which will help introduce new items or menu trends. We have increased the effectiveness of our sales consultants by providing them with digital tools to engage their customers. Examples include, enabling them to show streaming videos, highlighting menu trends and pushing promotional opportunities to their customer base. Additionally, we are deploying a digital pricing tool. With the implementation of our new pricing tool, we can simultaneously increase sales and create margin expansion. Our second transformation effort is in our sales model. We are making it easier for our customers to do business with Sysco and to increase the effectiveness of our sales teams. We are transforming our sales structure to be more focused, aligning the incentives of the sales force more closely with our business objectives and increasing the partnership of our sales teams across our multiple lines of business. This includes a change to our sales compensation model, which will now focus more directly on growth. Additionally, we are increasing the number of sales specialists who will help increase sales penetration with both new and existing customers. These roles will help increase our share of wallet and increase sales in premium products, which we have struggled to penetrate in the past. Combined, these capabilities will enable our sales team to visit more customers, inspire our customers to purchase more from Sysco and reduce friction in the purchasing environment. The last piece, friction removal, will also be enabled by centralizing key customer support functions for large international accounts. These key accounts will have dedicated account reps that will own their experience end-to-end across all facets of Sysco's extensive business. Our third transformation and new since the last time we have spoken, we are regionalizing our operations in the US. This important initiative was not public at the time of our Q3 earnings call, but we have recently begun our implementation. In July, we completed wave number one of our regionalization efforts. Through regionalization, we will be a more efficient company, we will be more agile with our decision-making, and we will execute against strategies in a more efficient manner. Our leaders will have bigger roles and will help ensure alignment and consistency across the country. Regionalization is a new leadership structure for our US Broadline business. With this change, we will move from our current 6 markets comprised of 76 operating companies, to 4 markets that consist of approximately 30 regions, each made up of 2 to 3 operating sites. Each region will consist of one region president and one cross-functional regional leadership team responsible for the performance across that region. This regionalization of our US business is the enabler that allows us an entirely new, more centralized, more aligned, more agile Sysco to go to market. We are unleashing the power of the consolidated enterprise by making this change, eliminating redundancies and shortening time to making decisions. This regionalization project will lay the necessary foundation for all future transformation initiatives in Sysco's future growth. It is important to note that we are not closing any physical distribution locations with this change, and we are retaining our local drivers, our local warehouse associates and importantly, our local sales force that supports our customers. Our fourth transformation is our structural fixed cost removal from our business in becoming a more efficient company. As previously mentioned on our third quarter earnings call, we had identified and implemented actions to remove approximately $300 million of annualized permanent fixed costs from the business for fiscal 2021. Today, we are updating those figures to $350 million, derived from improvements we are making in operations, transportation and corporate functions. In addition to this $350 million for 2021, we have identified additional cost improvement opportunities that we are pursuing that will generate savings starting in fiscal 2022 and beyond. We are calling these combined efforts our corporate modernization, and we will update investors on the additional favorable impact that can be expected as we move forward. Throughout this crisis, we have stayed focused on supporting our customers and putting them first as we have defined our strategy. The decisions that have impacted our associates were difficult to make. With that said, our decisions were informed by our strategy. That strategy will improve the service that we provide our customers and differentiate Sysco from others in our space. The transformation ensures that we are a stronger, leaner and more agile company. And through our transformation, we will be better aligned to execute on what matters most. By accelerating the pace of change at Sysco through our company-wide focus on these strategic initiatives, we are positioning the company for future success, ensuring that we will emerge from the crisis stronger. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Joel, who will discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal 2020 results, along with additional financial details around our business environment. I'll come back after to offer final perspective before moving into Q&A. Joel, over to you.
Joel Todd Grade - Sysco Corp.: Thanks, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. I will start with fourth quarter results for Sysco and results by segment, followed by an overview of full year fiscal 2020 performance. I will then give an update on cash flow and capital spend for the quarter. And finally, I'll go through our capital allocation priorities and closing comments. Our total Sysco results for the fourth quarter include a sales decrease of 43% to $8.9 billion. Local case volume within US Broadline operations decreased 38.7% for the fourth quarter, while total case volume within US Broadline operations decreased 41.5%. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw a significant decline in both volume and sales across all the business segments. Gross profit decreased 47% to $1.6 billion and gross margin decreased 159 basis points. Our gross margin for the fourth quarter was impacted by pricing to help move inventory and avoid spoilage and by a temporary shift in customer mix as a result of the current operating environment. These results were in line with our previous guidance as it relates to margins. Adjusted operating expense decreased 26% to $1.6 billion. It is important to note that we had $115 million of incentive pay accrual reversals that favorably impacted operating expenses and the run rate in Q1 of fiscal 2021 will be normalized when compared to Q4 fiscal 2020. With that said, the adjusted operating income run rate was profitable in June, even without the accrual reversal. Adjusted operating income decreased 104% to a loss of $34 million, and adjusted earnings per share decreased 126% to a negative $0.29 for total Sysco. Across the business, our results were impacted by various financial items, which I will review before proceeding into individual segment results. Our fourth quarter results are impacted by restructuring and transformational project costs associated with our various transformation initiatives. Examples of the restructuring charges include our regionalization efforts that Kevin previously mentioned and a technology change related to our ongoing integration in France. We have also experienced an increase in past due receivables as a result of the COVID pandemic, which has led to excess bad debt of approximately $170 million for the fourth quarter. However, we feel good about the progress we have made, tightly managing receivables, and we will continue to manage this tightly during an environment of higher bankruptcy risk. Additionally, we have taken goodwill impairment charges within our international segment, due to better visibility of the volume declines stemming from the global pandemics and their impact to our France and Fresh Direct businesses. Lastly, during the quarter, we made the decision to allocate corporate resources that are fully dedicated to our US Foodservice Operations to that reporting segment. We feel that this reclassification better reflects the true expenses of managing the US business and aligns our leadership squarely on combined efficiency improvements. Moving on to results by segment. For the US Foodservice Operations segment, sales for the fourth quarter were $6.1 billion, which was a decrease of 43% versus the prior year period. Volume and sales both showed recovery throughout the quarter as the exit rate was markedly improved compared to the start of the quarter. Gross profit decreased 46% to $1.2 billion for the quarter, and gross margin declined 102 basis points to 19.1%. Sysco brand sales for the fourth quarter decreased 2 basis points to 38.5% of total US cases and decreased 239 basis points to 45.2% of local US cases, which was driven by shifts in customer mix and temporary customer closures as a result of the pandemic. Our adjusted operating expenses decreased 24% to $1 billion, which was favorably impacted by changes in the business, including permanent reductions in force, more productive staffing, better warehouse operations and efficiency improvements within our transportation initiatives. Adjusted operating income decreased 80% to $165 million. Our International Foodservice Operations were impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, sales decreased 52%, gross profit decreased 56%, gross margin decreased 199 basis points, adjusted operating expenses decreased 32%, and adjusted operating income decreased 162%, for an adjusted operating loss of $73 million. Throughout the fourth quarter, our UK business has remained stable as we continued our work with the DEFRA program, providing boxes of food to those in need. Our Ireland and Sweden businesses have both shown steady improvement during the quarter as restaurants, hotels and pubs continue to reopen for customers. Although our results have been favorable, the current rise in COVID-19 cases warrants continued attention. In Canada, the country has been steadily reopening for the past eight weeks. And we feel good about our business. The exit rate was much improved, compared to the beginning of the fourth quarter. Additionally, our regionalized cost structure was beneficial and allowed for greater flexibility during the crisis. We saw mixed results throughout our Latin American countries' operations. The impact from COVID-19 continues to be most prominent in Mexico and Panama, as they have been heavily impacted by restrictions as a result of the pandemic. However, we opened a new Cash & Carry store in Panama that is performing well and partially offsetting some of the decline in the current environment. In Costa Rica, our Cash & Carry stores are also helping to partially supplement the decrease in sales from restaurants. Moving on to the SYGMA segment, sales decreased 17% to $1.3 billion, compared to the prior year period as quick-serve and drive-thru restaurants continued to experience less of a downturn, compared to other restaurant types. Gross profit decreased 11% to $114 million for the quarter, but gross margins improved by 56 basis points. We are encouraged by the steady progress of profitability improvement as a result of disciplined approach to profitable growth. Adjusted operating expenses decreased 11% to $103 million due to lower transportation costs. And adjusted operating income decreased 12% to $11 million. Now turning to our results for the full fiscal year 2020, sales decreased 12% to $52.9 billion. Our total case volume for the year in US Broadline decreased 11.2% and our local case volume for the year in US Broadline decreased 9.6%. Gross profit decreased 13% to $9.9 billion and gross margin decreased 26 basis points. The cost reduction efforts put in place at the beginning of the pandemic led to an adjusted operating expense decrease of 6%. And as a result, adjusted operating income decreased 37% to $1.7 billion. Adjusted earnings per share decreased by $1.54 to $2.01, primarily driven by volume and sales softness as a result of the pandemic. Our US Foodservice segment had been growing during the first half of the fiscal year, particularly with local customers, as the work we were doing pre-COVID to grow business is progressing well. We are confident, that our work to accelerate growth will return to pre-COVID levels as demand returns and that our transformation initiatives will drive future growth. Within the International segment, our business in Canada has performed similarly to the US during the COVID time period and we are encouraged by the recovery that has taken place throughout the fourth quarter. For our European operations, the impact from COVID-19 occurred earlier in the crisis and the declines were initially steeper, but our business has since improved. The UK and Ireland are now open for business and consumers are responding well. Our business in France had the strongest year-over-year revenue growth in the month of July, which is reflective of the French culture of dining out, combined with the solid work deployed by our team during the crisis to improve our supply chain challenges. Currently, France is our top-performing country in Europe on a top line basis. As for our businesses in Latin America, the companies were performing well pre-COVID and are continuing to show signs of recovery as restaurants and food-away-from-home places reopen. For the full year, SYGMA's results, despite the impact of the pandemic, achieved their operating income plan, showing their ability to gain new customers and operate efficiently through the crisis. I will now move to cash flow and working capital. For the fourth quarter, cash flow from operations was $540 million. We had a working capital benefit, which was driven by reduced volume levels in addition to improved accounts receivables and accounts payables' DSOs. Our net CapEx for the fourth quarter was $101 million, as a result of our substantially reduced capital expenditures that were directed only to targeted initiative spend and urgent projects. As previously indicated, our fourth quarter fiscal 2020 spend was $200 million less than our fourth quarter fiscal 2019 spend. And as a result, free cash flow was $439 million. For fiscal 2020, cash flow from operations was $1.6 billion, which is $793 million lower than fiscal 2019. Net CapEx for fiscal year 2020 was $692 million or about 1.3% of sales. Free cash flow for fiscal 2020 was $927 million, which was $813 million lower than the same period last year. The decline in free cash flow was principally the result of the softer top line due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but was partially offset by positive working capital throughout the fourth quarter. I am proud to say that despite the softer performance, we exited fiscal 2020 with a positive adjusted operating income rate and we had 10 consecutive weeks of positive free cash flow during the end of the fourth quarter. I want to remind everyone of the seasonality of our cash flow, which is typically lower in the first half of the fiscal year and higher in the back half of the fiscal year. I'm also proud to say that we have a balance sheet that affords us the stability and flexibility to navigate this rapidly changing business environment. As of August 11, 2020, we have more than $8 billion of cash and available liquidity, which ensures survivability for an extended period and through an impact much worse than we are currently experiencing or expected. While we do not currently expect to deploy the majority of the capital proceeds, we view it as prudent to ensure we have access to available liquidity given the near-term uncertainties. I also want to reiterate that even as we continue to navigate through the COVID-19 pandemic, our capital allocation priorities remain the same. Let me give you a comment around each area. From an investment perspective, as previously mentioned, we have chosen to substantially reduce capital expenditures to only urgent projects and those targeted investments to accelerate certain capabilities to make it easier for customers to do business with Sysco and continue our focus on industry-leading service and safety. Regarding Sysco's dividend, we remain committed to returning substantial value to our shareholders through our dividend payments. We are unable to grow our dividend due to an amendment restriction as previously communicated. However, we are committed to the long-term growth of the dividend. For M&A, we continue to reevaluate potential future opportunities but do not have a high priority on large complex deals in this environment. Let me also note that we are choosing to divest our CAKE business in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. This divestiture will allow us to better focus and accelerate growth at our core business. Our CAKE business is a technology program we sell to customers, largely driven by point-of-sale systems. We would like to thank the CAKE associates and leaders for their hard work and dedication to our business. The technology is a good solution for our customers, and we'll continue to support it through the transition. The CAKE divestiture, it should be noted, will not impact our LABS employees who are supporting our digital transformation efforts. As it relates to our share buyback program, we have temporarily paused our share repurchases. Currently, we expect to maintain this position throughout fiscal 2021. And lastly, as it relates to debt, we paid down $930 million on our revolving credit facility during the fourth quarter, and we have $700 million still remaining on the facility. In addition, we have $750 million of senior note maturity due in October. As a reminder, we do not have any secured debt. We have the flexibility to make decisions that are in the best interest of our company. Now before closing, I'd like to provide you with some commentary on the outlook for fiscal 2021. Sysco is well-positioned for current and future success with an ability to shift focus across all segments throughout the foodservice industry, whether local or national. As a result, we can easily pivot our concentration to areas such as QSR and health care, which are currently outperforming or shift into other food-away-from-home segments, such as education and travel and leisure as economic demand recovers. During the fourth quarter, gross margins were initially pressured due to product discounting to help mitigate inventory spoilage that improved throughout the quarter. We expect gross margins to reflect top-line mix changes, but otherwise remain stable throughout fiscal 2021. As Kevin said, we now also have a run rate of approximately $350 million in structural annualized costs removed from the business. Interest expense has risen during the crisis as we strengthened our balance sheet, but those increases have now stabilized in the current run rate. Lastly, from a tax perspective, we expect our overall effective tax rate to be approximately 24% in fiscal 2021. With that said, and considering the uncertainty of the current environment, forward-looking financial and operational results cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Before we go to Q&A, let me turn it back over to Kevin for some closing comments. Back to you, Kevin.
Kevin Hourican - Sysco Corp.: Thank you, Joel. I'd like to close with a few final thoughts before we move into Q&A. Sysco went into this crisis in a position of strength, which afforded us the ability to act quickly, reduce costs, ensure liquidity and pivot our business in support of customers. Although it has been a tough operating environment, we have managed well through the crisis, and the exit velocity of the business was positive, as Joel just communicated. Through our new business wins, totaling more than $1 billion since the onset of the pandemic and our continued cost out efforts now totaling more than $350 million for fiscal 2021, Sysco is well positioned for current success and future growth. More importantly, we are confident our transformation initiatives, including digital transformation, sales model, regionalization and expense structure modernization are paving the path for the company's long-term success. As I've said, we are managing the COVID crisis and transforming our company. We will exit this crisis a stronger Sysco, better able to serve our customers and differentiate it from others in our space. I want to close our call today once again by thanking our associates, especially our frontline heroes, who are out there working hard, serving our customers every day. And with that, operator, we're now ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Chris Mandeville with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Christopher Mandeville - Jefferies LLC: Hey, good morning, gentlemen. Kevin, can you just shed some additional light on what you're seeing with your total and local case growth quarter-to-date? And then specific to the local, what's kind of the delta in performance for those of whom opened up early versus late? Maybe you could talk about any notable geographic or suburban versus rural versus urban differences that you're seeing. And then can you also just help us better understand that negative mix shift in private label penetration for local? I mean, is that a reflection of some of your really true or subscale operators seeing greater challenges within that segment?
Kevin Hourican - Sysco Corp.: Yeah, Chris, good morning and thank you for the questions. You've got a couple of them in there. So I'll go through them in order. As I indicated in my prepared remarks, the sequential improvement through Q4 was steady. So each week, getting better than the week before, pretty much across the globe, pretty much in all sectors, both suburban and rural and urban. Unfortunately, in the month of July, there was some stagnation. I think that's been pretty well documented by both the restaurant customers we serve and others in our space. The good news is it's not going backward. So as cases are surging in many parts of the globe and states within United States, we are not seeing a backward slide. And recently, we are beginning to see again that incremental sequential week-over-week improvements. We're not going to quote stats for the month of August. But we were improving every week through Q4, we saw a stagnation in July, and we're now seeing, once again, steady improvement in the month of August on a week-on-week basis. As Joel said, from a geographic perspective, I think that's some of the uniqueness of Sysco. Our European operations in Q4 were hit the hardest, they were hit the earliest, and they were the slowest to recover. However, that headwind in Q4 is actually more of a tailwind in Q1, because Europe has done a pretty nice job actually of managing the crisis from a health perspective, and we're seeing very strong improvement. And as Joel communicated from a top line perspective, France being the top-performing country in our entire portfolio right now as essentially restaurants are open for business in its entirety. So, we're monitoring it very closely. We're doing everything within our capability and power to help our restaurant operating customers be successful, providing them extensions on their patios, providing them with takeout to go, et cetera. Your question about rural versus urban, I think your insights there are probably on target. The more rural, the better the performance to prior year has been in urban, but we are seeing improvement in all sectors, including urban sectors. And I'll toss to Joel for the question on, I believe, you're asking about Sysco private brand penetration, and I'll toss it over to Joel to answer that question.
Joel Todd Grade - Sysco Corp.: Thanks, Kevin. Yeah, Chris, I would suggest that I think the – as in our business, good operators win all the time, and others that struggle – at times struggle. And so, I think the – what you're really seeing there is just the impact of the mix change in the business that is indicative of both the mix between, again, some of the better operators and others that have not managed to survive and then also between the overall business that's obviously growing faster in those areas of QSR, of national accounts, of health care. So I think really, that's the primary impact which you're seeing there from a brand perspective.
Christopher Mandeville - Jefferies LLC: Okay. And then just my follow-up is, Joel, as we look to fiscal 2021, can you quantify that the customer mix impact to Q4 gross margins, as you stated that's what will only likely persist going forward? And then, can you offer any more concrete color on CapEx spend and D&A since the latter actually increased quite notably in the quarter?
Joel Todd Grade - Sysco Corp.: Sure. Yeah, from a margin perspective, Chris, I'm not going to quantify that specifically. What I would say, as we talked about, the margins improved consistently over the course of the fourth quarter and heading into the first quarter. So, some of the impact that we had in the beginning of the quarter, that was really related to inventory movement to avoid the spoilage, something that actually continued to go away really out throughout the course of the quarter. And the margins were more reflective of the mix impact that we're referring to. We anticipate those to continue as we move into the first quarter, but I'm not going to give any other specific commentary or guidance on that. The second part, as it relates to – I'm sorry, I lost you – the second question?
Kevin Hourican - Sysco Corp.: Depreciation that was up, increased in Q4 was his question?
Joel Todd Grade - Sysco Corp.: Yeah. I'm not able to hear you.
Kevin Hourican - Sysco Corp.: Okay. He was...
Joel Todd Grade - Sysco Corp.: Can you repeat the question, Chris?
Christopher Mandeville - Jefferies LLC: Yeah. No, the latter part was just with regards to how to think about CapEx spend in fiscal 2021 as well as D&A since it saw a pretty notable uptick in Q4?
Joel Todd Grade - Sysco Corp.: Yeah. So I think the capital spend piece, we certainly, as we indicated, we're going to be much lower than we were the prior year in Q4. And I would anticipate we would continue those trends as we head into the next fiscal year. I think the – at one point, we've talked about the fact that we anticipated our total capital spend to be somewhere in the range of 25% of what we'd call our normalized run rate. And I would anticipate that being more likely than not. We will, of course, continue to evaluate that as the year goes by and conditions change. But again, certainly focused on those urgent projects and those key transformational initiatives that we've talked about.
Christopher Mandeville - Jefferies LLC: Okay. And anything on the D&A front?
Joel Todd Grade - Sysco Corp.: You know, there is nothing really major to call out there, Chris, on the D&A side. I mean, I think they're – yeah, there's nothing really significant there to call out.
Christopher Mandeville - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Best of luck in the back half of the calendar year, guys. Thank you.
Joel Todd Grade - Sysco Corp.: Thanks.
Kevin Hourican - Sysco Corp.: Thank you, Chris.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Edward J. Kelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Yeah. Hi, guys. Good morning. I just wanted to follow up on the case growth trend, just to avoid some confusion here. At the bottom, you were down about 60% or so. And I think it was around mid-May or so you had given us an update. Post that, we'd heard from you that things continued to get better. I'm just kind of curious as to why you won't talk about the exit rate on case growth. It kind of seems like logic would follow that you're probably down in the US, somewhere in like the low to mid-20% range at the end of the quarter. Is that ballpark? Just any way you can help us there, because it's important as to how we're going to start modeling the current quarter?
Kevin Hourican - Sysco Corp.: Yeah. Ed, we exited the month of June in the more like the minus 30% range. That's a global number across all lines of business that we've had. And we've seen improvement in August from that starting point, if you will, for Q1 of fiscal 2021. In fact, the most recent week was our strongest week since the beginning of the pandemic. So as I said, there was steady improvement. We exited Q4 at minus 30%. We were stagnated in July, and then we begin to see a weekly improvement since that point in time with the most recent week being our best week. That's where we are at this point. We're not going to get into kind of the business providing weekly guidance for obvious reasons, but we're seeing positive trends in improvement. And another key point that we said in our prepared remarks, we're profitable at a minus 30%, and we are confident that our sales results for fiscal 2021 will be better than that rate. And we're prepared if in fact a worst-case scenario were to occur, and we were forced to have restaurant operators shut down again, we're prepared to handle inventory reductions, expense reductions in a rapid manner, if that were to occur.
Edward J. Kelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Great. Thanks. That's helpful, Kevin. And also just as a follow-up, on the regionalization, can you just talk about the genesis of the initiative, the benefits that you expect to get from it? What are the risks, if any? I'm just kind of curious as to what's really changing here for you and the upside associated with it.
Kevin Hourican - Sysco Corp.: Yeah. Thank you for the question. Appreciate it. The OpCo model, as we called it, served Sysco well for decades. And there's an entrepreneurial spirit and culture tied to Sysco that grew up from the foundation of this company, which was by families coming together to form a purchasing consortium. So that's how we grew up. It's who we were. We had operating company leaders who, yes, ran the Sysco playbook. But there was a fair amount of independence in entrepreneurial thinking and behavior in regards to how that structure worked. There are strengths tied to that. The disadvantages tied to that though would be it takes longer for Sysco to implement a change, and we wouldn't be as consistent as we wanted to be across the country if we rolled out a new program, a new initiative. With regionalization, we've essentially removed the operating company mentality and moved on to a regional president, who will now supervise multiple physical locations and a single combined sales force across all locations. The benefits that will come from a regionalization approach is a better alignment to the corporate strategy, ability to move faster on implementing change and to be a more consistent version of Sysco. On the risk side, we have some leaders that have departed the organization as a part of that change, and these were hard-working people who cared about the success of Sysco. On the opposite side of that risk would be we've placed, obviously, our top talent into these bigger jobs. And we call it fewer, bigger roles led by our top talent. So what I'm personally confident, because I've done this before multiple times in my career, when you put top talent into bigger roles, they can have a very positive impact on an even broader geography on an even broader set of responsibilities. I do just want to explain with detail one specific upside, which would be to now have our sales force led across physical geographies. We can do a better job of sharing resources across boundaries, being easier to do business with for our larger customers. And net-net, we believe it will accelerate our pace of change.
Edward J. Kelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Great. Thank you.
Kevin Hourican - Sysco Corp.: Thank you, Ed.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nicole Miller with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.
Nicole Miller Regan - Piper Sandler & Co.: Thank you so much and good morning. Just two quick questions for me. The first is going back to the early prepared commentary around your ability to invest and find leverage while others focus on survival. Could you just talk really big picture about the national distribution situation? It seems to me, you don't really need anybody to lose for you to win. And what I'm wondering about is, it seems to be making consumers confident to eat at restaurants and taking the share back from grocery. I think that there's plenty of super-regionals that are actually seeing a recovery as well. So could you talk about maybe you as a global brand? Maybe there's a difference between a super-regional versus a regional versus an independent? Thank you.
Kevin Hourican - Sysco Corp.: Nicole, thank you for the question. I just want to come back to one of your key points, which is we, as Sysco, can and will win during this environment. It doesn't necessarily need to come at the loss of a specific competitor so to speak. Some of the key stats that we use to convey these points, we have roughly 30% share of wallet from our independent street customers that we serve today. That is something that we know we can improve. And with just the customers we serve today, we know we can drive increased sales at Sysco. We've also recently changed our sales consultant compensation system to motivate them to go win more local street customer business. We believe we can increase market share through that activity. Today, we're not declaring the amount of net new business at the local level that we are winning because there's a lot of churn and tumult within the independent street customer business that I can come back to later. So we're not quoting those stats on today's call. The $1 billion of net new business that I articulated in my prepared remarks actually did come from the national sales level, some of that business in the SYGMA sector. And the why we're winning business at the national level at an accelerating rate is because the trust that those customers have in Sysco. They have confidence that we will have access to product, including fresh product. They have confidence that we're going to ship on time and in full. And they're moving business away from others over to us because they have confidence that we are here to succeed with them, both during this pandemic and more importantly, afterwards, that they can grow with us. So why I'm confident is we know we can win at the national level for the reasons that I just described, and we have $1 billion of net new wins since Q3, and we know we can win at the local independent street level by increasing share of wallet and winning net new doors at the independent sector level. I'll pause there, Nicole, and come back to you if you have a follow-up.
Nicole Miller Regan - Piper Sandler & Co.: Thank you. My follow-up is around the pieces of the business. So I believe it's like two-thirds, so a big chunk is in restaurants. And I wanted to understand the percentage in what might be called a limited service or QSR versus full-service or casual dining. And I'm asking because of that comment around the recovery kind of stalling out in July. We know from Knapp-Track that casual dining was down 25%, and limited service across the board is flat. So if I just do the math, so about 80% of your restaurant portfolio is in the QSR versus about 20% in casual dining. Is that right? Is it flawed? And then there was also a comment about, hey, we can easily shift to QSR. Can you tell us a little bit more about how you do that? Thank you.
Joel Todd Grade - Sysco Corp.: Sure. I'll start with that. And a couple points, number one is that the general mix of our business, if you think about it, is about 50:50 when it comes to local and contract. So when you think about the 62% of our business as restaurants, I think that roughly applies. And then again, there's a smaller percentage of that that is the QSR versus the fast casual. So, we haven't specifically given those points out, but that's really how to think about and I think the math that you did is fairly representative of how I would think about that ultimately. I think the question on whether the talk about the shift is really related to this idea of fishing where the fish are. Let me be very clear, we are not – this is not some overall strategic focus that says we're no longer focused on independents. We clearly – that's our bread and butter. That's the things that we do best. That's the business that we support in the most effective way. And so that clearly remains a focus of ours. But during this time of uncertainty where those recoveries may be somewhat slower in that part of the industry, this is really about what I'm doing, I'm (00:53:54) fishing where the fish are and focusing on those areas where we have a right to win in that space, in the QSR space, in some of the other chain businesses. In health care, be another opportunity where I would say is somewhere we'd over index. So that's the perspective I give as it relates to that. Kevin, I don't know if there's anything else you'd like to add there.
Kevin Hourican - Sysco Corp.: Yeah. It's a good question. We understand the question. And just to be clear, as Joel said, we are actively pursuing growth in both sectors. I just want to make one important point. Prior to COVID, we, Sysco, were posting our highest case growth in the independent sector in more than 10 years. We were winning share at an accelerating rate. We anticipate that will continue post pandemic, and customers want to eat at independent restaurant customers, farm to table, fresher trends, et cetera, and we're going to win in that space. And it's the most profitable sector. So we aren't shy about the fact that we want to win in that space and that will be our long-term growth strategy. In the meantime, Joel's expression of fish where the fish are, yes, QSR is the best-performing sector at this point in time. And we have the opportunity to go win new business in that space and we will do so.
Nicole Miller Regan - Piper Sandler & Co.: Thank you.
Kevin Hourican - Sysco Corp.: Thank you.
Joel Todd Grade - Sysco Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Jeffrey A. Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much. Just two broader industry questions. Kevin, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that, perhaps Sysco is seeing less of independent closures among their customers, versus the industry average. I was wondering if you can provide any color on, whether it's your closures or what you're hearing in terms of the broader industry. The foodservice distributors seem to be our best gauge of how the independents are doing during such a difficult crisis. And then, I had one follow-up.
Kevin Hourican - Sysco Corp.: Yeah, Jeff, thanks for the question. And so what we quoted is our customers, from a closure perspective, are performing better than the industry average. I prefer not to get into quoting those percentages, but it is a factually accurate statement. What we see in the independent space, because this is a really important question, I think there's been some external reports that are embellished as it relates to permanent bankruptcy closures. There's two types of closures that we're seeing right now. We're seeing the temporary closure for the restaurant operator who is struggling with how to succeed in just the takeout and delivery business. We're in active conversations with those customers. And as restrictions ease, they're getting back into the game. And then obviously, there's permanent closures. I think some of the industry reports tied to permanent closures are very elevated. What we anticipate is that there'll be an increase in churn. There will be a timing gap caused by that churn, by those that exit and then those that will actually get back into this business after they've cleared their bankruptcy. But there's an opportunity for us to take share during that environment as well as we increase share of wallet and as we do more new customer prospecting this summer and into the fall than we've ever done before in that 30% share of wallet that I talked about. It is also important, the HEALS Act that's being negotiated. We are optimistic and hopeful that it will get approved because our small business customers would benefit and need help from that Act. And we like the initial drafts of what's being proposed. And we're optimistic and hopeful that the HEALS Act can get approved and assist those small customers. So that's our best way of answering it. We anticipate an elevated amount of churn. We do not see a substantial and significant reduction in the number of doors in the industry for the long-term. And I'll toss it back to you, Jeff, for your follow-up.
Joel Todd Grade - Sysco Corp.: Actually, Kevin, if I could just add one other important point there. I think, Jeffrey, the other point that's really key is the help that we are actually providing to our restaurant customers. I think one of the things that we certainly feel good about are the things that we've done in terms of – Kevin mentioned in his prepared remarks, the grocerant, the marketplaces, the product baskets around PPE and sanitizing products. The things we're doing to help assist with the outdoor dining with the to-go containers, et cetera. There's a whole series of things, including web development that we've done to actually help our customers. And actually, we feel good about that. And I think that's part of the reason that we do feel we've had some lower than what we'd call in the industry, so just wanted to add that one point.
Jeffrey A. Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: No. I appreciate that color. And then, just my follow-up kind of broader industry question, again, Kevin, in your prepared remarks you said, you think obviously, the recovery was stagnant in the month of July. It's improving a little bit now in August, but you mentioned that you thought the food at home fatigue is real. And you thought that the consumers will reengage when things are safe, which is obviously a very bullish comment. Just wondering what gives you the confidence that the restaurant industry can get back to seating (00:58:56) what was 100% capacity or at least serving whether in restaurant or at home, when it just seems so hard to read it right now, when most of these restaurants are only reopening at 50% capacity. So I'm just wondering how the confidence level in terms of 100% when right now, it does seem good, but in reality they're just not servicing or they're not necessarily looking at the full industry. Thank you.
Kevin Hourican - Sysco Corp.: Yeah, it's a really good question and I appreciate it. And the why we are bullish about our ability to say that is because we can see the data at a finite level across the globe, by sector, by geography, rural versus urban, et cetera. And here's what I can say with confidence. As the restrictions are removed on the restaurant operator, there's almost an immediate improvement in the results in that sector. And so, we can see very clearly in those places where the easing of restrictions is greater, the data performing substantially better and when they move from a Phase 1 to a 2 or a 3 et cetera, there's an almost immediate pop. The reason that we've stagnated or did stagnate in July, as you know, we paused in most locales, the extension of the easing of restrictions. So that's why the recovery stagnated. But what we're seeing is in August, even with that stagnated level of restrictions, the business is now starting to get better again because consumers want to go out. And so that's my best way of answering the question. Rural versus urban where the restrictions are different, we can very clearly see the difference in the results. And we do know that at some point in time in the future, those restrictions are going to begin to ease. People wear masks and wash their hands and do all the things we're supposed do. You can safely go out to eat. You take out, do delivery and restaurant operators are also getting better at it. Last thing I'd say, our restaurant operators are getting better, doing takeout and delivery. And customers are getting used to using an app to order food, be picked up at a restaurant and then bring it to their home. So it's for those reasons that we have confidence.
Jeffrey A. Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much.
Kevin Hourican - Sysco Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kelly Bania with BMO Capital. Your line is now open.
Kelly Bania - BMO Capital Markets Corp.: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking our questions. Kevin and Joel, I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about the changes to the compensation structure that you mentioned and how that's being received across your sales force. And anything we should consider in relation to this change as we think about just trying to model margins going forward? Or how much of that compensation structure is part of the $350 million in longer-term structural cost savings?
Kevin Hourican - Sysco Corp.: Yeah. I'll do the first part, Kelly, and then I'll toss to Joel for margin. But let me make one thing very clear, the comp change was not in any way, shape or form intended to decrease our operating expenses. The comp change was to better align the focus of our sales consultants and the strategy of our company, which is to profitably grow. So the biggest change – and I'd actually prefer not to get into the granular details of our comp structure because it's proprietary confidential and we believe a differentiating item at Sysco versus other places where people can work. But what we've clearly been able to do is create a comp structure that provides our associates with a level of base pay that they need to be able to pay their bills and have a comfortable living and the appropriate incentives that drive their behavior to prospect net new profitable business at a rate that will be greater than the past. However, with that said, the compensation system was informed by and advised by our sales consultants. We asked them what they wanted. We asked them what they felt would be a fair and appropriate method of compensation to address their concerns, address their needs. So to answer your question directly, the feedback and the input from our sales consultants has been extremely positive about this change, but it's changed. And when you introduce change to a large number of people, obviously, communication is important. Change management is important. And we've leaned very, very heavily into the communication and change management efforts tied to this. But we know this is going to help drive improved business performance, and it was not done to reduce operating expenses. I'll toss it over to Joel to talk about the margin comment or question.
Joel Todd Grade - Sysco Corp.: Sure. Kelly, the way I would think about that is this program, as Kevin talked about, is designed to incent profitable growth. What that means to me is continue to drive line item penetration, continue to drive new customers. When you combine that with some of the other things that we've talked about that we'll obviously providing more detail later, such as our pricing tool, some of these things, ultimately, we do believe are things that will not only improve our gross profit dollars, which is really the most important measure, but certainly the growth from a margin percentage and ultimately generating more gross profit dollars. Again, I like percentages. I like dollars more. And I think the way I would think about that is ultimately what this is designed to drive and how I would think about that, Kelly.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
John Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Thank you. I remember maybe it was a couple of years ago, and I'm going to just do all this by memory, not my notes, so excuse me for that. The regionalization of Canada and the question I think was asked back then whether there would be some opportunities of kind of applying that regionalization done in Canada to the US and I think for a number of different reasons, I think just how the geography of Canada is different than the US, the answer was no. But am I right in kind of remembering that, correctly? What did you see in Canada in terms of overall productivity and reception from both the employees and the customers? And if there were any learnings from Canada, whether positive or negative, that we can apply to the US is basically a good benchmark, if you will, in comparison of those two markets? Thanks.
Kevin Hourican - Sysco Corp.: Yeah, John, it's a really good question, and I'll just say a couple of important things tied to this. In a host of ways, Canada is a great business for us to test things, try things, and there's a host of examples, regionalization being one. We're doing some work on direct-to-consumer up in Canada to learn a lot about that space right now. We can test marketing concepts in Canada. So it's actually really helpful. It's a business that is reasonably consistent and similar to our US business, and it's a business that we can use as a test laboratory. And our Canadian team wanted to do what I just described, the regionalization, and it's worked very well for Canada. As indicated, they can move more swiftly on rolling out change. They can get to better, quicker alignment on key transformation initiatives. And as Joel said in his prepared remarks, when needed, they can execute on things like expense reductions faster. So a leaner, more efficient, more aligned model. And we believe the US business will benefit for all of those reasons. John, my point two is there's no better time than the middle of a pandemic to make a change like this. And I mean that sincerely, right? So we have a proud 50-plus-year culture that served this company well. We're a very profitable company. We've consistently grown sales and profit. And change like this introduces risk. There's no better time than now to be able to do that. And why I say that is, our team understands the impetus and the need for change. Our leaders are completely aligned with what we're doing, and they're running towards the light as to a better operating model and change management 101. But this COVID crisis, if there's a silver lining in the cloud, the impetus for change and the willingness and the appetite for our leaders to get on board and go in the direction where we're headed, has never been higher, and I believe that will pave a road of success for us as we head to the future.
John Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thank you.
Kevin Hourican - Sysco Corp.: Thank you, John.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-05-05 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to Sysco’s Third Quarter Fiscal 2020 Conference Call. As a reminder, today’s conference is being recorded. We will begin with opening remarks and introductions. I would like to turn the call over to Neil Russell, Vice President of Corporate Affairs. You may begin.

At this time, I’d like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Kevin Hourican.
Kevin Hourican: Thank you, Neil, and good morning, everyone. And we thank you for joining our third quarter fiscal 2020 earnings call. I hope that you and your families are staying safe and healthy during this time. As the business world manages through this rapidly-changing operating environment, our first priority as leaders and as a company will be the health and wellbeing of our associates, our customers and our shareholders. Our prepared remarks today will be longer than normal due to the amount of content that we want to share with you. During this morning’s call, I’ll spend time discussing Sysco’s rapid response to the COVID-19 crisis and how we are positioning the Company for long-term success. It is extraordinarily important that we as leaders manage simultaneously for the short-term and also for the long-term success of Sysco. My comments today will inform you on both of these time horizons. I’ll then turn it over to Joel, who’ll discuss Sysco’s third quarter results and provide further financial updates. Lastly, I’ll make a few closing remarks before we complete the Q&A section of the agenda. As I begin my remarks, let me assure you, we have the financial ability to weather this storm for as long as it takes. We entered the COVID-19 crisis with an extremely strong balance sheet, and we have taken important steps to further strengthen our cash position, helping to ensure our liquidity during the crisis and enable our ability to emerge stronger than ever. In response to the current environment, we have identified four key areas of focus. First, we have taken swift action to further strengthen our overall liquidity. As I mentioned, we entered this crisis in a strong position and we have strengthened our liquidity to provide us with additional flexibility. We have built more than $6 billion of cash and available liquidity that allows for not only financial flexibility and survivability during this crisis, but will enable us to capitalize on an unprecedented competitive opportunity. I am confident that Sysco has the financial ability to invest in inventory and also service levels upon the return of customer demand to foodservice. There will be profitable market share gains to be had as this crisis unfolds, and Sysco will have the investment capability to profitably win new customers. Second, we are focused on stabilizing the business by removing costs from the system. Towards the end of March, our business declined significantly from the moment the shelter-in-place orders were issued. It is a good thing that we are practicing social distancing as a society. The shelter-in-place orders are helping to flatten the curve. With that said, social distancing orders have had a significant impact on the restaurant, hospitality and education customer segments that we serve. As a result, we needed to quickly reduce our expenses in order to match the lower level of business volume. Our leadership team has taken swift action to reduce costs during this downturn. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 alone, we have removed more than $500 million of expenses from the business, which includes the difficult decision to reduce our staffing levels by approximately 33% through temporary workforce furloughs and permanent reductions in force. Additionally, we have substantially reduced miles driven by rerouting our transportation fleet and implementing productivity improvements in our operating companies. We will leverage technology improvements to implement those structural changes without compromising service or quality. This is one example of how we will be a leaner, more agile, and stronger version of Sysco, post-COVID-19. The benefits of these changes will begin to be realized in Q4 of fiscal 2020 and the permanent changes will deliver an annualized benefit of approximately $300 million. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, the expense reductions, while significant, will be more than offset by the top-line sales volume decreases that we are experiencing. Additionally, we have reduced capital expenditures to only business-critical transformational projects. Physical projects like building expansions, fleet purchases, they have been put on hold. Our CapEx investments will focus on those things that will improve Sysco’s capabilities and will allow us to win market share in the future. By focusing on a narrower set of strategic initiatives, we will accelerate the pace of change at Sysco, and we will complete key projects more rapidly than previously planned. Examples of these efforts include improving the capability of our Shop platform, which is our customer ordering tool, increasing the effectiveness of our sales force selling tool and implementing a pricing tool that will improve management of margin for the long term and increase the percentage of time that our sales force can spend on consultative selling versus administrative tasks. Combined, these capabilities will enable our sales team to visit more customers, inspire our customers to purchase more from Sysco and simultaneously reduce friction in the purchasing environment. These investments in digital technology will allow us to improve the effectiveness of our sales force and increase their efficiency. As a more streamlined company, we will garner more business from our existing customers. An example of this improvement would be the development of a suggested order for our ongoing customers. These orders will include basic items they buy weekly, but we’ll also introduce customers to new items, popular trends and even deals of the week. These offers will be personalized to the individual customer. The intersection between personalized, relevant offers and Sysco’s vast purchasing scale creates a capability that is unmatched in the marketplace. We will better leverage our scale advantages that we are now developing and we are now developing differentiating customer centricity capabilities. Third, we are working diligently to leverage the upside that exists during this crisis by capturing new business opportunities and pivoting our support of current and new customers. Sysco serves a broad spectrum of the foodservice industry. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, roughly half of food consumption within the U.S. took place away-from-home, and the other half took place inside the home. COVID-19 has obviously tilted that balance and shifted more purchases to the retail grocery channel. As a result, we have pivoted our distribution model to include retail, grocer and new supply chain partnerships, sectors that we essentially did not serve pre-COVID. We are working with some of the best retail companies in the world in an agile manner to meet the rapidly evolving needs of our customers and communities through both, supply chain and labor service partnerships. Over the past several weeks, Sysco has shifted sales of products to regional and national retailers to help alleviate strain in the food supply chain due to a surge in demand at retail stores and shifts within the economy. A brief highlight of some of these wins. We are partnering with the government agencies across the global regions we service to provide much-needed food to communities in need. In UK, we are shipping more than 200,000 meal kits per week on the behalf of DEFRA, the UK’s version of the USDA. In the U.S., we are working with FEMA and the USDA to provide fresh food for those in need through outreach to food insecure communities. And as recently as May 1st, we submitted our bid to participate in the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program. We would like to thank the various government authorities for their support of these communities in need and also the farmers that we partner with in the food supply chain. Sysco has become a supplier of products to retail grocers. We have shipped hundreds of truckloads of protein, fresh product and bulk consumables to select retail partners. We expect the majority of this work to be transitory in nature with the potential for select partnerships to have staying power. We have increased our level of support to our healthcare customers. Our healthcare segment sales have increased roughly 15% to 20% as we continue to arrange for deliveries of critical products, including PPE to hospitals, urgent care facilities and long-term care facilities. We are delivering in a safe manner for our associates and those healthcare customers. We are proud to support these frontline healthcare workers and we salute their dedication to better health. On the logistics side, Sysco is now offering supply chain service contracts such as carrier services, cross-docking and freight brokerage. Over 50 contracts have been signed with national and regional companies to provide third-party logistic services through the use of Sysco’s vast transportation fleet and logistics capabilities. And lastly, Sysco has entered into labor-sharing agreements with select retailers to provide temporary work for opportunities of our furloughed Sysco associates. This action is providing work for our team members and enables Sysco to call them back as soon as volume returns. Our highly skilled labor is providing much needed assistance to retail. Furthermore, I’m pleased to announce that we have filled our important Chief Supply Chain Officer position from the last time we spoke. On April 6th, we welcomed the Marie Robinson to Sysco. Marie brings decades of substantial logistics experience to our team from a diverse set of industries in which she has worked. She has managed complex apparel distribution networks, international supply chain and has direct experience in the food sector. I have full confidence that she will work collaboratively with the rest of our leadership team and will be a tremendous addition to Sysco. Many of our longer term strategic initiatives will be led by our supply chain department as we transform how Sysco goes to market. It is important to note that while the retail and logistics opportunities are significant and show our ability to quickly adapt to the rapidly-evolving environment, these opportunities do not offset our volume declines in the food-away-from-home space. This good work shows our agility, to fight, if you will, within our culture and we are proud to serve new partners during a downturn in our core business. The part of driving our upside efforts that I am most excited about is the work within our core business to help our restaurant customers be successful. Make no mistake, food-away-from-home is struggling right now with substantial volume decreases to prior year. At risk are the hundreds of thousands of small business customers we serve. At Sysco, we take our leadership position in the food distribution industry very seriously. And now, more than ever before, we are doing everything possible to help our customers. I am proud of the steps that we are taking to serve both, new and existing restaurant customers during this difficult time. Sysco is delivering more products and solutions, including Sysco Knows Fresh, an expansive product assortment that includes fresh meats and seafood, produce, dairy and refrigerated specialty items. We are 100% open for business across all lines of business, especially during these challenging times. We want our customers to know they can count on Sysco to help them succeed with innovative food and product offerings. We developed a COVID-19 selling bundle and leveraged our Shop platform to introduce it to all of our customers. We call it our Focus-15 COVID Package, which features a combination of cleaning products, takeout containers, paper goods and PPE. These bundled solutions are quickly delivering critical goods that our customers need to maintain seamless business operations. By keeping our customers in stock with these essentials, we are helping enable their business to pivot to takeout and delivery and helping them keep their kitchens safe and clean. We remain in stock on these crucial products. We have been assisting thousands of customers with website development for takeout and delivery solutions throughout the outbreak of COVID-19. Many of our smaller partners do not have these capabilities in-house. Sysco’s helped provide tools, tips, and solutions to develop the digital platforms that drive customer engagement and increased traffic, while also helping provide ancillary services such as home delivery, menu design, to go containers and other considerations during this unique environment. We are offering training webinars and educational programs to help our customers navigate the CARES Act and supporting small businesses to help them retain their employees during this pandemic. In under 48 hours, we built a training webinar to help these small customers apply for loans and taught them what the funds are able to be used for in running their business. Our sales team actively invited our customers to join us for these important training sessions. It is a great example of how Sysco is delivering solutions, not just food-related products. Actions like this will ensure steadfast partnerships with our customers long into the future. In less than two weeks, we have helped thousands of restaurants create product marketplaces or grocerants or pop-up shops, lots of names for it, which includes transforming dining areas into pop-up shops where customers can shop for essential pantry items like eggs, condiments, bread, toilet paper and paper towels. These additional product sales are not only helping communities, but they’re also helping the restaurant industry increase traffic and protect jobs. We are pleased to see that our volume to restaurant customers has been improving sequentially week-over-week since it hit the low mark at the end of March. At Sysco, we are helping our customers stay in business, run their business and transform their business. We know that these activities will help us retain and win additional business from them well-beyond the pandemic. In addition to helping our restaurant customers, Sysco has started rolling out direct-to-consumer sales in area of business that we did not participate in pre-COVID. Our Buckhead Meat and FreshPoint companies have held several pop-up events which sell specialty meat and produce direct to consumers. Furthermore, through Sysco’s new websites onthefly.com within the U.S. and Sysco@HOME in Canada, consumers can purchase restaurant-quality steaks to be delivered direct to their home. We have started offering, will call opportunities from our physical locations through web-enabled ordering. If a customer prefers, they can purchase product directly from one of our operating companies and pick-up the product themselves. And lastly, within the consumer space, we have partnered with third-party logistics services to offer pre-packaged meal boxes, featuring a box of specialty produce delivered straight to the customer’s front door. We are learning a lot in these direct-to-consumer initial concepts and we are leveraging these learning opportunities to better serve our customers and keep the food supply chain running. Because, simply put, the food supply chain in this country does not work without Sysco. Finally, I would like to talk about what we’re doing as a leadership team to ensure Sysco’s success, post-COVID-19. We refer to this work internally as our snapback planning. The snapback planning includes the following key items: Integrated supply chain planning with our customers and our key suppliers to ensure that inventory levels will match the business recovery. Our strong relationships with key suppliers will enable Sysco to stay in stock for our customers during the recovery period and also as we win net new customers. We are also accelerating key strategic initiatives. An example of this work is the transformation of our go-to-market sales structure. We are transforming our sales structure to be more focused, aligning the incentives of the sales force more closely with our business objectives and increasing the partnership of our sales teams across our multiple lines of business. Sysco stands ready as the distribution provider that has properly positioned for food-away-from-home, once the demand returns. We have a strong balance sheet that will allow us to invest when others will not have the same level of strength. When our customers begin to reopen their restaurants, Sysco will have more-than-enough liquidity to rapidly replenish its inventory to meet the rising demand, to ensure that deliveries are made on time and in full capacity and to capitalize on the upside by winning new business. In fact, share opportunities are already emerging as SYGMA won a substantial piece of new business as the incumbent distributor confronted economic challenges. Currently, our sales team is doubling down on their customer focus. We are focused on a combination of both, better serving our customers and prospecting new ones. We are 100% confident, there will be profitable new customers to be served as the crisis creates new opportunities to gain profitable share. We are also confident that demand for food-away-from-home will return over time and we stand ready to enable that return of demand as we continue to be our customers’ most valued business partner. Sysco will win in the marketplace through a combination of a strong liquidity, agile business decisions and value-added partnerships that fuel business relationships. We expect that the combination of winning more business from our existing customers through the trust and partnership we have cultivated during COVID-19 paired with the prospecting of net new customers will increase Sysco’s market share within the 300-plus-billion-dollar food-away-from-home sector, post-COVID. We believe that the capability improvements that we are accelerating during this crisis, coupled with the financial strains of our company will enable our success for the long-term. Now, I’ll turn it over to Joel who would discuss our third quarter results along with additional financial details around our business environment. After we finish QA, I will come back on the line to offer a final perspective regarding the Company. Joel, over to you.
Joel Grade: Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. I’ll start with third quarter results for Sysco and results by segment, followed by an overview of current segment performance. I’ll then give an update on cash flow and capital spend for the quarter. Finally, I will go through the impact of COVID-19 on the P&L, our working capital working capital, and a detailed discussion about what we’re seeing in the business. Our total Sysco results for the third quarter include a sales decrease of 6.5% to $13.7 billion. Gross profit decreased 6.9% to $2.6 billion and gross margin decreased 7 basis points. Throughout the last couple of weeks of the third quarter, we saw a significant decline in both volume and sales across all the business segments as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We will give further color on that in a few minutes. Adjusted operating expense increased 2.5% to $2.2 billion. It is important to note that while our aggressive cost reduction initiatives were implemented at the onset of the pandemic, there’s a timing delay for the removal of the expenses. We expect savings from the cost reduction measures to be realized in the fourth quarter and into fiscal 2021. Also of note, corporate expenses for the third quarter were impacted by several discrete items such as liability claims, expenses associated with the recent senior leadership change and the pull-forward of certain investments as mentioned last quarter. Adjusted operating income decreased 39.2% to $377 million and adjusted earnings per share decreased 43% to $0.45 for total Sysco. Within the U.S. Foodservice Operations segment, sales for the third quarter were $9.6 billion, which was a decrease of 5.1% versus the prior year period. Local case volume within U.S. Broadline operations decreased 4.1%, while total case volume decreased 5.2%. We did see growth in our sales of Sysco brand products in the third quarter, which increased 37 basis points to 47% of local U.S. cases and 81 basis points to 38% of total U.S. cases. However, gross profit decreased 5.7% to $1.9 billion for the quarter, and gross margin declined 11 basis points to 19.8%. Our adjusted operating expenses increased 1.4% to $1.3 billion and adjusted operating income decreased 17.1% to $637 million. Our International Foodservice Operations were modestly impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, sales decreased 7.8%, gross profit decreased 10%, gross margin decreased 50 basis points, adjusted operating expenses decreased 0.5%, and adjusted operating income decreased 93.5%. Prior to the impact of the pandemic for the third quarter, the UK business remained stable. Our Sweden and Ireland businesses performed well and our work around integration efforts in France is progressing. We remain convinced that Europe will be a platform for long-term growth for Sysco in the years ahead. Both Canada and Latin America improved performance for the third quarter as well, as a result of steady investments to support customer growth in both these geographies. In our SYGMA segment, we continued to see steady progress of profitability improvement as a result of the disciplined approach to profitable growth. Cash flow from operations was $1.1 billion for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2020. Net CapEx for the first 39 weeks was $591 million or about 1.3% of sales. Free cash flow for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2020 was $488 million, which was $511 million lower than the same period last year. The decline in free cash flow was principally the result of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as a combination of software accounts receivable, initially higher inventory from the steep volume decline, and the timing impact of fleet additions, as we have discussed in prior quarters. I will now transition to the COVID-19 pandemic impact on the business, followed by details about liquidity, working capital and capital allocation. The exit rate of the third quarter saw a significant decline in volume, sales and gross profit across all of the business segments results of the pandemic. For total Sysco, our sales were down approximately 60% during the last two weeks of the quarter. In U.S. Foodservice Operations, sales were down approximately 60% as well, SYGMA was down approximately 50%, and International was down 70%. It should be noted that our sales decline may be higher when compared to our peer group as a result of our over-indexing in local and independent restaurant customers. However, we are glad to say that recent trends have shown about 15 percentage-point increases from the end of March. We have seen a sequential weekly improvement that shows further momentum and upwards trajectory. Combined with certain states opening in-restaurant dining, we expect additional improvement throughout the month of May. Our SYGMA business had less of an impact to sales and volume as quick-service restaurants experienced less of a downturn compared to other restaurant types. In addition, we recently won a new piece of business valued at more than $500 million, which is a good example of us taking share in the industry. We were able to onboard the customer within 7 days, which shows both, our financial stability and supply chain expertise to provide fast, in-stock service. The impact of sales was steeper in Europe. Our business is down as countries have issued stay-at-home orders sooner and the restaurant foot traffic decreased as a result. As Kevin mentioned earlier, we are diligently working to leverage the upside by capturing new business opportunities and pivoting our efforts to provide support to our communities that we serve. Those efforts have improved sales trends, particularly in the UK during the DEFRA program, which similar to the U.S. has also seen a sales trajectory improvement over the past several weeks. In Canada, restaurant sales performed similar to the U.S. as consumers are practicing isolation measures to protect the health and safety of one another. We are pursuing different avenues of revenue that we normally might not have tapped into, such as, redirecting the significant amounts of inventory to retail outlets and supplying indigenous communities with critical food needs. This has contributed to the trend of improving sales most recently. As to our business in Latin America, the impact of COVID-19 has been most prominent in Mexico where volumes decreased rapidly. In Costa Rica, our cash and carry stores are helping supplement the decrease in sales from restaurants. However, Costa Rica has also allowed for the soft reopen of restaurants, which along with increased sales to retail and other supporting sales to the government has led to recent year-over-year increases in sales. Now that we have covered COVID impact to volumes, I will move to commentary about expenses. As a reminder, roughly two thirds of our operating expenses are variable, and we have been swift with our cost reduction initiatives. As Kevin mentioned earlier, the timing of those reductions, which total more than $500 million in the fourth quarter alone, will be more fully realized throughout the remainder of fiscal 2020 and into fiscal 2021. These expense reductions not only temporarily adjusted expenses for volume, but also accelerated opportunities to make permanent structural reductions to our business. The permanent changes will deliver and annualized benefit of approximately $300 million. However, to be clear, the cost reductions will not fully cover the significant impact of the crisis. On that note, to summarize from a P&L perspective, as it relates to Q4, there will be negative operating income as a result of the crisis. However, based on recent improving trends and certain states reopening, we feel that Q4 is the operating income trough. Now, let’s talk about some of the liquidity impacts to the business from the COVID-19 pandemic. As it relates to working capital, we expect our collections to remain soft through the remainder of the fiscal year. However, we have done extensive modeling for various scenarios of impact, and our current collections are ahead of those expected cash flows. We feel good about the progress we’ve made, given the current situation. Nonetheless, we have booked an additional reserve to reflect estimated exposure subsequent to the third quarter of $153 million, which we classified as a certain item. On the accounts payable front, we’ve been continuously working to increase standard payment terms with our suppliers, and are seeing good progress with that initiative. Our leadership position in the industry allows us to have these deeper and strategic partnerships as suppliers are willing to partner with us on extensions due to the size of our relationship and our financial strength. For inventories, we’ve taken appropriate steps to quickly flex our inventory levels to align with volume trends. While we have experienced some elevated levels of food spoilage, a combination of our transition to retail business and product donation has alleviated some of the impact. Our ample liquidity will allow us to adequately replenish inventory levels once consumer and customer demand returns. While we navigate this unique food environment, we continue to review our capital allocation priorities as we take decisive actions to manage our costs, capital spend and working capital. I will now revisit our four priorities. As previously mentioned, we have chosen to substantially reduce capital expenditures to only urgent projects and those targeted investments to accelerate certain capabilities to make it easier for customers to do business with Sysco and to continue our focus on industry-leading service and safety. CapEx spend was in line to the prior year for the third quarter. But, we expect spend to be more than $200 million below fourth quarter fiscal 2019, as a result of these efforts. Regarding our dividend, we remain committed to return substantial value to our shareholders through our dividend payments. If needed, we would evaluate this approach each quarter moving forward. As it relates to M&A, we continue to reevaluate potential future opportunities, but should not have a high priority on large complex deals in this environment, particularly any large international deals. As previously noted in March, we have temporarily paused our share repurchase program. And as it relates to debt, we recently completed a $4 billion debt offering. We intend to use the net proceeds from the offering to repay commercial paper borrowings, to repay outstanding senior notes due in October and for other needs as warranted, including ensuring that our business is well-positioned for the return of demand to food-away-from-home. As part of our efforts to continue strengthening our liquidity position, another important update is that we are nearing completion of our efforts to address the EBITDA to interest expense ratio covenant in our revolving credit facility to help to ensure our ongoing compliance with our debt covenant, even in circumstances where COVID-19 pandemic impacts continue beyond our current expectations. We anticipate completing these efforts and disclosing our resolution in the very near-term. In addition, we are launching a $600 million sterling commercial paper offering in the UK to take action to support the liquidity needs of our European operations. Sysco’s strong balance sheet has afforded us the stability and flexibility to navigate this unprecedented and rapidly-changing business environment. More importantly, it provides confidence in our ability to achieve continued success and growth over the long-term. As of May 5, 2020, we have more than $6 billion of cash and available liquidity. While we do not expect to immediately deploy the majority of the capital proceeds, we view it as prudent to ensure we have access to available liquidity, given the near-term uncertainties. We have not asked and we do not intend to ask for government bailout money or government financial assistance. Sysco was in a strong financial position prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and will weather this storm to emerge an even stronger company. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chris Mandeville with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Chris Mandeville: Hey. Good morning, guys. Kevin, just quickly, looking at the International business and the performance in the quarter there. I appreciate some of the country-specific color. But, if we just kind of bundled everything up together, can you give us some perspective on where sales trends are performing relative to U.S. in recent weeks? And in light of material decline in profitability, can you remind us of how varied the cost structure is internationally versus U.S.?
Kevin Hourican: Yes, sure. Thank you for the question, Chris. And I’ll take the first part and then I’ll toss it to Joel on the cost structure of Europe versus the U.S. It is a little bit different, mostly because in the United States we own our assets and equipment. We do some leasing overseas. But he’ll end with that. Europe, the business from a top-line perspective has been hit harder than other parts of the globe: A, it was hit earlier; and B, the declines themselves were steeper. So, as Joel said in his remarks, we’re about 60% down. We were at about 60% down at the trough. Good news is across the globe, we are recovering sequentially, week-over-week. As we mentioned, we’re up about 15% from where we were at the trough. But Europe started earlier, the declines were steeper and the recovery has been a little bit slower. And really, it comes down to one basic key concept; they have fewer drive-thrus in Europe than in the United States. So, I think about all the fast food chains in the United States and the drive-thru capability, the segment of our business that’s performing the best is quick-serve. Drive-thru in Europe, it’s more small restaurants. Many of them have closed temporarily and aren’t even doing the pickup and delivery that you’re seeing pretty robustly across the United States. So, we do anticipate the Europe business -- European business to come back. It’s a matter of when, not if, and it’s taking a little bit longer. And some of the social distance practices in select European countries have been quite strong. Ireland as an example was a business of ours performing quite well before COVID, and they’ve had some of the most strict restrictions. What is good is that we now have line of sight for each of those countries as to what their reopening plans look like. And even in Ireland in the month of June in particular, we’re going to begin to see easing of restrictions that will result in improved business trends, as I said, the trough being in the rear view mirror. So, I’ll toss to you on the expense side of the question.
Joel Grade: Yes. Thanks, Kevin. Yes, Chris. I think, the way to think about that, as Kevin mentioned in the beginning of his comments, that the expense structure in Europe is slightly different than we have throughout the rest of the organization in a sense that the assets that we have for most of the Company are owned, and much higher percentage of those in Europe is leased. And so, this idea of the ability to flex variable, obviously, as we’ve done across the remainder of the business, the European business has aggressively done that type of work at both from a headcount reduction as well as the productivity. However, they do still have lease agreements. Again, work’s been done there to renegotiate the terms on some of those, and again, a lot of work there. But, just to be clear, that expense structure is slightly different. And therefore, you’re going to see some of the increased impact there relative to here. The other thing I would remind you is that Europe has been a bit ahead of the curve in the U.S. in terms of the timing of when the stay-at-home requirements happened. And so, again, they’ve been a little bit further on and a little bit deeper into that than we are here.
Chris Mandeville: Okay. That’s helpful. And then, Joel, on the write-down of about $153 million, little over 100 or so of that is U.S. related. I know you can’t speak to what competition has done, but I guess I’m just curious that, call it, $107 million or so in the U.S. relative to your size, it is quite a bit different than let’s just say U.S. Foods whom has a notably higher write-down to-date. So, I guess, just how comfortable are you guys with respect to that $107 million domestically? And is there any additional color you can offer with respect to how you approach that?
Joel Grade: Yes. So, absolutely, thank you. A couple things I would point out on that. Number one is that the $153 million as an enterprise is essentially -- think about it as an estimate of what we should know now that happened between the end of the quarter and earnings, right? So, it is essentially an estimate of that amount. It is not intended to be fully reflective of all impacts that we would have going forward. But, it’s our best estimate of what we know today. We do anticipate seeing continued pressure in that space, and again, as things continue to evolve in the fourth quarter. But having said that there’s a couple key points I’d like to make in terms of what you’ve talked about in terms of the relative magnitude. Number one, we made some really solid progress in terms of our collection efforts. And frankly, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we’re actually ahead of schedule in terms of where we would have been in terms of the modeling. The second thing, as part of that, we’ve refined our tools and both from the collection that we do at the center and have engaged significantly our sales force to help with our collection efforts, even to the point where actually as we’ve thought about incentives for them during some of this time, the work that we’ve done is actually included an incentive for collection for our sales team. So, I would say, one of the things that we feel good about, even despite some of the challenges, is a very collective and aggressive effort in terms of collections. And then, the third point I’d make is that in terms of how we thought about that, it’s been a combination of things where for selected customers, we’ve supported them in the forms of payment plans, in the forms of deferrals and in the forms of them collecting new receivables on shorter terms, and so, again, doing the things that we can do to help support their business as they’re struggling through their own opportunities. So, just a couple of points there. But again, we feel good about that for now, but I don’t want that to be taken as the fact that yes, we’ve absorbed all of our exposure in the bad debt. But, the combination of that, a lot of good collection efforts is I think the result there.
Chris Mandeville: Okay. I’ll leave it there. Good luck in Q4, guys.
Joel Grade: Thanks.
Kevin Hourican: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Judah Frommer with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Judah Frommer: Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Thanks for all the color around business trends and kind of the trough, and the sequential acceleration. I was just hoping you could maybe unpack for us a bit, kind of chain versus independent trends. Clearly, the independents are probably going to get going a little bit slower than chains did. And potentially, are you seeing some independent closing slow the trajectory of that recovery? And then, additionally, does that last week of April benefit from an Easter compared to the point where that might look a little better?
Kevin Hourican: Hi, Judah. It’s Kevin. I’ll start with the macro trends and then Joel can back cleanup on anything that I missed. We talked about geographic differences in the business in Chris’s question on this one. I think, you have a pretty good insight as to what’s happening in the business. So, as I mentioned, the quick-serve restaurants are doing better than all others because of the drive-thru capability. The fine dining and smaller restaurants are struggling the most. What we saw throughout the month of April, not just the week of Easter that you’re referencing, was a sequential week-over-week improvements. Two things were happening. Those customers of ours that were in fact doing takeout and delivery are getting better at it. As we mentioned in my prepared remarks, we’ve helped them with their websites. We’ve helped them with creating social media posts. In fact, we started a campaign called #Take Out to Give Back just to creating a momentum around help that small business operator, creating awareness. We’ve seen an increase in those restaurants that were up and running throughout the entire crisis sequentially week-over-week and they are ordering more from us, as a result. What we’ve also seen is each week in April, more of our customers were getting back into business. So, for some of them, at the very beginning of this social distancing, temporarily closed shop. We’re seeing about a 10% week-over-week increase in the number of unique customers that we are serving. So, to be clear, we still have many customers that are currently closed, but we’re seeing a 10% increase week-over-week. So, yes, there’s some uniqueness with Easter. We can though normalize for that and we can go back in time to know when Easter fell on that week, and we have in fact normalized for that. And we’re seeing, as I said, sequential week-over-week improvement. And in the month of May, we will accelerate further, as many states in the U.S. are beginning to open up Texas, the state we are in, on Friday May 1st, opened up, and we can see already an impact the positive due to that. Canada, similarly is kind of following a similar speed and pace, and our Latin American business is actually slightly ahead of the United States in its recovery. As we mentioned, already, Europe is lagging. It entered earlier and it’s lagging from a come out the other side piece. And Joel, anything to add there?
Joel Grade: No, other than to reemphasize, there was a sequential improvement, Judah. It was not just kind of a point A to point B or the 15%. We actually had an incremental sequential improvement over the course of the month. Other than that, I don’t know. 
Judah Frommer: Okay. And, Kevin, maybe you could help us a bit with the profitable growth on the other side of this, right? We hear you sign a large SYGMA customer. QSR is doing better. Maybe just some incremental color on how you win profitable accounts, clearly there’s some cost being pulled out of the business, but kind of maintaining the margin structure, and does meat inflation make you at all nervous on the another side of this as well?
Kevin Hourican: So, we’ll take that question in two parts. I’ll have Joel comment upon inflation, but let me take the profitable new business wins. The reason I say the word profitable each time I say new business wins is we want to be very clear, we have no intentions of going out and trying to buy the business. We are seeing rational pricing in the marketplace by ourselves and others in the space, and we have no intentions of buying the business. What we’re referring to is our capabilities that we are bringing. I’ll remind everybody that we have roughly 30% of the share of wallet of our existing customers. The work that we’re doing to help them through this crisis, we help lobby for the CARES Act, we help teach them how to apply for the loans, we help teaching them how to set up websites for takeout and delivery, we help providing them with PPE that helps them stay in business. These things create long-term win-win partnerships for them and for us. We expect for an increase in share of wallet from existing customers. The shop enhancements that I referred to, and hopefully we’re going to have an Investor Day at some point in time later this year, we can show you the improvements that we’re making to the shop tool to increase the effectiveness of the suggested order that we provide those existing customers, again, we know will result in increased share of wallet. What I was referring to on the net new business opportunity, I’ll do the local level first. We are changing the compensation structure for our local sales associates to align the incentives of those associates more directly to winning new business profitably, we’re also changing the go-to-market structure of how we organize that work, who does what, who calls our new customers, who comes in and sells an additional product, like our premium meat business, like our seafood and fresh-cut produce business. So, it’s an entire end to end campaign visa vis-à-vis new customer prospecting and it’s being rolled out as we speak. So, it’s an opportunity, when others are perhaps struggling to deal with this crisis, perhaps having financial challenges that will hinder their ability to acquire the inventory that they need to bring back there business, we will have the inventory in place, we will have the ability to ship on time and in full, and we will have the largest sales force in the industry actively prospecting new customers. Joel, I’ll ask if you have anything to add for inflation.
Joel Grade: No, just a real quick on the meat piece. I mean, I think, look, we do expect to have some inflationary impact on beef due to some of the higher demand and supply shortages, as a result of the plant closures. I think the one thing I would just emphasize, as always, I mean, number one, we have -- we do have a substantial supply of frozen inventories that I think will continue to help carry the day there. We also, as always, have been the supplier of choice where we have access to a tremendously diversified supplier base. And so, again, access to products has always been something during any of these types of supply shortages. We’ve been the provider that’s been able to do that. And I think, just as a one time in general on inflation. Obviously, there’s a lot of moving parts in April, again, the inflation numbers, obviously we talked about one number, but there’s a lot of different categories. That’s a difficult thing to predict right now, in general. And so, we’re not really looking to do that based on the forward look, just with everything going on in April. But, I mean there is some view that there will be some inflationary pressure on the meat side, without a doubt.
Judah Frommer: Okay. Thanks and good luck.
Joel Grade: Thanks.
Kevin Hourican: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Edward Kelly: Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for all the color. My first question is really around Q4, and Joel, your guidance on negative operating income. Can you just help us out -- what level of sales declines are you anticipating in that outlook? I mean, it looks like April’s probably down a bit more than 50% or so. You talk about $500 million in cost saves. I don’t know, you run the numbers through the model, and it doesn’t look like OpEx is going to be down by $500 million. And then, is there additional sort of like gross margin pressure in this that we need to think about or pressure on profit per case?
Joel Grade: Yes. So, a couple of things, Ed. Thanks for the question and good morning. I think, yes, I think, the way I would think about this is the following. I mean, I think, your approach, your approximation of April is roughly correct. Again, I think, as we talked about, some level of gradual incremental improvements over the course of the quarter, I think would be what we are expecting, just given the trends that we’re seeing and obviously the states’ gradual reopening of their economies. From a margin perspective, I do think there’s -- our margins in this time are impacted, I guess, I’d think about really by a couple of things. One is the mix of the business. Obviously, as we’ve talked about, there’s a bit more of the chain, and particularly QSR space has been better off than the local. And so, that obviously will result in some level of mix shift. In general, there also for a time period in order to remove inventory, there was some level of discounting we had done in order to move some of that product. And so, that is not to suggest irrational competitive behavior; it’s simply to suggest movement of inventory. So, I think, you’ll continue to see some of that. So, I think there is a margin pressure that is likely to be continuing to impact that is probably one of the pieces that you’re missing out of your modeling there.
Edward Kelly: And then, just on the OpEx, Joel. The $500 million, that’s gross number or net number?
Joel Grade: Well, so, in other words, what I would suggest is that you should think about the trends you’re anticipating, based on volume movement. We’ve given you kind of a two-thirds variable and fixed, et cetera, et cetera. And then, we’ve actually taken $500 million of expense out. So, I don’t know how to say it other than just to run your expense model and add back by $500 million.
Edward Kelly: Okay. And then, the one follow-up I just had to all that is, how -- the variable cost component and how things -- customers are just not open, and you’re able to put a lot of costs on the sideline. It is probably different than it looks like when we reopen and customers are back, but everybody drop sizes are half of what they were maybe, right? How do we think about the next few quarters, as we reopen? And what the ramp in the costs sort of looks like against the reopenings and variable cost component, and how it changes in that environment?
Joel Grade: Well, I’d say a couple of things to that, Ed. Number one, I want to reemphasize our point that we do believe while we get -- we try to be clear on what we expect for Q4. We do believe that’s the trough. Number one. I think that’s an important point to emphasize. The second thing I would emphasize and point out is that as part of the cost work, it’s not only been reduction of the heads and reduction of variable costs in that way, but the productivity improvements that we’ve made have also been significant. We’ve taken almost 90% of our overtime hours out. We’ve taken actually action to ensure that our routing is reflective of the fact that -- again, we have the metric called pieces per trip, that is only down a slight percentage from the actual volume decline, meaning that we’re sending out a lot less trucks. We’ve got a very fast and agile rerouting of our fleet in order to maximize and optimize our routing. And so, I think that’s another part that comes into play here, the way you’re talking about. So, I guess to put a bow on all that to summarize, yes, we’re going to anticipate there’s going to be some capacity restrictions or whatever things that restaurants, and there will likely be some lower than normal drops. But, as we’ve done now, we will be very flexible and agile in terms of ensuring we’re optimizing our productivity and the profitability of the business that we’re going to do.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Your line is open.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Couple of questions as well. First one, just in terms of the independent restaurant outlook. I know, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that perhaps your sales are a little lower than peers because you kind of over-indexed towards those customers. I’m just wondering, as you think about their recovery, they’re getting lots of questions in terms of survival of a lot of these independents. It’s been difficult to use history as a guide because we just don’t have a period of time that’s even close to something like this. But, any thoughts you might have in terms of the potential for a significant independent store closures, whether or not you can look at maybe current accounts that aren’t returning calls or how you think about sizing up the independent restaurant outlook over the next 6 to 12 months on the heels of the pandemic? And then, I had a follow-up.
Kevin Hourican: Yes. Jeff, I’ll be pretty concise on this first question, because obviously, we can’t with precision predict the question that you’re asking. What we would say are a couple of key components from a color perspective. For the longest term, we expect for that local street independent customer business to normalize and return back to its pre-COVID levels. People like eating at local restaurants, the whole farm to table, organic, local, et cetera was a big trend pre-COVID, and we would anticipate over time that it will revert back to that type of business penetration. And it’s the most profitable segment and one where we have significant upside potential from a market share perspective. And our sales force is uniquely positioned to do well in that space for the reasons I said earlier. As it relates to the second half of calendar 2020, and what will be the first half of our fiscal 2020, we’ll say it this way. From an expense management perspective, we will be planning for and preparing for the worst and we will be driving hard to make it be better than that potential outcome scenario. So, that’s about as clear as I can be at this point in time on that color.
Operator: Thank you. Due to the interest of time, that would be our last question. I would now like to turn the call back over to Kevin Hourican for closing remarks.
Kevin Hourican: Okay. I want to thank everyone for your questions. And I’m sorry that our prepared remarks took longer than they normally do and therefore we didn’t get to as many questions as we would have liked. But, we thought it was really important for us to provide you with the details that we did. And I would like to close with a final few thoughts before we end the call. I’d like to summarize the significant amount of content that we covered with you this morning. As Joel reviewed, the financial impact of COVID-19 on our business is significant in the short-term. With that said, we want to be very clear that we are very confident in the long-term success of Sysco. We will continue to be the leader in this business and we will win new business through this crisis. We will profitably gain market share in the businesses we serve today and we will closely evaluate new business opportunities that have been identified during this crisis. To summarize the actions we’ve taken. We’ve improved our liquidity, we’ve reduced our operating expenses, we are driving our upside by leveraging new business opportunities in the short-term, and most importantly, we are using the COVID-19 crisis to transform our Company. It is Rahm Emanuel who is most often cited with the quote, Don’t Let a Good Crisis Go to Waste. We have taken those words to heart at Sysco. The crisis has galvanized our team to focus on a narrow set of strategic initiatives, and we are working in an agile and collaborative manner in a way that is better than at any time in our proud Company’s history. This leadership focus will enable us to implement transformational initiatives, like the ones I highlighted today in rapid manner. This includes improving our Shop tool, implementing a new go-to-market sales structure and selling model, and developing and implementing a world class pricing tool to better manage top-line growth and margin management. Each of these initiatives will help us becoming more agile, focused company. It will enable us to serve our customers more effectively, which will result in increased market share. When you combine what we will become as a company with the amazing work our sales team has done during this crisis to help our customers, we know we will be our customers’ most trusted business partner. That trust will help increase share of wallet with them and grow our top-line and bottom line. I would like to thank all of our Sysco associates for their tireless efforts and leadership they’re displaying during this crisis. Our associates inspire me every day. That concludes today’s call. And we thank you for joining us.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to our Executive Chairman of the Board, Ed Shirley.
Ed Shirley: Thank you, Neil, and thank you everyone for joining our second quarter fiscal 2020 earnings call. I'm proud to speak to you today as Sysco's new Executive Chairman. On today's call. I will provide some introductory remarks about the recent leadership change, and then you will hear from our new President and CEO, Kevin Hourican. After that, Joel will walk you through our second quarter results, and then we will take your questions. As you know, we recently announced senior leadership changes to accelerate the next phase of our development. This leadership transition was part of a deliberate and thoughtful process to ensure that Sysco is best positioned to enhance long-term value for all our stakeholders. While Sysco's performance has improved steadily over the last few years, we see a clear opportunity to accelerate growth. Kevin brings a demonstrated track record of delivering strong results and operational efficiencies within large and complex environments. He takes a strategic approach to winning in underdeveloped markets. We are highly confident he has the skill set and vision to capture the opportunities ahead. As Executive Chairman, I will work closely with Kevin to ensure smooth transition and provide input on key strategic priorities. Our Board is excited about Sysco's future and is fully supportive of Kevin, the leadership team, and all of Sysco's associates, as they strive to continue to support our customers. I have had the opportunity to speak with many of you, and I look forward to continuing our dialogue as we move forward together. I'm now pleased to introduce Kevin, who will make brief remarks before handing the call over to Joel to discuss the quarter.
Kevin Hourican: Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to join you today for my first earnings call as Sysco's new President and CEO. And more importantly, I'm very excited to lead Sysco during this time in our Company’s history. I would like to say a few words about what attracted me to Sysco and the compelling opportunity that I see ahead. For decades, I have admired Sysco's reputation as the market leader in cutting-edge foodservice solutions. Like Sysco, I have dedicated my career to excellence of supply chain, logistics, taking a customer-first approach and leading successful teams. I have admired Sysco for its leadership, its brand and its strong culture in these areas. When the opportunity arose to join the team, I immediately knew that this was the right next step for my career and a place where I can apply my leadership skill set and business passion. I also knew that this would present a unique opportunity to further strengthen the company as the market leader and enhance growth. Sysco's Board and I collectively agree that there are opportunities to further capitalize on our scale advantages, win in underdeveloped markets, improve our performance and increase operational efficiencies to unlock funding for growth. Our core strategy will remain in place, but we intend to accelerate execution in key areas to increase long-term value for all of our stakeholders. I look forward to working closely with Ed, the Board and our talented global team to deliver on our strategic plan. And I look forward to speaking and meeting with you, our associates, our analysts and our investors. Your perspective on our business and the surrounding landscape will continue to be important as we move forward. Now, I will turn the call over to Joel, so we can walk you through our second quarter results.
Joel Grade: Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. This morning, we announced financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2020, which represented improved local case growth in our U.S. Foodservice segment, primarily driven by our independent customers. I will start with second quarter results, continue with segment-specific commentary, transition into the first half of fiscal 2020 results, and then close with a general business update. Our total Sysco results for the second quarter include a sales increase of 1.8% to $15 billion, which was driven by U.S. Broadline local case growth of 3.7%. Gross profit grew 2% to $2.8 billion, and gross margin increased five basis points.  We saw growth in our sales of Sysco brand products in the second quarter, which increased 27 basis points to 47% of local U.S. cases and 42 basis points to 38.3% of total U.S. cases. Adjusted operating expense increased 1.5% during the quarter, which resulted in an adjusted operating income increase of 3.9% to $626.9 million. Adjusted earnings per share grew 13.2% to $0.85. I will now transition to our quarterly results by business segment, starting with our U.S. Foodservice Operations. Local case volume increased 3.7% versus the prior year period and has now grown for 23 consecutive quarters. As previously noted, we remain disciplined in our approach to managing our national account business, which was reflected this quarter in our total case volume growth. As a result, total case volume growth was 2% for U.S. Broadline operations. Sales for the second quarter were $10.4 billion, which was an increase of 3.2% versus the prior year period. This includes the divestiture of Iowa Premium, our beef processing facility that was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, which had a negative impact of $122 million for the quarter. Gross profit grew 2.4% to $2 billion for the quarter. While we are pleased with the gross profit dollar growth, gross margin declined 17 basis points to 19.7%. This is primarily driven by a few key levers.  First, we saw an unusually high rate of inflation specifically in the dairy and beef categories. As a result, we are unable to efficiently pass inflation through to our customers. Separately but still related, we saw a return to more normalized pricing in produce markets, compared to a sharp increase in the second quarter last year, which resulted in a negative impact to our gross profit dollar growth. We expect this year-over-year headwind to continue into the third fiscal quarter. Lastly, fuel surcharges, which appear in gross profit for us, were less this year than in the prior year period. Turning our attention to costs. Our adjusted operating expenses increased 1% to $1.3 billion. As we have discussed in our previous quarters, our labor costs were slightly higher due to our decision to retain driver and warehouse personnel in a tight labor market. We will continue to evaluate our staffing trends relative to our business model over the next couple of quarters. Additionally, we experienced a 12-day strike in Denver, which resulted in added costs from the business impact of continuing to serve customers during that period. Adjusted operating income increased 4.7% to $772 million within our U.S. Foodservice Operations segment. Moving to International Foodservice Operations, we had mixed results for the quarter. Our international results were modestly impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, sales increased 0.9%, gross profit increased 0.4%, adjusted operating expenses increased 2.2%, and adjusted operating income decreased 11.1%. Our business results in Canada softened for the quarter as a result of a slowing economy in some parts of the country and the loss of a large chain customer. Our business results across Europe were mixed. As mentioned during the first quarter call, we continue to experience operational challenges arising from our integration efforts between our two businesses in France, which is offsetting growth in our other international businesses. We expect this to continue through the end of our fiscal year. However, the UK business performance remained stable despite ongoing uncertainties around Brexit. We are continuing our work around modernizing the business and growing our customer base. In Sweden and Ireland, we saw positive results versus the prior year period stemming from a positive business environment and solid independent sales growth. We remain convinced that Europe will be a growth opportunity for the company in the years ahead. As for our business in Latin America, the companies are performing well and we remain excited about the growth opportunities in this region. We extended our retail cash and carry footprint from Costa Rica into Panama with plans to open more stores there in the future. In Costa Rica, we saw solid growth despite a slight economic slowdown due to the recent implementation of a value-added tax. In Mexico, the business has improved meaningfully year-over-year despite continued economic contraction. Our SYGMA segment continues to show improved profitability as we remain disciplined and focused on our portfolio of customers. As a result, we saw planned top-line softness as sales decreased 5.3% versus the prior year period, but gross margin expanded 62 basis points. Adjusted operating expenses were down for the quarter, driven by a focus on business and routing optimization, which led to an adjusted operating income improvement of $8 million versus the prior year period. We feel good about the continued progress we are making within SYGMA and are confident in our ability to drive improved performance going forward. Finally, it is important to note that our core business is performing fairly well as our adjusted operating income from operations increased 5.5% versus the prior year period. However, our corporate expenses increased due to several discrete items such as costs from the Denver strike and other liability claims. Therefore, our adjusted operating income increased only 3.9% versus the prior year period. Now, turning to our results for the first half of fiscal year 2020. Sales increased 1.2% to $30.3 billion. Our local case growth in the U.S. Broadline was 2.9%, and total case growth was 1.4%. Gross profit increased 1.7% to $5.8 billion, and gross margin increased 10 basis points. Our overall expense management was solid with adjusted operating expenses increasing only 0.5% for the first 26 weeks. Adjusted operating income increased 5.7% to $1.4 billion, resulting in a gap between gross profit dollar growth and adjusted operating expense growth of 120 basis points. Adjusted earnings per share increased by 10.7% to $1.83.  Cash flow from operations was $754.5 million for the first half of fiscal 2020. Net CapEx for the first half of the year was $383.1 million or about 1.3% of sales, which as a reminder is in line with our previously noted guidance. Free cash flow for the first half of fiscal 2020 was $371.4 million, which is $329.5 million lower compared to the same period last year. The decline in free cash flow was impacted by an increase in working capital as we continue to experience challenges from our ongoing implementation of the finance transformation road map as well as an increase in bad debt accounts. Strong cash flow has always been a strength of Sysco, and we are confident that we will see an improvement to this trend by the end of the fiscal year. Before closing, I would like to make a few additional comments about our financial performance where we stand relative to our three-year plan goals and our outlook for the year. We have a chart on Slide 14 of the earnings presentation slides on our website detailing anticipated results compared to our most recent three-year plan guidance. As you recall, our three-year plan included six different financial objectives. These included total case growth of 2.5% to 3%, for which we are tracking to 2.5%; local case growth of 3% to 3.3%, for which we are tracking to 3.3%; sales growth of 3.5% to 4%, for which we are tracking to 3.7%; gross profit dollar growth of 3.5% to 4%, for which we are tracking to 3.6%; adjusted operating income growth of about 8% or $600 million, for which we are tracking to 7%; and adjusted earnings-per-share growth of 15%, for which we are tracking to approximately 15.5%. When we announced senior leadership changes last month with a goal of accelerating growth and operating improvements, we noted that our fiscal year 2020 performance was generally tracking along with consensus estimates. As you can see from the chart, we continue to generate strong performance relative to our three-year plan across virtually all metrics. However, after closing the second fiscal quarter and considering recent performance even with some clear positives such as an acceleration in local case growth, we have decided to make adjustments to our outlook.  Specifically given challenges we are seeing and have discussed this morning relative to year-to-date performance; specifically challenges related to inflation changes, integration challenges in France, discrete corporate expenses I noted earlier, and given certain investment opportunities we see today that can deliver strong returns overtime, we have decided to amend our plan. Specifically, we are lowering our adjusted operating income growth target to approximately $500 million to $525 million to the previously communicated approximately $600 million target and lowering our three-year adjusted operating income growth guidance from approximately 8% to 7%. We would note that the benefits we are seeing below the line in areas such as interest and tax rate provided added flexibility to make these investments now, while still delivering on our previously communicated top-line and bottom line earnings per share targets. While we do not like to move backwards at any part of our previously communicated commitments, when given the decision between achieving a short-term goal or investing for the long-term, we will always choose to invest for the future. The investments we are making will allow us to advance work that will both further enhance our customer focus while accelerating future growth and to continue our efforts to efficiently manage costs through improved processes.  It is important to note that we are incredibly excited about Sysco's future, one that will include continued leadership across the foodservice industry driven by investments in our customer-centric strategies and fueled by the best associates in the business. With that, operator, we are now ready to take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo.
Edward Kelly: Hi. Good morning, guys. And Kevin, let me just me be the first to say welcome to Sysco. My first question actually is for you, Kevin. I mean, I know it is obviously very early days, but you and the Board have clearly highlighted the desire to grow faster as a company overtime. Can you just give us some sense as to what that means and how you get there profitably? I think there is just some concern around when companies make CEO changes and talk about accelerating growth about what the cost of that potentially could be. And I'm just curious philosophically how you are thinking about - how you think about the path to that. 
Kevin Hourican: Yes, good morning, and I appreciate the call - the question on the call this morning. First, I do want to acknowledge the good work that the company has been doing and the strong results and, as Joel said, the very capable team here at Sysco. And to directly answer your question, where do we see opportunities for growth?  The first is, we need to and can leverage our scale and our size more efficiently. Joel referenced improved processes, taking cost out of the system. That cost that we can take out of the system that is where we can fuel and fund top line growth in the future. We will be very pragmatic and disciplined on our pricing strategies. Joel, I know, has covered that consistently quarter-over-quarter.  We will be very thoughtful about how we price the business. Ed referenced there are underserved markets for Sysco. A specific example would be the metro market where we under-represent versus our national average.  There are some things we can do vis-à-vis how we serve those customers more strategically with, we will call, customized tailored supply chain solutions for those markets, and that would be again another area of where and how we can grow that is not tied to price.  I guess, I would just wrap up with saying, as you know, this is a very highly fragmented market, one where the largest player in the space through the investments that we can make, the capabilities that we can bring to the table, we can take increased share overtime, and that is our plan.
Joel Grade: And Ed, if I could just add one thing to that. I think, look, we have said many times, and we have said that our strategy as a leader in this industry has never been to lead with price. It never has been, it never will be. And so, I think the - again, some of the stuff that you are seeing this quarter as we talked about was related to some - a bit elevated inflation that happened at a higher level and at an accelerated rate that allowed us some inefficiencies on passing that along. But again, I just want to reiterate - what Kevin said and just to add on to that question just a bit, and that is not and never will be a strategy of ours to lead with price.
Edward Kelly: Can I just follow up then, Joel? The case level profitability on gross profit per case this quarter was obviously disappointing. And you mentioned the inflation component. But inflation overall didn't really accelerate from Q1. I'm just - I guess I'm struggling with what changed from an inflation standpoint and why you had issues with passing through costs within dairy and the protein side? And then, why even through the back half of the year, it sounds like you expect that pressure to continue?
Joel Grade: Sure. So, a couple of points. First, I would say, one of the things that we saw - remember, the average that we talked about inflation is one number, but obviously it is made up of a lot of different categories. And some of those categories tend to be harder to pass along inflation with - than others. And again, certainly the Center of the Plate category is the ones that tend to be more emotional on our space.  And so, what we experienced, and particularly in the later part of the quarter, was an acceleration in the areas that we talked about primarily in Center of the Plate and beef, in dairy and - as well as some in canned and dry. But really the beef and dairy categories were the primary ones. And I think, again, as we have talked about a number of times, it is not just that overall number, it is the rate at which they're actually accelerating. And certainly that is part of what we saw again toward the later part of this quarter that we struggled to pass along. The other point I would make, when you actually look at the overall, given if you will gross profit per case. One of the things we called out here is, some of the produce market that we had last year that was related to weather impacts in California. And so, at that time, we had some positive gains from the produce markets. That was the latter part of the second quarter last year, and we actually saw that carry into the early part of the third quarter of last year as well. And so, on a per case basis, when you look at the overall gross profit, it really is related to, again, some of the struggle of the inefficiency of passing some of the inflation along to the produce markets, again the piece around the fuel surcharge, particularly areas that we struggled with. The question that you had in terms of - as we see that outlook moving forward, I think one of the things we did continue to see is some of those challenges that we had toward the latter part of this quarter and carry into the early part of the third quarter. And so, I think that some of it, again, will be somewhat self-correcting in a sense that in the case of our multi-unit customers, so that 50% of the business that we have on a cost-plus arrangement where it is a relatively short-time lag to pass some of that cost along.  Again, we will anticipate seeing, I would say, some improvement there. But again, particularly the categories that we saw the inflation in and the rate that we saw the increase is why we had some challenges passing that along. And it impacted our margins, particularly in the U.S. Foodservice business.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Mandeville with Jefferies.
Chris Mandeville: Hey, good morning. Kevin, I guess, similar to Ed's question here. I imagine a little bit more of a detailed go-forward strategy is going to be laid out at some point. So, I guess I'm just wondering what the reasonable time frame to expect there? And is there any ability to elaborate a bit more on the comments surrounding a desire to improve in underdeveloped markets and your ability to deliver strong results in large complex environments? I mean, I guess when I think about that, it sounds like you are referring to urban markets and from what we understand that is already a fairly competitive environment and comes with low margins. So, how do you navigate those waters and accelerating sales but yet not diluting your margin?
Joel Grade: So let me take that. I will let Kevin add in if he so desires. Obviously it is pretty much his first day on the job, so we should take that into consideration here. But what I will say is the following. The idea that the metro markets are competitive is certainly true.  The idea that the metro markets are somehow inherently unprofitable, I would certainly debate that with you significantly, because again there is - one of the areas that we have been underdeveloped is in some of the most sort of dense urban markets. And in some of those cases, it is about the ways that we go to market and the value that we provide to those customers. And in so many of the cases, and particularly in some, again, the - some of the high-end restaurants and some of the different metropolitan areas, again, price becomes much less of an issue when the go-to-market strategy is the right one. And so, I - so I will let Kevin chime in here, but I just want to probably a little bit debunk this idea that somehow we are just charging into the less profitable area. Kevin, I will let you take it from here.
Kevin Hourican: Yes, Joel. So what I was referring to, yes, was the more metro markets where our share under-represents. And the why as I mentioned earlier was the supply chain solutions and the go-to-market strategy that works in more suburban or rural area does not necessarily work in a downtown metro environment.  Some of these high volume, let's just call, New York City restaurants, they may need delivery multiple times per day. And what we will work on are solutions that provide more tailored support for those types of customers in a cost-efficient way so that the business would be profitable. And Joel already covered the profit per customer, so I won't build on that.
Joel Grade: I think the other thing I would point out, Chris, when we talk about investments that we are making, some of the investments that we are talking about here are to continue to enhance the way that our technology tools interact with our customers, to continue to enhance the way our technology tools allow our salespeople to be supported in a different way that allows, again, for these types of interactions. So I think, again a lot of these things that we are talking about here is certainly - are where we see opportunities, and again particularly in these areas where we are very - we are significantly underpenetrated.
Chris Mandeville: Okay. That is helpful. And then, Joel, I guess recently I believe there was a decision to outsource your customer service department. Any way that you can elaborate on what went into that analysis with respect to potential cost savings versus maybe some service disruption or just changes for that matter? How does the department change with respect to its overall interaction with account? And does anyone else in the industry necessarily have a similar model?
Joel Grade: Well, let me start with the premise of why that decision was made and the thought process around that. If you look at Sysco historically, one of the challenges that we have had in servicing our national customers is the idea that we have primarily had customer care at each operating company level. So name the CMU customer, and you had to solve issues whether it were credit issues, whether it were customer service issues, your primary points of contact were in a very decentralized - we service in 50 locations, you basically had 50 points of contact, which obviously is suboptimal in terms of the service for a large national account. So the basic strategic premise for doing this was to actually have a situation where you actually had, again, sort of a one call, one single point of contact for customer care, single point of contact for credit issues.  And so, the whole reason strategically for doing this was around that. Part of the work that we did and the decisions in terms of why we chose to do things in the way that we did was again both to have a partner that would allow us to provide the technology support to enable that work, and again to restructure the team somewhat differently in a way that again it was really more focused around teams of this sort of single point of contact for customers. So, I actually look at this as a very good strategic enhancement for our business both from the perspective of the ability to actually sell those customers and serve them in a different way and take care of their needs.  But in addition to that, and again, I would say a little bit later down the line from a cost perspective. Obviously, there is some initial work required to invest in this model. Overtime, we do believe it will be a more efficient model, but that is the premise of what that was done for.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Securities.
John Heinbockel: Maybe for Kevin. When you think about the market share opportunity, right, particularly in those metro markets, what is your early thought on the structure and size of the sales organization, right? Do you think you need to step-up hiring of MAs in some of those areas? And then, distribution platform, do you think capital is required to put facilities in closer to some of those metro markets or it is really not a capital issue as much as it is maybe trucking equipment and scheduling?
Kevin Hourican: Yes. Thank you for the question, John. I would say, on the talent and people side, it is too premature for me to comment upon that, as Joel mentioned, just started with the company. And a big part of my on-boarding will be, what we call, listening tour, which is going out and talking to our MAs all throughout the country our sales associates to listen and to learn from them. Some of the best most customer-centric ideas, innovations come from that front-line-associate. It could be the MA, it could be the driver that is been delivering to an account for many, many years in some instances at Sysco decades. They have great ideas on how we can better serve the customers. So, I can't wait to get started in regards to traveling around the country and meeting our great associates, and learning from them on how we can best serve our customers. So too premature to comment upon are there more or fewer overtime. You will hear more from us later in the year on our strategy and where we are headed in that regard. As it relates to supply chain solutions, this is my expertise by trade and by background. We will do a thorough end-to-end network optimization review to determine number of facilities, optimization of which end points are stored from those facilities. The work we do there though will be thoughtful, and we will self-fund the work that we need to do. We are not at this point communicating a need to increase capital investment. We can reduce cost and use that reduction in cost to fuel and fund the investments that we will make. That is our remit, that is our charter, and I know you are looking for specifics today. Those specifics will come in due time.
John Heinbockel: And then, Joel, maybe - I don't know, if you have an idea of how much lower your share is in these urban metro markets. I assume it is more than half what your overall share is, but any idea how much lower it is?
Joel Grade: It depends on the market as you can imagine. There is some that we are better penetrated than others. But I would say, generally it is - I would say, somewhat less than half would be the way I would think about that.
John Heinbockel: Okay. Thanks.
Joel Grade: Yes.
Kevin Hourican: I just want to add one thing to that. I don't want the participants on the call to perceive that our singular whole step growth is through those metro markets. We have multiple vectors of growth. We just highlighted one of them as an example to answer a question earlier on in the call.
Operator: Our next question comes from Judah Frommer with Credit Suisse.
Judah Frommer: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to circle back on kind of this decision to pull forward operating expense, and then what is going to effectively kind of limit the adjusted operating income growth over this three-year period. So, there are clearly some issues with operating expense and delivery on operating income growth both internationally and locally, whether it is labor in the U.S. or the consolidation in France. So, can you help us with the decision to pull forward and kind of layer on top of what seems to be going in fits and starts? And then, maybe more specifically, is a lot of this tied to the metro market share or are there other aspects you can highlight as well?
Joel Grade: Sure. So, a couple of points. Again, just as a - the general gist of the three-year plan to takedown, it was - as we talked about some of the things related to some of the margin, challenges and opportunities, the work - the integration work in France, some of the discrete expenses from a corporate perspective. The investments in the business, the way I would actually characterize that and again, this falls into the category of the point I made literally toward the end of my prepared remarks, where we talked about the decision. Would we just simply hold off on investments that we believe are really important in order to hit short-term goals or in order to accelerate some of those investments to continue to move forward on some of the things we believe are really important? And a little bit - and certainly we always have and always will choose the latter in that scenario. So, the point Kevin made earlier, again, the metro example was just simply one idea or one point that was an example of some of the areas we are looking to accelerate. But the investment is really centered around a few key areas that I would probably highlight for you. It centers around these areas around accelerating work in our customer-facing technologies. It centers around accelerating work in the technologies that support our salespeople and allow them to go to market, support our customers in the way that we think, again, certainly moves some of these things forward in an accelerated way. They focus on areas what I would call simplification of our business in terms of the way that we interact with our suppliers, with our customers. They look at the way that we can actually accelerate. And when I say cost savings, I look at cost from almost an end-to-end view in terms of both how we accelerate areas of cost of goods all to indirect spend, all of those types of things that some of the investments that we are making, we believe, will allow us to accelerate in each of those areas, again both due to simplifications as well as some of the enhancements again in technology. And then, so those are the way I would categorize some of the work in the investments. And certainly, as we have talked about the need to continue to accelerate growth in this business, they need to leverage scale in a better way, they need to go-to-market in a way that enhances our ability to service this wider group of customers in a better way. I would characterize our investments as falling into that. And again - and frankly, we felt it is important to - they're important long-term investments that we thought were very much worth accelerating.
Judah Frommer: Okay. Maybe just a follow-up on that. Kevin, would you say you had a hand in kind of pulling forward these investments or are these kind of investments that have been now there beyond the current three-year plan that the Board is deciding to pull forward? And then, Joel, if you could just help us with modeling the EPS growth coming in, in line, any help on the interest expense or tax line would be great.
Kevin Hourican: Joel will start and then I'm going to do a follow-up close to what Joel covered.
Joel Grade: Yes. I mean, what I would say is that there is - it is a continuation of some degree of investments that have already been made, but an acceleration at work. So what I would say is - and again, I will let Kevin say this to you. I mean, I think Kevin, there is an alignment with the strategic approach we are taking. But to say Kevin was one that directly said, hey, we would accelerate that would not be a fair statement. We certainly believe that as a leadership team that that was important work, again, supported by Kevin and by our Board. I will let you...
Kevin Hourican: I will build on. I will ask a question and answer, and it is - Kevin, are you aligned with the Sysco priorities and the investments that Joel just referred to are directly driving those key priorities? The answer to that is, yes, I am. The Company’s number one priority is to be a customer-first culture, and I'm 100% aligned to that culture. As I mentioned earlier, the best ideas, the most innovation - innovative solutions come by better understanding the needs of your customer and providing solutions that help you do better business with those customers. Joel referenced that. It is also our MA sales force, providing them with better tools to be able to be more effective at their roles. That is a part of this investment, and I'm 100% aligned with that. The second one is our local transformation. And Joel talked about essentially a framework of capabilities that can then be deployed to match the needs of a local trade area. One of those happens to be metro, and that is customer on-boarding, I mentioned supply chain solutions and a customer ordering tool improvement. I'm aligned with all of those things. And last but not least is business optimization. Joel talked about funding sources for growth by improving the manner with which we run our business. We have talked about leveraging our scale. Leveraging our scale is, we should be the lowest cost operator in the business, and therefore then be able to pass upon to our customers savings tied to the efficiency improvements and also create sources for investing growth dollars. So, I am aligned with the priorities and I'm very supportive of the decision that was made.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much. Kevin, you have talked about traveling the country and meeting with associates and management across the organization. I'm just wondering, how long you think before you complete that initial review and maybe we get an update on the - what you see as the vision for Sysco and whether or not we would get another three-year guide or how you kind of think about the strategy of providing guidance to the Street?
Kevin Hourican: Yes. That is a great question, Jeffrey and thank you for it. I think most new CEO is coming in, there is a 90-day, 100-day plan and this listening tour will be a part of that. In addition by the way, it is doing very specific deep dives into the business while doing that. It is not just a listening tour, but the listening tour is a vital and important part of on-boarding. I think what I would say at this point in time is late summer is when you could expect to hear from us from an update perspective on where we are with our strategies. And more on that later, Neil will help manage and communicate in that regard.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Got it. And then, I know you mentioned in your - up to kind of three-year plan guidance chart within the slide deck you talked about continued disciplined approach to profitable growth with your national and SYGMA accounts, and this has been something we have been hearing for a little while now. I'm just wondering as it relates to that, where do we stand on that? I mean, is that a process that you think is just something that we should expect to hear about for just ongoing, and therefore it is just every quarter every year that is kind of that? Or maybe is there kind of a short-term opportunity to pull that forward in order to no longer happen to be focused on pruning those national accounts?
Joel Grade: No. I mean I would think that - again, that is something I think you'll actually continue to hear us talk about. Actually we have talked about that consistently for actually many years in terms of how we view that. Again, those customers and the opportunity are really disciplined in how we grow. I would say, the only thing I would maybe say is, I mean, what you are seeing in our SYGMA segment right now, which actually has a fairly acute decrease in the top line that was planned for and as part of this thing, again, that is probably a little stronger year-over-year than you may anticipate as we move forward. But I think, generally speaking, we will remain disciplined in this space. It is an important area to us both strategically and in terms of covering fixed and providing opportunities for us to enter in service markets and outlying areas that may have that type of business that then allows us to have a great local business there as well. So, again, it is a strategically important part of the business, but nonetheless one that I think you'll continue to hear us talk about as one that we will be disciplined in terms of how we approach.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Understood. And then, lastly, I think, Joel, you mentioned something about bad debt expense. It sounds like you are making reference to an increasing of late. I'm just wondering if you could talk about where you are seeing that pressure from. We didn't get much color in terms of from a restaurant industry perspective whether you are talking about national chains or independents or maybe one or both of their operating environments becoming more difficult leading to the elevated bad debt expense?
Joel Grade: Yes. Here is how I would answer that. I mean, there is a little bit of both in terms of the market. I think, again, just one thing I would really emphasize here. There is no panic button being pushed for us in terms of the market itself. There is a bit of softness. We have had a few increased bankruptcies.  And again, I would say, it is really both across the national and the local. I would say, the bigger impact though at this point certainly remains just continued challenges around the stabilization and implementation of some of the work that we did that really centralized credit activity in an area that used to be a very decentralized activity across our businesses. And so, that is accelerated a bit over the last couple of quarters. We are certainly doing a lot of work to continue to stabilize that and certainly anticipate that happening. So, again, I would say, it is a little more self induced. But again, there is, I would say, a little softness certainly though not ready to push the panic button on the marketplace.
Operator: Our next question comes from Josh Nolan with Piper Sandler.
Josh Nolan: Great. Thank you for taking the question. Wanted to circle back to the commentary around outsourcing the support. That was very helpful. Curious if that was more of a proactive decision or if this is feeding off of commentary you have received from your customers and your key members?
Joel Grade: Well, I would say, it is probably a little bit of both in the sense that obviously feedback from customers in terms of how we have serviced them over many years is that, hey, I would rather have a single point of contact. Instead of calling 50 people, I would rather call one. I would rather have a team that knows my business well that can relate to me, again, both from a care perspective, from a credit perspective, et cetera, et cetera. So I would say, it is in response to customer feedback and how we can do a better job servicing. But again, in that sense then, I would call it proactive in the way that is something that we believe that was an important investment, one that we again found both the right what we believe structure, partner and technology support in order to do that. It is still new. We are still again moving into that, and it will continue to improve and evolve, but the team has done a great job of rolling that out. And so, again, I would call it proactive, but in response certainly to listen to our customers and feedback that we received from them over a number of years of doing business with us.
Josh Nolan: Great. That is very helpful context. And then, thinking about the international strategy, particularly in Europe, sounds like that is still a long-term growth opportunity for you. Can you talk about what you have learned with the integration process, particularly with the French businesses that you mentioned and kind of how that process is coming along?
Joel Grade: Sure. So, I think, a couple of areas that I would say thinking about how that business is integrating. It was two businesses that were acquired even prior to our acquisition of brakes. They were similar-sized businesses that we have then ultimately chosen to bring together. And I would say, the two bigger challenges really are, what we call, a single delivery, meaning instead of customers getting delivered by both businesses are being delivered by one, and the technology to support that. And so, I think, in both cases, there has been challenges in making that happen. On a positive note, doing some of that type of integration in France is often complex due to some of the labor and work councils and all that. And I think actually we have got through that part of it very well. But nonetheless, those challenges remain. And then, some of the impact you have seen have been service levels that have been less than we would like them to be, which then has translated into gross profit dollar impact there. And then, what I will call dual running costs, meaning we have had to have some of those things where both businesses running longer than we would have liked them to have done. So, I think, again, we are certainly - we have got a strong leadership team there. We have got lots of resources that we have dedicated both there and from here in order to enhance that. Some of the investments that we are talking about here as well fall into the category of how we accelerate the stabilization of that. But as you said, again, we certainly are confident that we will get there. And certainly, as you pointed out believe that, again, this is a good long-term investment for us and, again, in a market that we certainly think will be one of the strongest ones that we have in the future.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kelly Bania with BMO Capital.
Kelly Bania: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I was wondering, maybe for Joel, the decision to kind of the less consensus two weeks ago and lower kind of the outlook today. Can you just help us understand that decision? You talked about some of the factors. I'm just trying to really understand how much was the quarter and how much really is these investments and certain opportunities that you talked about. And I think what people are trying to struggle with understanding today is, how many more investments really need to be made out there over the next couple of years?
Joel Grade: Sure. Let me start with the first. And what I would say is a couple of things. So, the timing of the announcement that was made on January 13th was obviously fairly early in both the processes of closing as well as the - how we got into the third quarter. So I think one of the things that I would say, as we have evolved and certainly finished the closing process of this quarter as well as saw some of the results that we talked about as we moved into the third quarter, part of that was some of the reasons that you probably heard a little bit different tone from both of those things. And so, I think, as we looked at some of the challenges that we talked about from a margin perspective that we continue to see fall into the third quarter. We took a look at some of the work that, again, was happening in this business in France as we talked about. And I'm certainly looking forward to see some continued challenges there. And in addition to that, again, it was just some of the work that we talked about with some of the investments again, these aren't brand-new investments. They aren't things that we have never talked about doing. But certainly the opportunity to accelerate that growth - to accelerate as we build some momentum at the end of this year and head into the next year, we thought were very important in terms of how we did that. And so, I would just say the combination, Kelly, of some of the kind of wrapping up of the quarter, seeing some of the way the third quarter was starting to play out in a number of different areas of the business, obviously some transition costs as well of the leadership change, and then thinking about how we actually spend that investment dollars moving forward. The question is how much are continue to need to invest in this business. Look, I think, this has been, as I know you know, a multi-year journey of transformation because the reality of it is, is that this company, again even 10 years ago was a business that it was significantly decentralized in a way that we approach the marketplace. If you think about the things that used to happen at a local operating level, where for the most part, I always joke about this a little bit, but pretty much only things they couldn't do or they couldn't give themselves a pay raise and then to report according to U.S. GAAP. Other than that, it was for the most part their business to run. And so, when you think about the things that we have done in terms of how we standardize, how we leverage scale, the category management processes and the way that we go to market and set an assortment in a different way that is not just decided by every individual operating company, those type of transformations. Again the latest one again we have talked about on this call things like finance technology roadmap, things like the centralized customer care, all those things are one step along the way to continue to drive a more leveraged efficient nimble organization that can go to market in a different way. And so, again, there is not necessarily sort of a beginning and an end point to that. I do believe this business will continue to invest in itself. As we have talked about our top capital allocation priority is and has been, the ability to take the cash we generate and reinvest it in this business to continue to get better. And as Kevin said, as you have heard Ed talk about, our ability as the market leader to continue to leverage scale to drive the things that we can do and again go to market in a different way I think are important. And so, you should expect us to continue to invest in our business that way.
Kelly Bania: Okay. And then, maybe just one follow-up on the gross margin and the inflation impact. How much of that, just given that it does look relatively manageable on an overall basis, but obviously there is more happening, I think, in meat and dairy, but how much of that is just pure mechanics of the type of inflation and the environment you are seeing versus the execution of that either at the local or the chain side?
Joel Grade: Yes, it is a little bit of both. I mean, on the chain side again, it is actually a fairly mechanical process in the sense that as we have talked about before, there is - depending on the category, there is about a seven to 30-degree - 30-day lag in terms of when prices recalculate. So that one is a little more, I would call, mathematical and environment-driven. Obviously there is some market-driven and there is some execution as well on the local side. Although as we have talked about, historically one of the areas that is actually really allowed us to do a better job of that certainly over the last few years is our revenue management function. That is been an area that we have leveraged well both in deflationary times and inflationary times. And I certainly anticipate work that we have done and will continue to do in the rev man area will help us work through that. But we have also talked about the fact that in certain cases where inflation - and in certain categories, when inflation hits higher levels and escalates in a more rapid way that we still have some challenge in passing some of that along. So, I think that is how I would frame it up. It is probably a little bit of all of that, but certainly something that I believe moving forward we will get a handle on. Again, our rev man function has certainly done a good job of helping us work through that over the number of years, and I anticipate that continuing to move forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bob Summers with Buckingham.
Bob Summers: Good morning, guys. So, just help me understand of the operating income revision, which I think is really just what two more quarters, how much of that is being driven by this investment pull forward? And what I would really like to understand is, what is the run rate of that investment? How should I think about it as we bleed into 2021? And then, on the benefit side of the equation how are you thinking about the return on this, either through cost savings or bolting on acceleration and case volume growth? And when is that or when should we expect that?
Joel Grade: Sure. So, just starting with your first point on sort of the takedown. Again, we haven't broken out the specifics of those things, but just to reiterate again a couple of the key points. Again, there is a portion of it that is related to some of the challenges we have talked about both, again, as we kind of exit this quarter and enter the next one as it relates to some of the margin challenges. Again, it is related to some of the challenges that we have talked about in France. Again, there are some discrete costs in corporate that, I would call, are unplanned things like the strike we had in Denver, things like that we have seen a bit of higher level, I will call, claims activity in terms of things like auto liability and workers' comp. Some of those type of things that were part of - where you saw our corporate expenses elevate a bit obviously as well as some of the transition costs we talked about related to leadership. So those are things that are, again, some of the components to that as well as an investment. Bob, I don't know that we are going to go and break down the detail of every one of those components. I would say, and the biggest ones really fall into the category of some of the point on the margins, the areas in France as well as the investments broadly speaking. And I guess, from a run rate perspective, as I said, I don't know if we are going to go into that type of breakdown detail. What you should expect though as we head into our Investor Day and as we talk about, as Kevin on-boards as we talk about our ongoing strategic opportunities. We certainly plan to go into more detail of that both in terms of how it impacts our growth, how it impacts the expenses and the ability to fund that growth through some of the efficiencies. So, certainly more to come on that. But I would say, again, those are the main categories of how to think about why the takedown happen?
Operator: Our next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.
John Ivankoe: Hi. Thank you. I think the comment was made that we shouldn't expect an increase in CapEx, so I just want to make sure that I heard that correctly. I guess, especially in the context of what may be in coming years kind of a broad need to modernize facilities really not just for you but across the industry, and also potentially the use of new facilities into smaller facilities to better penetrate some of the urban markets. So that is kind of the first point. And secondly, is part of the plan or part of the thought at this point that you would enter new European countries or is kind of you are getting the current countries to your acceptable returns the priority in the near-term? Thanks.
Joel Grade: Yes. So let me take that one first and then I will go back to your other one. I think the answer on that is that certainly stabilization is the highest priority right now in terms of that. And then, again, maybe just to reiterate one thing, and then we talk about Europe is just one entity. Within that, again, three out of the four main countries we are in Europe are actually performing, what I would call, acceptably well. And obviously the biggest challenge is in France. But from a priority standpoint there, definitely stabilization is our focus at this point in time. Certainly over the long-term, we will continue to look for opportunities to grow in that part of the world. The CapEx piece, so look a couple of things I would say on that. As we have talked about actually over the last couple of years, we actually have accelerated, even heading into this year our CapEx level a bit. In other words, we have been running in that 1.1%-ish range, somewhere in the 1.1%, 1.2%. As we talked about this year, we actually bumped that up a bit to 1.3% of sales for some of the investments we plan to make. And as we talked about a little bit earlier in the prepared remarks, we are actually running at that rate. And so, I would say, on one hand, there is a bit of acceleration from the perspective of that, but that was talked about and it is where we are going. And so, I think Kevin's point was, we are not certainly saying what we are doing now at this moment in time. There are going to be, I think, some increased potential investments. But as we also look at how we rationalize those things at the moment as a percentage of sales, I think you can think about fairly consistently how we have talked about as we are headed into this year we have talked about a bit of acceleration.
John Ivankoe: Okay. So more or less model 1.3 would be safe?
Joel Grade: I think that is fair.
John Ivankoe: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rebecca Scheuneman with Morningstar.
Rebecca Scheuneman: Good morning. So I would like to circle back to protein inflation. Given the global protein shortage that has resulted from African swine fever, it is likely to think that this protein inflation will continue for at least the next year. Are you beginning to like proactively work with your customers on some price increases or are you just kind of playing it by ear? They have been admittedly volatile, the prices. I'm just wondering what we should expect if there are possibly some further gross margin compression due to difficulties passing on this expected inflation? Thank you.
Joel Grade: Sure. Thanks for the question. So, I would, first of all, decouple a couple of these things a bit. The impact that we have seen from the African swine flu has actually been very minimal, I would say. And this is something we have taken questions on for some time. And again, that is not something I would say has been a sizable or even, again, just barely above minimal impact in terms of us. I think the markets for Center of the Plate and beef do move around some. And I would say, again, we experienced a little bit more of acute inflation here in that category. I don't know that I would look right now though out a longer term and say, yes, there is some fundamental reason that there is going to be a highly inflationary Center of the Plate markets for any time to come of any real significance. Here is what I would say though, just as a reminder, in terms of how we deal with some of those things and why - back to maybe your customer point, why this has been something actually we have historically been a strong partner for our customers. And obviously we have scale benefits that have allowed us to in any of these types of moments have access to products, have a traceability that obviously is deep and well appreciated by our customers, the availability of substitutes. And so I think, the alternative products - and so, I think, if you think back a few years ago even when we had the issues with avian flu, one of the things that we were able to bring to our customers is simply the availability of product. And again, a traceability program that actually ensure that those are safe and in a way that they would expect. So I guess, what I would say to summarize that all, again, decouple a little bit the African swine flu elements that has not been something that we have had a significant issue with. Some Center of the Plate challenges right now although again not necessarily looking at what I would call acute inflation in that area over the longer-term. But in the event of any of those things, I think the company is well positioned to manage through that stuff in a better way.
Operator: The next question comes from Marisa Sullivan with Bank of America Securities.
Marisa Sullivan: Hey, good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to circle back, Joel. I think you have referenced some challenges with the implementation of your finance transformation road map.
Joel Grade: Yes.
Marisa Sullivan: Just wondering, if you can give a little bit more color on that? And then, in the timeframe for working through those, and then as it relates to working capital and free cash flow, can you just comment on when or how quickly you might start to see improvements there? Thank you.
Joel Grade: Yes. Sure. So a couple of things. So think about the finance technology road map in our history, we would have had all of the finance-related functions, things like credit, things like cash app, accounts payable, general ledger, each of those types of areas that would actually have been in each individual operating units that over the last couple of years enabled by technology, we have moved many of those functions into a centralized place and, in some cases with an offshore partner as well. And I think, what you are hearing us talk about here are challenges related specifically to local credit, where in the past each one of our operating units would have had a credit department responsible for credit and collections in each of their local markets. And in today's world, it is certainly again through the uses of technology and a bit of different structure. We are just working through some of the bumps in terms of managing how to do that in a way that is more somewhat market, but also is much more centralized. And so, again, an interesting example on working capital of a process. Accounts payable had some bumps along the way as well, and we had a little bit of a positive benefit, if you will, on working capital on that in our previous year. That process has actually stabilized and again in a strange way had a little bit of a negative impact on working capital in a sense that we paid our suppliers in a more efficient manner. So, I would say that, in general, we certainly feel confident about our ability to stabilize that. We are certainly making the appropriate investments and leveraging the technology in order to do so, but there are some short-term bumps that we are having along the way. I actually certainly in some of my prepared comments talked about the fact that we anticipate some of this continuing to improve over the course of the year. And I certainly expect that to be the case. The other point I would make, and just as a reminder, as part of the free cash flow is related to CapEx on a year-to-date basis. If you remember, at the end of our fiscal 2018 based on some opportunities presented by U.S. Tax Reform, we actually accelerated the process of investing in some fleets. That actually then allowed us to invest at a lesser rate at the beginning of our fiscal 2019. So, where we have gotten back to, what I will call, a more normalized capital spend as it relates to fleet, the year-over-year comparison certainly for the first half of the year and again this will level out a little bit as the year goes by, looks worse, particularly due to that factor. So, again, all that to say, I do think we will see some improvement in this area in the second half and certainly over the long-term, I feel good about where we are at.
Marisa Sullivan: And then, just very quickly, I'm wondering if you can give any comments about the current trends you are seeing with independent restaurants. You saw a nice acceleration in your local case growth this quarter, and I'm just wondering if you expect this to continue in the third quarter or if you can comment on quarter-to-date trends. Thanks.
Joel Grade: Yes. I think, look, a couple of things. I mean, I think the team did a great job, we talked about actually a favorable exit rate from the first quarter. That continued to accelerate over the course of this quarter, particularly in our local business, and I would say particularly in the area of account penetration. So, what this was not was just kind of going out and just - people often ask where did the growth come from? And it wasn't so much in the area of new customers, but is an area that actually as we have talked about is best for us in that further account penetration. The market itself, I would say, is kind of where it has been. I think it is in a decent place. There is sort of lots of reports that move around from time to time. And the check size has generally seemed to be continuing to elevate. Traffic seems to be flattish. You say it is up a little, you say it is down a little. But I would generally say the market is in an OK place, probably similar to what it has been. But I think, again, certainly a lot of good work by our teams in the U.S. to drive a strong level of growth, again certainly in the independent space, and we anticipate some of those trends continuing as well.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the Q&A portion of today's conference. We’d like to thank everybody for participating. You may all disconnect and have a wonderful day.

Tom Bené: Thanks, Neil, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. This morning, we announced financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2020, which reflect continued momentum in transforming our business and improved year-over-year performance. Our overall results were largely in line with our expectations. From a top line perspective, we generated sales of $15.3 billion, a 0.6% increase compared to the same period last year. As we discussed during Q4 fiscal 2019, we saw top line softness and difficult comparatives during that quarter, which we said would also carry into the first quarter of fiscal 2020. We did, in fact, see that continued softness at the beginning of the quarter, but as expected, we saw sequential improvement throughout the quarter and therefore, feel confident about the future trajectory based on the exit rate of the quarter. There were several things that contributed to our volume and sales growth rate for the quarter, including the continued growth of our local customers at a faster rate than our national customers, in part driven by the transition of certain large national customers, both in U.S. Broadline and SYGMA during the past year. Secondly, the divestiture of Iowa Premium, our beef processing facility, that was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. This divestiture had an impact in the quarter of $114 million, and the negative impact of foreign exchange rates, which amounted to an additional $100 million for the quarter. Gross profit for the quarter grew 1.4% to $2.9 billion dollars. And gross margin expanded 15 basis points, driven by continued shift in our customer mix as we grew local cases at a faster pace than total case growth. And we continued growth and penetration of our Sysco brand portfolio across the various business units. Turning to cost. Adjusted operating expenses decreased 0.5% to $2.2 billion, driven by strong expense management during the quarter, including greater operational efficiencies and benefits from our transformation initiatives, such as the regionalization work in Canada and our finance transformation. As a result, for total Sysco, we delivered solid adjusted operating income growth of 7.3%, which led to adjusted earnings per share growth of 8.6%. Looking at the broader economic and industry trends in the U.S., GDP growth was 1.9% during the third quarter, and unemployment remains at an all time low. Consumer spending, the main engine of growth, rose a healthy 2.9% but it was down from 4.6% in the spring, all signs that the economy is doing well despite some broader global concerns. While some other economic indicators have recently been softer than expected, we haven't seen a meaningful impact to restaurant industry trends and therefore, continue to feel good about what we're seeing in the food away from home market. During the quarter, according to Black Box Intelligence, restaurant same store sales rose slightly, driven by average guest check increases. Although, traffic in the food service industry continues to be mixed, it appears that market conditions are modestly favorable for food service operators in the United States. Turning to international markets. Traffic and sales in the UK and Ireland continue to be soft as uncertainties around Brexit affect food service operators, as well as other economic activity. However, these trends are relatively stable compared to conditions in the prior quarter. In Canada, GDP and consumer spending are stable and unemployment continues to decline, which is reflected in positive broader restaurant industry performance. In France, GDP growth is expected to continue. Household spending has picked up, and employment is trending down, boosted by labor market reforms. I would like to now transition to our first quarter results by business segment, beginning with U.S. Foodservice operations. We were pleased with our top-line results and strong expense management in the U.S. Foodservice operations segment in Q1. Specifically, sales for the first quarter were $10.7 billion, an increase of 2.5%; gross profit grew 2.6%; adjusted operating expenses grew only 0.4%; and adjusted operating income increased 6.1%. Local case volume was solid within U.S. Broadline operations, growing 1.5% and has now grown for 22 consecutive quarters. As previously mentioned, this performance reflects solid growth at local restaurant customers, especially as we cycled one of our largest growth quarters last year, which was partially offset by the loss of some less profitable traditional bid-type business, such as local schools. Total case volume within U.S. Broadline operations grew 0.5%, reflecting our ongoing disciplined approach in managing our national account business. We expect to continue to see the impact of certain customer transitions in U.S. Foodservice operations into the second quarter as well. Gross profit grew by 2.6%, driven by higher inflation, the positive mix of local cases to total cases, continued growth in Sysco brand, up 36 basis points, and continued category management efforts. Food cost inflation was 2.9% in U.S. Broadline, driven primarily by the meat, produce, dairy and poultry categories. From an expense perspective, adjusted operating expense for the quarter grew only 0.4%, driven by strong expense management throughout the business, including the impact of some of the transformational initiatives mentioned earlier, which drove down costs during the quarter. This was partially offset by higher labor and operational costs. Similar to the larger discussion we had in the second half of fiscal 2019, our labor costs were slightly higher due to our decision to retain driver and warehouse personnel in a tight labor market. And while we do see some signs of improvement in the overall labor market, we will continue to evaluate this practice is the right one for our business over the next couple of quarters. Moving to International Foodservice operations, we had mixed results for the quarter. Our international results were impacted by changes in foreign exchange, and Joel will provide more details on that to you in just a few minutes. However, on a constant currency basis, sales increased 3%, gross profit increased 2.1%, adjusted operating expenses increased 1.3% and adjusted operating income increased 6.2%. Canada and Latin America had improved performance for the quarter, driven by a combination of positive business environments driving the top line with positive synergies coming from programs, such as the regionalization effort in Canada. In Europe, performance in our UK business remained stable, although, uncertainties around Brexit certainly remained in the market. However, challenges with our operational and supply chain integration in France continue to negatively impact our overall performance there, and most likely continue through the remainder of our fiscal year. The relatively soft gross profit performance was offset somewhat by solid expense management throughout our international segment, as we continue to see benefits from the various integrations and other expense management initiatives [Technical Difficulty] improved operating income growth for the quarter. Moving on the SYGMA, as mentioned previously, we remain disciplined and focused on improving overall profitability of our portfolio of customers in this segment, which included gross margin expansion of 73 basis points as we saw total gross profit reduce by roughly 3%. In addition, strong expense management and the closure of a distribution location drove adjusted operating expenses down 8.8% versus the same period last year, resulting in significantly improved operating performance. We continue to feel very good about the progress we're making within this segment, and look forward to continuing to improve our operating performance throughout the year. In summary, we feel good about the trajectory of our business for fiscal 2020. We continue to increase profitability through growth at local customers, our disciplined approach in managing our national customer portfolio, managing our expenses and making progress in the various initiatives we have discussed to transform our business. As we look ahead, we are excited to celebrate our 50th anniversary this fiscal year. For half century, our company has been at the forefront of the food service distribution industry, passionate about our customers, dedicated to service and committed to being socially responsible. Our team is enthusiastic about the changes we're making in our business model to ensure we remain the market leader, and fulfill our vision to be our customers' most valued and trusted business partner for the next 50 years. And finally, I'd like to thank our dedicated associates across the company for all their efforts to make Sysco the distributor of choice for so many customers. They are truly all in. Now, I'll turn the call over to Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer.
Joel Grade: Thank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Tom mentioned, sales for the first quarter increased 0.6% despite a number of factors, including a difficult comparison versus the same period last year, our disciplined approach in managing SYGMA and national accounts within our U.S. Foodservice segment, the divestiture of Iowa Premium and the negative impact of foreign exchange rates in our International segment. Local case volume within U.S. Broadline operations grew 1.5% for the first quarter, of which 1.4% was organic. While total case volume within the US Broadline operations grew 0.5%, of which 0.4% was organic. Gross profit increased 1.4% versus the same period last year and gross margin increased 15 basis points. We saw growth in our sales of Sysco brand products, which increased 20 basis points to 47.7% of local U.S. cases and 36 basis points to 38.8% of total U.S. cases in the first quarter. We are pleased with our strong expense management for the quarter. Our transformation initiatives continue to generate benefits to the business as adjusted operating expenses decreased 0.5% compared to the same period last year, and slightly ahead of our expectations. As a result, the gap between gross profit dollar growth and adjusted operating expense growth was 190 basis points and adjusted operating income grew 7.3% compared to the same period last year. It is also important to note that our adjusted operating expenses grew only 0.4% within the U.S. Foodservice segment despite a challenging operating environment. Although, we have strong expense reductions throughout the quarter, we continue to invest in areas of our business that will help facilitate future growth. For example, our technology spend was higher versus the same period last year as we continue to make advancements in areas that help us streamline workflow, while better supporting our customers and helping to support better growth. During the first quarter in the U.S. Foodservice segment, we saw 220 basis points gap between gross profit dollar growth and adjusted operating expense growth, which translated into strong adjusted operating leverage for the quarter. As Tom mentioned earlier, our results in the International segment were impacted by foreign exchange rates. In that segment, sales decreased 0.3% on a reported basis and increased 3% on a constant currency basis. Gross profit decreased 1.7% on a reported basis and increased 2.1% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted operating expenses decreased 2.7% on a reported basis and increased 1.3% on a constant currency basis. And adjusted operating income increased 3.8% on a reported basis, but increased 6.2% on a constant currency basis. As it relates to taxes, our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 22% compared to 20% in the prior year period. While higher than per year, this rate was lower than our guidance of 24%, primarily due to tax benefits from share based compensation. Our adjusted earnings per share grew 8.6% to $0.98 per share, which is an increase of $0.08 compared to the same period last year. Cash flow from operations for the period was $172 million for the quarter, which was $100 million lower compared to the same period last year. Free cash flow was $1 million, which was $170 million lower compared to the same period last year. Net capital expenditures totaled $171 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2020, which was $70 million higher compared to the prior year period. The decline in free cash flow was due in part to an increase in working capital in the first quarter this year, driven primarily by an increase in receivables. Additionally, we saw planned higher capital spending due to the timing of investments in the prior year period. However, we continue to expect strong cash flow for the full fiscal year 2020. In July of 2019, we adopted the new lease accounting standard that changes the way we recognize operating leases by including the related right of use assets and lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of fiscal 2020.The changes are also reflected in the consolidated results of operations and consolidated statement of cash flows. However, there's only minimal net impact. We remain focused on delivering long term results for our shareholders through a strong and consistent approach to our capital allocation priorities, which are as follows; investing in the business, consistently growing our dividend, participating in M&A and maintaining a balanced approach to share buybacks and paying down debt. We typically review our dividend growth rate each November, and expect to once again increase our dividend later this month. We also have previously committed to a modestly higher rate of share repurchases than in the prior year. In summary, we had a solid first quarter that reflects the sustained momentum of our work to transform our business. as fundamentals of the industry and our business remained strong, as we continued to deliver steady local case growth, good gross profit dollar growth and strong expense management. These results give us confidence that we remain on the right path to enhancing the customer experience and delivering a high level of execution in all areas of our business, as we continue our progress toward achieving our three year plan objectives. Operator, we're now ready for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Edward Kelly from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Edward Kelly: Good morning. And nice quarter on slower overall case growth, and that's really kind of what I want to ask you about, Tom and Joel. I was just hoping could you provide just a little bit more detail on your outlook for the case growth in U.S. business? And you've talked about an improved cadence throughout the quarter. Can you give us any color on the exit rate? You mentioned that you still expect some impact from customer losses in the second quarter. I'm kind of curious as to how we should be thinking about case growth here. And then just overall, as we think about the momentum of the business, what's an acceptable level case growth that you're thinking about as you progress through the year? And other than easing comparisons, can you maybe help us out with what helps to drive that?
Tom Bené: So specifically to case growth, as we talked about the quarter, nothing is too specific. But we did see, as we talked about when we came out of Q4 and we all know we had some softer numbers there, driven by both the lapping of a good quarter of the prior year, but also just some general softness in certain parts of the business. Specifically, we talked about some of the national accounts and these more the micro chains. What we're seeing, as we came out of the first quarter, was the local independent customers maintaining solid performance and continuing to grow. And so we feel good about, as we come out of that, that we're -- if you think about, we finished this quarter in this 1.5% local case growth, we feel like that is the lower end of what you should expect from us going forward. And we feel like that we'll be more in the range of what we have historically talked about with you guys over time. And so that doesn't mean every quarter is going to be the same. But this idea that you should see us back in the 2% to 2.5% range on local cases is where I'd tell you that you should think about. As it relates to the comment I made about some of the national account and some of the account transitions continuing, it's just really the timing of we know some fairly large customers and transition in the back half of last year, fiscal year. And we have that overlap still ahead of us. We had it in the first quarter that’s why you saw this softening in the total cases, and we'll have that again in Q2. So I think that's the headline there. When you talk about what's an acceptable level. I think we continue to talk about the fact that we want to be gaining share, certainly, as it relates to the independent market. And we see that, even at the current rates, we're clearly close to being at parity with what the market is doing. And if we're at the levels I just talked about, we will continue to be gaining share, which is where we wanted to be throughout, really all of the last couple of years, and where we continue to be focused. And so I think you should just think about that level being we want to be in a share growth in a shared gaining scenario. As you noticed from these numbers, very little case volume was attributed to any M&A activity. And as we go forward, you'll see a little bit more of that showing up in as we've had some recent acquisitions. So hopefully, that gives you a sense of what we're thinking about and where we're seeing things now and for the foreseeable future.
Edward Kelly: And just a quick follow up so on the competitive environment. Has anything changed really on that front? You have, over the last couple quarters, highlighted a little bit more competitive intensity in the micro chain. So I'm just curious as to what you're seeing there?
Tom Bené: Yes, I don't think we've seen anything change dramatically from what we had talked about. And if you recall, I had made a comment at the end of last quarter about, maybe us not being as competitive in some areas. And so -- and the point we're trying to make then and that we'll just reinforce today is that, that was really on us and we have kind of re-stepped up our efforts to make sure that we're not losing business, because of somehow we weren't being competitive. And so I'd say it continues to be obviously competitive out there, but we're not seeing any increased level of activity from what we talked about in the past.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Christopher Mandeville from Jefferies. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Blake on for Chris. Just wondering on the upcoming quarter, can you talk about any other details on timing of case growth in terms of year-over-year comparisons we should be aware of, or holiday timing, just anything like that.
Tom Bené: Blake, not really, I mean, there's nothing major there. As we called out that some of this national account business that we're cycling still will still be there in Q2. So I think that you should expect that based on the comments we made. But nothing else that's unique or different other than what I just mentioned.
Unidentified Analyst: And then my follow up is on, some of the capital spending. I know you mentioned free cash flow impact from working capital and in CapEx. On the CapExside, I think you mentioned some project timing. Can you just talk a little bit more about what was going on with that investment? And then maybe, can you give us the cadence of the free cash flow throughout the year? Any commentary about that would be helpful.
Tom Bené: So a couple things on that, specifically, on the CapEx piece. We had a little bit of an anomaly in our last year cash flow, because in Q1 of our last fiscal year, we had just come off of Q4 of the previous fiscal year, where we had actually accelerated some CapEx as related as the U.S. tax reform. So the tax reform has given us an opportunity to accelerate some CapEx at that quarter, particularly in the fleet. So we actually had, what I'd consider, an unusually low first quarter of last year where it came to CapEx. So the year-over-year comparison, what I would -- I would characterize that as a bit of more of a normalized spend as we had it this year relative where we would normally be purchasing more fleet, particularly in that first quarter last year. So that's where there's a little bit of a timing element. And again, it really relates to the Q4 and the U.S. tax reform actually in the year prior to that. We also, if you remember, we typically have a fair bit of just if you think about the overall kind of cadence and flow of our cash flow, we typically have a lower -- some seasonality related to our first quarter. The number we actually had last year, I would tell you, is actually somewhat of an anomaly relative to how we've actually looked over the last few years on our Q1. And so I, you know, while somewhat, obviously, there's a bit of this timing and capital spend and again there's a bit of a word, there’s some working capital impact, we certainly look at as somewhat short term. This is not necessarily an unusual sequencing of our cash flow as that relates to our numbers historically, even though last year had a better number. So I would just tell you, when you take a look at some of the way our cash flow has gone outside of over the last few years, I think you should get a pretty good sense of what that will look like here. And then obviously, it certainly ramps up a lot as we head into the latter part of our fiscal year. But again, certainly, feel confident of our ability to have a strong -- continuing strong cash flow here, despite some of the time issue here.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.
John Heinbockel: So Tom, when you think about share gains, maybe parse that out between new accounts that you're taking over as opposed to existing account market share. So I think existing account market share is probably pretty static? Or is that not right? And then what are you seeing with regard to drop size? I assume that's getting a little bit larger.
Tom Bené: As we think about share, I mean, you're right. It comes from two different places. It comes from new business and obviously, maintaining our current business, so holding on and retaining our current customers and driving penetration, or more cases through them. I'd say it comes from both places. And I wouldn't look at it and assume that the new business is an opportunity. Given our relative share in the market, there's plenty of new business opportunities for us. And for us, it will define a new business as we haven't done business with someone for roughly a year, no business, then that would be new business. So there are customers in this business that cycle on a pretty regular basis. So I wouldn't at all think that new business isn’t still a big part of our opportunity to grow. And then as it relates to penetration, I'd say we're very focused on penetration, because it's the more you can sell into any existing customer, that's obviously the most efficient case that we can ever get. And so we're very focused on that as well. And we've got some tools that are in place to help identify for our selling organization where some opportunities might exist in those customers. There might be some products that they either have bought from us in the past they may not be buying now, or based on the type of customer they are that they could be buying from us in the future. So I'd say it's really pretty balanced between the two. And we always look at and talk about that mix of new retaining our current business and further penetrating our customers. And to the point, as we do better job on penetration that generally does help our drop size go up. So I wouldn't say there has been a significant increase in our drop size but overall, our drop size -- we're very comfortable with where our drop sizes are, and are always focused on trying to improve that as we improve our overall penetration.
John Heinbockel: And then maybe for Joel, the corporate expense adjusted, when I take out transformation, looked a little high. I think it grew 4%. Is that -- what drove that, and is that the new run rate, as we think about the rest of the year? Are you up in that 3% to 4% range, or $235 million to $240 million a quarter? Is that a run rate?
Joel Grade: Well, I guess, I would characterize that, John, and a couple of things. I mean, again as we think about -- again, where some of the transformation work is happening that some of those results in some further investments in our corporate spend that actually then, in some cases, coming out of our field organization. So I think some of what you're seeing there is a bit of a geography shift. Obviously, the net effect of which is actually a overall positive, when we look at our SG&A. So I think, again, probably that's the way I would characterize the majority of that. So I think from that perspective, that's probably a reasonable way to view that. But again, I would just make sure we take a -- think about it more holistically in the sense of how we think about our overall G&A spend and again, we've made some good progress there, when you take that as a whole.
Tom Bené: And John, I might just add a point that Joel made in his earlier comments around technology. So like a technology investment, it's going to show up in that corporate expense line. But there are other offsets as you mentioned some of the transformative work that we're doing. So we're going to invest where we need to. And area like technology continues to be a big focus for us, so just to give you little more context behind it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Judah Frommer from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Judah Frommer: One of the areas that was more impressive to us was certainly the gap in gross profit dollars and OpEx in the U.S. business. Can you talk a little bit about balancing the pullback on OpEx, and making sure that you're finding the business in the right way to grow the top-line and margins going forward, and the opportunity to further reduce OpEx as you move into the back half of this year or next year?
Tom Bené: I'll take a start at this, and I'll let Joel chime in. Judah thanks for the question. I think, look, the gap is important. We've talked about it a lot. And it continues to be something we focus on. Because when, if we're in a quarter where the volume may not be exactly where we all like it to be, we are very conscious of making sure that our expenses fit and flow accordingly. Having said that, I would say that, as we just talked about with technology as a great example, we're going to continue to make investments in the things that are going to drive and support this business. And you should absolutely expect that from us. The types of things that we're getting the expense leverage on are the things we've been talking about. We've had some administrative costs focus areas here last year that we're still getting some benefit from. We've had this smart spending initiative, which is around just making sure that we're removing some non-value added expenses in parts of our business where possible. We talked about the regionalisation effort in Canada, and that's had some impact. And then we've had things like the finance transformation that's been a journey here, but we're still kind of benefiting from that work that's going on. So I would say think about it as, we're going to continue to stay focused on cost, and we do believe there are additional opportunities there. But those areas of opportunity are not the areas that would, in any way, reduce or slow down our focus on both transforming the business and accelerating our growth and driving the share gains that we've been talking. Joel, if there's anything you want to add?
Joel Grade: I think it's well said. I think the only maybe small point I'd touch on part of your question in terms of what's the -- is there more to come on some of that kind of stuff. And I think the answer to that is that, in the context of what Tom talked about here, in terms of taking some of those things that are more, again, non-value added or transformative, or however you want to say it, there's certainly further run rate on some of that stuff. Again, we -- you know, obviously, we started receiving some of the benefits to that, a lot of that in the second half of last year. But obviously, we remain very focused on continuing to find additional opportunities. And so that's something we certainly will continue to pursue, and you should expect to have some continued benefits of that over the course of the year. But again, just to reinforce Tom's point, none of those things are the things that are going to somehow get in the way of us investing for growth. And so that's a critical piece of that message I just -- certainly, we just can't repeat enough.
Judah Frommer: And just to follow-up on that. Historically, M&A is an important piece of both top line growth and I would say also, driving margin as you're able to strip costs that have acquired businesses. With what you've seen out of the regulatory bodies and kind of review of M&A over the last couple of years, largely on the larger size. But how does that affect your process going forward in terms of assessing deals and deal flow?
A - Tom Bené: Well, I think one of the points you made, again, our historical M&A has been pretty strongly focused on kind of the smaller fold-in tuck-in type deals. And so I think -- and that certainly continues to be our focus. Obviously, as we talked about from time-to-time, we certainly have our eyes open for larger strategic opportunities. But certainly, the vast majority of the work that we do is within that smaller fold-in tuck-in space. So I can't say truthfully that that's had that much significant impact on our perspectives on that. Obviously, we’ve certainly paid attention to what's going on there. But I think, in general, again, the J. Kings deal we announced in the last quarter and just yet another example of one of those opportunities that we have that certainly fits really nicely into our existing portfolio. And so, I would just say, Judah, generally speaking, we feel good about our M&A pipeline. We feel good about the opportunities ahead of us. And I can't say a lot of that, even though we certainly took and to take a note of it, has been a real significant impact on how we think about overall M&A pipeline.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Marisa Sullivan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Marisa Sullivan: I just wanted to touch on gross margin, and see if you could maybe quantify what the impact of inflation was on the gross margin improvement, and then what the outlook for inflation would be for the rest of the year, and then as we think about modeling gross margin? Any other puts and takes just to keep in mind in 2Q and the rest of the year? Thanks.
Joel Grade: Sure Marisa. This is Joel, I'll take that one. I think the -- in terms of quantifying the specific impact of inflation, I don't know that we'll do that. But I think the -- I think maybe the takeaway is, again, we've had -- again, we always think about this sort of 2% to 3% range is as sort of an optimal range for our industry, where we have the ability to pass those costs along and generally speaking, our customers to have the ability to pass those costs along to their customers over the longer term. And so I think we find ourselves in a pretty good place there. Again, it obviously is always driven, depending somewhat on the categories that are inflating and certainly nothing, again, that we see as something that's either particularly problematic or an issue for us at this point. So I think my view on this would be that we have a modest level of inflation than we expect to over the next few quarters. And -- but again, nothing really to call out other than the fact that we certainly like the place we’re in from an inflationary perspective.
Tom Bené: And Marisa, I think you asked about kind of going forward what do we see? I think what I'd just say is, as we've talked about remaining competitive in the competitive environment. I don't think you should be modeling big gross margin increases. I don't think, on the other hand, you need to be hitting self on those numbers either. But I think we feel like, and we've talked about this a few times in the last couple of quarters, we feel pretty good about where we are from a gross margin perspective you know where we sit, relative to our peer group. And so I think we feel comfortable and confident where we are right now, but probably at the high end of where we can -- you should think about us going forward.
Marisa Sullivan: If I can just quickly follow up with just another kind of modeling question, on SYGMA. Should we think about the 1Q sales performance as -- is indicative of what you'd expect going forward, given some of the business rationalization. And if so, when do you start to cycle that?
Tom Bené: Similarly, I think Q1 was probably a little more aggressive than we saw in Q4. But as we talked about last year -- in the last year, we are in fact cycling some, some fairly large customer transitions there. So I would say for the next couple of quarters, you ought to think about similar numbers. And there is a balance of transition customers and also performance within existing customers. As you probably know, on the SYGMA side, not in every case, but when we have a customer we have majority of their business in geography. And so their relative performance will in fact affect our performance there. But the bigger numbers you're seeing are driven by the transitions we've been talking about.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Your line is open.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Two questions, one on the topic of chain versus independents. And you mentioned the ongoing transition of presumably some of the chain accounts. So I'm just wondering how you would characterize maybe the health of each of the sub-segments being chain and independent. And importantly, maybe some changes in sequential trends for either in terms of top line performance, again recognizing that you're pruning some of the chain larger business. But just how you think about change in independents in terms of their performance of late?
Tom Bené: So as we mentioned earlier to some of the comments and you guys have access to the same kind of information. I think in general, the numbers you're seeing for us, have more to do with transitions than softness within certain customer types. I think we continue to feel good about the Independent growth potential out there, whether it's existing customers or our opportunity to gain new business as we were talking earlier. I think as it relates to some of the larger national type customers we have there are segments of the market that are growing faster than others. Think about QSR is doing well, you see some of the casual dine maybe having a little harder time, but I think generally speaking, we feel like the environment is pretty good for the restaurant operators. And so I think we would say that the numbers you may see us talk about or reflected here will be more about decisions we made, or customers have made in doing business with Sysco. So right now, I'd say we feel pretty good about that environment, in that market.
Jeffrey Bernstein: And then just following up on the M&A discussion, I know you've often quoted that there's tons of room for growth for you guys, with only a 16% share in the US. And I think you mentioned you expected it to be a modest uptick for you guys, but still not huge M&A numbers expected. With that said the comment around the regulators in terms of seemingly being increasingly involved and scrutinizing. I'm just wondering, more so than just for yourselves. But do you think that changes the landscape of M&A and consolidation for the broader Foodservice industry?
Joel Grade: Yes, I don't know that we think about it that way. And again I think at Tom's point, I mean, look our M&A as we talked about, we anticipate between 0.5% and 1% of our total sales in any given year. And obviously that moves around a bit, given by quarter given what we may or may not have or lap. Again we feel certainly good about our pipeline of deals. Certainly feel good about the companies we brought on over the last couple of years. And I think, I don't know, I think from an overall industry perspective, I just think there is plenty of room for consolidation, continues and again I think that will continue to happen. And I think you certainly should expect that from the broader industry and from ourselves as well. I think it's interesting to see how some of those things all play out. And what the regulators are interested in, in this math. But I would just, as I said earlier in the call, I don't believe, what's happening there as we have really significant impact on how we think about M&A.
Jeffrey Bernstein: And just lastly a clarification on what you said earlier about inflation. It looks like now, like I said, you're approaching 3% which is maybe the upper end of your two to three sweet spot. But has been kind of upticking the past number of quarters. I'm just wondering whether you would expect it to lag of that 2% to 3% range to the upside. And if it did, which commodity have you seen some more significant signs of inflation, whether it's protein, dairy or produce or otherwise.
Joel Grade: Yes, I mean as I think and again Tom can chime in here. I think our view would be that we still stay within that range for the most part again. Obviously, we've had some issues in terms of pork and some of the other pork related commodities that are on the higher end of that. Obviously, there have been some of the challenges certainly they are well documented. Obviously, produce has been certainly on the higher end of that range. A little of that's certainly is oftentimes the category of that that moves around a fair bit. So I would just say, generally speaking, I mean, you're right. We're on the bit of a higher end of the range that we consider kind of the optimal place. But outside of that, I don't know if there's anything that, that we would see that would drive significantly. We get questions fairly often on the question on pork, just in general. But again, our pork certainly, a fairly small percentage of our overall business and not something that people are seeing, that our folks are seeing something that we should be overly concerned about over the near future.
Tom Bené: Jeffrey, I think, the only thing I'd add is, as Joel mentioned the center of plate items are the ones that can drive the biggest impact for everyone, because it's such an important part of the menu for the operator and where they struggled to pass things along. So I think we just have to stay focused on those key center plate categories meat, poultry, seafood, and certainly pork falls within the meat segment of that. And then the last thing as Joel mentioned produce. I think it's something we just got to stay close to. There were some ups and downs a year ago, seeing where that ends up. And dairy has been on the higher end too. So I think you're right. We're feeling good about where things are now, we think that -- we hope that they maintain within this range, but if we have any concerns it would be around those center plate and produce items.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Wolf from Loop Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Andrew Wolf: On the acquisition side, I think you said you expect more -- you announced $155 million acquisition last, at the end of the -- toward the end of this quarter, the one you just reported. So doing the math that's about 25 bps, a little below what you think it sounds like you can get to. First of all, are there other acquisitions that we could model in right now that you've kind of would add to that 25 bps roughly. Secondly, kind of related to this, the next two largest distributors in the industry are involved in very large acquisitions at different stages, but pretty early on. How does the market look to you in terms of, as a buyer out there looking for targets in terms of availability and valuations?
Joel Grade: Well, a couple of things. First of all, as it relates to other acquisitions, obviously again the only thing I can reiterate there, obviously, I think able to reported anything specifically is that we continue to feel good about the pipeline that we have in front of us. And certainly, so again reiterating just our overall guidance around the sort of 0.5% to 1% in any given year, it's again moves around by quarter some. But all I guess I can say there is, without being able to go into specifics, it's again we certainly feel decent. We feel we're in a good place with our pipeline and obviously there's something we can talk about. We will certainly do that. I guess just in general, I mean the sort of the view of the large, again, certainly, I don't want to speak for other competitors in the space. I guess the only thing I would say there though just in terms of context. You obviously the density of our network in this certainly are in the United States is, I would say, significantly higher than the others in our space. And so the ability for them to take on additional geographies or additional areas that you consider white space for them is obviously a bit different than the way we would look at some of those things. And so outside of the deals that we've done in Hawaii are recently and obviously outside of our core markets in North America. But in our North American business, again the density of our network it puts us probably a little bit in a different place in terms of how we look at some of those deals and then are probably our two largest competitors. So I think just from that contextual perspective would be the way I would think about that. We certainly again have again lots of opportunities in front of us and we'll certainly continue to be aggressive in that space. But probably the best context I can give you there at this time.
Andrew Wolf: And then I just wanted to either circle back or just ask directly about this African swine fever in China and other parts of Asia that you hear different views on that from kind of semi catastrophic to sort of probably not -- not that great. How is Sysco sort of viewing this? I mean, I'm not asking you to make a prediction. But what kind of contingencies are you thinking about, what kind of scenarios you're looking at, and so on, if you have any? Thanks.
Tom Bené: Andy it's Tom. Look, I think it's something that's, it's out there. It's something that we are starting to stay very close to. We think over the next six months that there could be some impacts in that area that especially if you think about other markets may be beginning more import of that because of their needs. I think if you think about the pork segment, there are various components of that, some that are more important and our bigger part of the sales and others. And so I think we're staying close to try to understand what impact might exist in some of those different areas. So I think there are two, probably two things you should just think about. I mean, it's been out there for a while, we haven't seen major impacts yet, but we believe there could still be some. And the way we think about that is, we work closely with our restaurant operators and certainly with our suppliers. We're not going to be in a position where we're not going to have availability. That's not going to be the issue, it's really a matter of do the prices in some areas get to the point where customers start to transition those menu items or think differently about those menu items. And I think that's the work we're always doing with our customers to stay abreast of the impacts that might be happening on these certain product categories. And try to proactively work with them so that they are not in a situation where it dramatically affects their ability to drive profitable growth in their own businesses. So I'd just say, we're very close to these kind of things. We have lots of resources that are involved both with our supplier partners and here. And right now, I think we're saying our sense would be, over the next six months, we'll probably see some increased impacts here, while we are proactively trying to manage that both in the company with our customers.
Joel Grade: And I would say just even in terms of just sourcing availability of product, as well as substitutes. So I think that's one of the things that we've certainly been very active in working with customers and managers navigate through those things in the past and certainly we are moving forward.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kelly Bania from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Kelly Bania: Tom and Joel, I wanted to just go back to the independents. And I was wondering if you could or the local case growth and wondering if you could unpack that 1.4%. Just help us understand kind of what types of trends you're seeing underneath the types of restaurants, regional trends, open new customer openings. And regarding the improved exit rate, can you elaborate on that. Is that just comparisons, or is that internal or external factors. And then the last part is, I think you had been targeting closer to a 3%. And so, I'm curious is that still on the table or should we be thinking about a 2% to 2.5% kind of going forward for that segment? Thank you.
Tom Bené: So a couple of things, as we talked about earlier on the 1.4%, part of what we talked about is, we feel very good about the growth within the independent restaurants segment and including in that would be the this more of the regional or micro kind of change we've talked about as well. We did talk about we do see this from time-to-time. We talked about the impact from what we think about is almost local bid business. So we talked about local schools as an example. There is some of that that falls into these local numbers. It's not national business, because it's literally local school-type agreements or some kind of local governmental things that fall into that as well. So I think what we see is and why we feel good and confident is that the restaurant side of it is strong, and we're seeing good growth there. And so I think that piece you should, rest assured that we feel good about the work we're doing. And I think it's a combination of, as we talked about, us making sure we're remaining competitive in that space. But also there are some, as I mentioned, also some tools that we're providing our selling organization that help them to understand where they can improve their overall penetration within those customers. So I think it's a good balance of both new business opportunities that exist and that we're able to pick up, as well as the penetration within those existing customers. As far as the 3% number versus where we are today and maybe with 2.5%, I talked about earlier. I think we just have to continue to think about the fact that we're going to see improved growth in this segment given the fact that we have things like this local bid business in there. I can't sit here today and say that we still deliver the 3% overall for the whole time frame. But we still feel like that 2.5% to 3% is not an unreasonable number for us. So we are cycling two of our biggest quarters in Q4 and Q1 from prior year, as we've talked. And so I think we'll get some benefit of that may be going forward, but that really wasn't part of the sequential improvement, I talked about as we exited Q1.
Kelly Bania: And then, I think I heard you mention or maybe Joel mentioned some signs of improvement in the labor market. And I was wondering if you could elaborate on where and what you're seeing and what you're thinking about in terms of where -- how you are staffed appropriately for the rest of the year?
Tom Bené: Yes, I had mentioned that we are seeing some settling I guess right, I'd say it. As we all know over the last couple of years, the labor market has been very tight, it continues to be tight. But what I think we found is, and we see this in our own associate retention numbers is we're seeing better retention. And therefore, when I say we're seeing -- feeling a little bit better about that labor market, we feel like we're having a little more stability than we had there for a while, both in our -- and I'm mainly talking about our front-line operating associates warehouse and drivers. And so what we have also talked about is, one of the things we've been focused on is, not naturally transitioning some of that business when the season has got softer, because then we'd have to ramp back up as we came into the new season. And so what we're still evaluating is we need to be thoughtful here. We'd rather maintain our good associates and continue to invest in them during the lower seasons to ensure that when time comes to ramp back up, we're not in a situation like we were in the past where we are now scrambling for labor having to potentially do a lot of training. There's a lot of expense associated with new hires and not the least, which is the training and development of them and getting them up to speed. So that's really what I was referencing. I think we’ll continue to evaluate, we think the model we have right now is a good one for us. But as we get into some of the lower parts of the year, I mean volumetrically that could have some impact and we're just trying to make sure we understand the pros and cons of that business practice that we've employed.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Ivankoe from JP Morgan. Your line is open.
John Ivankoe: The Canadian regionalization was mentioned a couple of times, and it sounds like, at least in that market it's having some effect that at least in terms of delivering more profitability. And it looks like as well some more case volume as well. Are there any lessons to be learned from that project, as it relates to the United States? In other words, is that lagging the United States in terms of implementation of that structure, or might the United States to be able to learn something as to what is happening in Canada?
Tom Bené: So the Canadian regionalization is something we have talked about a few times. And it's an effort that we started about 15 months ago and we were implementing it throughout last fiscal year. So we're getting some continued benefit as we move into this fiscal. And I would say that it's a little different than the U.S., because just the sheer geography and types of facilities we had there. We had regular size operating companies like you'd expect to see in the U.S. and we had some smaller operating companies, significantly smaller than we have in the U.S. And in the case of Canada, we had a similar management structure at every one of those facilities. And so we just felt like there was an opportunity to better structure ourselves up there from a cost perspective to take out some of that additional expense associated with some of those smaller facilities. There is certainly been learnings there that we do believe over time might have some applicability to the US, but it is a little bit different setup than what we have in the U.S. and that drives some difference in the way we have opt to think about it going forward. But we feel good about the lessons we're learning and we've had many, and I would say it's still work-in-progress, but we're feeling good about the effort and time will show whether or not there is some similar opportunities here in the US.
John Ivankoe: And this wasn't really apparent in the results, maybe a little bit just in terms of the overall inflation numbers. But there was some very unusual pricing behavior this quarter that happened because of the beef processing plant fire that happened where number of different state cuts actually in the spot market spiked up considerably. Did you see anything unusual happen within your P&L that happened because of this kind of intra-week volatility, specifically on the beef side or is your company just big enough that, that would have been noise?
Tom Bené: Well, John, first of all, I mean, because of the way we go to market with the supplier partners, and our agreements, those things for us are probably a little bit of noise more than anything else, but not big impacts for sure. And that's one of the things as we've talked, I think over the years that their own should feel really good about is, the long-standing relationships, the way we've built our relationships with our suppliers are not short-term, they are longer term in nature, and that helps us I think dramatically as we go in and out of these type of events. It's unfortunate when they happen, and it's difficult for our suppliers. But we're generally able to manage through those pretty seamlessly.
Operator: Thank you. And we will take our last question from Bob Summers from Buckingham Research. Your line is open.
Bob Summers: Just a quick question on the calendar for second quarter, the period between Thanksgiving and Christmas has shortened. I think last time we went through something like this, Starbucks was impacted. I mean, I think it's really pent-up demand for restaurants. Did it impact you at all or should be expect any weakness associated with that?
Tom Bené: Bob, I don't think, you know from where we're sitting today, we don't necessarily believe so. It's a fair question and something we're certainly have to go do a little more work on. But we don't, at this point, see any historical impact or feel like that's going to be a problem.
Bob Summers: And then second, you guys seemed really confident with the acquisition pipeline. Just curious what you've seen on the seller expectation price point, point of view? I mean, arguably two big competitors are now out of the market for some period of time. I'm wondering if seller expectations have accordingly modified.
Joel Grade: Bob, it's Joel. I don't know that I'd say we've had a lot of seller impact. We have previously been asked a lot about just sort of the overall high price that U.S. Foods SGA deal was. I mean did that impact expectations. Just I would say generally no. I mean we've got a pretty steady -- every deal is very different. I can't say we've run into a lot of situations where we just -- again, that aren't very deal specific where we would say, hey, there is some inflated view of expectations, or the opposite direction. So I mean, I think we had -- we've historically had a pretty, I'd say, normalized view of what we expect our M&A multiples to be. And I would say generally speaking, discussions we have with people today are generally within that range. So there is nothing, again, outside of what I'd call very deal specific situations that come up from time-to-time. There is nothing that I would say impact, either what direction of, either higher or lower related to the deals or the, as you suggested, possible timing today.
Operator: Thank you. And that does end today's question-and-answer session. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participation and you may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

===== 2019 Q4  (2019-08-12 10:00:00) =====

Tom Bené: Thanks, Neil, and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us. This morning we announced financial results, which reflect improved year-over-year performance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2019. For the full year, we made solid progress against our multi-year transformational initiatives, which we believe position us well to exceed our customers' expectations and deliver long-term growth. During the year, we had solid 8% adjusted operating income growth and adjusted earnings per share growth of 13%. Starting with Sysco's full year fiscal 2019 results, sales grew 2.4% to $60.1 billion, driven by steady growth of local customers and the acquisition of several smaller distributors in both the U.S. and Europe, which were partially offset by the transitioning of some national customers in both our Broadline and SYGMA businesses. Gross profit for the year grew 2.9% to $11.4 billion, driven by a continued shift in our customer mix, as we grew local cases at a faster pace than total case growth; favorable product mix, as we continue to drive growth in our Sysco Brand portfolio, not only through the addition of innovative products, but also by bringing Sysco Brand to additional geographies beyond the U.S.; the continuation of our successful category management effort, as we are now starting to bring this successful process to our European business; and the ongoing management of inbound freight that's now stabilized, although, not back to the pre-fiscal 2018 levels. Finally across the entire business, we saw a modest level of inflation for the year of about 1% to 2%. From an expense perspective, we saw solid overall expense management for the year, with adjusted operating expenses increasing only 1.4%, driven by benefits from our transformative initiatives and solid corporate expense management, all of which helped to offset the ongoing rising labor costs in both the transportation and warehouse areas. The gap between gross profit dollar growth and adjusted operating expense growth was 150 basis points for the full year, despite a challenging year-over-year comparison in the fourth quarter. For total Sysco, we delivered solid adjusted operating income growth of 8% to $2.7 billion, which helped to drive our adjusted earnings per share up 13% to $3.55. As we look at the results by business segment, let's start with the United States and the overall macroeconomic trends, which continue to be relatively positive. The underlying economic picture remains encouraging with GDP at 2.1% for the second quarter of 2019 and continued low unemployment, which were just 3.7% in July. Consumer confidence has decreased slightly, but still remains solid. These factors were important macroeconomic indicators, which describe the environment our customers are currently operating in and speaks to the relative health of our food-away-from-home market. As for restaurant industry trends Knapp-Track and Black Box show same-store sales relatively flat in June and consistent with what we previously discussed, while traffic continues to be negative. Within U.S. Foodservice Operations for the year, sales for fiscal 2019 were $41.3 billion, an increase of 4.2% compared to the prior year. Inflation in U.S. Broadline was 1.5% and local case growth grew 3.1%, of which 2.2% was organic, while total case volume within U.S. Broadline grew 2.7%, of which 2% was organic. Gross profit dollars increased 4.4% and gross margin increased 5 basis points to 20%. Gross profit was positively impacted by strong Sysco Brand sales, year-over-year favorability of inbound freight and continued category management benefits. Regarding Sysco Brand, using customer insights we launched two new brands, including Sysco Earth Plus, a planet-friendly non-food solution for operators looking for a wide range of reliable and economically environmentally responsible products; and Sysco Simply, a platform designed to enable our customers to accommodate the growing consumer demand for varied dietary and lifestyle choices. Our adjusted operating expenses for the year increased 4.4%, due mainly to increased costs in both the transportation and warehouse areas, partly as a result of the tight labor market. This combined with seasonal hiring of driver and warehouse staff have driven increased operational costs on a per unit basis, as volume has softened. Finally, adjusted operating income was $3.2 billion, an increase of 4.4% compared to the prior year. Now turning to our International Foodservice Operations results for the year. The macro environment for the -- macroeconomic environment for the geographies in which we serve remains relatively positive, while the foodservice industry data suggest modestly improved sales with flat to slightly higher volume growth. The Sysco results in the segment overall were mixed during fiscal 2019 with improved performance during the second half of the year. Overall, for fiscal 2019, sales decreased 0.2%, gross profit decreased 1.8%, adjusted operating expenses decreased 3.7%; and adjusted operating income was $354.8 million, an increase of 10.7%. Topline growth for the year across our international businesses was also mixed. Canada and most of Europe performed well especially Ireland and Sweden and we dealt with some operational challenges in France as our efforts to integrate our two businesses Brake France and Davigel has impacted our ability to drive growth. From a cost perspective, we continue to make investments across much of Europe to position us for future business growth. We have also begun to leverage broader Sysco capabilities and processes to deliver improved synergies across the European business. Additionally, our regionalization efforts in Canada continue to deliver results and also helped to drive improved cost performance in this segment. In Latin America, our businesses are operating well with continued growth in sales, gross profit and operating income in Costa Rica and Panama from both the Broadline and Cash & Carry segments. The Bahamas in our international food group export business also continue to experience growth but were partially offset by our business in Mexico, which in the fourth quarter began to show some progress and weaker performance earlier this year. Turning to SYGMA, we continue to focus on improving overall profitability. As a result, we saw planned softness in the topline, while gross margin increased 30 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted operating expenses were down for the year, driven by a focus on removing unproductive miles and rightsizing underperforming locations, which helped to drive an adjusted operating income increase of 25% versus prior year. We feel very good about the continued progress we are making within SYGMA and are confident in our ability to drive improved performance going forward. Now, let me turn the call over to Joel Grade, who will talk with you about our fourth quarter performance, along with additional financial details for both the quarter and the year. I'll then come back to offer perspective regarding our overall business performance for the year, some important updates as we look ahead and some things we are excited about for the future.
Joel Grade: Thank you, Tom. Good morning everyone. I'd like to discuss our fourth quarter results, followed by some additional perspective on our full fiscal year results, closing with some commentary regarding fiscal year 2020. Sales for the fourth quarter increased 1%, compared to the same period last year. Foreign exchange rates negatively affected total Sysco sales by approximately 0.8%. Local case volumes within U.S. Broadline operations grew 1.4% for the fourth quarter of which 1.3% was organic, while total case volume within the U.S. Broadline operations grew -- of which 0.3% was organic. Even though, case growth was softer than anticipated, it is worth noting the tough comparison in the prior year local case growth of 5% and total case growth of 5.3%. Gross profit increased 2.1% versus the prior year and gross margin increased 21 basis points. We saw solid expense management for the quarter, despite operational cost challenges in our U.S. segment. Our transformational initiatives continue to provide benefit, as adjusted operating expenses grew only 0.6% for the year. And as a result, we achieved a gap between gross profit dollar growth and adjusted operating expense growth of 150 basis points and adjusted operating income grew 6.6% compared to the same period last year. It's important to note, that this performance as well was achieved despite having difficult year-over-year comparison, where the gap between gross profit dollar growth and adjusted operating expense growth was 300 basis points. As it relates to taxes, our GAAP tax rate in the fourth quarter was 21.5% and when adjusted for certain items was close to 20%. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we recognized the benefit as a reduction of income tax expense, attributable to stock option exercises that occurred in the quarter. In addition, we recognized a onetime benefit in France, related to a favorable ruling on tax carryovers and employment tax credits. Now turning to our results for the fiscal year 2019. Sales increased 2.4% to $60.1 billion. Foreign exchange rates negatively impacted total Sysco sales during the year by 0.8%. Our local case growth for the year in U.S. Broadline was 3.1%, one of the highest full year percentage increases in several years. Gross profit increased 2.9% to $11.4 billion and gross margin increased 10 basis points. For the year, our overall expense management was solid, driven by benefits from our transformation initiatives with adjusted operating expenses increasing 1.4%, resulting in an adjusted operating income increase of 7.9% to $2.7 billion. Foreign exchange rates negatively impacted total Sysco operating income during fiscal 2019 by 0.5%. For the year, we achieved a gap between gross profit dollar growth and adjusted operating expense growth of 150 basis points. Adjusted earnings per share increased by $0.41 to $3.55, primarily impacted by growth in adjusted operating income and our fiscal year 2019 non-GAAP effective tax rate which is 21%. For fiscal 2019 our non-GAAP tax rate reflects tax benefits attributable to equity compensation elections and credits. Cash flow from operations was $2.4 billion for fiscal year 2019 which was $256 million higher compared to last year. Net CapEx for fiscal year 2019 was $671 million or about 1.1% of sales which was $5.9 million higher compared to last year. We continue to generate meaningful free cash flow as we achieved $1.7 billion for fiscal year 2019 which was $250 million higher compared to last year due in part to reduced pension contributions partially offset by higher cash taxes. We are pleased that our adjusted return on invested capital grew 170 basis points to 16.4% in fiscal 2019 reflecting continued disciplined investments in our business and solid operating performance during the year. Now before closing, I would like to provide you some commentary on the outlook for fiscal year 2020. Capital expenditures during fiscal 2020 are expected to be approximately 1.3% of sales consistent with our previous three-year guidance. From a tax perspective, we expect our overall effective tax rate to be approximately 24% in fiscal 2020 and we intend to continue to improve working capital days to achieve our three-year plan goal of two days improvement by the end of fiscal 2020. At the end of fiscal 2019, we have improved working capital by approximately 1 day versus start of the three-year plan. In addition, we continue to maintain a strong and consistent capital allocation priority of investing in our business and returning value to shareholders with the increased cash flows from the business. These priorities include; first, investing in our business for long-term growth and increasing our industry leading position; second a commitment to consistently growing our dividend, something we have done each year for the last 50 years. Third, participating in successful tuck-in and specialty acquisitions as well as being opportunistic when it comes to larger more strategic deals. In fact I am proud to announce today that we are signing a definitive agreement to acquire J. Kings Food Service Professionals, a New York-based distributor with $155 million in annual sales a majority of which are local customers. Fourth, a balanced approach between debt paydown and opportunistic share repurchase. As a result of our confidence in our long-term growth opportunities and our strong market leadership position, we intend to increase the amount of our share repurchases to more than $1 billion of shares during fiscal 2020. Before we go to Q&A, let me turn it back over to Tom for some closing comments.
Tom Bené: Thanks, Joel. Before closing, I'd like to first review a couple of things we've shared with you this morning. As mentioned we delivered a strong fiscal 2019 with 8% adjusted operating income growth and 13% adjusted earnings per share growth. However, we didn't finish the year as strong as we would have liked especially in the U.S. Foodservice segment and therefore didn't meet our own expectations for the fourth quarter. When you combine the overall softness in our topline, driven primarily by national and regional customer losses along with some increased operational expenses and with our previously communicated reduction in go-forward operating income from the sale of Iowa Premium, our beef processing facility, we are now lowering our fiscal 2018 to 2020, 3 year plan adjusted operating income growth target to approximately $600 million from the previously communicated low end of the $650 million to $700 million range. Having said that, I'd like to reinforce why we feel very confident in our ability to improve the current trajectory and continue to achieve success over the long-term despite some of these near-term challenges. We know from our ongoing customer feedback that we are strategically on the right track as we work to improve the experience our customers have in doing business with Sysco. That includes our ongoing investment in customer facing technology as we look to improve the way our customers do business with us. Additionally, we will continue to drive growth in our Sysco brand not only through the addition of new and innovative products, but also by expanding the reach of these type of products in additional geographies beyond the U.S. and Canada. We continue to have the strongest balance sheet in the industry and expect to leverage that to drive growth both in the core business and in returning value to shareholders. That includes planned M&A in both segments and geographies, in which we currently serve as well as relative adjacencies over time, which will only further strengthen our position as we see the level of competition in the industry increasing. In summary, in fiscal 2019, we saw improved year-over-year financial performance, which included strong adjusted operating income growth, double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth, and strong cash flow performance all achieved while investing in the business and returning value to shareholders with our 50th dividend increase and over $1 billion in share repurchases. Looking ahead, our focus remains squarely on the customer and achieving the newly outlined three-year plan financial targets. I remain very confident we have the right strategies and most importantly, the right team to vigorously compete on service, the highest quality products and price. Finally, I would like to thank each of our 69,000 associates across the globe for their continued dedication and hard work to ensuring Sysco remains our customers' most valued and trusted business partner. Operator, we are now ready for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kelly Bania of BMO Capital. Your line is open.
Kelly Bania: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions and for all the color. I guess, just wanted to start with maybe a diagnosis of the top-line and the case growth and if there's any execution factors that you see either with sales reps or service levels or you really think it's just a function of the industry. And I think you've just made a comment about a level of competition increasing. So maybe you can just expand on what you're seeing there and how you feel about execution? And then I guess second part of the question is the outlook for $600 million, I guess does imply a little bit of a stronger year in fiscal 2020 than the last two years and just maybe helping -- seeing if you can help us walk through the puts and takes on how you're thinking about modeling that?
Tom Bené: Yes. Thanks Kelly. Let's start with the top line and it's a great question. So as I shared, we certainly have seen and continued to focus on this disciplined profitable growth as it relates to our national customers. And so we've seen certainly some impacts there and some fairly significant change in the trajectory of that business as we've kind of -- we're in the fourth quarter even as we're into the New Year. So that's a big part of what we're talking about here. We've seen that also at some of the regional customer levels. So we talked over the last year or so about our focus on these micro chains and we cycled some business that we've picked up in the past and we've also seen competition ramp up in that space. And so that's the biggest single impact I think you will see both in the fourth quarter, driving our top line performance. Joel also talked about just the overlap we had year-over-year. Our Q4 last year was one of our biggest quarters in record both local and total cases. As far as operational or executional things, most of what we're talking about is on the expense side. Although as we talk about some of the transformative initiatives that we've been executing, but we see from time to time as we're learning that there are some customer service challenges that get created. We're not broadly concerned about that and don't feel like that is a long-term issue but we've certainly seen a little bit of impact both from our finance transformation and also in some of the work we've done with our new ordering platform. But again in both cases we think that they are short-term and we're working through them. And obviously our customer service is kind of paramount for us in everything we do. As it relates to fiscal year 2020, I think that your point is correct, which is even at the $600 million number that does suggest a step-up from where we are today. And I think it's a combination of good performance in the U.S., and obviously continuing to see that business perform well, improving business across our international segments, and as I mentioned continued improving performance within SYGMA as well. So it's a little bit across the board, but we feel going into 2020 fairly confident that we can deliver that $600 million number and that increased step-up for fiscal year 2020.
Operator: Our next question comes from Edward Kelly of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Edward Kelly: Yeah. Hi guys, good morning. I just wanted to follow-up first question -- another question on Kelly's question here. Industry data for July hasn't really been great. Just kind of curious as to what you're seeing so far in Q1? And then how should we think about the progress of case growth throughout the year just given what you put up in Q4, some of the commentary about being more disciplined on accounts? Just kind of curious here as to how -- what the expectation should be in terms of case growth as we progress through to 2020 given what we just saw?
Tom Bené: Great, Ed. So let's start with the Q1 question. I'd say, as we started Q1 and July has had some of that same softness that we just talked about for Q4. And I think it's mostly in the same areas for us these national and regional customers where we transitioned some business there or had some losses. So we see that similar trajectory as we started the quarter. As we think about case growth broadly, as we've talked for a long time now, our focus continues to be on those places where we can add the most value so those local customers. Some of those still are those regional concepts. I don't want to lead you to believe that those aren't important part of our growth story as well. But that independent customers where we have the most value, we continue to see that part of the business performing well, if not maybe at some of the high you saw a year ago, but we still see that business performing well. We feel like we're continuing to progress nicely with those customers. We do believe that we will start to see some improved volume growth throughout the fiscal year 2020, as we continue to cycle some losses that we had earlier in the year in the national customer sector. But generally speaking, I think we feel like the overall case numbers as we talked about I think last quarter are going to be a little softer than we originally projected for the three-year plan.
Edward Kelly: Okay. And then I just wanted to ask you about bad debt and just really kind of what's going on. We haven't -- looking at the cash flow statement, but -- and I'm assuming this is your accrual, but it hasn't been this high really since 2009. I'm just kind of curious, is there one specific situation that drove that this year? Is it something more broad-based? Does 2020 normalize?
Joel Grade: Yes. Ed, it's Joel. I think the way I think about that is, I do think we have seen some worsening of the environment for bad debt. I think the -- it's -- I wouldn't certainly call it at a crisis situation, but it has certainly gotten worse. Our overall days are a little softer. We've had -- we had about one fairly significant hit per quarter to some extent that has impacted us. And so on one hand the bad debt expense -- and when you look at it year-over-year there is an element of some pickups we had in last year's numbers that account for about half of the difference. But nonetheless, I would say the environment has gotten a little bit worse. It's certainly something we're keeping a close eye on. And I'd say, if you look at our performance relatively over the last few years, we've had a pretty strong run. And so again I think it's a fair comment to say that has gotten -- it has gotten somewhat worse, but certainly something we're monitoring carefully.
Edward Kelly: All right. Thanks guys.
Tom Bené: Thanks, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Mandeville of Jefferies. Your line is open.
Chris Mandeville: Hey, good morning. Tom, you characterized some of the losses or just reduction in customer count both in national and in regional from a perspective of loss and then planned. Can you just go into the losses a little bit more in greater detail? Just -- is there a common thread with respect to why they're choosing to go elsewhere, or is competition doing something a little bit more aggressively? Anything you can add there in terms of concept?
Tom Bené: Sure, Chris. I think you're right to suggest there's both. There's customers that as we go into the negotiation would end up not being a renewal for Sysco. When we've taken a loss, it's generally driven by competitive pricing. And what I mean by that is more aggressive distribution fees than what we are comfortable with. And part of what we've tried to work through is how do we continue to improve the cost of -- to serve our customers so that we are obviously competitive on a day-to-day basis for almost any customer. But when we've typically lost, it's been because the fees have been beyond what we've been comfortable. And so that's been a big driver of what has happened to some of these regional customers.
Joel Grade: Yes. And I would say too, I just wanted to add to that. I mean there's a little bit -- there's been, I'd say a little bit more of the upfront monies that have been moved around in the industry at this point. That's things in the areas that again discipline-wise at times we're just not comfortable making some of those decisions. So it's probably the other part that plays into that same point.
Chris Mandeville: Okay. And then, just looking to fiscal 2020 here and really just the updated EBIT guidance for $600 million or so. Is that still again very much predicated on OpEx and the larger buckets which you've outlined in the past? And are we able to essentially hit that $600 million, if in the event we don't see any material acceleration in total cases?
Tom Bené: It's a great question. I think this conversation we've had for a couple of years now around the balance between gross profit and operating expenses is going to be key. And so if we do see -- we don't see a dramatic uptick in volume, therefore gross profit, we've got to make sure that that spread remains at that 150 basis points. So it is -- I wouldn't say, it's not really predicated only on that, but that balance of those two is very important as we continue to move forward the business.
Chris Mandeville: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim. Your line is open.
John Heinbockel: So, Tom let me start local case growth is not bad, but it could be better right, particularly stacked up against some peers. Where do you think -- maybe you can put some investment muscle behind the business, right, if you think you can to drive some incremental growth? And where do you -- how happy are you with the growth in the MA population and their performance? Is there a case to be made for stepping that up a little bit selectively like you did two years ago?
Operator: Our next question comes from Judah Frommer of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Judah Frommer: Hi good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe first just to follow-up on kind of the competitive landscape within Broadline. Can you help us with what types of competitors may be winning those customers away from you? Are they more local in nature? And then why is your scale not helping you with kind of lower costs to serving those locales? [Technical Difficulty]
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, please stand by. We're experiencing technical difficulties. Thank you for your patience and please stand by. Jeffrey Bernstein, your line is open.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thank you. Can you hear me? Hello?
Tom Bené: Hi there, Jeff?
Jeffrey Bernstein: Yes. Hi, there. Thank you.
Tom Bené: Hi.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Good morning.
Tom Bené: Go ahead with your questions.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Thank you. A couple of follow-ups as we think about the three-year profitability target obviously you've baked into the sales side of things. I'm just wondering from a cost perspective. First, I guess on commodities, I know the best inflation this past quarter was 2.5%, seems like it's been creeping up the past few quarters. Just wondering, what you're assuming in terms of fiscal 2020 whether you're anticipating a further acceleration in inflation. Maybe any thoughts specific to proteins that might be more vulnerable or any color you can provide on the food cost side of things?
Joel Grade: Yes. Sure, Jeff. It's Joel. I would say at this point, I mean, we're anticipating what we continue to refer to as modest levels of inflation over the next couple of quarters, which I would interpret to say as something fairly consistent, where we are today. And we're certainly – the inflationary categories really have been in meat, in poultry and produce and then to some extent Jeff frozen potatoes as well has been an area that's continued to have some inflation. So I don't know that we are look for the next couple of quarters anything really dramatic or above that, but I certainly – we do anticipate continued inflation, and I'd say approximately in the range, we're at today.
Jeffrey Bernstein: And on the labor front? Is there any color you can provide in terms of whether there's a basket inflation number or how you look at it from turnover or just competition for drivers and associates?
Tom Bené: Yeah. I think what we've tried to manage through here Jeff is the – and it's probably worth spending a minute here for everyone's benefit. As we went into the fourth quarter and we did have some volume softening traditionally, what we would be is much – probably more aggressive on trying to reduce the number of drivers the number of selectors we have. And given the labor market and the environment we're operating in we choose – we've chosen really to take more of a long-term view on this. And so part of what we're wrestling with right now is these increased operating expenses not so much driven by increased labor rates, because our labor – we pay – we're a pretty good payer in the market, but trying to make sure we're not letting people go during maybe a little bit of softer volume times. So we're still paying for those resources probably at a level that we haven't historically to maintain the service and support levels for our customers. As we look forward the volume – if the volume numbers will be softer over a longer period of time, we'll manage that more appropriately. But I think we're just trying to make sure, we're not in a situation where we were a couple of years ago, where we had lots of retention challenges and we were struggling to even get drivers in to fill routes. So today, we're feeling much better about our retention. And as we look to the labor rate next year, we don't see anything that's beyond the kind of 2% to 3% that we've dealt with over the past. And we look to offset some of that with productivity benefits in the operations. We still feel I think pretty good about the labor rate increases, just continuing to manage the retention and making sure we're not doing anything in the short-term to impact our ability to service our customers.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Got it. And just lastly, just – you mentioned national customer softening. I'm just wondering, if you're able to dig into that whether it's more quick service versus casual dining, whether there's a differential there, whether it's a regional differential, or is it kind of a broad brush comment across all brands and across all geographies?
Tom Bené: Yeah. I think it's more of a broader comment. Part of it was losses meaning, we didn't renew or weren't successful in renewing a customer. There are some softness in certain customers, but I would say, it's not specific to anyone geography or even customer type. It's probably more of certain brands that are performing better than others and you guys probably have a sense of who those are and so some of those are in our portfolio both on the positive side and on the challenge side.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Got it. Thank you very much.
Tom Bené: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim. Your line is open.
John Heinbockel: Hey, Tom, can you hear me?
Tom Bené: I can hear you John. We're glad you're back or we're back here.
Joel Grade: We thought we lost you.
John Heinbockel: So when you look at local case growth and you think about trend right because obviously a two-year stack it probably a little bit better in the fourth quarter, where do you think you are, or have you seen any deterioration in local case growth say the last three to six months? And then, is there opportunity, right? A couple of years ago, you selectively added or stepped up MA hiring. Is there an opportunity to do that again, or you don't think that would result in incremental share gains?
Tom Bené: So let's start with the local cases. It was probably a little softer when you think about the last two quarters. But to your point about the two-year stack as we look at how we've grown over the last couple of years, we still feel pretty good about it. And even as we move into this year on that true independent customer, I think we feel good about where we're at. There are some of these as we've talked regional chains where we've seen some impacts and we've got to stay close to that. And part of that is making sure, we're staying competitive in those situations and so that's something that we're going to be very focused on. As we think about is there a way to accelerate that growth even further the MAs continue to play an important role in our portfolio. As you guys know, we've talked about often the fact that our customers really value that resource and we obviously see the benefits of having them out there. We will selectively add resources, where it makes sense meaning maybe our share position is such that there's lots of upside and – but I don't think it makes sense for us to go and add a significant amount of resources in that area. What we're trying to make sure we do is we have the right support around them, especially as we have more and more customers go online to make sure that they've got whether it's the specialist support around proteins or it's around certain product categories that we feel are important to those customers or some of the other tools and technology that we've built to support them. So, it's less about I think adding more resources because, we feel like, we're pretty balanced in the size of territories that they have and the amount that they can handle going forward. We are thinking about ways to increase our new business. Our new business has been strong, but there's always an opportunity to increase the new business side of things especially as we've had some of these transitions happen.
John Heinbockel: And then, when you think about 2020, right, so two things, impact of financial road map in 2020 maybe versus '19. And then maybe for Joel, so D&A in 2020 is that likely to be in the sort of $775 million to $800 million range? I know, it's been stepping down a bit. Is that a fair range to look at?
Joel Grade: So, why don't I start with the D&A comment? I mean, we typically have our D&A that -- I don't know, if there's anything I'd say that's any material or significant change as it relates to that. I mean, I think -- and these sometimes find -- again as we make investments, some stuff falls off and some things add and our D&A may go up a tick. But I just broadly speaking would not say there's anything of significance that you should expect from a D&A perspective moving forward.
Tom Bené: And John, when you spoke financial road map, is there something in particular?
John Heinbockel: No. I'm just curious, when you look at your operating initiatives, right, and you think about which one can make a bigger difference of that group of four, right. It would seem like financial road map could be one of big ones that would have a bigger impact in 2020 than this past year. Is that not right?
Joel Grade: Yes. I would say it this way. I think, we actually had a significant impact in fiscal year 2019 at our finance transformation road map and actually certainly expecting even a slightly more significant impact in fiscal year 2020. I think a couple of those key initiatives. Again, the Canada regionalization as well and when you think about that that was really something that had a benefit in both this year and as it carries into next year kind of started in the middle of the year. And so, the way I would look at these initiatives, John, is that many of them if you remember started benefiting in the second half of the fiscal year which then carries into the -- some of the first and then obviously some further benefit builds on that. So, I would call -- I would say a couple of those certainly again strong impacts last year and expect another solid year as we head into next year as well.
John Heinbockel: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ajay Jain of Pivotal Research Group. Your line is open.
Ajay Jain: Yeah, hi, good morning and thanks for taking my question. I think as others have pointed out, I think you still need to deliver over $200 million of incremental growth to hit the three-year target. And so, I'm just trying to figure out where that's coming from in 2020. I mean do you think that growth will be broad-based across your segments, or should we expect continued pressure in U.S. Foodservice? I think in U.S. Foodservice, earnings were flat in Q4 and that was a pretty sharp sequential decrease in the growth rate. So, do you have any color on what you're assuming across the three main segments in terms of growth for 2020?
Tom Bené: Ajay, as mentioned earlier, I think, it's going to be a balance across all international U.S. and SYGMA. And we see -- in the U.S it's about maintaining that balance between gross profit and operating expense and we feel pretty good about our ability to do that. We have initiatives in place to drive that. As it relates to the European business and the rest of international, I think, we feel like we dealt with a few challenges this year that we had not expected. Specifically, we talked about Mexico and also France and so we think we feel much better going into next year about that. And then, SYGMA, I think, we're just on a good trajectory at this point. We've got ourselves in a place where we need to be able to continue to see improving, both not so much top line, because we've got that business, I think, in a place now where it makes sense, but more around balancing the gross profit and the cost side, so we can deliver operating performance.
Ajay Jain: Okay. Thank you. And I had one follow-up. I think, Tom, in your prepared comments you sort of presented a mixed picture with strong economic backdrop, but softer industry trends in terms of restaurant spending in the U.S. with flat restaurant comps and negative traffic trends. So I'm just trying to reconcile the weaker industry backdrop with your operating performance and that of your competitors, I think, apart from the weaker -- I guess, I'm just wondering apart from the weaker traffic trends, do you feel like you're losing any piece of the independent business to competition? I'm asking, specifically, in relation to some of your competitors who've reported an acceleration with the independent case volume.
Tom Bené: Yes. Well, as you guys all know, there's tremendous amount -- a number of competitors in the space we operate in. There are the public guys and then there are tremendous amount of regional and local folks. I think there are geographies where we've had more impacts from a competitive environment than others. I would say, broadly speaking, we feel comfortable with where we're at. But it is getting aggressive out there and more competitive and we just need to make sure we're maintaining our position and doing everything we can to continue to earn our customers' business every day, not just on price, but obviously on things like our service platform and our product portfolio.
Joel Grade: Yes. And, Ajay, I think, just as a reminder though as well. I think some of the commentary earlier was also related to the fact that, again, within what we talked about as local, there's a couple of different types of those customers. And I think when you think about kind of the true independents versus talk about some of the regional and local chains. Again, I think, some of the pressure a little bit, as Tom talked about earlier, is more in that area where there seasonally seems to have been a bit of a ramp-up in, again, pricing and some upfront that I think we just -- again, we're keeping a very close eye on that, but also again trying to remain -- maintaining our discipline in some of those areas. So I just think I would just distinguish a little bit between, as it relates to true independent and some of the other areas that we're actually feeling more of the pressure.
Ajay Jain: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Ivankoe of JPMorgan. Your line is open.
John Ivankoe: Hi. Thank you. I just had a direct follow-up on the previous question, actually. That level of competition that you have cited in your prepared remarks, I think, even a few times, do you think that's service level-driven, or are you seeing competitors that are materially using gross margin to drive case growth? And like using your previous history in this industry, I mean, do you think we're at the cusp of, which we've obviously been in several times before, companies that might be using gross margin just in and of itself to drive case growth? And is that something, at this point, that you're at least contemplating on a customer-by-customer basis?
Tom Bené: Look, I'll start with, it's always been competitive out there and our comments are, we are certainly seeing some increased competition in certain geographies and segments. And we tried to articulate that. As it relates to how we need to think about that going forward and whether others are investing, we need to make sure we're competitive every single day in every customer and we intended to do that. I think the way we think about that has more to do with making sure that our overall offering is top-notch for our customers and that includes service, product and cost and pricing. I don't think we are having any adverse impact based on our service. We continue to provide very high levels of service. And I would argue that we -- as we've talked about with some of the investments we're making on the operating expense side, we'll continue to put service as a top priority. We know in this business that's critically important to our customers. If you don't have the product, it doesn't really matter what the price is. And so we -- it's really a broad-based approach John and therefore the answer is, there's not one specific thing. But we certainly don't want to be and won't be in a position to be uncompetitive, however that looks by customer type or geography.
John Ivankoe: Understood, thank you. And it's certainly often across many different industries being -- including foodservice distribution where corporate efficiencies can improve cost and margins for the corporate, but it can change or maybe some lower service levels for customers. So in terms of how you measure service levels, can you go into some of those measurements in terms of how you've been able to maintain or even improve service levels across your customer base in the past couple of years? And that's the first point.  And secondly, are there any changes? You've mentioned about investments in OpEx but are there any changes that you think you might need to make to get back and do things like day-of-the-week delivery whatever that case may be that a specific customer wants to regain some of their case volume?
Tom Bené: Yes. So, a couple things. We -- you're referring to the corporate expense adjustments we made earlier in the calendar year our -- end of our -- start of our third quarter.
John Ivankoe: I am yes but also some of the broader business transformation efforts that even occurred before that.
Tom Bené: Yes. So those things are really designed -- we've talked about those as non kind of operational or service-related investments or focus for us. And what we really try to do there is remove non-value-added expenses in our business. And so that -- when we talk about corporate expenses those are kind of tightening our belt here making sure we're doing all the things we need to do so that we can be competitive in the marketplace. So nothing that we've done there would be necessarily affecting our serviceability or our ability to take care of our customers either from a pricing or a cost standpoint. Only we do is further improve our ability to do that. As it relates to how we service the service has been a hallmark for Sysco for a long time. And we look at everything. We have lots of metrics there. But some examples of things we're doing to improve even our service level is to make sure that we have a way of communicating to our customers on a daily basis throughout the day where their delivery is as an example so that -- we have -- they have both an application and we use technology so they can look and see where their delivery is at. But we also have ways of making sure we're staying more in touch with our drivers throughout the day, so we can remove any obstacles they might have to delivering that customer when they expect to be delivered. So when I talk about investments some of it's technology investments, some of it is resourcing investments as we've talked about. But we intend to make sure kind of for us table stakes is a great service offering and certainly delivery is a big part of that.
Joel Grade: Yes. And just -- John just as a summary of that. I would just think it's just really important to be clear that the work we've done had been again some streamlining of spend layers efficiencies in terms of administrative, but in no way shape or form are we somehow reducing investments in our ability to grow or to provide great service. I think that's just the really key takeaway here, I just wanted to reinforce.
John Ivankoe: Absolutely. And certainly for fiscal 2019, I think that was clearly the case that it was corporate driven. But some of the business transformation efforts before that were put into place would be with routing and purchasing and what have you and you could have had an impact on consumers that were actually delayed. And so that was the question that I was asking. If you were to go back versus several years ago and looked at your service levels after the variety of business transformation efforts that you've put forth whether you've been able to maintain or even increase service levels despite those changes, which have obviously been a big part of the efficiencies and profit growth that Sysco has seen.
Tom Bené: Okay. Thanks for the clarity. If you're referring back to some of the ERP implementation work, yeah, we certainly had some fairly significant service challenges in those companies that had transitioned. We're well beyond that and our systems are operating well. And certainly that is a big driver of our ability to make sure that we've got the assets on the road to deliver our customers' expectations. So, yeah, we're a much different place than we would have been years ago and we feel very good about our ability to continue to improve in that area.
John Ivankoe: Okay. Thank you.
Tom Bené: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Judah Frommer of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Judah Frommer: Hi good morning, guys. I was hoping, first you could help unpack the commentary on competition within the U.S. business between national, regional and then truly independent cases. You guys do probably have more chain business within your local case number than some competitors. And I don't want to put words in your mouth but it sounds like you're seeing that elevated competition on the chain side of things as opposed to independence. And can you help us with why that may be happening?
Tom Bené: When we talk about regional accounts you might I guess -- I don't think oftentimes folks talk about them as changed, certainly I don't think talks about them as always changed. But some of the larger regional concepts is what we have talked about and we are referring to here. And so I'd say just -- we're just seeing increased competition. Folks do I think look at that as a growth opportunity and certainly we have and just become more aggressive in going after those customers. Those are the type of accounts that Joel referred to earlier that are susceptible to some aggressive pricing as they look to change their offering, and we tend to be more balanced on our focus on those customers around -- certainly product pricing is important but so is our ability to service them and make sure that they have what they need to keep growing.
Judah Frommer: Okay. Could that potentially create a dynamic over the course of the year where you're seeing maybe cases slow down but, kind of, average profitability across your local customers improve if you are calling some relatively lower margin business within the local customer base?
Tom Bené: You see a little of that today based on that mix, but that's certainly not our objective, meaning we're not trying to in those customers per se change the mix or certainly not looking to drive more pricing in our independent segment. We feel like we're positioned well there. So it's not about driving additional margin with local customers I guess is the key point I'm trying…
Joel Grade: But I do think you're seeing a little bit of that now Judah when you see the -- our margin this past quarter continued to increase despite some -- a little bit higher inflation. And I think some of that is related to the fact that there's a bit of a shift in -- in terms of where the growth, which again a little more towards the -- a little move away from if you will some of the contracts.
Judah Frommer: Okay. And if I could just squeeze one more in. As you kind of lower the three-year operating income plan to $600 million there are things that within the three-year period have kind of worked out after you guys expressing concern namely the inbound freight and inflation seems to be in a supportive area. Would you say that you're setting the current guide assuming that everything kind of continues as is Q4 and early into Q1, or would you say that there are kind of executional improvements you can make that could drive upside to the updated guide?
Tom Bené: I think the way we talk about that is that -- someone referenced earlier is the big step-up from the prior two years and we know that we've got to be able to deliver that. So, we feel like it's a reasonable number based on all the things we need to execute, the topline that we've talked about continued improvement in our costs so that we are being competitive out there every day and ultimately making sure that the industry and the market continues at least at the pace that it's at now. So, I think what we would say is we feel good about the number but I wouldn't go as far as assuming there's a bunch of upside in there based on where we sit today.
Judah Frommer: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Edward Kelly of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Edward Kelly: Hey, thanks guys. Thanks for letting me back in. I just wanted to ask just one question here Tom and this relates to kind of beyond 2020. And just any thoughts on sort of the next three years when we'll think we'll get some color? Are you planning an Analyst Day at all later this year? And kind of we take a step back and you hit your $600 million, you're still going to average 8% EBIT growth rate over this period in what was one of the toughest operating environments in the industry in quite a while. That's really hard to find a consumer. Just thoughts on how you're thinking about the longer-term outlook kind of beyond 2020 even if it's qualitatively at this point.
Tom Bené: Well, appreciate you raising a couple of those points. So, we feel really good about the three-year number and to your point that's delivering really solid results. I think as we look ahead we have not set a date yet to do an Analyst Day or Investor Day but we are we're certainly talking about that and trying to think through when is the best time to do that given the current three-year plan ends. I think the way we think about it is how do we continue to invest for the long term and drive what we would argue is top quartile results in the industry. And so it's a combination of the two. We still have a lot of investments that we're making in the international sector. Even here in the U.S. we still believe there are things we need to continue to invest in around technology to put ourselves in the right place going forward. And obviously, M&A continues to be an opportunity as we think about how do we grow in the future. So, probably not giving you what you want other than to say that we feel good about the performance we've had over the last couple of years. We feel like that's the kind of performance that we should be able to deliver going forward and we'll pick a day here in the not-too-distant future to be able to get together with you all and talk about that.
Edward Kelly: Great. Thank you.
Tom Bené: Thank you.
Operator: Our last question comes from Rebecca Scheuneman of Morningstar. Your line is open.
Rebecca Scheuneman: Good morning. So I want to switch gears a little bit and just ask about the international division. The profitability came in a bit better than we were expecting and at 4% operating margins in the quarter. I was just wondering is this a reflection of the Canadian reorganization and something that could be more sustained and possibly a new kind of base hitting forward, or was there something unique about the Q4 that will not -- that temporarily kind of boosted profitability that we should not expect to carry forward?
Tom Bené: Hi, Rebecca. Thanks for joining us. I wouldn't say, it was any unique things that happened in the quarter. I think it's a combination of things. The regionalization is a good example of where we need to be bringing more consistency across how we run the international businesses. And in the case of Canada, leveraging a model that given the geography there could help us drive more benefit on the cost side, because our costs were a bit out of whack. As it relates to Europe, some of those same opportunities exist. And you heard me say in the prepared comments that we're starting to bring some of the same kind of capabilities that we have as a company and processes to some of these businesses that maybe historically haven't operated that way. So I think what we would say is that we feel good about where we ended the year. As we had said, though we -- it was a little bit rougher in the first half and we still have some work to do, I think balancing the investments we're making and the improvements you should see in our operating expenses over time in the international sector should be kind of a way to think about us going forward.
Rebecca Scheuneman: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Tom Bené: Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-05-06 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to Sysco's Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2019 Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. We will begin today's call with opening remarks and introductions. I would like to turn the call over to Neil Russell, Vice President of Investor Relations, Communications and Treasurer. Please go ahead.
Neil Russell: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Sysco's third quarter fiscal 2019 earnings call.

To ensure that we have sufficient time to answer all questions, we'd like to ask each participant to limit their time today to one question and one follow-up. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Bené.
Tom Bené: Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining us. I'd like to start off this morning with an overview of our third quarter performance and a discussion around our business segment and the key highlights for the quarter. Following that, Joel will cover the financial results in further detail. Overall, we are pleased with our overall operating and financial performance for the third quarter. We delivered improved year-over-year growth in line with our expectations and managed costs well including the ongoing cost savings associated with our business transformation initiatives. The improved pace of performance for the second half of fiscal 2019 we've previously spoke of is in fact taking shape. And while we still have work to do, we remain confident in our ability to deliver our adjusted operating income growth target and now expect that to be at the low end of the $650 million to $700 million range. Joel and I will both elaborate on this further. From a total Sysco perspective, our third quarter results include increased sales of 2.2% to $14.7 billion; gross profit growth of 2.9%; and adjusted operating expense decrease of 0.4%, which translated into an adjusted operating income increase of 16.6% to $620 million; and an adjusted earnings per share increase of 17.4% to $0.79. Turning to U.S. restaurant industry data. The overall sales trends remained mixed. According to Black Box and Knapp Track, we saw some choppiness throughout the quarter as March data was generally positive compared to February in part due to weather, which negatively impacted February sales. Additionally same-store sales were positive for the quarter, although traffic once again declined. However, even with this recent choppy industry performance, the overall macro trends remained generally favorable for our customers as illustrated by continued low unemployment which was at 3.8% for March and strong GDP growth for the first quarter at 3.2%. Economic growth in the international markets in which we operate was mostly positive. This includes modest growth in the foodservice sector, although we continue to see the impacts of Brexit on our U.K. business due to uncertainty and low consumer confidence. In Canada, the consumer confidence index continues to rise with March seeing the third consecutive monthly increase with Technomic forecasting the Canadian foodservice industry to grow 0.6% in real terms or 4.1% on a nominal basis for calendar year 2019. Additionally, we continue to see reasonable overall trends in the other international markets where we do business. As we discussed last quarter, we anticipated seeing an increased benefit from our transformation initiatives beginning in the second half of this year and we began to see those benefits show up this quarter. Overall our results included a bit softer top line than expected offset by good overall expense management which delivered solid operating profit performance that was in line with our expectations. Examples of initiatives that are driving benefits from an expense management perspective include our field finance transformation and the corporate office administrative restructuring which we implemented last quarter. As it relates to acquisitions, in April we acquired J&M Wholesale Meats and Imperio Foods; two smaller central California distributors. J&M Meats is a foodservice distributor that specializes in key Center of the Plate products and Imperio Foods carries dry canned good products which both are complementary to our existing Broadline businesses in central California area. They also provide Sysco with the opportunity to further extend our reach to the important Hispanic customer segment. We will begin to see the impact to our business in the fourth quarter from both of these acquisitions. Additionally in the quarter, we made the decision to sell our Iowa Premium, cattle processing business. While our 3-year plan forecast included positive operating income for this business, we believe the divestiture of this business is in alignment with our strategic priority and allows us to focus on our core strength as a distributor. The transaction will result in a reduction of planned operating income of approximately $25 million and is the reason for us now projecting to achieve the low end of our adjusted operating income growth range. Now I'd like to transition to our third quarter results by business segment beginning with U.S. Foodservice Operations. Sales for the third quarter were $10.1 billion, an increase of 4.1%. Gross profit grew 5.1% including an improvement in gross margin of 18 basis points. Adjusted operating expenses grew 2.3% and adjusted operating income increased 10%. Total case volume within U.S. Broadline grew modestly at 2.1% for the quarter, of which 1.3% was organic. However we delivered relatively solid growth in our local business, as local case growth was up 3.1% of which 2.2% was organic. We are pleased with the gross profit growth we delivered for the quarter which was impacted by a number of factors including continued positive momentum from category management, as we continue to deepen our relationships with our strategic supplier partners; year-over-year favorability from the impact of inbound freight; and continued growth in our Sysco branded products, which increased by 28 basis points with our local customers this quarter. In addition, the inflation rate for the quarter was 2.3% in U.S. Broadline, up nearly 1 point from the second quarter of this fiscal year. Technology continues to be one of our fundamental enablers of growth, as we transform our business to serve our customers in ways that best meet their needs. We are continuing to provide new capabilities and tools to enable an improved experience of doing business with Sysco, including new ordering tools, which has driven our e-commerce ordering utilization to more than 53% with our local customers. From a cost perspective, within U.S. Foodservice Operations, our expense management was solid, as adjusted operating expenses were 2.3% for the quarter. While we continue to see Supply Chain cost challenges in the warehouse and transportation areas, we are seeing positive momentum from our recruiting, onboarding and retention initiatives. These challenges were partially offset by continued improvements seen as a result of our routing optimization initiatives and ongoing process improvements. Furthermore, our finance transformation and smart spending initiative have also provided benefits in the quarter. Moving on to International Food Service Operations for the quarter. Sales decreased 1.5%. Gross profit decreased 3.1%. Adjusted operating expenses decreased by 5.8% and adjusted operating income grew 30%. We saw solid overall performance in Canada with strong top line growth and solid gross profit dollar growth of more than 5%, driven in part by an inflation rate of 2.6% along with strong expense management, partially benefiting from our ongoing regionalization efforts, which are progressing well. In Europe, we continue to have mixed results. The U.K. continues to feel the effects of Brexit uncertainty, causing depressed consumer confidence. However, our Brakes U.K. business continues to stabilize operationally as a result of our multi-year initiatives to transform the business. In France, social unrest continues to impact tourism and consequently food-away-from-home consumption. Our sales performance during the third quarter was adversely impacted by this unrest and by some operational challenges associated with integrating Brake France and Davigel into Sysco France. That said, the overall integration and supply chain transformation continues to be on track to deliver the long-term benefits that are part of our multi-year plan. As for our business in Latin America, we continue to see growth opportunities in this region, both with our chain restaurant customers and with our expansion of Cash & Carry locations to complement our Broadline footprint in both Costa Rica and Panama. Moving on to SYGMA. We continue to make disciplined choices in an effort to deliver improved profitability. In Q3, we saw expected softness in the top line due to transition customers, while seeing gross margin increased by 28 basis points year-over-year. Solid expense management drove adjusted operating expenses down 7.1% versus prior year, resulting in significantly improved operating performance. In an effort to improve overall profitability in this important segment of the business, we will continue to take a very disciplined approach to growth as we move forward. Lastly, in our other business segment. We recently announced the restructuring of Guest Supply. As the industry landscape evolves, we are focusing on optimizing our business model in creating a more focused and agile organization to better meet the changing needs of our customers. New operating structure has created three distinct business units under the parent company Guest Worldwide. The business units include Gilchrist & Soames our amenity manufacturing unit; Manchester Mills one of the world's leading textile producers; and Guest Supply which serves the world's top hotel chains and independent properties in over 100 countries as a full spectrum distribution solution provider. In summary we continue to feel good about the fundamentals of our business. Our customer and operational strategies are firmly aligned around reaching our customers' experience of doing business with Sysco. And we remain focused on engaging our 67,000 dedicated associates around the world to deliver against our financial objectives associated with our 3-year plan. Let me now turn the call over to Joel Grade our Chief Financial Officer. 
Joel Grade: Thank you Tom and good morning everyone. I'd like to provide you with additional financial details surrounding our performance for the quarter. As Tom mentioned earlier, we saw improved year-over-year results for the third quarter. Although we saw some softness in the top line, our earnings reflect solid expense management and strong adjusted operating income growth which are in line with what we've previously stated and our results of our enterprise-wide transformational initiatives. These initiatives showed our streamlined efficiencies and allow us to reinvest in the business to facilitate continued growth include, our finance transformation roadmap, smart spending and the Canadian regionalization initiatives. For the third quarter of fiscal 2019, total Sysco sales grew 2.2%. Foreign exchange rates negatively affected total Sysco sales by approximately 1.1%. In our U.S. Broadline business we experienced 2.3% inflation driven by a few categories including the frozen potato, poultry and meat categories and we are managing this modest increase in inflation well. Gross profit in third quarter increased 2.9% and gross margin increased 14 basis points while adjusted operating expenses decreased by 0.4% resulting in strong adjusted operating income growth of 16.6% to $620 million. Changes in foreign exchange rates decreased adjusted operating income by 34 basis points. Although it will vary from quarter-to-quarter we are focused on maintaining the 150 basis point gap between gross profit dollars and operating expense dollars that we committed to as part of our 3-year plan in order to achieve our adjusted operating income growth targets. Turning to earnings per share, our adjusted earnings per share for the quarter increased $0.12 to $0.79 per share. Our EPS results this quarter were impacted by our strong operating income, adjusted tax rate, foreign exchange impact and stock option exercises. I would now like to discuss our tax rate for the quarter. The GAAP effective tax rate of negative 2% for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 is primarily attributable to the termination made during the quarter to recognize the favorable impact of $95 million of foreign tax credit generated as a result of distribution to Sysco from our foreign operations at the end of fiscal 2018. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 21%. Looking to our fourth quarter, we would expect our effective tax rate to be in the 23% to 25% range. Now turning to cash flow. Cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2019, which is $244 million higher compared to the prior year period. Free cash flow for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2019 was $1 billion, which was $233 million higher compared to the prior year. The improvement in free cash flow was primarily due to last year's pension contribution, partially offset by cash taxes and the impact to working capital from an increase in day’s sales outstanding. Net capital expenditures totaled $367 million for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2019, which was $10.8 million higher compared to the prior year period. For the full year fiscal 2019, we now expect the capital expenditure forecast to be approximately 1.1% of sales, down slightly from our previously stated 1.2%. That said, there are no changes to the prioritized order of capital allocation, which is as follows; investing in the business, consistently growing our dividend, participating in M&A, and a balanced approach to share buybacks and paying down debt. As Tom mentioned earlier with the anticipated sale of Iowa Premium, we expect to achieve our target at the low end from $650 million to $700 million range as a result of our planned operating income being decreased by $25 million. In summary, we saw improved year-over-year results for the third quarter, led by continued momentum from improved underlying business performance, solid local case growth and good cost management. That said, we have more work to do in order to achieve the financial objectives of our three-year plan, although we remain confident in our ability to achieve these objectives. We are committed to serving our customers and delivering at a high level of execution all years of our business that will improve our financial performance in both the near and long-term. Operator, we are now ready for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Christopher Mandeville from Jefferies. Your line is open.
Christopher Mandeville: Hey, good morning. Can you speak to the gross margin improvement in the quarter and maybe help us understand [those reference] [ph] impacts by order of magnitude? And then Tom or Joel as it relates to private label penetration, it was again expansion but it was one of the lower rates we've seen in recent quarters. So maybe you could help us understand as to whether or not it was an anomaly and we can return back to that 50 to 60 bps of expansion going forward or any color would be appreciated.
Joel Grade: Yeah. Sure, Chris, good morning. It's Joel. I'll start. The way to think about that again it's really up balanced across some of the levers I would say, but I mean certainly our continued opportunities in our Sysco Brand, certainly are a strong driver as well as continued category management efforts where we continue to again obviously it's not what it was five years ago when we had this giant year-over-year jump, but the reality of it is we continue to enhance our relationships with our suppliers and continue to drive category management as well across. Again there are business and so I think those are a couple of areas that certainly are driving again [indiscernible] like a margin percentage, but again I'm really talking about what we think about most and that is our gross profit dollars. We obviously also have some favorable benefits of some inflation. Inflation in our world clearly is something that ultimately certainly in the moderate range it's at today is a good driver of opportunities again to move as we continue to push cost of goods through our customers and so that's certainly beneficial in terms of the dollars and gross profit. And I would say it's not necessarily at the levels of that detrimental really against the comments that I think we're managing these cost of goods inflation well. And I think that's really, really due to the fact that this is -- yes, there's ton of inflation really in our wheelhouse in terms of where those functions best. So, I don't really say those are some of the main drivers of what we're looking at here and just in general some of the tools that you heard about in the past in terms of again managements continue to help us drive the margins in a positive way.
Tom Bené: Hey Chris this is Tom. Just maybe just two other things I reinforce as well. We did get some positive year-over-year benefit on the inbound freight side which as we've talked in the past does impact gross margin. And then your question around Sysco Brand, we look at 20 basis point improvement as a very positive number still as long as that continues to move in the right direction. That's a reflection for us of a couple of things. One, our customers are still reacting positively to all Sysco brands. And two, we continue to bring innovative ideas and solutions to the market. So, we actually view that to be a solid number, while it might be a little bit less than the growth that you've seen in a couple of quarters, it's still a really good number.
Christopher Mandeville: Okay. And then just my final question would be -- and you brought it up Joel inflation. What should we be expecting in the coming quarter? And if there's a willingness with you guys be able to disclose organic case growth quarter-to-date?
Joel Grade: Yes. And so I mean I think just on your question on inflation I mean I think certainly our forecast is to continue to see I'd say moderate level of inflation as we move forward, certainly over the next couple of quarters. There's nothing that jumps up necessarily that would be really significant in terms of the overall inflation numbers. So, I would think we expect certainly an additional moderate level of inflation over the next couple of quarters. Organic case growth I think it was part of the U.S. Foodservice ops, 2.2% was the overall number that was organic.
Tom Bené: But you're asking year-to-date right? Chris? And that's--
Christopher Mandeville: Quarter-to-date?
Tom Bené: Quarter-to-date numbers. Okay. 
Christopher Mandeville: Yes, strip out some of the noise from weather and what have you and may be expect the calendar shift for Easter as well.
Joel Grade: Yes. So, I think -- so when we talk about there's local -- our local case volume for the quarter was the question I was answering, it was 2.2% was organic. Total case volume organic was 1.3% [indiscernible].
Christopher Mandeville: But is there any real comment for April?
Tom Bené: Not really. I mean we continue to -- I think we feel good about continued momentum of the business. And I don't think there's anything necessarily -- Easter, there was a little bit of an Easter shift, but not a big shift given the timing of when it fell last year in the quarter versus this year.
Christopher Mandeville: Okay. Thanks guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Edward Kelly: Yes. Hi, guys. Good morning.
Joel Grade:  Good morning.
Edward Kelly: Can I -- I want to start with OpEx and I was hoping that you could give us a little bit of help here. I mean, obviously, you had a big quarter from a cost perspective. Maybe just digging a little bit more related to the drivers and I'm asking this question, because I think a lot of the accelerated efforts that you guys have been talking about weren't supposed to be at a full run rate this quarter. So I'm just trying to figure out, how we think about OpEx going forward? And then, as part of this, Q4's comparison looks pretty hard. I think you had a worker's comp benefit last year that you had to lap. Can you get to that 1.5% spread in Q4?
Joel Grade:  Well, I'll start and I mean, I think, a couple of things I would say to that. Number one, I'll maybe take the last point first. 1.5 point spread obviously and I think I even said it in my prepared comments is, it's something we look at over the course of a three-year plan. It doesn't mean that necessarily a report has been all the same, some actually higher, some actually possibly be lower as, obviously, we've seen both here. I think the way I would look at it though, I mean, again, as we did signal, we did anticipate some improved performance in the second half of the year. Obviously, some of these benefits start to kick in from our finance technology roadmap, smart spending work, the Canadian Regionalization, some of the other administrative cost work that we did around some of our corporate office transitions. I think the -- again, we feel that about -- those things kicking in as we said in the second half of this year, as we headed to next year as well. I would also call out just -- again, overall, our operating performance continues to be pretty strong and the expense line -- that’s a good pace so that actually we had some a little bit of fuel headwind, this particular quarter. And it was about $0.03 a case. So, I mean, we had -- I think the question is, do we expect this to continue in these areas? I do. To your point, there are some headwinds that we're anticipating that we will be up against in the fourth quarter. But, certainly, as we've talked about here for a while, we certainly anticipated that our leverage from the second half of the year will be better than the first half and I think we're certainly starting to see that.
Edward Kelly: Okay. And then, just a follow-up on CapEx. So the CapEx guidance is down a bit. Can you just talk a bit about what's driving that? I don't know if Iowa Premium has anything to do with it. And how sustainable a rate of sort of 1.1% would be going forward?
Joel Grade: Well, I -- again, I -- the way I would look at that, I mean, number one, it's not that optimum of a forecast, but I mean the reality of it is, we spend our CapEx and make our investments based truly on the needs of the business. There's been absolutely no change in terms of our perspective on our capital allocation priorities that always start with investing in our business. We're obviously very committed to doing that. We've got a lot of changed programs and things transitioning our organization that will continue to require investments. I would just tell you, from a timing perspective, some of those things happened. And, again, things do move around in the businesses has been some ways, so some of that's probably the timing as much as anything, but I would definitely not takeaway that there's some changes in terms of the way we're looking at forecasting our CapEx. We just -- again, we just adjust spending in investment in terms of the needs of the businesses.
Edward Kelly: Great. Thanks guys.
Joel Grade:  Thanks, Ed.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short from Barclays. Your line is open.
Karen Short: Hi. Thanks. First thing I just want to ask was in terms of the composition of the -- now I guess the $650 million. Is there any change to the breakout between gross profit and then the supply chain versus the admin?
Joel Grade: No, Karen. So there's not. I would just – the only shift at all was related to the anticipated sale of the business, but no there is no bucketing difference if you will.
Karen Short: Okay. And then the same question I just want to ask. I know you, obviously, mentioned and you have been mentioning positive same-store sales, but traffic weakness. So, I was just wondering if you can talk a little bit about trends of traffic and I guess same-store sales on a true like mom-and-pops local basis in terms of being independent versus the micro change? Any patterns or differences you could point to there?
Tom Bené: Yeah, good morning, Karen. This is Tom. I mean I think we have seen certainly some choppiness this quarter particular. I think there are probably a bunch of different things driving that, but it depends really on what source you look at. I mean NPD would call out that while overall spend is up traffic is up in some areas as well and down in others, and Firefox, Naptrack they are probably a little more consistent than they have called traffic down really across most of the segment. So I think it's driven by everything from the weather choppiness in Q3, our Q3 and mostly in February and then I think again consumer efforts during that time. The small chains seemed to be doing a little bit better, so that's going to be your micro change. And then the pure independents at least in this quarter according to NPD tend to be a little bit softer, but I would say from our perspective we have seen necessarily any major difference in trend line that we've experienced over the last couple of quarters, so we continue to feel like this independent growth that we've had and that sector is doing well and we continue to feel pretty confident in our ability to continue to grow and take share in that space.
Karen Short: Okay. And so then just last housekeeping. Corporate came in on a dollar basis was higher than I would have expected given the layoffs that you'd announced. I don't know if that's just an allocation issue or what because I would have thought on the dollar basis that would have been quite a bit down sequentially and year-over-year.
Joel Grade: Are you talking about the last kind of the specifically corporate layoffs? We're talking in stream stocks…
Karen Short: Yes, yes.
Joel Grade: Obviously there are a lot of things that are part of our financing technology roadmap that are very much fueled focus. And so in fact one of the things we talked about in the first half of the year is that there were again why do we feel comfortable about this because there's been -- field personnel. And so I would tell you, I think the majority of what you're seeing is pretty – is probably even more fuel focus in corporate, but it's balanced between the two.
Karen Short: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Wolf from Loop Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Andrew Wolf: Good morning. I wanted to follow-up on the cadence of sales question that people asked about. You guys said, January was strong on a good weather comparison for February, but it's not good. Should we take away from that sort of March and April have somewhat normalized and if people are trying to get obviously trying to get a sense of whether the industry has slowed or not on a normalized basis?
Tom Bené: Yeah. I think we would say that that's -- we feel like that certainly instances of weather impacts in the early part of the quarter, things have stabilized. 
Andrew Wolf: And I noticed you gave us -- I may have missed this but I heard the Technomics forecast for Canada. Do you have one for the U.S that you might be able to share with us? 
Joel Grade: As you know Technomic kind of gets out ahead of and they do it by quarter kind of by -- sorry by subsegment. I may have that information which if I have it I can get it to you. We may get back to you on that, but we generally do have that information. 
Andrew Wolf: Okay. And I just got one other question unrelated to sales. So in the -- you took a $35 million charge and I know it was related to the change in the business technology strategy. So could you expand a little upon that what the change is in your business spend -- business technology for us?
Joel Grade: So – just can you clarify -- that question one more time maybe? 
Andrew Wolf: Of the $72 million charges you excluded out of operating expense $35 million was allocated for what you call the change in business technology strategy. Is that basically going to the cloud and could you expand on -- so we could understand a little bit better…
Joel Grade: Yes some of that. It's also a variety of things being actually accelerated depreciation we took in Europe. That was really all due to technology change. So I think, there's been a few things that I get that number is also accelerated our G&A a little bit. But I would say there's one thing that fell into a number of things that are just part of our technology strategy that are included in that number and it's not necessarily one big thing there. And there's not one thing -- the takeaway would not be that we've somehow have a significant change in technology because we do not. It's just a variety of things going on.
Andrew Wolf: And that was what I was trying to get to. So appreciate that.
Tom Bené: Yes. Think of it as more specifically around Finance Transformation which is a technology component of it and then the European work we've been doing where we have an ERP in France that we've been updating and so those are the two main drivers of it.
Andrew Wolf: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Marisa Sullivan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. 
Marisa Sullivan: Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted to touch on fuel quickly. You called it that there was a slight headwind in the third quarter. Well, how should we think about fuel in the fourth quarter as it impacts your assumption?
Joel Grade: Marisa I’d anticipate some of the continued headwinds as we head into the fourth quarter and probably a little bit as we head into next year as well. 
Marisa Sullivan: Got you. And then I haven't heard you guys talk about category management in a while on these calls. I'm wondering was there anything you guys are doing differently in the third quarter that kind of made it a greater impact, anything that you're planning for the fourth quarter as we should think about gross margin in CatMan?
Tom Bené: Marisa, it's Tom. No, I wouldn’t say anything unique. I think we're just trying to highlight as we continue to -- it's an ongoing process. It has been now for years and we're starting to do some deeper work with some of our more strategic supplier partners and think about them more as some potentially long-term benefits as we the end partner more deeply with some suppliers.
Marisa Sullivan: Got you. And are you seeing any impacts or any customer feedback on category management? Are they like and what you're doing? Or is it -- are they having to adjust to assortment changes? 
Tom Bené: No. I think we're in a point now its – early, early days so call it a few years ago now. I think because we were changing some suppliers in some areas or products that was creating some choppiness and we've actually continue to have a very good feedback from our customers around the work we're doing with CatMan, obviously, that drives cost benefit for them and they're very excited about that. And as I mentioned, we are getting more focused on strategic partnerships so that we can have more consistent supply for the long-term. So, it's generally very positive. 
Marisa Sullivan: Thank you so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Judah Frommer from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Judah Frommer: Hi thanks for taking the question. Maybe first just on the changes to guidance related to Iowa premium. I think you said it's the entire kind of reduction in guidance is due to Iowa premium. But if we're stripping $25 million out, obviously, that's not necessarily the low end. So, when you say the low end, are you saying $650 million to $675 million effectively? 
Joel Grade: Yes. No, I think here's the way I would think about that Judah. I think we talked about really -- really comes around the midpoint of the range. And so if you do $650 million or $700 million that will be $675 million. Really we're talking about here is a $25 million related Iowa premium and yes that was the only adjustment to our guidance at this point, which takes us from that midpoint down to the lower end of the range.
Judah Frommer: Okay, that's helpful. And switching gears. I thought you said that freight was a tailwind on the inbound side in Q3. Is that right? Are you telling us that you're actually getting a benefit there? Or that it was less of a headwind year-over-year? And any commentary around kind of the freight situation in driver shortages and ability to retain drivers lately will be helpful.
Tom Bené: Sure. Just remember we had to separate a couple of things here. So, inbound is our gross margin and I did mention that we had charm year-over-year positive impact to that. Again -- because a year ago, we were still dealing with quite a few challenges related to inbound freight. So, I would think about it as it has gotten better. We're not feeling the kind of impact and there was a piece of that gross margin improvement that was driven by that this year. As it relates to outbound, we continue to have certainly we're managing that I think better than we were a year ago as well, but we still have challenges from transportation perspective although albeit I think the work that we're doing around recruiting and retention is much improved and we are seeing positive impacts across our operations versus a year ago in that regard.
Joel Grade: Yes. Judah just one thing I would just add to that. I would characterize the inbound freight as less of a headwind and not necessarily a benefit. In other words, there is some level of resetting in the overall structure that happened. But relative to Tom's point to where we were at last year, we were really up against some real major challenges that we have left ahead. We have to think about that.
Judah Frommer: Great. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.
John Heinbockel: So, Tom maybe 18 months ago you guys selectively added MAs in a few markets. So, how are they performing? And then if you think about the opportunity on the share side, is there an opportunity today to go out and redirect some of the cost savings into more MA hiring to try to drive more share? Or is that not productive? 
Tom Bené: hey good morning John. I'll answer the question. So, I would say first of all we felt really good about the work we did around MAs a little over a year ago. And if you recall when we talked about it back then, what we were really focused on was a few tools that enabled us to do a better of understanding where the biggest opportunities were and then applying those resources to those specific geographies or areas. And so, we continue to believe that targeted approach is the right approach. And as I think about it overtime, it's -- so it's not as much just about adding MAs for the sake of adding MAs. It's about adding them where we now know we have the biggest opportunity to succeed. And so, we'll continue to selectively do that. And we're kindling all the time evaluating our territories in each of our opportunity areas and that may encourage us to shift in certain areas versus others, but I would say just outright adding a bunch of more MAs for the sake of that is not really our strategy. We continue to see our territory size get a little bit larger as we are able to provide the marketing associates with more tools and support. We're talking a lot about the tools and support that we offer our customers on that side of the business and we continue to do, I think, a really nice job of building up those capabilities, whether that be things like menu planning and analysis for our business review process, where we have our chefs engaged. So I think we're continuing to focus those total resources on the local side of the business, not just the marketing associate, but leveraging the MAs to bring these other tools and capabilities that we built behind them to the market. 
John Heinbockel: And then, if you guys started to give thought to when you provide the next plan, right, what's the time frame for that? And is the idea another three-year plan? Or, sort of, shift to year-by-year outlook?
Tom Bené:  I don't think we -- we've never made that call on that yet, John. And so we're -- I think, we're still working through ourselves, what the best approach and so I'd say, kind of, more to come. We'll certainly talk with you all when we're in a place where we want to do that.
John Heinbockel: Okay. Thank you.
Tom Bené: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Ajay Jain from Pivotal Research Group. Your line is open.
Ajay Jain: Yeah. Hi. I know you guys don't typically comment on case growth internationally. And Tom, you did mention in the prepared comments that top line in Canada is really strong and then you also talked about some of the challenges in France and the U.K, but is there any way you can give some directional commentary about organic case growth internationally, specifically, for Canada, the U.K. and the rest of Europe sequentially and year-over-year?
Tom Bené:  Honestly, Ajay, I think part of the challenge for us sincerely is the way we are still, I would say, managing through that transition. The cases that we talked about in the U.S. and the consistency that we can provide you guys, does not exist in that business yet. And so, potentially over time, we might be in a place to do that, but today the way we still account for the sales and the way we think about the cases or the pounds of the units that we sell in different parts of the world are not on account on a consistent basis. But what I did say and I will reinforce here, we did have strong top line growth in Canada. And what we said in Europe is, look, we had a couple of things going on in Europe that are impacting us. Certainly, the U.K. and everything with Brexit, has created some choppiness over there. Our sales are positive. It's just that they are not -- they're not growing at the rate we would like them to or would want them to at this point. And then in France, look, I think, we all thought the unrest that was going, the total social unrest in France would have, by now, certainly cleared and it just has not. And while that’s -- it's not a huge impact because it's a big country, there's certainly still some things going on there that are creating issues for our customers and therefore us getting products to them. So, long way of saying, I think we still feel generally good about those businesses. We would have like to see a little bit more top line growth in Europe in this last quarter, and that's kind of built into my prepared comments driving that overall numbers and we feel good about the U.S. numbers and certainly about Canada. We just don't have the information in a way that we feel like it's easily providable to you guys.
Ajay Jain: Okay, thank you. Would it be possible to confirm how much you've allocated for severance in Q3 and year-to-date? I think there were some kind of breakdown provided last quarter for Canada and Europe, but I'm just wondering if there's any update on severance that includes U.S. Foodservice and also wondering if you can give your outlook for severance for Q4.
Joel Grade: Ajay, there's volumes to that -- I mean, they're not GAAP rest. I mean, we do have a fair amount of detail that is probably the best I'd be able to give you here in terms of spilling that out. Again obviously if you think about the areas, certainly really across our business we've had a little bit finance technology roadmaps certainly we talked about our corporate here in the U.S. side versus the Canada regionalization, some of the work being done freight in terms of programs, I mean obviously again some of that I think you'll see fallout in our non-GAAP product, but I think that's part of the back up. And the only thing I would say is, obviously, there's some pretty sizable numbers in there, particularly last quarter as it relates to Europe, obviously, that was -- well not all inclusive. That was some of the biggest majority what's going to come there and at least in that part of the world.
Ajay Jain: Okay. And in terms of the impact from the recent headcount restructuring, will that be more reflected in Q4, or will the majority of that allocated in Q3?
Joel Grade: Yeah, I mean I think the majority -- again the majority of that is actually going to be in -- within Q2 but then also here in Q3, so I wouldn't expect that -- a lot of that is reflected in Q4. The benefits we were starting to realize here as we talk about the second half of the year as we head into next year. 
Ajay Jain: Okay. I had one final question if I can. I think you've made some adjustments in the financials for accelerated depreciation year-to-date. I'm not sure if there was any impact in Q3 itself, but I thought at this point you should cycle the technology restructuring plan from a few years ago. And maybe I can get some clarification offline, but I thought conceptually at this point there shouldn’t be any residual impact from the SAT accelerated depreciation less your year-to-date adjustments are for Europe or unrelated to the previous?
Joel Grade: Yeah, I wouldn't think about it that way. It's actually was in D&A, in particularly the site volume increased this quarter. That was related to I would call accelerated depreciation in Europe for the most part, actually accelerated some depreciation there. And so the majority of the depreciation increase you're seeing is related to some technology transitions in Europe, but it's not related to what you're talking about before in terms of the mess right here in the U.S.
Ajay Jain: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Sinisi from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Vincent Sinisi: Hey, great. Good morning, guys. Thanks very much guys for taking my questions. Wanted to just go back to the choppiness and the top line in the domestic business, obviously as you said a few times, it seems like you know more kind of February and weather specifically. Just wondering was there are a lot of variability that you could see by region? Another way of asking was it basically, the weather and largely February the way to think of it? Or were there any other factors that just might be worth us knowing?
Tom Bené: Yes. I would say nothing that was inconsistent with what you just said. I mean I think we just -- when I talked about weather we saw certain parts of the country where there were more impacts than others, so I wouldn't say nothing else beyond that we saw. 
Vincent Sinisi: Okay. And then just I appreciate the color on the Iowa Premium versus the 3-year plan. But as you had this quarter very nice expense control, just kind of curious more from like a high level perspective like with the buckets that you are getting more the kind of cost of efforts pulled to date, how much kind of lead time or planning is there with some of the levers that you had to pull? Kind of said another way like, kind of how much quarter-by-quarter planning or impact are not -- is there any kind of way to think about that?
Tom Bené: Maybe I'll start and then let Joel chime in. If you think about the way our business operates, we have regular operating expense which is generally built into the businesses that is going to have a primarily consistent cadence depending on volume and our topline being a big driver, right? Just a lot of it is driven by cost per unit. In addition we've talked about vague strategic initiatives like Finance Transformation, like Canada Regionalization, like Smart Spending that we have planned out and we believe we have a good use to win those impacts will be happening. And then we have things like our last quarter when we announced the corporate restructuring. There's more of a onetime event where we would see that coming into the business. So a long way of saying it I think generally speaking our operating expense moves with our business performance meeting our volume. And then -- and certainly the headwinds or tailwinds we see in the business, few are being a great example of headwind we're feeling right now, certainly things like driver and warehouse turnover in the past and just a low employment rates driving higher cost of some of those roles in the company. But everything else is generally planned out and we have visibility to that, except for these one timers. Does that get what you're asking? 
Vincent Sinisi: Yes. That was very helpful. Thank you, Tom.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
John Ivankoe: Hi, thank you. I want to follow-up on your some comments that were made about maybe independent restaurants being a little bit softer in the March quarter. I mean whether we adjust for weather or not. And the context of the question really what I'm getting at is, have you seen a significant rate of openings for independent restaurants? In other words, your addressable customer base maybe over the last 12 months? And considering the amount of labor pressure that independent restaurants are facing and just margins which were in general lower than chains are you actually seeing a pickup in closures on the independent side that's noteworthy even on like a very market-specific basis?
Tom Bené: John good morning. I wouldn't say anything that's unique that's happened there. I mean as you – we all know, in this industry you've got a lot of new business coming online all the time and you also have folks that are closing. I don't -- wouldn't say we have seen any dramatic shift in that area. As I mentioned the different data sources have some mixed information, but all of them generally talk about positive spend dollars being up in that kind of 2.5% to 3.5% range and then you have traffic generally down with the exception of NPD which is showing slight increase in traffic. So, I don't think there's anything unique or anything in this quarter that we've seen as highly different than what we've seen in the past quarters.
John Ivankoe: And is there anything to note by category or by regional that you're beginning to see? And obviously I think there's a lot of questions that are being asked you of whether you think there's a slowdown and I think the answer, at least, as it stands today is no. But when you look at different categories or different regions, is there anything interesting that you're seeing in the marketplace a little bit more detail either positive or negative that you can basically talk about now that gives us I guess somewhat of a forecast of the future from Sysco's perspective as opposed to some of the third-party sources that you use for your data?
Tom Bené: Not really. I mean there's nothing else that I would tell you that we're seeing is any different.
John Ivankoe: Understood. Thank you.
Tom Bené: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania from BMO Capital. Your line is open.
Kelly Bania: Hui, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just going back to expenses, again, it seems like there was a good amount of upside at least in our model on the international. Can we think about the performance this quarter? I think it was down about $30 million year-over-year. Is that kind of the right run rate to think about for the next few quarters international? And then maybe you can tie in just the impact of the corporate restructuring on the expense performance this quarter? 
Joel Grade: Yes, Kelly, I'll start. And I think the answer to that I mean obviously we're continuing to do a lot of work there as to streamlining our operations more efficient. I guess I'd say there is some run rate consistency there, but I would tell you is that, reason a lot of room in -- right now in some of our international business. What I would not necessarily tie it to one of the things we talked about in the past is the sizable transformation we're doing in France. I think the majority of that benefit really we start to see next year, so I would not tie a lot of that necessarily to the restructuring that we're doing in our French business. But I would say generally speaking, I think it's fair to continue to see that as a relative run rate realizing again we just got a lot of moving parts over there that in terms of transformation were doing. So, I guess my answer is generally is yes but again, just realize things are not going to move around quarter-to-quarter based on the amount of stuffs we got moving around that business.
Kelly Bania: Okay, that's helpful. And maybe just in terms of the U.S. Broadline business. Can you talk a little bit about some of the specialty meat and produce, some of the categories that aren't necessarily part of the normal case growth? And what kind of trends you're seeing in those other areas of the U.S. business?
Tom Bené: Sure. This is Tom, Kelly. Good morning. I think we continue to feel really good about our specialty company strategy. As we've talked for a few years we know that our customers truly value Broadline, but they also have these -- oftentimes they can be better met by some specialty companies. And in our case, meat, seafood, poultry, and that side and then the produce with FreshPoint. And so I think we continue to feel really good about overall -- what we bring to the market and the value proposition we have there. We've been working on ways of even helping our customers, to make that easier for them to procure products both from Sysco and from the Sysco specialty companies and we're seeing benefits of that as well. And so, creating the environment where it's easier for them to kind of do business with both of those entities as they need to and as they feel like they want to and so -- versus the feeling, maybe like two or three different companies that they're doing business with, the idea that they can do business with one Sysco and get the value out of that. So we continue to believe that's an important part of the market and we continue to feel really good about the work we're doing there.
Kelly Bania: Thank you.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of the Bob Summers at Buckingham. Your line is open.
Bob Summers: Hey, good morning, guys. So I just wanted to dig a little deeper into the transportation. Your dry van spot rates have been contracting all year. So can you maybe talk about how that flows through in your business, either by talking about the percent of business that you do at the spot rate? Maybe talk about how that spot rate influences contract rates as you may be threatened to move more to the spot market? And then, lastly, how that impacts what you have to pay your drivers.
Tom Bené:  Hey, Bob. Again, getting back to this conversation about transportation and cost, the piece you're referring to is the inbound freight part for us, which does hit our gross margin and we called out in the prepared comment and we've talked a bit here this morning about that we are seeing some year-over-year improvement that have been there. It's not huge and it's not something that is a major driver for us but the market has come down certainly from where it was a year ago and obviously everybody benefits from that. We, obviously, try to minimize the spot market, because when that -- that's the one that gets the most out of whack the fastest and that's what happened a year ago, so we continue to manage that side of our business mostly with contracts. But, yes, it's certainly is that whole market comes down that affects both sides, the spot and contract side. And then as it relates to our drivers, as we said, I think, we've done a lot of work around both recruiting and retention and the way we're operating our business to improve as much as we can our driver retention. And so, we feel better about where we're at than we were year ago. But it continues to be a challenging part of the business and I think will be as long as of the markets the way it is, meaning unemployment's low and there's a lot of freight on the road. So we feel much better where we are now than we were a year ago, but that doesn't mean that we don't still have ongoing challenges associated with hiring and retention of drivers.
Bob Summers: Okay. Thanks.
Tom Bené: You bet.
Operator: That concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-02-04 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to Sysco's Second Quarter Fiscal 2019 Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. We will begin today's call with opening remarks and an introduction. I would like to turn the call over to Neil Russell, Vice President of Investor Relations, Communications and Treasurer. You may begin, sir.

To ensure that we have sufficient time to answer all questions, we'd like to ask each participant to limit their time today to one question and one follow-up. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Bené.
Tom Bené: Good morning, everyone, and thank you as always for joining us. I'd like to start this morning with some key themes that drove our results for the quarter, along with some comments on the current macro environment we are operating in, followed by a discussion of recent organizational changes, then continuing with our U.S. Foodservice Operations business results, and concluding with a discussion of our International and Other business segment. Joel will then discuss the financial results in more detail. For the second quarter, we saw improved year-over-year top-line results and are continuing to execute on our strategic priorities designed to improve our overall performance. Our focus for the quarter was led by our efforts to enrich customers' experience of doing business with Sysco and to consistently provide excellent service, help our customers to be successful. We remain committed to achieving our three-year plan financial objectives. Although the manner in which we achieve them may look slightly different from what we originally outlined. Joel will discuss this further in just a few moments. Our results for the second quarter include: a sales increase of 2.5% to $14.8 billion; gross profit growth of 2.7% to $2.8 billion; and adjusted operating expense growth of 2.1%, which delivered an adjusted operating income increase of 4.8% to $603.3 million; and an adjusted earnings per share decrease of $0.03 per share to $0.75. Local case volume was solid within U.S. Broadline operations, growing 3.3%, of which 2.4% was organic. Total case volume within U.S. Broadline grew 2.9%, of which 2% was organic, with local growth outpacing national this quarter. As previously discussed, we expected overall softer volume this quarter due to lapping of the HFM acquisition and the lapping of two large national customers. Looking at broader economic and industry trends, and as we think about the key drivers in foodservice and the segments in which we operate, there are number of factors which are important in the overall macro environment, including consumer confidence and discretionary spending. Even with the recent somewhat volatile financial markets, we continue to see U.S. consumer confidence remaining fairly strong, driven by the solid labor market with unemployment remaining low at 3.9% as of December, which is normally a good indicator of that higher consumer confidence. In the restaurant industry, we continue to see sales growth, particularly in same store sales, though traffic continues to be mixed. And lastly, from international economic outlook perspective, it's mixed where we do business. In the UK, the consumer is still dealing with uncertainty and concerns over Brexit next step. However, this is balanced with some strength in other geographies. And generally speaking, we are seeing decent consumer spending and overall industry trends in the other international markets where we do business. Turning to the topic of M&A, M&A continues to be an important part of our strategy for growth. Last week, two new acquisitions were made public: one in the U.S., Waugh Foods; and one in Ireland, Classic Drinks. Though these are examples of smaller transactions, especially compared to the size of total Sysco, these acquisitions are great examples of our M&A strategy. Waugh Foods is a Central Illinois distributor with the overwhelming majority of its business with independent restaurants. And Classic Drinks is an established specialized wine and spirits distributor, which will further strengthen our existing product portfolio in our Ireland business. I'd like to now transition to some organizational and leadership changes that we recently announced. In order to drive continued growth and to create value for all Sysco stakeholders, we implemented organizational and executive leadership changes, which will further align the company with its customer first operating model and streamline the business. These changes will help us increase agility, reduce costs, and accelerate decision making across the business by getting closer to our customers and better aligning our resources to support and address their evolving needs. Additionally, this reorganization results in an approximate 10% reduction in salaried corporate support positions. And while any decision which impacts our associates is a difficult one, this is an essential step to realign the organization and sharpen our focus on the company's key strategies to enable growth. Now, I'd like to transition to our second quarter results by business segment beginning with U.S. Foodservice Operations. Sales for the second quarter were $10.1 billion, an increase of 4.2%. Gross profit grew 4.5%. Operating expenses grew 4.7%. And operating income increased 4.2%. Inflation during the first 2 months of the quarter remained relatively flat, but increased towards the end of the quarter contributing to the total gross profit dollar growth. Overall gross profit growth was also positively impacted by an increase in case growth, a reduction in spot market usage of inbound freight, continued growth in Sysco brand, which was up 59 basis points in our local segment versus prior year, benefiting from our ongoing category management initiatives and our Cutting Edge Solutions innovation platform. Our Cutting Edge Solutions continue to provide value-added products for our customers. We are excited about our next launch for these innovative new products that will be taking place in a couple of weeks, which we also believe could be our best yet. Also of note, we continue to see an increase in the utilization of our digital ordering platform, which has improved over 50% of local cases ordered. Additionally, we continue to make progress on improving our customer-facing tools, including a refreshed delivery app and improvements to our digital shopping platform. From an expense perspective, operating expenses grew for the quarter, driven primarily by continued supply-chain cost increases in both the warehouse and transportation areas. While we have seen increased cost in these areas in recent quarters, we continue to remain focused on better managing and mitigating these costs. As an example, we continue to focus on specialized recruiting, training and onboarding efforts. We are starting to see an improvement in retention, especially in the warehouse. Moving on to our International Foodservice Operations for the quarter, sales increased 0.8%, gross profit decreased 1.6%, adjusted operating expenses decreased by 2.6%. And adjusted operating income grew 5.1%. In our International segment, from a top-line perspective, we saw improved performance in Canada, with strong sales growth year-over-year, despite some softness in Alberta. In the UK, top-line performance for the quarter was impacted by continued uncertainties surrounding Brexit and our business in France was impacted by the Yellow Vests protest during the critical holiday timeframe. From a cost perspective, in our International segment, we had some supply chain challenges in the UK, as we onboarded several new customers to the business. In Ireland, the team continues to execute strongly against our integration initiatives. And as a result, synergies in the merger of Brakes Ireland and Pallas are ahead of schedule. Our integration of Brake France and Davigel into Sysco France is not only progressing well, but we launched our new Sysco France brand to the French market last week at the SIRHA World Hospitality and Food Service event in Lyon. This is an important step to building on our position as a leading European food service provider. As we have also discussed, in Europe, we have accelerated the investments we are making related to our long-term strategic growth plans, which are designed to enrich the customer experience and position us well in these markets. Joe will discuss this point further in a moment and its impact our Certain Items this quarter. Moving on to SYGMA, performance for the quarter was down as we continue to optimize our business in this industry segment and we remain focused on improving our overall operational performance. We expect to see continued softness in the top-line as we make disciplined choices in an effort to improve profitability for the long term. And lastly, in our other business segment, Guest Supply had strong top-line performance during the quarter, with increased sales of 8.3% and increased gross profit of 5.2%, though cost continue to be a challenge due to continued impact of tariffs, product availability and the increased cost of shipping products to our customers. Overall, we are pleased with our performance in the hospitality segment and remain excited about the long-term potential for this business. In summary, overall, the fundamentals in our industry and in our business remained solid. We plan to continue to deliver against our strategic priorities to provide an improved customer experience, excellent customer service and strong operating performance. And finally, I'd like to thank our dedicated associates across the company for all of their efforts to make Sysco a distributor of choice for our customers and the leader in the food service industry. Now, I'll turn the call over to Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer.
Joel Grade: Thank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone. I would like to provide you with additional financial details surrounding our performance for the quarter. As Tom noted for the second quarter for total Sysco sales were $14.8 billion, an increase of 2.5% compared to the same period last year. Changes in foreign exchange rates decreased sales by 0.7%. Gross profit in the second quarter increased 2.7% and gross margin increased 4 basis points. During the quarter, particularly in December, in our U.S. Broadline business, we experienced 1.4% inflation, driven by a few categories, primarily frozen potato, meat, paper and produce. Adjusted operating expenses for total Sysco were up 2.1% for the quarter, with regard to the leverage of operating expense growth, gross profit dollar growth our performance was in line with our expectations. While we did improved performance compared to the first quarter of this fiscal year. We remain focused on improving this trend to the third quarter, the second half of the year and for the remainder of the three year plan. Total adjusted operating income was $603.3 million in the quarter, an increase of 4.8% compared to the same period last year. Changes in foreign exchange rates decreased adjusted operating income by 48 basis points. We previously discussed transformative initiatives that we have in place, which will allow us to continue to grow our business and capitalized on our strong fundamentals. As we continue to evolve as a company, we are placing further emphasis on the holistic assessment of our work in order to effectively centralize and standardize our business, including by leveraging technology and strengthening Sysco overall. We'll continue to focus on strong implementation and execution, while accelerating some of this work, all of which provides us with confidence to achieve our financial objectives. As a reminder, we're expecting to see increased cost savings benefit from this initiative in the second half of this fiscal year. Some of these initiatives include: first, our Finance Transformation Roadmap. This important work is about modernizing our global financial platform, starting mostly within our U.S. operations. We're centralizing activities, automating work and working with offshore partners where the transactional work can be done more efficiently and cost effectively. Changes have begun and we expect to see the benefits in the second half of this fiscal year. The second area focus is our Smart Spending initiatives. Here, we take a detailed and accelerated view of indirect spending categories to identify and execute on cost reductions in these areas. Again, we anticipate benefits being realized in the second half of the fiscal year. In our Canadian Regionalization, this work is about optimizing the leadership and overall structure of our Canadian business, which historically has been highly decentralize. We have good opportunities here and feel great about the progress we've made thus far. And finally regarding overall administrative expenses. We continue to aggressively look for new and innovative ways to drive cost out of the business, which aligned with our transformative efforts to drive growth. Areas that are not only in line with our three-year plan objectives, but also either accelerate some initiatives or our incremental to the original plan. An example will be the changes we discussed earlier regarding the new streamline organizational and business unit structure. Turning to earnings per share. Our adjusted EPS for the quarter decreased $0.03 to $0.75 per share. Our EPS results this quarter were impacted by our tax rate. As a reminder, in the second quarter fiscal 2018, we saw retroactive benefit back to the beginning of our fiscal year in FY 2018 due to the adoption of reduced tax rates in the U.S., while U.S. tax rates are lower in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018. The retroactive benefit created a larger benefit in the second quarter of our fiscal 2018 as compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Our EPS results this quarter were also impacted by increased interest expense, which is higher than the same period last year due to variable rate changes, and less stock option exercises than in the prior year. I would also like to remind you that we anticipate our effective tax rate for this fiscal year to be 25%. I would like to take a minute now to talk about, why we had a large amount of Certain Item in this quarter. We continue making investments in our business related to our strategic plans designed a position us for long-term growth. Our Certain Items in the second quarter are primarily related to these initiatives including the integration of our businesses in France and Ireland, European multi-temperature investments, our Finance Transformation Roadmap and Canadian Regionalization. The largest in the Certain Items is related to the restructuring of our France business, which included significant severance. As we've discussed with the France restructuring, we are integrating our Brake France and Davigel businesses in to Sysco France. The merger of these two businesses will position us well for continued success in the French marketplace. And we expect to see benefit from this initiative in our France business beginning in fiscal 2020. Additionally as we have stated, we anticipate seeing benefit from our Finance Transformation Roadmap and Canadian Regionalization initiatives in the second half of this fiscal year. Now turning to cash flow. Cash flow from operations was $917.8 million for the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2019, which was $15.4 million lower compared to the prior year period. Free cash flow for the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2019 was $700.9 million, which was $22.4 million higher compared to the prior year. The improvement in free cash flow was due primarily to continued improvements in payables and receivables. As a reminder in the second quarter fiscal 2018, we deferred cash tax payments due to flood relief associated through Hurricane Harvey, so this is impacting our year-over-year comparison. Net capital expenditures totaled $216.9 million for the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2019, which was $37.8 million lower compared to the prior year period. In summary, we saw improved results for the second quarter and we remain focused on supporting our customers and executing our business initiatives to achieve our objectives. At this point, we are halfway through our three-year plan and an increase adjusted operating income by $241 million. We are committed to achieving our goals, and as always we are committed to performing consistently on a high level to achieve customer satisfaction and solidify our industry-leading position. Operator, we are now ready for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Karen Short with Barclays.
Karen Short: Hi, thanks. Just to clarify a couple of things, so as we look at the percent of savings coming from gross profit dollars versus OpEx, it does seem that it will be much more skewed to OpEx now with these layoffs. Can you maybe just give an update on how to think about that?
Tom Bené: Yeah, hi, Karen. So I would say it's somewhat more than we kind of - I wouldn't call it dramatically more. But again, just –if you think about it, the first half of this three-year plan, for the most part we've had relatively flat levels of inflation. Certainly some of the challenges we've had in supply chain. So I guess, I would just say that some of the - there is a bit more emphasis on some of the administrative cost reductions. But, again, as we've seen little bit of inflation returning and certainly - obviously, continue to work to mitigate some of the challenges on the supply chain side. Again, I would say somewhat more focused, but again, I wouldn't say we're really dramatically shifting, we talked about it earlier.
Joel Grade: And, Karen, I might just add. I mean, I think if you think about it as - we really have two big buckets, you had gross profit and you had cost. And what we're really talking about and what we've been sharing is that our supply chain costs have been higher over the last few quarters. So we're having to balance that still on the cost side. So it's kind of - cost and gross profit isn't the big shift. It's really more between some of the cost buckets that we're really focusing on.
Karen Short: Okay, but just for modeling purposes, to clarify, when I look at the corporate number, it's fair to say that that only included the benefit of the corporate layer or the supply chain - sorry, shared services for one month out of the three in the quarter, right? So going forward as we model corporate that number should be quite a bit lower?
Tom Bené: Yeah, so it would not have included any of that at this point, so there will be some impact on corporate expenses moving forward, yes.
Karen Short: Okay. And then, just my follow-up is I was curious if local organic case growth internally was in line with plan. And I know you said the kind of quarter was in general, but only asking, because you actually don't no longer have a slide highlighting case growth and you guys kind of had that slide in the past, so any color on that would be great.
Tom Bené: Let's look back on that slide. I'm not sure about that. But the - as far as the local case growth, I think we feel really good about the case growth. I think there was a little bit of choppiness in the quarter. It kind of came back little stronger towards the end, which is we feel good about. But I would say it was maybe a little less than we had planned but not dramatically different.
Karen Short: Great. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.
John Heinbockel: Hey, guys. Tom, maybe a quick question, could you maybe walk through some of the changes you made here on the organizational side, because they sound more operational? So what happened in terms of chain of command - span of control, layers of management? How do you go to market differently because of this and then how do you guard against any adverse impact on your customer?
Tom Bené: Great question, John, thanks. So let's start with, the changes we made were in fact around kind of streamlining the business. And when you think about spans and layers was the key focus, very focused in corporate. And so, when you think about impact to our customers or to our selling organization, or to our growth plans, little to none. I mean, that's not where the focus was. This is really about how do we kind of improve kind of the agility of this organization, our ability to make decisions more quickly. And so, it's heavily focused on corporate office. And as you probably saw or heard, there were a couple of changes with my leadership team. So the headline here is, mostly kind of the spans and layers exercise in areas where we felt like we could remove some cost and maybe some redundancy and candidly get us more focused on the key priorities we got and then we've outlined to you all. From a leadership perspective, there were a couple of changes that are probably worth highlighting. One is that we've been going through some work within our technology area. We've got a kind of an innovation technology group and we've got a core traditional technology group. And we're looking at how we bring those two organizations closer together. And we've been doing some work around that. And as we continue that work, we will continue to make some adjustments. And so, what you saw there was a change taking place within the kind of traditional IT area. The great news for us is we've got a deep bench here. We feel very good about the team we've got and the work we're doing. And so I don't think you should expect and we certainly don't expect to miss a beat with our technology efforts. The other thing is there were some - think about it in the administration area, we had a role that was kind of an administrative role. It was a combination of a lot of other things that as a company we have tucked under that role over the last couple of years, think about CSR, think about even some of our communications work. And so, we felt like there was an opportunity here to streamline that work and that organization. And so, we obviously - we placed the important part of that role, which was the Chief Legal Officer. And we promoted a talented woman named Eve McFadden here at Sysco, who is now our new Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary. And so, again, really no impact there, I think from an overall business perspective or certainly from any of our customers or our strategic focus. And so, those are probably the largest changes that are worth highlighting.
Joel Grade: Yeah, and if I could just add one thing and just to reiterate something Tom said, yeah, John, none of these were cost changes that were in any way inconsistent. We're not saying costs out that are actually supporting growth. So I think that's really an important point here that there is work been done to streamline and tighten the connection between our customers and our selves. But this is certainly nothing done that's going to impact growth.
John Heinbockel: And then one last thing, if you - and if you look at the step-up in inflation, right, you saw in December, and it's not clear if that's going to continue. But let's assume it does. How do feel about pass-through right now, right, relative to all the other cost pressures your customers are seeing? Maybe compared to the past, do you think you can pass it through as you have in the past or maybe it's a little more challenging?
Tom Bené: Yeah, I don't think we've seen really a big change there. I think, look, as we've always said, too much inflation is hard to pass through, but as long as it remains at kind of this modest level, I think we still feel very good about our ability to do that. Clearly, we've got lots of tools in our tool-belt here including Sysco brand, which we continue to talk a lot about. But it's driving really good performance. I think it was 59 basis points we talked about this quarter. And again, we've just kind of seen that ongoing benefit that we get from Sysco brand. And that, again, helps our customers a lot. It generally provides them some value and, obviously, it's good for us as well.
John Heinbockel: Okay, thank you.
Tom Bené: You bet.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Vincent Sinisi with Morgan Stanley.
Vincent Sinisi: Hey, great. Thanks very much for taking my question, guys. Just wanted to follow-up on the headcount reductions. Can you just kind of give us maybe a little bit more color on how does that fit into kind of the grand scheme of the cost cutting initiatives, especially as we go through the next couple of years here? Is it fair to say that's kind of the largest bucket among them and other ones that might be worth noting in terms of progress?
Tom Bené: So let me start and I'll let Joel talk here too. And I think it's important to go back to the things we've been consistently talking about. So certainly cost is an important part of us delivering the three-year plan. And as we continue to talk, I mean, the balance of that cost may be slightly different than we initially had talked about, primarily between the supply chain area because that area has been increasing and the administrative cost side. But this recent action is really about maintaining the focus that we talked about on cost broadly. Yes, it was focused on administrative side of this. But I wouldn't say that this is a large part of the overall. When you think about the plans we had over the 3 years, all of these areas need to work together. And this is just one piece of that, that overall puzzle, in addition to the big buckets that Joel also has mentioned numerous times. So with that, I'll let Joel kind of build on that.
Joel Grade: Yeah, I think the only thing I'd add, Vinnie, is this - we talked about the fact that we've had some of these initiatives that we have that were multiyear in scope. And in some cases, some benefits are being able to be accelerated on those. And then in some cases there are also things that we looked at that were outside of the main scope of those. And this would be one of those things. And so, in other words as we sort of thought about and some of the things we talked about at overall cost discussions this will be one of those things that would be incremental to that. And so, anyways, that's the way I would think about it. And again, just - again, as a reminder, there is obviously still a very large part of this benefit that we're looking is to get from our gross profit dollar growth as well. So I mean, this is - I still consider it as a very balanced approach, with just some further acceleration of those things. And again, some of these things that - like that were incremental to the additional plans that we laid out.
Vincent Sinisi: Okay. That's helpful guys. Thank you. And then maybe just a quick follow-up comment. I think you said in your prepared remarks that you had a reduction in spot market usage. Can you guys just give us a quick update on transportation, freight cost, kind of where you are on a sequential basis and how you're able to be better managing through?
Tom Bené: Yeah, if think about that comment, it's very specific to inbound freight. And if you think about a year ago when we really hit - I think in this quarter had a big increase in that spot market utilization because of the tight market hit and everyone was scrambling. We got - like probably everybody we got kind of pushed to the spot market. We just done as we talk for the last really four quarters a much better job of managing that. And so as we went into this year, it's that overlap that I'm really referring to that was down. So I think we talked about this last quarter. I'd say the inbound freight is kind of the new normal. It's higher than it was certainly a year ago, kind of spread out over a year. But year over year for the quarter we saw some benefit just because that's when we took the biggest impact last year.
Vincent Sinisi: Got it. All right, that's super helpful. Thanks very much guys. Good luck.
Tom Bené: Yeah, thanks.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Judah Frommer with Crédit Suisse.
Judah Frommer: Hi, thanks for taking the question guys. Maybe first just on the independent case growth commentary. I think it's been a while that you've been talking about same store sales being flattish to positive and traffic being more mixed. And kind of at what point do you get concerned about the trajectory of that independent business? And can you talk about those very small one and two store independents versus the chains that you've been talking about more recently?
Tom Bené: Yeah, good morning, Judah. I think, we continue to feel good about the mix of our business. We've talked over the last couple of quarters about this kind of regional change or this kind of micro changes are growing and that continues, and I think we still feel good about our position there, because of the value proposition that we have for those customers. We think about the true independents, the ones you're talking about this kind of one- and two-unit kind of operators. Look, we continue to see as we said a decent growth there. Now it is very much driven by the outlet and the type of the business that they're running and the experience they are providing. But generally speaking we still feel good about that. So I think, there - and as you've heard us talk a lot and I won't overdo it on the - this market is still very fragmented. So the acquisitions were good example, even - while Waugh is a fairly small acquisition relative to Sysco's size, it's a great example of where there are a lot of really good regional distributors out there, who are still doing good business and are a good fit. And so those guys are heavily independent driven and it's a great example of how we can leverage some great work and a great organization that they have with Sysco and the capabilities we bring. So long-winded way of saying, look, I think, we still feel really good about our position, our growth and certainly our prospects given the marketplace that we operate in.
Judah Frommer: Okay, great. And then, maybe just quickly, if we kind of rewind to Q1, I would say there was some combination of warehouse labor pressure and flattish inflation causing some consternation on your part that hitting the midpoint of 2020 guidance would be tougher against that backdrop. Would you saying that we fast forward to Q2 and kind of the exit rates there, that was kind of the offset in operating expense and inflation kind of re-ramping that, you do feel better about those 2020 targets than you did 3.5 months ago?
Tom Bené: Well, I think, we feel good about the 2020 targets are long. So I think, what we've talked about is some shifting of how we might deliver that. But we have consistently said, we feel good about our ability to deliver this three-year plan and we still feel very comfortable about that.
Joel Grade: Yeah, Judah, I think, we just - we called out a couple of things that we've - since we've said are causing us to continue to accelerate some other things, because we're certainly not just sitting on our laurels, and saying inflation is low in the supply chain side. Obviously, we're going after some of that stuff. But I think, we've been pretty consistent in saying - in expressing our confidence in achieving our targets.
Judah Frommer: Great. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Marisa Sullivan with Bank of America.
Marisa Sullivan: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about cost savings. As some of the initiatives that you've been talked about kind of roll in and kick in the back half. Do you think that you'll get back to that longer term 150 basis points gap between gross profit dollar and OpEx growth in 3Q? Or is that more of a - will that take more time to get you back to that long-term level?
Joel Grade: Hey, Marisa, it's Joel. Yeah. So the way I would think about that, obviously, we don't give the type of quarterly guidance, but what I would say is that again, as we continue to express confidence in our - achieving our three-year targets. And as mathematically would be necessary in order to get back to or exceed that rate over the next six quarters. I would think about that way. Again, we've talked about the fact that our second half of this fiscal year, we believe, we'll ramp in some of those areas and including that gap. So again, I'm not giving specific guidance, I would just tell you that we continue to express that confidence, and I'd say mathematically that would certainly have to be the case over the course of those six quarters.
Marisa Sullivan: Got you. And then on the corporate reductions that you've announced this morning. When did they kick in? How quickly did they roll on to the P&L? And is there more room to go and you have to kind of find more incremental pockets to get to maybe back to that mid- to higher-end of the EBIT improvement range?
Joel Grade: So why don't I start here? I mean, so I think the question when does it start to kick in that will be in the third quarter. And so you'll start to see some of those benefits in Q3 and again over the second half of the fiscal year. I guess, the other thing I would say, and again certainly, Tom could chime in here; we're always continually looking for ways to do this. Again, we often get asked, hey, we've got this sort of key initiatives we've laid out. Are there other things you're doing? And then again, that's our job to always look for different opportunities. And so we'll certainly continue to do that. But hopefully, that gives you some clarity on the timing.
Tom Bené: Yeah, Marisa, I think that's well said. I mean, I think this - anytime you take an action like this, it's difficult for the associates involved and we take that very seriously here. But I think at the same time, it is our responsibility to be constantly looking for ways to optimize this business, and improve the overall experience our customers are doing business with us, and we're going to continue to do that as an organization, and we'll have to - time will tell whether or not some of those things need to be accelerate or not, but we feel really good about the plans we have in place right now.
Joel Grade: Yeah. And I think the only thing I'd just - again, not to sound like a broken record here, but again, these are not - again, we are not taking cost out of things that are actually facilitating growth in our company. And so I think that's just really important. We continue to invest in this company, we continue to ensure that we're investing in the right places to grow, and we also continue to look for opportunities to streamline. I just think, it's important to make sure that message is loud and clear.
Marisa Sullivan: Thanks. Super helpful.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital.
Kelly Bania: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just going back to the workforce reduction, I guess, two questions. One, can you just talk about the size of the impact of that on a dollar standpoint on an annualized basis? And then, I just to clarify was this always part of the three-year plan or was there any change into the size of the structure of it? Or was it just pulled forward in terms of timing relative to your original expectations?
Joel Grade: Hey, Kelly, thanks for the question. Yeah. So no, this is - first of all, a couple of things on that. We've been actually given the dollar amount, the dollar magnitude of that. We didn't talk about certain - 10% of the positions in corporate support, but we have not given that dollar amount. The question - and so again, as I mentioned in my remarks, this - I would characterize this as one of those things that are incremental as some of the stuff that we actually talked about as part of our plan. It's sort of fall in one of those categories we often get the question, hey, what else are you guys going? This would be one of those things. And so this would not have fallen into one of the things we talked about specifically in our Investor Day or key initiatives that we often talk about.
Kelly Bania: Okay. Perfect. And then in terms of the inflation, it sounded like that started really in the latter part of the quarter? Just curious is that has continued into January and what maybe you're expecting for the back half in terms of inflation in your plan?
Joel Grade: Yeah, I would say, Kelly, at this point, that has continued. And I think our expectation is that called modest levels of inflation here over the next couple of quarters.
Kelly Bania: Okay, great. And maybe just a bigger picture on then, as you look at your competitive set, obviously, the big three of about one-third of the share. But just curious what you're seeing from that other two-thirds in this regional distributors, you talked about some of them performing well with independents or catering to the independents well. But are you seeing any changes in behavior or strategy with those group of distributors that we don't really get to hear from on a regular basis?
Tom Bené: Hey, Kelly, this is Tom. I don't think, we really - I mean, it remains very competitive, obviously, out there. And when we talked about this fair amount, but as you know, the big kind of the public three, while, that's very visible to everyone, there are very good and very capable regional distributors in this business, and many of them. But there are some fairly large ones as well on a regional basis that we all compete with. And I would say that they have always been good competition and they continue to be. But I don't think we've seen anything kind of new or different from them or just dramatically change, so highly competitive, but there are certainly a lot of good companies out there in this industry.
Kelly Bania: Thanks.
Tom Bené: You bet.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs.
Karen Holthouse: Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Just on the inflation commentary. So it was pretty flat in the first two months, and then you ended up a little bit ahead of 1% for the quarter really just driven by December. With that just the math would imply that you are running north of 4% probably in December? Is that the right way to think about it? And - is that how to think about the run rate into the third quarter? Or were there really some parts of that that you would view as more temporary? Thanks.
Joel Grade: Yeah. So - Karen, it's Joel. We - first of all, I'd say were slightly inflationary or again over the first couple of months, so I wouldn't say we're flat. And for that was - the math for us doesn't apply 4% over the December. So it certainly implied some acceleration in December, as I mentioned. Some of that inflation, again, it's carried over into the third quarter. And we anticipate, again, modest levels of inflation as we head in the second half of the year. But I would not anticipate 4% inflation heading into the second half of the year.
Karen Holthouse: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of John Ivankoe with J.P. Morgan.
John Ivankoe: Hi, thank you. First, I wanted to get back to some of the prepared remarks about the industry, which I think were - you're discussing the expectation of same store sales growth, but traffic being mixed. Can you elaborate on what sectors that you're seeing in terms of that are participating in this overall economic growth and maybe how you're positioning towards the better sectors and less towards the slower even negative sectors might be changing over the next couple of years? And then I'll have a follow up as well.
Tom Bené: Sure. I mean, if you think about - we've talked a lot about the various sectors over the years, and if you think about the restaurants obviously being the largest segment of this industry and of the market. Let's start there, but I think, we talk about the traffic and the spend, it's highly variable. So if you think about it from a NPD perspective, the total traffic during the last - during this last timeframe was basically up slightly, and the spend was up about 3%. QSR was driving the majority of that midscale, they call midscale dining traffic was down about 2% and spend was up about 1%. And then casual was also traffic was down and the spend was up. So it's kind of mix, if you think about the various segments within the restaurant. As we've also talked a lot about though, we participate in lots of different segments. We continue to see growth opportunities in places like healthcare and certainly education, retail sector continues to be a growing Foodservice segment. And so there continues to be lots of areas of growth out there. And we've also talked and it's been a focus for us for a few years now, but it continues to be is the ethnic segments within restaurants continue to see growth. And depending on that's somewhat maybe more a little more geographic based, but we see solid growth in certain ethnic segments as well.
John Ivankoe: Okay, helpful I wanted to see if there was maybe a change of tone in anyway regarding your comments and it sounds like it's more consistent. The next question if I can sneak another one in before the final one, digital ordering now at 50% of local case growth order that would suggest maybe you were at some type of a tipping point. Obviously, the marketing associates are doing less ordering and they're doing a lot more servicing or adding value to their customers. Could you remind us whether we're now at the point where the level of marketing associates is relatively stable, despite the expectation of local case growth or maybe we can get to a point where the best marketing associates can serve more clients and just be more overall profit additive to the corporation?
Tom Bené: Sure, John. That's a good question. So we've actually been over 50% for a few quarters now, but we have kind of hit this - it is a - I think it's an important question, because it's a good percentage of our business that is online. And remember this is the local business we're talking about our national or contract business a lot higher portion of that is actually done online or through things like EDI. But within this local segment, about the same time a year ago, we also talked about we were adding some marketing associates. We've kind of gotten through that addition and we felt like that was really important at the time, because we had now had some tools available to us that were enabling us to target where those resources could go. Think about that is, where we had some bigger share gaps or share opportunities. And once we identified that we wanted to make sure we were focused there. As we think about it today, given that percentage of ordering, given some of the additional tools we continue to provide our customers and our organization. I do think we're in a place where we're somewhat stable from a selling resource perspective. We are seeing larger territories, we think that's a good thing. But we aren't looking at this as a way to dramatically reduce or change our selling resources. We continue to believe they're a very, very important part of our model. And we know from our customer feedback that they are highly valued. So it's really about continuing to give them more tools to help them be more effective, and obviously more consultative, but also making sure that our customers have the opportunity to do business with us the way they want to, which has been also our focus in our model.
John Ivankoe: Great. Thank you for that. And then the final question, the acquisition of wine - excuse me, of Classic Drinks, which does wine and spirits in Ireland. Is that - that segment, is that a one-off for you? Obviously the U.S. has, especially even on a per-state basis, have a lot of unique challenges in terms of wine and spirits distribution. But is that a unique-to-Ireland type of business segment for you? Or might there be other types of applications in your geographies around the world in that type of segment?
Tom Bené: I would say it's a little more unique to Ireland or maybe some of the parts of Europe. In Ireland, we had a small - we sold a small amount of Wine and Spirits. In that market, in particular, the competitive set - wine and spirits is a big part of the competitive set. So the Classic Drinks acquisition really puts us in a great spot to compete more broadly in that overall market. And so I'd say it is a little more unique, they don't have nearly the kind of the state-by-state laws that we have here in the U.S., and so it's - I'd say, at this point, think about it as something that's appropriate for that market, but not something that is a strategic shift for Sysco.
John Ivankoe: Thank you.
Tom Bené: You bet.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo.
Edward Kelly: Hi, guys, good morning.
Tom Bené: Good morning.
Edward Kelly: I wanted to start off with a question on gross profit per case. Your gross profit dollars exceeded case growth in U.S. Broadlines again after really kind of, I guess, stalling over the last couple of quarters, so obviously encouraging. I would imagine that this is re-inflation, normalization of inbound freight, better local mix. I mean, all things that are good for you and the industry, obviously. Is there anything else in here that was driving that and should we expect that to continue going forward?
Joel Grade: Yeah. I think - Ed, this is Joel. I think the other thing you probably - I think, you summarized it pretty well. The only thing I might add is the - our brand growth. Again, that's something 59 percentage points up again in our local brand sales this quarter. So I mean, I think that's - I'd say that's one other area that's certainly strongly impacting that. And so I think you're right, I mean, again some of the few other things that you did talk about, again to Tom's point, the inbound freight piece was a little bit of an overlap issue, I'd call it that - if you recall a year ago, we were talking about, it was a fairly sizable impact for us. So there's probably some heavier - a little bit of heavier influence from that, but broadly speaking, I think the mix, the brand, the more inflation and again some normalizing some of the impacts we had on the inbound freight, I think it's certainly a fair way to look at that.
Edward Kelly: All right. And then just on the OpEx side, the growth in OpEx moderated a bit from Q1, but still reasonably high, and obviously, that's warehouse labor and driver pay. Just thoughts on where you are in terms of having to raise wages on both of those sides and how are you thinking about the necessity of future wage increases? Just any thoughts on whether things are settling down at all there for you?
Tom Bené: Hey, Ed. I think, what's happening is we are kind of at a new level we talked about it on the inbound side, and certainly, I'd say on some of the internal operating expenses. Having said that, so I don't think we were necessarily anticipating any larger significant cost like hourly increases that are going to dramatically change the OpEx going forward. Where we're really focused on is how do we go after some of those big cost buckets that drive the expense. And so for - in this business, as you all know, there are things like miles driven, there are things like cases per mile. So the efficiencies that we can drive that really impact the cost or the things that we're trying to focus on, and we've got a couple initiatives that we feel early days are helping us and performing well. We've talked about small delivery vehicles a bit in the past. We think that that's a mitigating factor in the fact that we can bring in kind of non-CDL drivers in that environment and deliver those cases at a lower cost per case. So we're trying to do a lot of those things that ultimately help the overall cost, the operating expense, if you will, more broadly on a sustainable basis knowing that we do have higher wage rates than we did in the past, and then we'll probably continue to see that going forward. But I don't think it's a new spike that's coming in front of us, I think it's more - we've now kind of hit that number and we are now just trying to manage the overall utilization of our headcount and our resources.
Joel Grade: I think if I can add one thing to that also is just the - again, part of our challenge we are having was some of the retention of some of the newly hired associates. And so, I think it was which is then driving over time, which is then driving other things that are little bit lower productivity. And so, I think some where we're also making significant emphasis on in terms of our hiring, our training, our onboarding processes to ensure that we do have a better retention rate with some of the hiring, both on the driver and the warehouse side, that I think - and again, I think to Tom's point, I agree. I think it's leveled out somewhat, but certainly not in a position to really say we're past the issue.
Edward Kelly: And, Joel, just one quick one for you on the tax rate, when you say the full year tax rate at 25%, I think the adjusted tax rate in the first half is lower than that. How should we think about the back-half tax rate? I guess that's what I'm asking you.
Joel Grade: Yeah, I would just look at the whole - about a 25% run rate would be the way I would think about that.
Edward Kelly: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Ajay Jain with Pivotal Research.
Ajay Jain: Yeah, hi, good morning. Thanks for sneaking me in. On the cost cutting that you've just announced, it sounds like those initiatives are mostly focused on U.S. operations. So I don't know if there's any international component for the headcount reductions. But can you give any additional geographic breakdown on the latest cost cutting initiatives? And then, within the U.S., what's the relative breakdown of the cost cuts between regional operating companies and corporate?
Joel Grade: Sure, so I'll start here. So the discussions we had regarding the cost cuts here was - it was exclusively focused in our U.S. business and really on our corporate office and on corporate support. So I think this was not a, what I'll call, the U.S. field-related. It was again - it was really specifically in our U.S., and corporate and support operations. So I think the - some of them we did talk about on a few of the certain items was related to, again, some of the infrastructure changes we had in bringing our businesses together in France. But what you're specifically asking about is U.S. related only.
Ajay Jain: Okay. And I know you didn't want to provide a dollar amount for the cost savings in response to an earlier question. But can you at least confirm what you're expecting for overall restructuring charges, that's associated with the layoffs?
Joel Grade: Yeah, Ajay, we haven't given that out. We're not planning to.
Ajay Jain: Okay. Thank you very much.
Joel Grade: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Bob Summers with Buckingham.
Bob Summers: Hey, good morning, guys. You talked about volumes being choppy during the quarter, but coming back toward the end. But any comment on how January was and any impact from the shutdown?
Tom Bené: I don't think we saw much of an impact from the shutdown. I think what I'd say is that we feel good about how the quarter has started. And we feel like it's delivering on the trajectory that we had hoped.
Bob Summers: Okay. And then circling back to the cost saving numbers, when I think about the transformation and the Smart Spending and having second half impact, is it fair to say that you're trying to get us to weight that more toward the fourth quarter?
Joel Grade: I don't know that we've said that, Bob. I mean I think we we've been pretty consistent in saying that we anticipated improvement in the second half of the year. Having said that, that doesn't mean day one in Q3 is like everything happens. And so there is a little bit of a spreading over the third quarter, where things kick in, which I guess would then suggest fourth quarter be a bit stronger. But we've been pretty consistent again as moving through second half. And these things do happen, again, it's a little bit of a ramp over the course of Q3.
Bob Summers: Right, of course. And then, lastly, as I think about all the expense savings that you've articulated and are they sufficient enough to drive the expense growth, say, below 2.5%, which would allow you the opportunity to flex that spread up, which if you think about achieving the plan, at some point you'll have to overachieve on that spread for a couple quarters to get back on track. Is that fair to hold you to that?
Joel Grade: I think it is. And certainly again, we certainly acknowledge that, and again, certainly continue to look for acceleration of opportunities there, but yeah, I think that's fair.
Bob Summers: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Your final question is from the line of Andrew Wolf with Loop Capital Markets.
Andrew Wolf: Thanks and good morning. So the quarter, the U.S. local case growth, I think you face the toughest year ago comparison of this economic cycle if you will. So given the commentary you just made, Tom, that you like how January is and what you said about the macro environment, really, I guess that you got easier comparisons. It shouldn't be too much of a leap of faith for us to get the model somewhat better case growth than you showed this quarter?
Tom Bené: Look, I think I'd start with, and we talked about this prior quarter and we talked about it again here. In the second quarter, we lost some cases from acquisition we did a year ago, HFM, also a couple of large national customers that we lapped. We have another acquisition that we're going to be lapping that we did last year, a larger one than the ones we've done that we're going to be lapping kind of in the third quarter. So I would say, my commentary around the start to this quarter is, it's in line with what we had hoped and what we expected. And so, we feel generally good. Having said that, you guys all know, many of you were living the frozen - where the polar vortex happened a week ago. We saw - we see always things that come up and happen throughout the quarter that we are all happen to deal with. And so, you see little impacts from things like that as well in certain parts of the geography. So I would just say we feel good about the momentum we've had. We feel like we're on the path that we had hoped for. And I don't think there's anything that would necessarily should change your thoughts, your projections one way or another. I think you should - the commentary we've given is we feel good about the back-half, we feel like we can deliver the incremental upside that we've talked about, primarily driven by a lot of the cost activities, and we're feeling pretty good right now.
Joel Grade: The only thing I would add to that, just a slight caveat is, just remember, I mean, our third quarter, our March, March is our big month. In other words, it's so - certainly couple, again, talked about - so Tom said some decent trends coming out of this thing. But, obviously, our Q3 is made or broken to some extent by March, but just as a reminder of that.
Andrew Wolf: Sure. Thank you for both of those comments. And just to close on product cost inflation and talking about how it inflected and we can see those in the numbers, the [governance] [ph] reports as well. Just curious, do your systems and management allow for that to be passed through if possible almost real time, number one? And how about competitively, is there just a normal lag, just a sense that nobody wants to be the first guy to move up prices or do these prices get through pretty much, pass through pretty much as they occur?
Tom Bené: Hey, Andy. I think what I would say to that is that just keep in mind the order of magnitude of these things too. I mean, we always talked about is that this industry, with a couple percent inflation, typically has been historically able to pass those things along. And so, certainly, we continue to feel good about that. And I think - a little bit of a lag, I mean, I don't - if you think about half of our business being contract with some sort of cost plus, there is typically a little bit of lag in terms of when we actually are able to book cost increases and then pass that through. So it's not sort of an immediate thing. And on the - and the local side, again, I would just say in these times of what I call modest inflation, I think we generally feel pretty good about our ability to pass those things through. So I don't know the - I wouldn't call us in a place where we've got some rapidly accelerated inflation. I think we're in a pretty good inflation point and certainly feel pretty good about our ability to do so.
Andrew Wolf: Okay. And if I could, lastly, just on the international gross margin contracting a bit this quarter, sort of a trend, is that still mainly driven out of the UK where the cost inflation you're getting, because of their currency or is it more broad-based?
Tom Bené: It's primarily UK, a little bit also in Mexico, but it's primarily UK.
Andrew Wolf: Okay. Thank you.
Tom Bené: Yeah.
Joel Grade: Thanks.

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Bené.
Tom Bené: Good morning, everyone and thank you as always for joining us. This morning I'll provide an overview of Sysco's first quarter results. Discuss the macro environment that we are currently operating in and walk through our operating performance including key drivers impacting our performance across each of our business segment. I'll then turn the call over to Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer who will discuss our financial results in more detail. Sysco's overall financial results announced this morning reflect improve year-over-year operating performance, driven by a variety of initiatives across each of our four strategic priorities. Due to some temporary headwinds, including decreased inflation across some categories and the impact of Hurricane Florence to hit the southeast late in the quarter, as well as some additional and more persistent operating expense pressures, we had mixed business results across the business. From a top-line perspective, we generated sales of $15.2 billion, a 3.9% increase compared to the same period last year, driven by a very strong US Broadline case growth of 5.7%. But offset by slower growth and our international businesses. Additionally, we saw our gross profit increase by 3.9%. Adjusted operating expense growth of 3.6%; adjusted operating income increased 5.1% and adjusted EPS increased $0.17 to $0.91. Overall, our fundamentals for the quarter were solid and as an organization we remain focused and working closely with our suppliers and customers to deliver discipline, profitable growth to enable the achievement of our long-term objectives. Looking at broader economic and industry trends in the US, overall consumer confidence remains high which is driven healthy consumer spending. During the quarter, according to black box intelligence, the restaurant industry saw improved performance particularly in same store sales growth despite lower same-store traffic. In addition, other data points reflect positive implications for longer-term consumer demand such as faster than anticipated growth in US GDP of 3.5% and the strength in the labor markets, all factors that historically have been positive signs for the foodservice industry. Economic outlet in our international geographies remains somewhat mixed. Canada's economy is performing well and foodservice sales are projected to continue growing. In the UK, GDP and household consumption are both forecasted to grow over the next year, but consumer sentiment remains negative in the market with further closures of restaurants and concerns about the food supply chain being driven by continued Brexit negotiations. The remainder of the European market continues to experience healthy foodservice growth and positive economic conditions due to improving consumer confidence. As it relates to the current operating environment at Sysco and some of the impacts affecting our business, we are seeing cost challenges specifically driven by the tightening labor market in the US and a slowdown in growth in some of our international businesses, which I will address in the various segment results. Given some of these ongoing challenges, we are accelerating our focus on managing our overall costs and having placed multiple initiatives across the business that will drive cost improvement and enhance customer service over the next several quarters. A few of these initiatives include the finance transformation roadmap which we originally discussed at our Investor Day in December. This initiative increased centralization and standardization of our end-to-end global finance processes and workflow, and utilizes digital automation on a more modern finance platform to improve efficiency. This also allows for increased globalization of certain roles, helping to lower our administrative costs. Job changes have recently begun and we expect to see financial benefit from this initiative to ramp up as planned over the next few quarters. Smart spending which is focused on reducing our overall G&A spend by taking a detailed and accelerated look at indirect spend categories to drive productivity and savings. This effort is providing unprecedented visibility, ownership and performance management in all areas of our business. And third, the Canadian regionalization which is focused on streamlining our back-office administrative support for our Canadian operations, while maintaining an acute focuses on our customer. This effort has already commenced and will contribute to increased cost savings as we move forward. I would like to transition now to our first quarter results by business segment beginning with US Foodservice Operations. We are pleased with our top-line result and local case growth but as mentioned we continue to see significant cost challenges. The results are as follows. Sales for the first quarter were $10.4 billion, an increase of 5.6%; gross profit grew 5.2%; operating expenses grew 5.8% and operating income increased 4.3%. As previously mentioned, local case volume was strong within US Broadline Operations growing 5.2% % and is now grown for 18 consecutive quarters. Total case volume within US Broadline Operations grew 5.7% reflecting a mix of both local and national customer growth. As it relates to volume, going forward we expect to see some softening in the year-over-year growth numbers through the annualization of both the HFM and Doerle acquisitions, the annualization of two large national customers added in the prior year and the impact of hurricane Michael. Gross profit grew by 5.2% despite moderating inflation as we continue to see growth in Sysco brand which is up to 47.2 % of local cases. We also continue to see accelerating growth with local emerging concepts also known as micro chains as these unique locations continue to resonate with today's consumers. In fact, the larger portion of our local growth is currently coming from this type of customer. From an expense perspective, operating expense for the quarter grew 5.8% driven by supply chain costs in both the warehouse and transportation including significant overtime expense and cost associated with hiring due to the tight labor market. Additionally, rising fuel prices also contributed to our higher operating expenses for the quarter. We are addressing these challenges by working on the initiatives I mentioned earlier and by continuing to drive productivity putting tighter control in place and how we manage costs, and working with our teams to improve our hiring and training practices to better retain talent in our supply chain operations. Moving on to International Foodservice Operations, we had mixed results for the quarter. Sales increased 0.6%; gross profit grew 0.1% adjusted; adjusted operating expenses were flat and adjusted operating income increased 0.2%. Top line results were softer than expected in Canada after a good second half of fiscal 2018, first quarter sales in Canada lost momentum as year-over-year growth began to moderate. In Europe, performance with a quarter met our expectations and we have a combination of activities impacting our overall performance that includes the rationalization of some customers in the UK as we restructure our operations, along with saturation of restaurants in the market partially driven by the uncertainty surrounding Brexit. In France, we have made significant progress towards the combining of Brake France and Davigel which will enable us to ultimately leverage the size and scale these businesses to deliver accelerated performance as we create Sysco France. And in Latin American businesses, we saw solid performance particularly in our Costa Rica operations which were partially offset by a challenging operating environment in Mexico. From a cost perspective, Canada is experiencing similar cost challenges for our US business in both warehouse and transportation. Additionally, our strategic transformation efforts in Europe continue with the integration of Sysco France progressing well along with the final phase of cost synergies occurring in Ireland as we combine Brakes and Pallas Foods there. Finally, our ongoing investment in multi temperature distribution in the UK is moving forward and will eventually enable us to improve our overall cost structure and customer experience as we reconfigure the supply chain network across the country. Moving on to SYGMA. +The underlying macro cost challenges with both the transportation and warehouse area in the supply chain are also impacting this segment of our business. We continue to take a disciplined approach to growth with our customers and as we have transitioned some business sales modestly decreased during the first quarter. We continue to look for opportunities to improve our value proposition in this important chain restaurant segment, while also looking for synergistic opportunities for growth. Lastly, in other business segment, guests apply also experienced cost challenges due to a combination of tariffs which began to put pressure on certain product categories in the business along with increased cost of shipping products to our customers. Overall, we continue to see top-line growth in the hospitality segment and are working on a variety of activities and initiatives to mitigate some of the increased operating expense associated with this business. In summary, despite some of the challenges we are experiencing related to our operating environment, we delivered improve year-over-year results in our largest segment of the business. Our overall fundamentals are solid and we remain confident in our ability to achieve our three year plan financial objectives. Furthermore, we remain focused on delivering against our strategic priorities, which we believe will serve as our roadmap for additional growth and long- term value creation. Now I'll turn the call over in Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer.
Joel Grade: Thank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone. I would like to provide you with additional financial details surrounding our performance for the quarter. As Tom noted for the first quarter for total Sysco sales were $15.2 billion, an increase of 3.9% compared to the same period last year. Changes in foreign exchange rates decreased sales by 24%. Gross profit in the first quarter increased 3.9% and gross margin increased two basis points in part due to a year-over-year decline in inflation primarily driven by deflation in the meat, poultry and produce categories. Adjusted operating expenses for total Sysco grew 3.6% for the quarter. The increase in expense as previously discussed was largely driven by supply chain costs in both warehouse and transportation and increased fuel costs, as well as increased bad debt expense in our US operations related to larger recoveries in the prior year and a couple large local customers going out of business. Additionally, we continue to make investments in transformation and integration in our international business. Regarding the gap between gross profit dollar growth and adjusted operating expense growth, we were disappointed in that performance for the first quarter. The compression in the gap during the quarter can be attributed to continued increase costs in our US and Canadian supply chain operations, customer mix and Hurricane Florence. But as Tom indicated, we are taking an aggressive approach to accelerate our costs initiatives to improve this performance going forward. Total adjusted operating income was $692 million in the quarter, an increase of 5.1% compared to the same period last year. Changes in foreign exchange rates decreased operating income by 36 basis points. In terms of earnings per share, our result this quarter were primarily impacted by a lower tax rate, which I'll discuss more in a moment, driving an adjusted earnings per share growth of more than 22% to $0.91 per share. However, this was partially offset by increased interest expense which was higher than the same period last year due to variable rate changes and slightly less stock option exercises than in the prior year. Returning to taxes. Our effective tax rates for the first quarters of fiscal 2019 and 2018 were 20.3% and 32.6% respectively. The lower effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 is primarily due to lower tax rates resulting from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the favorable impact of excess tax benefits of equity based compensation, partially offset by higher rates in local, states and other jurisdictions. With regard to share repurchases, we repurchase shares based on a dollar based amount program. With the increase in share price this means fewer shares are being repurchased than during the same period last year. Cash flow from operations was $271 million for the quarter, which is $188 million higher compared to the same period last year. Free cash flow was $171 million, which is $222 million higher compared to the same period last year. It's important to note that the first quarter is often a weaker quarter for cash flow seasonally than the remainder of the year. The improvement in cash flow is mostly due to improved working capital, and I'm pleased with our net working capital performance for the quarter. We had good improvement versus the same period last year driven primarily by changes in our receivables and payables. In September, Sysco issued senior notes in Canada where we previously had no fixed income exposure. This was a good opportunity to take advantage of investor demand in Canada and further balance our assets and liabilities in different geographies. As we looked to term out internal debt that was created to repatriate earnings from Canada as a result of US Tax Reform. We're very pleased with the transaction and the interest on the notes will be paid semi-annually in April and October beginning in April of 2019. Before closing, I would like to reinforce some of the messages we have shared with you as we look ahead to the next couple of quarters. As Tom mentioned, in our US business we expect to have a continued volume growth as a result of both healthy macro environment and our initiatives differentiate our capabilities from the competition. However, we will begin to annualize a couple of large acquisitions. One, we are beginning to annualize now and the other will begin to annualize in the second half of the fiscal year. And the annualization of two large national customers which will impact our overall volume growth. Due to this annualization, along with a customer mix shift towards more growth of emerging concepts or micro chains, we expect our gross profit dollar growth to moderate. As for expenses, as Tom mentioned, we have a plan to aggressively manage and accelerate our cost initiatives and expect the benefit of these initiatives to ramp up over the next few quarters. As a result, we expect to have modest operating income growth during our second fiscal quarter. However, we expect improved performance in the second half of fiscal 2019 and are still committed to and confident in our ability to ultimately achieve the financial objectives associated with our three-year plan. In summary, our results for the quarter reflect continued momentum from our underlying business, including solid local case growth and strong gross profit dollar growth. That said, we have more work to do in order to mitigate the macro-environment headwinds, manage our overall costs and achieve the full financial objectives of our three-year plan. We are committed to servicing our customers and executing on a high level in all areas of our business. To continue to improve our financial performance in both the near and long-term. Operator, we're now ready for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Christopher Mandeville from Jefferies. Your line is open.
Christopher Mandeville: Yes, good morning. You guys saw some nice sequential improvement in your organic cases of close to 70 to 80 basis points. I don't think you had provided prior year first-half number. So I was just hoping maybe you had those off hand on organic cases for Q1, Q2 first off.
Joel Grade: Yes. Chris, just this is Joe. I think just to clarify your question I mean I think the first half of last year there is-- there's very little M&A. And so we hadn't, I think that's probably part of what you're looking at here is just a difference in having M&A and this year M&A and not last year. And I note that if that is your question.
Christopher Mandeville: Okay. Yes. My question I suppose would be thinking about trends on a two-year basis, you reference that you're looking for or expecting some moderation in Q2 on the top line of cases for that matter. How do you feel about maybe keeping things somewhat stable on a two-year stack basis?
Joel Grade: Yes. Well, I think, look, I think - one of the things I would certainly reference you back to is the three-year plan that we talked about with an overall volume growth. Again that made some assumptions of some M&A about of some M&A about 1%, 0.5% or 1% in there. We talked about overall volume grow over 3% local about 3.5%. Again every quarter is going to look a little different and there's going to be some impact of some things that we've talked about here, but I think we broadly still feel good about the volume numbers we talked about as part of our three year plan. Those things are just going to move around some, but I think our --what we're really trying to get at here is just to give some line of sight to the fact that as we head into this next quarter and over the next a little bit of near future here that some of the things that we have been benefiting from including the HFM acquisition, the Doerle acquisition, some large as we referenced national accounts coming on that we're simply suggesting that we're seeing some of that moderation happening as we move forward.
Christopher Mandeville: Okay and my follow up would be so you referenced that you weren't happy with your gross profit dollar growth in the quarter, and you'll be accelerating your cost savings programs going forward to help trying offset that to see some improved trends on overall even in the back half of the year. You also mentioned that you were still confident in your 2020 outlook, but if I recall over half of the growth was going to be predicated on gross profit dollar growth so has the algorithm changed to some degree or should we be just thinking that there's some near-term softness and gross profit dollars and we'll improve from here on out.
Tom Bené: Yes, Hey, Chris, this is Tom. So I think - I don't think we said we are disappointed in our gross profit dollar growth. What we said was that the gap between gross profit dollar and expenses was not where we had hoped they would be. And so we still expect to see I think good gross profit dollar growth. What we've got to get is better focus and management of the cost because the current cost increases are not, we're not comfortable with where they are at. And so I think the headline here is that we still expect to see decent gross profit growth as similar to what we've talked about externally, but we just got to figure out how to mitigate some of these rising costs that were --that are challenging us right now.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bob Summers from Buckingham. Your line is open.
Bob Summers: Hey, good morning. Just to leverage off that a little I mean I think about the gap between case volume growth and gross profit dollar growth wind out in a not favorable way like any more texture to that. And if I think about deflation impacting that number what's the right way to view it?
Joel Grade: Yes. So, Bob, it's Joe. So I think the couple things on that. I'll start with the deflation point is obviously there was an anticipated level of inflation and some of the projections we had as part of this three-year plan and where we're at today is less than that. So I think part of what we're calling out is the fact that again in a deflationary environment which you are a less inflationary environment you typically have some mathematical improvement in the margin percentage that you actually have less gross profit dollars. And so when the impact of lower inflation does tend to be having lower gross profit. And so I think that's part of what we're seeing there. I think some of the other thing we talked about a little bit here was a bit of the mix and we called out some of this mix between some of the --even within our local cases of some of the micro chains, some of the things that are actually growing at an accelerated rate versus some will even I would call some of the pure independence that's part we're also referencing is something we're seeing as a somewhat of leveling off of our gross profits that's I think part what we're calling out here. So those are couple of -
Bob Summers: And then you referenced the Hurricanes but you didn't size it up in any way on the cost side on the case volume side. How should I try and normalize?
Tom Bené: Yes. I think typically, Bob, the way we try to look at those hurricanes and the reason we've talked about both of them is one of them impacted quarter one, the other one Michael will actually more impact quarter two. But typically what we find is we lose the top-line right. We don't get the cases because outlets are shut down, the markets basically shut down, but we still have some of the costs. We still pay our people. We still and sometimes we try to recover. We are paying overtime because we are having to struggle to get as many people where we need them when we need them there. And so we tend to get is less top-line and more cost in those situations. And that's what we experienced in both of those situations. Obviously in the first quarter we had a little bit of that a year ago with a couple of hurricanes. So the real impact probably here is somewhat smaller in the first quarter and will be a little maybe larger in the second quarter.
Joel Grade: Yes. And you're right, Bob, we didn't size it out. I mean some where the impact of the, let's say Florence itself it is pretty somewhere a little less than a penny I would call.
Operator: Our next question comes from Edward Kelly from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Edward Kelly: Yes, hi, guys. Good morning. I just wanted to dig a little bit further into the cost pressures that you're talking about in here and just I guess how they're impacting the P&L right because there's a part of the cogs that there's impact and there's part of OpEx as we think about and Bob started asked sort of along this lines, as we think about gross profit dollar growth this quarter relative to case growth, there clearly was a short fall within that relative to I think what has been going on historically. What is going on with inbound freight? Has that gotten worse to some extent or is this truly just a more of a mix issue and lack of inflation issue?
Tom Bené: I'll start and then Joe can jump in. I think it's probably more of you suggest. I think it's more of a mixed issue and somewhat of, look, it's a slowing down of the inflation that we had planned, but it is also seeing deflation in a couple of key categories which is impacting us. I think in addition, look, I think the inbound freight is gotten better. It's still not great but it's more I think more consistent and maybe we were experiencing last year. So I think that consistency enables us to manage through that a little bit better. It's still up obviously it still continues to be a challenge as all of the-- we'd say everything around drivers because it's a challenge. Whether it's our ability to hire and retain and make sure we're doing everything we can to get our products out the door, or the impact of products coming in. I think what we're just seeing with within inbound is we're a little more stable than we were a year ago. We're cautiously optimistic but that will continue throughout the year but as we get to this holiday season, we do worry that that we see more pressure there as they're just more freight on the road.
Joel Grade: Yes and I think this - just one thing I'd add to that, yes, it is just I think Tom's comment earlier about these the categories themselves that are actually in deflationary are important. We've always and we always talked about this pretty consistently. It matters what inflation or deflation is but it also in some ways matters what the categories that are inflating or deflating are. And in this case some of them, we've had in our FreshPoint business for example, we had a fairly significant deflation in the produce area and again on the center of the plate in the meats area. Those are large dollar cases you start experiencing some of the deflation and that has some more impact on per case number that you're referring to.
Edward Kelly: All right. And just a follow up on the cost side and the potential offsets. How are you thinking about pricing at this point in the industry given the rising cost pressures? I mean your top-line is obviously very strong and it doesn't take a lot of pricing to offset issues like driver pay and what's going on with the warehouses. Are you actively looking to try to offset some of this with price? And, if not, then why?
Tom Bené: Yes. So, of course, we are and we always try to look at what is reasonable to pass along from a pricing perspective. I think the only challenge I'd say we've seen is the as we talk between the inbound freight which is adding to our cogs and some of the inflation in some categories that we've seen, we are trying to pass along as much of it as we can. Having said that, we did see a little bit of a gap between the cogs rising and our pricing in this quarter, and that is obviously creating some of this pressure we're talking about. So we continue to leverage our revenue management tools and all the work we've done over the last couple of years. We're just-- we're doing everything we can to move it along without creating issues obviously for our customers or for our overall top-line growth.
Edward Kelly: And just last question when you think about the back half of the year, obviously you're expecting an improvement there. When you say that do you mean back to that 1% gap in GP versus SG&A growth?
Tom Bené: Yes, that's very much the focus is how do we get keep, our top-line growing very strong and then make sure we are managing the cost side of the business tighter.
Joel Grade: Yes and again just as part of that three-year plan if you remember that that gap was targeted at for that three-year time period. So certainly there's a plan that has some acceleration.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Heinbockel from Guggenheim. Your line is open.
John Heinbockel: So Tom and Joe, let me start with corporate overhead right or your corporate EBIT. Did that grow a little faster in the period than you would have liked or have planned? How do you attack that--I know that a lot of these shared services are part of that but maybe talk about the way you're attacking that here specifically on the next couple of quarters? And then is it fair to for us to think that line item can grow? You can hold the growth to 1% or 2% on a go-forward basis or is that too low?
Joel Grade: Well, let me start and then Tom can chime if he wants. I mean-- I --first of all, no, the answer your original question is we did not actually that was not part of the cost acceleration that happened this quarter. So but having said that one of the things that Tom had referenced in his comments were around some of the areas in terms of the finance technology roadmap, some of the smart spending that, so that is not to suggest we don't still have areas of opportunity that we're continuing to address. And again in a world where we have some of the challenges we talked about in some of the macro in particular in the operations side. These are areas that we need to continue accelerate even at a faster rate than we have today. And so I think as we always think about those type of cost them in there are pay increases and there's things and so each --there are going to be a couple points of the increase in any given year, but what we're talking about now is actually doing some things that are going to further accelerate decreases in that area. And again it starts with these things that Tom referenced in terms of finance technology roadmap and smart spending categories.
John Heinbockel: Yes, are you pulling forward the timetable on some of that in light of the warehouse cost pressures or it's on the same timetable?
Joel Grade: In some cases, yes, but obviously there's some puts and takes and all that, but we're certainly making sure we're either stay on track or where we can't accelerate we're doing so.
John Heinbockel: All right. And then maybe just for Tom when you think about this question of pricing the flipside being obviously you've got a lot of data and you think about the position you're in versus a lot of your peers right which is far better competitive position. If you don't take pricing and they do, is there an idea when you look at elasticity that can lead to step up in share or not and I know what's account by account item by item but that's really not the path you want to go down?
Tom Bené: Yes. As you know, John, that we've talked a lot about this in our past. We are not looking to buy share, if you will. We need to be obviously competitive in the marketplace, but you should not expect and we would not be out there and kind of leading with pricing downward to drive market share. We need to earn that based on all the things we've talked about. We're very focused on all those I would call differentiators in the business to create a better experience for our customers.
Operator: Our next question comes from Karen Short from Barclays. Your line is open.
Karen Short: Hi, thanks. So my question is I guess in early September you kind of indicated that you probably you loosely achieved a third of your three year goals and operating income in 2018 and you'd indicated that the remaining two-thirds would be pretty evenly distributed between fiscal 2019 and 2020. And obviously with what you have given us today that doesn't appear to be the case achieving your remainder of the $400 million or $450 million to $500 million in operating profit is pretty heavily weighted to fiscal 2020. So I guess the first question is that I mean that is an accurate statement right? And I guess the second question would be I guess I am still trying to understand really what changed from early September to today?
Tom Bené: So, Karen, A couple is, I would say not just a year 2020. I think we're telling you is back half of 2019 and 2020 but we are still confident we can achieve those numbers that we've shared with you all. So I think from that standpoint I wouldn't assume by any means that this is a - we're pushing everything off to the last year and you're going to have some big balloon when you need to stall for. So as far as what's changed, I mean I think what we are --one big thing that we are feeling maybe more right now than we had anticipated or had been prior to that is this cost pressure on the a supply chain side. And look, we knew it was out there. We were managing it pretty well, but I think we've gotten to a point now where we are like probably everyone starting to feel the impacts of that kind of day in and day out. And if we think about what that really looks like it literally is if you don't have enough drivers in the building then we need to pay what we have over time to get those products out. We need to invest more in recruiting people faster because we're not getting the folks in the door, and so whether it's incentives we have to pay to get people in, it's all of these things that we all know are out there, but I think maybe we were feeling less of that than others in the last couple quarters. And now it's hit us kind of squarely like everyone else. So I think that's the single biggest thing that's changed here. Obviously, we talked about going forward more of these just lapping issues that we have where we had some acquisitions a year ago that we'll start to lap and we had some new some bigger customer acquisitions, but it's really about this supply chain cost and all we're saying is we're going to accelerate some things in some other areas knowing we've got to offset that.
Karen Short: Okay so then just to clarify also you were kind of asked this earlier but in terms of the components of achieving that 650 to 700 I think you were asked gross profit was 55% to 65% of that, so is that still the case or should we expect the leveraging cycle not leveraging supply chain but reducing admin costs to be a more of a contributing factor? And then if you could give us just some color in terms of the dollar buckets in the three areas that you called out the finance transformation, smart spending and Canadian regionalization that would be helpful?
Joel Grade: Karen, so I'll start I mean I think the bucket is broadly speaking, I wouldn't call it materially different. There's probably some shifting around a little bit there that that skews towards some more of the cost side. Again out of necessity, again - every - we --again express confidence in our goals and if it looks a little different than we'd originally anticipated, but I wouldn't necessarily come to conclusion right now that all those things are going to just dramatically shift in terms of the buckets. I think that's, again, we're all we're really saying is that where we have some experiences of some of these issues particularly in our supply chain area, we're just going to continue to focus on accelerating those areas that we can continue to take costs out of our system. So I think that's really the main message here. And I think - [Multiple Speakers] yes and on those specifics, Karen, again we haven't-- we're not going out and actually I guess assigning specific cost to those items just suffice it to say, and we talked about this in Investor Day. Those were certainly a sizeable portion when we talked about of their G&A savings, and yes we can accelerate some of that we're looking to do so.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vincent Sinisi from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Vincent Sinisi: Hey, great, good morning, guys. Thanks very much for taking my questions. Also of course just wanted to follow up with what the cost focus. So I guess Tom you said it's certainly supply chain seems to kind of be the biggest difference versus last quarter, but then in your prepared commentary it felt at least like you talked quite a bit around kind of opportunities for cost cuts across really all your geographies, and not maybe just with breaks and whatnot. So I guess first is that a fair statement? And then just more holistically are some of these costs initiatives strictly to combat the headwinds that you ran through or by different geographies may there --may be just be more efficiencies that you should be realizing overall?
Tom Bené: So, Vincent, there are a couple of things. So the cost challenges are, if you think about the various segments, the business we talked about. Our biggest cost challenges are in North America. So the US business in Canada from a supply chain perspective. That's where we're feeling the majority of the impact. Our European business while there's a few things that are not a big driver of our cost issue. So it's the supply chain North America, big focus, so that's number one. Second what I would say is while I referred to other opportunities those are the ones we've been talking about finance roadmap, smart spending, some regional, I talked about Canadian regionalization. Some of those are kind of normal course of business opportunities, and we'll continue to look for those as well whether they're in the US or whether they're an international. We'll continue to look for and we will drive out cost opportunities that exist beyond big strategic focus areas. And so the last thing I think you asked is are they in the plan or not some? Some are and some aren't. And so finance roadmap we talked about that Investor Day, we plan for some of that. We're accelerating some of the work there, but we had planned for some of these things. So I think some of them are in the numbers; some of them are going to be accelerating, but I think the key message for you guys is, look, we understand that we were seeing some cost headwinds today that we had not anticipated. And you should expect and we are focused on mitigating those by taking out other, by taking out cost in other areas. That's why we're not really saying we're shifting; we should be shifting the model a lot. There might be slight adjustments as Joel suggested but this is basically saying look, we got some more cost headwinds than we anticipated. And we are aggressively going after those so we feel comfortable we can deliver the numbers we've committed.
Joel Grade: Yes and I think just again that benefit again, we certainly anticipated seeing some of that starting in the second half of this year as opposed again somehow jamming all that into the final year, the three year plan.
Vincent Sinisi: Okay, all right, that's helpful, guys. Thank you and maybe just as a quick follow-up. Joel, I guess this is more for you just in terms of the rest of this year. How are you thinking about inflation which was just very slight and then also how should we think of tax rate going forward?
Joel Grade: Yes, so from an inflation perspective, I mean I think you were certainly coming around this flattish area and I would just say that our anticipation within a couple quarters is, I'd say somewhat modest inflation splash kind of deep-- this is kind of right around this flattish area over the next couple quarters. I think is probably the best view you can have right now. Tax rate, certainly at this point continued we talked about twenty bucks I think a 25% tax rate that we called out in our earnings call for our fourth-quarter and some guidance there. And while obviously, we certainly continue to drive traditional opportunities there. At this point that certainly though we're still looking at that 25% factor at this point.
Operator: Our next question comes from Judah Frommer from Crédit Suisse. Your line is open.
Judah Frommer: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just to break out the expense pressure from the top-line strength. I mean it does sound like the expense pressure is expected to continue, but that's tied to wage growth and you're talking about a pretty supportive macro in the US. That said, it sounds like there is some channel shifting going on that's kind of pressuring margins. You talked about the micro change versus independence. So how much confidence do you have in continued top-line strength potentially offsetting elevated costs in the near term?
Tom Bené: Hi, Judah. I'd say, look, I think we feel like the top line should continue to see solid growth, were, all of the, as you said the macro environment there is pretty positive and a lot of the things we're seeing across the food service segment continue to give us confidence there. I think the other thing you're raising and we've talked about this a little bit already this morning in the call is. There is some potential pressure on margin based on the mix of the customers and where some of that growth is coming. So I think the growth will continue but this kind of emerging segments, micro chains growing at a faster rate maybe than we had seen earlier are creating some pressure there. We're going to have to figure out how to manage through that as well. And I think your point on expenses was these aren't short-term, these are-- we see these continuing at this point. And, so yes, that's why we have to get aggressive in some of these areas because we don't see those costs increases mitigating anytime in the short-term.
Judah Frommer: Okay and then kind of beyond the broader expense pressures in the industry. I mean there are clearly different things going on at each of the public players. Is there anything you'd call out in the first quarter or going into second where you've seen material share shifts amongst the top players in the industry? Or is this kind of you guys executing on your plan and that's where the top-line is coming from?
Tom Bené: Yes, I would say in our case, I can't really speak for the other guys but we're --this is more just continued execution of our plan. We continue to be very focused. We talk about this disciplined profitable growth and while we have some of these challenges we're talking about, we're still very focused on each customer and making sure there's value. We can create for the relationship but also being thoughtful about not every customer is a good fit for what we're trying to accomplish, and we'll continue to focus on managing your business that way.
Joel Grade: Yes, and just to remember the size, the sheer size of the industry in terms of competitors. Again we often, the conversation is often around the three of us but really three of us maybe have 30% share at the top and so I think there's just a lot of competition in there, where share moves around.
Operator: Our next question comes from Marisa Sullivan from Bank of America. Your line is open.
Marisa Sullivan: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to follow up on the top-line focus. Can you just give us a little bit more detail on the drivers of the healthy case growth you saw in the US? Was it more new business that you were bringing? Was it increased penetration? Are you seeing accelerated share gains and then any commentary on the quarter to date whether that's continued? Thank you.
Tom Bené: Hey, Marisa. So from a top-line standpoint, I think it's really all of the above. We continue to see obviously some new business gains. Obviously that's important for all of us in this segment of the industry. I think in addition, we are seeing improved penetration in certain geographies and with certain customers which is a good sign again kind of some of the robustness in the industry in certain segments of the industry I should probably say. And last I guess I'd say is we have like everybody we have markets that are performing better than others. And I say market, from our geographic market say in the US, and so we are constantly kind of managing through that whether it's competitive situations or weather related situations or whatever, we've got to manage through those on regular basis. So I'd say the top line is nothing changed dramatically from what we've seen historically. Again, some of that growth that we talked about was still acquisitions and some non-organic but we feel really good about organic growth. And we are kind of right where we thought we would be from that top line perspective. Is it relates to - what was the second part of your question?
Marisa Sullivan: Just quarter-to-date if you have seen that momentum continues?
Tom Bené: Yes. I think in general as we go into second quarter we talked about some of these things, some of the lapping issues. So I'd say in general, yes, understanding that we have some of these lapping things that we shared occurring as we speak.
Marisa Sullivan: Got it .And if could just quickly follow up on the cost side. Given that a lot of this is coming from wage pressures both in the warehouse and transpiration. Can you give us a little bit more detail on some of the productivity initiatives you have underway in both the warehouse and supply chain other opportunities for automation that you see that could help offset some of these pressures over the midterm? Just any more color there. Thank you.
Tom Bené: Sure. And just on the pressure so it's wage to some extent. I think the important thing for everybody remember, I know we've talked about this is, we aren't --folks who are out there maybe increasing the minimum wage or coming out with higher wages for their associates. We generally aren't as impacted by that because we're already at or above those rates, but what we're finding is with the reduced availability of work force with the current levels of employment, we are just having a harder time attractive and retaining a certain associates. And I think that's we get into this little bit of churn situation where again we don't enough or paying overtime and that's driving our cost or we are having to spend money at higher rate to get people in the door. And it's not necessarily the pay rate or the wage rate; it's more of that churn that we are experiencing there and everything around that. And that's when we talk about out trying to retain folks longer, we know just like customers or we can retain our associates, it helps our overall cost. As far as other things we are doing, we've talked about things like small delivery vehicle. So let's talk about that for a second. That's a great example of where you may instead of having to find CDL driver where we know there is huge pressure right now for that commercial driver's license person. We can use folks who don't necessarily need a CDL. Ability to accelerate initiatives like that can be - can do a couple of things. Help us dramatically in our service for our customers but also impact that overall cost to wage rate and expense of that driver issue we've been dealing with. That's an example. Automation, we have a fair amount of automation in our facilities not like you might think of its hi-tech automation but automation around some of the slower moving items we are able to put more items into our facilities. We have piloted and tested some various types of warehouse automation and we will continue to look at that. We've not seen necessarily that being a big driver for us in the short term. But that doesn't mean we don't continue to look for ways to do that. I'd say the other areas where we might use think about automation is around analytics as you think about the AI, you hear a lot about. How do we take the information we have, enable us to make quicker decisions, enable us to do something in a way that maybe in the past that took us a little more manual approach to. And then maybe the last thing around our delivery is the way we route our trucks and the way we - the more we can be efficient in our routing and also enables us to kind of manage through this driver challenge but also improve our cost, meaning we can get more cases on the truck and we can obviously --we can have bigger drops with our customers, all those things really do help and improve that pressure on the supply chain cost.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kelly Bania from BMO Capital. Your line is open.
Kelly Bania: Good morning, thanks for taking my question. I guess just another way to ask the cost question. Do you think that your planned initiatives on the cost side just need to be bigger than maybe previously expected over the three-year period in order to offset some of these supply chain costs which sounds like it's more drivers and warehouse labor versus maybe freight but I guess the question what are you assuming for those kind of supply chain costs over the next year and a half?
Tom Bené: So, Kelly, I think it's a combination of things. I think as we were just talking with Marisa's question. We need to improve the current run rate of our supply chain cost. They are higher than we are comfortable with and I think we've got some initiative underway to continue to manage that, but to make sure we cover this increase that we're seeing. We are going to I'd say probably not necessary bigger but accelerate some of the cost initiatives that we've had out there. We have a pretty good line of sight to the areas of opportunity and I think it's really about accelerating those faster versus making them bigger if you.
Kelly Bania: Okay and I guess Joel just on the comment on gross margin and the impact of deflation and the mathematical impact that has. I guess can you quantify what that did have on the gross margin rate? I guess it would have thought gross margin would have been up a little bit more last time we went through this deflationary cycle it was also up a little bit more, so can you help us understand maybe kind of some of the puts and take underlying gross margin?
Joel Grade: Yes and so again just to be kind of clear on that, again we haven't quantified that but I mean the point here really is we're not in deflation yet. What I was really referring to is that we were actually having, you want to call it less inflation and in certain categories we are actually experiencing some level deflation, but we're not in an overall deflationary place. Now the point I was also making was that if you look at last year in the same quarter, we actually had more inflation and so I guess that was really the point of the kind of the earlier comparison that there's some mathematical if you want to call it contribution to the gross margin percentages that happens when you look at that year-over-year. But that's really the point I was trying to make but we're not in a deflationary environment right now in total. So again which when we were talking about this couple years ago we're a couple points of deflation. And that obviously has certainly a much more significant margin percentage impact than what we are talking today.
Kelly Bania: Okay and can you help us understand how you're defining these micro chains? How big are they? Ad how close is the margin profile to more of a local independent restaurant versus a chain? And how we should think about that?
Tom Bené: I think typically we've talked about them kind of less than 100 units, but generally covering multiple from our view-- multiple operating company. So instead of being like within a local geography with a few locations these are emerging concepts that are starting to grow beyond their traditional borders. And think about it as there are concepts that usually have done well for a while as a local or independent customer and now we're at the stage where they feel like they're ready to expand. And so we're just seeing that segment of the market starting to grow a little bit faster as they do that they require things that are probably more similar to a national account, both from how we manage their business but also the kind of programs they're getting from suppliers et cetera. And so that's why we say that that segment is a little more margin pressure than an independent restaurant operator, and but that they vary in size and scope. There not --they're not --they're certainly not changed like you typically think of a chain but they are starting to emerge and shift beyond kind of their traditional market.
Operator: And our next question is Ajay Jain from Pivotal Research Group. Your line is open.
Ajay Jain: Yes, hi, good morning. I was wondering if you could maybe expand a little bit on the general operating environment for independence. Obviously, your competitors have had some recent challenges with independent case growth and they've also been adding marketing associates to address that challenge. And on the last earnings call I think you mentioned at the time that you were also hiring some marketing associates. And even though your top line for independent case growth has been really strong, I'm wondering if there's a more competitive backdrop to get that incremental case growth. This competition by itself driving some of that increased cost pressure. So just wondering if you are seeing any combination of increased industry pricing and headcount expenses for drivers and for more salespeople?
Tom Bené: Yes, Ajay, maybe the way I'd answer that is if you recall we actually probably led these nine months to or so ago by adding some marketing associates. We believed that we had now had the kind of the data analytics and tools to allow us to focus where we were going to add resources. So we started that kind of Q --our Q2 of last year and that carried on kind of through now. So we have seen some additional expense associated with our adding some marketing associates, but we also believe that that's helping us drive our local customer and case growth. And so I'd separate that as far as what we see is the strategy we put in place is working. Is the competitive environment changing as others? Now look to add marketing associates out there, sure, I'm certain markets we're seeing some of that and as it gets more competitive obviously we need to be there to compete, but I would separate those from the operating expense other than to say that obviously higher case growth drives higher operating expense in general. If you're growing 5% plus in the cases and you should expect your operating expenses are going to grow. Our problem is our operating expenses, we're not getting leverage on them or they're growing faster than what obviously we're just getting on the case grow. So that's our issue and we've got to get that back in check which is what we've really been talking about here this morning.
Ajay Jain: Okay and Tom in your prepared comments you, I think you cited improved economic data points and improved environment in the US for restaurant spending, but then based on the recent performance it breaks and SYGMA you mentioned a more moderate rate of earnings growth in Q2 but can you mention or can you confirm whether that operating income growth in Q2 is that supposed to be similar to this quarter or could it be potentially worse than Q1?
Tom Bené: Yes. I think we're suggesting that where we sit today we feel like we just want to make you all aware of a couple of the lapping issues we've talked about. So we're not sitting here calling down for anything. I think just to be clear when you talk about breaks or Europe that's very different situation. And as I said in the remarks, I think in the UK there's certainly some uncertainty in that market continues because of this Brexit question that's out there. And quite honestly what we see in here as it gets closer to the date where they need to make some decisions that's probably creating more dynamics in the market right now, but the rest of our international markets we feel pretty good about, France and Sweden, Ireland all doing well. And so we just sort --we are managing through what is a little bit of a bumpy environment in some of our international markets.
Joel Grade: Yes, Ajay, I just, this is Joel. I think just to clarify I think what I think we're saying is that the Q2 we are anticipating looking somewhat more similar to what we have this quarter as opposed to something a lot worse than that. So I think what we're calling our is just some moderation a bit due to some of the lapping and some of the volume and then again we talked about some of these expense acceleration kicking in, but we're anticipating some of that more in the second half of the year. So I think just to clarify is more similar is the answer to your questions is we really we're calling out there in a second quarter.
Ajay Jain: Okay, thanks Joel. And just lastly for you. Do you expect higher interest expenses? Is that going to remain a headwind for the rest of the year or does that moderate at all?
Joel Grade: No, that's - I anticipate that remaining a bit of a headwind.
Operator: Our next question comes from Karen Holthouse from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Karen Holthouse: Hey, thanks for taking the question. Just another way to ask the question on the cost side of things. It sounds like you're pulling forward some cost savings but if there a level of inflation or we at the point or how much worse would wage inflation have to get before that sort of 150 basis point gap between gross profit and operating expenses in the three year plan would be addressed?
Joel Grade: Well, you are right, couple things. Again I just like to just make one slight comment like that Tom made. I would not characterize this as wage inflation per se. It is demand for labor particularly on the transportation side and again with a pretty low unemployment obviously that impacts our ability to try to retain on the warehouse side as well. So it's really that as opposed to just wage inflation itself that's causing that impact. And I guess what I'd say to that, Karen, your other question, how much of that's going to happen before it just blows out the course of the three-year plan. I mean the reality of it is, again, we've been an environment for a while now where we've had these --some of these driver challenges. We've navigated through that for a while now. It's starting to pinch us a bit more which is what we've talked about here. I'm certainly not ready to make the call though that, it's again unemployment is pretty low, driver shortage has been there. And so I don't, I certainly don't know whether we're contemplating a scenario where that somehow gets just exponentially worse and it just blows this plan out yet. We're certainly-- we've talked about a couple times today. We've --it's a headland, we've got to deal with it both from how we become more productive on our supply chain as well as some of the other costs that we need to accelerate to deal with that. We will do so and we're certainly again at this point we should we certainly have continued to express our confidence in achieving our three year plan numbers.
Tom Bené: I think that's the important thing, Karen, is where we sit today we still feel like we will deliver the three-year plan we committed. Will we have to make some continued adjustments? No doubt. And that's what we've been talking about mostly this morning.
Operator: Our next question is from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
John Ivankoe: Hi, thank you. The question is on pricing but pricing not to your local accounts but to your contract accounts and I was just wondering whether some of the cost pressures that you're seeing internally in particularly this quarter we're allowed to be passed on in general to your current contract accounts. In other words are you selling them, products at one delivered price it's different than what your own backdoor price is? And it might just be a function of some of these contracts kind of rolling over or for you to set up a new whether cost-plus percent or cost plus your dollar per case basis whatever it is for you to capture the true cost to deliver to these customers?
Tom Bené: Hey, John. It's a good question. There are certainly some contracts that have longer periods of time for adjustments of cost increases for us to pass them along, but I wouldn't say that's a big driver here but there's some of that for sure but I wouldn't characterize that as something that's a major impact or you should see some big switch swing because of it.
John Ivankoe: And at least from what I remember historically it was at 50% contract and 50% locally managed. I mean is that still the breakout within your Broadline or has that not?
Joel Grade: That's right, John.
Tom Bené: Yes, that's right.
Operator: And our last question comes from Andrew Wolf from Loop Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Andrew Wolf: Hi, good morning. I just want to drill down on some of this maybe into some of the line items on the cost pressure. So it sounds like you're saying it's still the change was still more on the driver side than in the warehouse side. I just want to confirm that and change in terms of where more pressure came. And then I want to --one of you guys referenced started over talking your answer but maybe can do two at once. One of you guys referenced increasing over time and that sounds more like a warehouse issue or is it also a driver issue?
Tom Bené: So let's start there. Andrew. So I think it's both and so we obviously have hours of service types of things we have to manage on the driver side, but it's both. And I would say that costs are both as well if you think about those are relative expense. The driver and the transportation cost associated in our business are significantly higher than the warehouse. So both are being impacted but if you have heavy impact on transportation and the drivers that plays a disproportionate role in the overall expense load. And that's the really the point.
Andrew Wolf: And in terms of the labor shortage and I think the turnover that's very central to that. If you could perfectly match up the supply of labor with demand, would you --these cost pressures mitigate? In other words it's just-- is there just a lot of turnover and it's sort of unpredictable and that's when you're caught short or is it generally just more of a general process and you're just short labor most of the time?
Tom Bené: Yes. We historically have not been short labor most of the time. So this is clearly a new phenomenon and I think it's driven by all of the factors we've talked about. Certainly just the unemployment levels are a lot lower; there is a shortage of what we would call skilled drivers. These drivers that have the CDL licenses and there's just a high demand for them in lots of industries right now. And as long as they remain short, we're going to have to do everything we can to retain the ones we have and attract the ones we need. And so that's where a lot of this is happening.
Joel Grade: Yes and you can imagine, Andrew, I mean it's --the more your --the issues you are having with retention, there's more training cost, there's more churn; there's more --people take some time to ramp up productivity and accuracy and all those things. I mean all that stuff just exacerbates when you're having some of the issues of the retention. So that's just really - and that's both on the warehouse and the transportation side.
Andrew Wolf: Okay and if I could just ask kind of housekeeping. I think you called out fuel for the first time in a while. I don't know if you'd be willing to give us a swing in fuel and just sort of comment on whether this future surcharges, what degree that mitigates things?
Joel Grade: Sure, well. So, yes, so fuel has continued to increase, obviously we continue to use some forward derivatives to hedge some of that but nonetheless those are on a rolling 12 that as fuel costs continue to go up those also go up. And so we certainly had say about $0.03 a case in terms of our fuel impact this quarter. So it's pretty significant, and you can certainly anticipate that coming continuing fuel surcharges I think the way ours-- the way those work I mean again that's not a dollar-for-dollar offset to be clear. We have had some increase in our surcharges those and on the contract side most of those are negotiated in. We have contract customers and those do move up and down based on some type of grid. On the street side, yes, that's something we're certainly continuing to evaluate and again as the markets move those do tend to move some as well but aren't nearly as big an impact.
Andrew Wolf: Okay. And Joel just on the reclassification and the other income. It was pretty big swing this quarter especially without any other income this quarter and a year ago going up. Is that a pattern or we're going to or you guys going to go back to having sort of a decent other income line going forward? Otherwise it's like-- if we annualized this quarter so adverse swing it's like a $0.05 a share.
Joel Grade: Well, so again that was related to an accounting change related to the way the pension accounting works that used to be up above the line. And so that is a reclassification from up above to down below. That is something you're going to see because again that's just to play a classification issue. That's really the main impact on the other income this quarter. And that you'll see for this yearend beyond.
Operator: Thank you everyone for joining us today. This concludes today's conference call. And you may now disconnect. Have a great day.

Thomas Bené: Thank you, Neil, and good morning, everyone. Earlier this morning, Sysco announced that we concluded fiscal year 2018 with a strong quarter that ultimately translated into a successful year. Fiscal 2018 was also the final year of our three year plan and I'm excited to share that we exceeded the various metrics that we initially outlined during our Investor Day back in September of 2015. Many of you will recall that when we initially announced this three year plan, we had three targeted objectives we wanted to achieve. The first was to improve the customer experience of doing business with Sysco through enhanced service levels, improve sales retention and higher customer loyalty. The second was to enhance associate engagement through improved workplace safety and associate retention by providing attractive career growth opportunities for our associates. The third was to achieve our financial goals of growing adjusted operating income by at least $400 million, which we raised twice since then, ultimately to the high end of a $650 million to -- $600 million to $650 million range while targeting an adjusted return on invested capital of 15%, all of these excluding the impact of the Brakes acquisition. Specifically, for our financial goals, we had three key levers that would help achieve those metrics: Grow gross profit through accelerated local case growth and gross margin expansion, leverage supply chain costs and reduce administrative expense. I'm proud to report that our team was able to successfully execute on all of these objectives, which has translated into steadily improving financial results over the past three years. At the conclusion of the three year plan, local case growth was 3%. Gross profit dollar growth outpaced operating expense growth, creating operating leverage of 2 points, and we delivered $665 million of incremental adjusted operating income, excluding Brakes and based on a comparison of fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2015. Additionally, we grew EPS faster than operating income and we surpassed both our adjusted return on invested capital and working capital targets. We achieved these goals by staying focused on our customer-centric vision and driving consistent execution at the operating level. Our objective to improve the overall customer experience has been a core element to our success over the past few years and will continue to be a key focus for us as we move forward. As we described at our Investor Day in December of last year, we continue to build on the momentum we've achieved against our strategic objectives, and we'll strive to accelerate our current growth guided by four strategic priorities: First, enriching the customer experience of doing business with Sysco; second, delivering operational excellence in everything we do; third, optimizing the business, what we like to call The Sysco Way; and finally, activating the power of our people. The overall macroeconomic trends continue to be positive in the United States and the underlying economic picture remains encouraging, including a strong employment market. This has resulted in a healthy consumer that is driving a positive trend in restaurant sales. We also see continued growth at local customers as they increase their reach through flexible menus, innovative concepts, and additional delivery options to reach consumers. Looking at our results for the year, sales grew 6.1% to $58.7 billion driven by strong growth with local customers, the addition of some new customers which helped accelerate our national customer growth, a few key acquisitions, and continued product cost inflation. We continue to be focused on M&A activity as a part of our strategy and also closed several acquisitions during the year, including HFM in Hawaii, Doerle Food Service in Louisiana, Kent Frozen Foods in the U.K., a small transaction in Sweden as well as acquiring the remaining 50% interest in Mayca, our Costa Rican partner. For the year, local case growth for our U.S. Broadline business was 3.6%. It was the strongest in the fourth quarter at 5%. Overall gross profit grew 5%, driven by a few key factors: First, the acceleration of local cases to improve processes and training of our marketing associates and continued growth in our digital platform; second, the growth of Sysco Brand, which now comprises nearly 46% of U.S. Broadline local cases; third, Cutting Edge Solutions, our product innovation platform, which features our exclusive product offerings has now delivered 1 million cases of new on-trend innovative products to our customers; fourth, the continued success in category management as we continue to introduce new categories to capture value; and finally, effective ongoing management of product cost inflation using our suite of revenue management tools. These positive results were partially offset by continued challenges from inbound freight costs driven by overall industry factors such as driver shortages and adjusting to electronic regulation of hours driven. From an expense perspective, adjusted operating expense for the year grew 4%, driven by ongoing strategic investments in the business and a few operational challenges that impacted the year. Some of those investments included supply chain transformation work occurring in the U.K., the investment in marketing associates in the U.S. and the continued investment in technology solutions that will translate into a more enriching experience for our customers. Overall, we delivered adjusted operating income growth of 8.4% to $2.5 billion. With the addition of tax benefits, EPS growth was meaningfully higher than the prior year as adjusted EPS grew 26.6% to $3.14. The operational improvement in our business is a direct result of the hard work and effort of our 67,000-plus associates who executed our business strategy that is predicated on disciplined, profitable, and sustainable growth. Transitioning now to our annual results by business segment, beginning with U.S. Foodservice operations. Sales grew 5.4% for the year, gross profit grew 4.6%, adjusted operating expenses grew 4.7%, and adjusted operating income grew 4.3%. Top line results were strong as local case growth in our U.S. Broadline business was 3.6%, including the acquisition of HFM and Doerle Food Service. Organic local case growth was 2.8% and has now grown for 17 consecutive quarters. Total case growth was 2.9%, of which 2.1% was organic. The solid case growth performance translated into healthy gross profit dollar growth of 4.6%, driven by a combination of customer mix, product mix, and inflation. Additionally, the previously mentioned growth in Sysco Brand also contributed positively to the gross profit dollar growth. Turning our attention to cost. Our adjusted operating expense growth for the year was 4.7%, driven by rising fuel costs and increased supply chain costs in both the warehouse and transportation. These costs were largely due to a combination of a tight labor market, weather impacts throughout the year, and ramp-up costs for new business. Additionally, we had ongoing investments in our selling organization to better penetrate underdeveloped markets. Moving on to International Foodservice Operations. Sales grew 8.5%, gross profit grew 7.1%, adjusted operating expenses grew 9.7%, and adjusted operating income declined 7.7%. Top line growth was strong for the year across all our international businesses. Our business in Mexico added a new national customer, and Canada performed well as we implemented strategic investments from our -- initiatives from our U.S. business, which led to accelerated local case growth for the year. However, in the U.K., we continue to experience acute product inflation in the mid-to-high single digits. From a cost perspective, we continue to make investments across Europe. The supply chain transformation work in the U.K. to transition from a single temperature warehousing fleet into a multi-temperature network is progressing well and we feel good about the progress that has been achieved. We are also making good progress on the integration of Brake France and Davigel to create Sysco France and are excited about the new capabilities and the unique multi-temperature service that will better adapt to our customers' growing needs. Additionally, the integration of Pallas Foods and Brakes in Ireland is nearly complete and we've achieved good cost synergies throughout the year. We are also making technology investments to improve the infrastructure and to enhance our suite of customer-facing tools. And finally, in Mexico, we absorbed the cost of adding a new large customer during the year. The overall decline in adjusted operating income is a direct result of the strategic investments we are making in the International segment along with the impact of foreign exchange currency translation. We continue to focus on executing against our long-term plans by investing in necessary capabilities across the International business and by leveraging our position as a platform for future growth. And finally, SYGMA showed continued top line growth during the year with sales up 6.1%, driven by inflation, along with fees growth of nearly 3%. However, the business continues to struggle with operating expenses related to increased transportation costs and a reduction in backhaul revenue due to driver availability. I'd now like to briefly discuss the announcement that will be coming out later today. Today, we're announcing our 2025 corporate social responsibility goals. These newly defined goals set a clear path for the future and demonstrate Sysco's continued commitment to care for people, supply products responsibly and protect the planet. We believe it is our responsibility to operate in a manner that meets the needs of our customers today while producing positive lasting change. We are leading our industry with our CSR initiatives and by including specific long-term goals that align with our strategic business priorities, we're living our vision of becoming our customers' most valued and trusted business partner. In summary, we are excited about the results achieved in fiscal 2018 towards our three year plan and are encouraged by the solid fundamentals across our business, specifically the top line growth trajectory we're on, while continuing to be able to invest in our future. Our success is a direct result of the dedication and hard work of our associates executing on our strategic priorities. As a reminder, fiscal 2018 is an overlap year in that it was the final year of our initial three year plan and the first year of our new three year plan. We are pleased with the results for the year and remain confident in our ability to deliver the financial objectives associated with our new three year plan that we described in our December Investor Day. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer.
Joel Grade: Thank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Tom mentioned earlier, we are excited about our performance in achieving our initial three year plan and pleased with the results for both the fourth quarter and the full year. This morning, I'll start with our quarterly results. Sales and gross profit growth were strong at 6.2% and 5.7%, respectively, as we saw positive impacts from overall and local case growth, continued Sysco Brand growth and a benefit from inflation and foreign exchange. Adjusted operating expense growth was 2.5%, resulting in adjusted operating income growth of 15.7% and adjusted earnings per share of $0.94. In addition, we continue to generate meaningful free cash flow as we achieved $1.5 billion for fiscal year 2018. For the fourth quarter, we saw a foreign exchange benefit to sales of approximately 1%. Sysco also experienced inflation in our U.S. Broadline business of 1.1%, driven by a few categories, including dairy, frozen potatoes and vegetables and paper disposables, partly offset by deflation in poultry. Within our International business, inflation was driven by a combination of both product costs increasing and currency translation in the U.K. During the quarter, we had gross profit growth of 5.7% driven by overall and local volume growth and improved Sysco Brand penetration. Adjusted operating expenses grew 2.5% for the quarter. The increase in expense was largely driven by supply chain costs in both warehouse and transportation, which were mostly related to increased fuel costs and a tighter labor market and the previously announced investment in our selling organization in our U.S. operations.  Additionally, we continue to make investments in transformation and integration in our International business. These costs were partly offset by favorable comparison in corporate expense versus the prior year that we previously mentioned. As a result, we saw a gap between gross profit dollar growth and adjusted operating expense growth of 320 basis points this quarter. And while we don't expect to see that trend to continue, we do expect our three year plan gap to be approximately 150 basis points. As it relates to taxes, our net earnings for the fiscal year were impacted by lower tax rates from U.S. Tax Reform where our U.S. federal rates went from 35% to 28%. Other favorable impacts include additional credits and tax benefits from stock option exercises. Cash flow from operations was $2.2 billion for fiscal year 2018. Net CapEx for fiscal year 2018 was $666 million or about 1.1% of sales, which was $3 million higher than last year. Free cash flow for fiscal year 2018 was $1.5 billion, which was $83.6 million lower compared to last year, primarily due to a pension plan contribution we discussed last quarter. As Tom mentioned earlier, we also achieved results that exceeded our original three year plan targets, excluding any impact of Brakes. This includes an adjusted return on invested capital, excluding Brakes, of 20.2% and our working capital improvement was 5 days or 1 day better than the original target. Now, I'd like to close with some commentary on the outlook for fiscal 2019. As Tom mentioned, fiscal 2018 was the first year of our current three year plan concluding in fiscal 2020. For this current plan, we continue to feel confident in our ability to achieve our goal of $650 million to $700 million of operating income improvement. The inflationary environment has abated throughout the year and while we can't predict the impact that macroeconomic factors will play in the cost of our products, we believe modest levels of inflation will likely continue for at least the next few quarters. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 1.2% to 1.3% of sales. And from a cash perspective, as we previously stated, our U.S. federal tax rate will drop to 21%. With the addition of state and local jurisdictions, we expect our overall effective tax rate to be approximately 25%, similar to the rate for this year due to some tax benefits that occurred in fiscal 2018 that we anticipate will not fully repeat in fiscal 2019. In summary, we've had a very strong performance over the past three years and the fundamentals of our business remained solid. We are excited about the future as we kick off fiscal 2019. We expect to deliver continued strong top line fundamentals and improved cost management, building on the momentum from the prior three years. Our strategic priorities of enriching the customer experience, delivering operational excellence, optimizing the business and activating the power of our people will accelerate our current growth and position us well for future success. Operator, we're now ready for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Edward Kelly from Wells Fargo.
Edward Kelly: Tom and Joel, I want to start really with gross profit and gross profit per case. The per case result this quarter was a little bit weaker, I guess, than really kind of what we've seen in some time, although there was, it seems like, more M&A benefit this quarter than what we've had. You have a harder comparison there. I was just wondering, is there any real change in the underlying rate of profit per case growth? Or are there -- does this more relate to one-off issues? And I know freight plays a role within all this, so if you could help out with all, that will be great.
Joel Grade: Sure, Ed. I'll start. And I think the answer to that is there really is no, what I'd call, fundamental changes in our view of that. I think you've hit on a couple of the points. I mean, certainly our contract growth was again a bit higher this quarter as well as the freight certainly has still continued to have an impact. And again, we certainly anticipate that continuing, but in terms of any other fundamental impact to that, Ed, I -- there's really none I would call out there.
Edward Kelly: And just as it relates to freight, there's been talk about incremental freight challenges from one of your largest competitors. Can you just maybe talk about what you're seeing in regards to getting product from vendors on a timely basis, filling open driver positions? Any disruption that you are seeing related to any of this or how you're mitigating it? Is it reflected in the top line at all? I mean, it doesn't seem like and maybe you're actually benefiting, but just some help there would be great.
Thomas Bené: Yes. Good morning. This is Tom. Look, we've been talking about this for a few quarters now. I mean, the freight challenges out there are real. I think that every industry who's moving freight is dealing with them. And so what I'd say is -- and I think we went all the way back to our probably second quarter when we first started feeling the impacts of this. We struggled a little bit early on, making sure we were getting our lanes filled. We were getting our service levels from our suppliers where we needed them. We started a very aggressive approach back then and continued on through our third and fourth quarter, trying to really make sure we get the right relationships in place with carriers. We've got the right plans in place with our suppliers so that we don't have the type of service issues that one could expect or might expect in dealing with this situation. So I think we've done a lot of work as a team to mitigate that as much as we can. That doesn't mean we don't have some of the cost impacts because we got to get the freight there. In some cases, we're still having to go to spot market. We're still having to pay higher rates than we were a year ago, but from a service level perspective, I don't think we're having nearly the challenges that maybe some others have talked about. What I'd say as it relates to our own drivers and more on the outbound side, we do have challenges filling driver roles in certain markets where the labor market's just very tight. We see regularly drivers being offered significant upfront incentives to join a company. We're having to do some of that same type of thing. So there -- it is very real that there's a tight market out there for drivers and we're experiencing some of that just like everyone else is.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mandeville from Jefferies.
Christopher Mandeville: Tom, on the case growth acceleration, trends improved really quite nicely on both the one and three year. What would you attribute that to? In terms of influence, how would you rank things? Was it similar to what you outlined on gross profit dollar growth? And have you seen some momentum that was observed in Q4 in 2019 thus far?
Thomas Bené: Chris, yes. So regarding case growth, I'd say really a continuation of a lot of things we’ve talked about, but certainly, e-commerce, as it does grow, we're now at about 50%. We have seen some improved penetration with customers who are buying on the e-commerce site, so that's certainly helping. But I would say the additional MAs that we added in the year and we've talked a bit about that as well as the training programs we now have and the way we can get our MAs up to a rate of productivity a little faster maybe then we've historically been able to would be maybe another driver. We talked a lot about our focus in this area. And I think it really is about, one, applying the resources in the places where the biggest opportunities exist. That's some work we've been doing now for a while. And then additionally, making sure that they've got access to the right resources, whether that's specialists to help them grow the parts of their business where maybe we're underdeveloped or even accelerating our business review process we've talked to you all a fair amount about. So it really is a lot of the same fundamental things, but I think as we -- all those things start to come together, we see that acceleration there. I also mentioned and I think this is true that, that independent customer continues to be kind of well-positioned. And we're seeing that work out for us, too.
Christopher Mandeville: Okay. That's helpful. And then, Joel, just for the three year plan into 2020. This past year that you just completed, you were just shy about 8.5% EBIT growth. Can you just provide some color on how we should think about progression for fiscal '19 that need to show a little element of acceleration in the growth rate? And then what may be the primary drivers are that we should be thinking about for the coming year?
Joel Grade: Sure. So I think one of the things that we've spent a fair bit of time talking about is the idea that, to some extent, FY '18 was certainly a strong finish to the last, but it was also an investment year. We talked about the fact that if you kind of rewound about 1.5 years ago, given the trajectory we're moving on, in the last three year plan, we got a lot of questions on, "Hey, do we -- are we actually extrapolating that out to an even stronger end of the three year plan than we even ended up?" And part of the reason we continued to emphasize that the high end of the range that we were -- had talked about was just the fact that we continue to -- we do have some investments in our business we're planning to make that we anticipate will continue to benefit here over the next three year plan and then certainly beyond. So I would just look at '18 somewhat -- and again, it was something that we had a view of and then talked about of some investments that we've made that we called out in our sales force, in our International business in terms of some of the transformation work from technology, from the integration of the merger from the supply chain in the U.K. And so I think I would look at it that way. And so -- and as we move forward, obviously, the main impact this year that I would say we anticipate accelerating over the course of the three year plan is really somewhere around this gap between gross profit and operating expenses. This year came in at a gap about 1% and, again, much of that was related to some of the investment that we talked about. And so I would anticipate, as we move forward a -- as we called out earlier in the call today, a 1.5% gap as we go through that three year plan and certainly that means, from an expense perspective, probably some improvement there as we move into that three year plan.
Thomas Bené: Chris, the only thing I'll add is, I mean, I think what you should take away is we're committed to that three year plan number that we talked about last December. And so as Joel just said, there's some things we need to accelerate and improve on in '19 and '20 and we feel comfortable we can do that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Judah Frommer from Crédit Suisse.
Judah Frommer: Maybe just to follow-up on some of the questions so far. So for the three year plan going forward with that 1.5% gap between gross profit dollars and OpEx dollars, how should we think about the flattish gross profit per case in the U.S. in Q4 and extrapolating that forward versus the control you have on operating expense and your ability to leverage that line?
Thomas Bené: So Judah, I think, let me just start and I'll let Joel jump in. I mean, when you say flattish gross profit, we are on our kind of gross profit or actually above our gross profit target for the three year plan. So I think we feel good about our ability to deliver the gross profit growth. And obviously, if we can get some help from what's happening with products and inflation, we might -- we feel comfortable we can get there. I think you're raising the point that Joel was just referring to, which is the cost side. We need to continue to focus on the cost to make sure that we can, in fact, keep that 1.5-point gap that we have alluded to over this three year plan. And we've got some work to do there, but I think we feel good about our ability to get there.
Joel Grade: Yes. And again, Judah, just I think the question that you made actually was on the gross profit per case and, again, that's -- as I mentioned earlier, I mean, I don't know that any -- there's a bit of a flattening out at this particular this quarter. Again, I'm not overly concerned about that on a long-term basis. And as Tom said earlier, we certainly feel very good about the -- about our outlook for our three year plan moving forward.
Judah Frommer: Okay. Great. If I could sneak one more in on that national competitor Ed mentioned. So beyond the freight implications, clearly they struggled in this calendar second quarter. Is there anything you'd call out in terms of a benefit from their struggles on cases or kind of business as usual?
Thomas Bené: No. I'd say, look, you guys know, we talk about this pretty often. It's very competitive out there. It remains very competitive. I wouldn't say that -- anything that they talked about was necessarily a similar impact for us. And I'm not necessarily sure we, in any way, benefited by the challenges they were facing. So I think it's pretty much we see the same competitive environment we've always operated in.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short from Barclays.
Karen Short: Just a couple of questions. And in terms of -- I'm going to ask the case growth a little bit differently or the gross profit growth question a little differently. So your case growth was up 5.3% and gross profit was up kind of 5.2%, which is definitely the narrowest gap we've seen in a long time so -- I mean, looking back 8 quarters kind of thing. So is it really just a function of freight or is there anything else you could point to?
Thomas Bené: We talked about there are a couple of things driving that. So if you think about the freight impact for sure on the inbound side; the customer mix, which as Joel talked about earlier, the fact that we had more growth in our national customers or our contract business; and then product mix also comes into play there some so which products are inflating versus not. So I'd say those 3 things and combined probably affect that, but we still feel really good about those numbers. And we're able to basically hold our margin flat given everything else that's going on. We feel actually really good about that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Kirk from RBC.
William Kirk: So in the quarter, your expense control in that final period of the first three year plan, it was very strong. So can you help us better understand those year-over-year improvements? And how do you make sure you aren't cutting resources that may be needed somewhere in the future?
Joel Grade: Sure, this is Joel. So I think a couple of points on that. I mean, number one, as we've headed into this quarter, one of the things that we've given a heads-up to people on is the fact that we anticipated this quarter being in -- this sort of this gap being very strong as it relates to last year due to some things that were in last year's expenses, particularly on the corporate side, that were not in this year. And so -- and we also, I think, made a point today of making sure to point out that, look, this -- obviously, the 3 points -- the 320 basis point gap is extremely strong. That's not something I would look at as a long-term trend, but really settling in around over time, again, this long-term view of 1.5 points between GP and OpEx. And so I -- this is not a matter of somehow doing something that is a onetime expense cut that hit that. It's simply something we anticipated coming. We've continued to improve, again, our management of our expenses. We had a strong year in general in our corporate expenses and so that was something that, over the course of the year, certainly helped us manage the gap that we had and, again, make some of those savings and investing them in our operations as we've talked about throughout the year. But in no way, shape or form should you interpret the strength of what happened in this fourth quarter as somehow anything that was a management or resource that's going to impact us negatively moving forward.
William Kirk: Got it. And on the inflation commentary, I think you said you expect a little or a modest inflation for the next few quarters. Do you expect something different after those next few quarters or that's just the time frame you're comfortable commenting on?
Joel Grade: Yes. I would say that's typically how we comment on these things. Obviously, much beyond that is not really any basis on anything and wouldn't be responsible in our part so that's just our typical comfort of how we look forward.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Sinisi from Morgan Stanley.
Vincent Sinisi: Wanted to just go back to the sales force investments. Could you just kind of give us an update? I know you said kind of part of the solid case growth this quarter was due to that, but kind of where are we, what inning in terms of the low investment? And then just any color you can give us in terms of productivity, what may be the newer class of folks versus years past are looking like? And I know you said kind of e-commerce around 50%. I'm guessing that's the local restaurant cases. I feel like not too long ago it was 40%. So kind of where are some of the better productivity tests going toward, that would be helpful.
Thomas Bené: Sure, Vinnie. I'd say you actually hit on a few of the things yourself, which is e-commerce has continued to grow. As you said, we're at 50% now and which has been kind of an ongoing move. As we talked a lot about how we think about e-commerce, it's really been this customer choice platform. And so we -- the good news is we're seeing more and more customers wanting to migrate to e-commerce. And so the other big thing with our sales force, and so we go back to the MAs. We talked through the last couple of quarters that we've added marketing associates. And we're kind of at that point now. I wouldn't say we're necessarily adding more, but we still have some of the expenses associated with those new marketing associates in our numbers. When I think about getting those more -- those marketing associates more productive, what we're really talking about is how do we get them into a territory where they're actually delivering results. And I think the training programs we now have, the way we bring them on board and the type of more focused effort we got around that is really helping us get them into a territory starting to produce, if you will, on a much quicker basis. We used to talk about that would take 18 months to two years to get someone up to speed and we're -- we've cut that in about half now. We believe that, that is certainly something that we're going to continue to get better at. Part of what helps drive that is the support resources we give them as we try to move them from being order takers to more consultative sellers. And I think we've made really good progress there as well. And our people -- so our people's capability is growing. Therefore, how they're investing their time is getting better. And that's translating into not only larger territories, but more importantly, more effective and productive selling resources.
Vincent Sinisi: Okay. Super helpful. And if I could just slide one other one in here. Just turning to International for a second. Granted, I kind of knew the currency translation and inflation, all that was continuing to be a part. Just more on the kind of what's more under your guys' control with the temperature zones and more of the fundamental changes, where would you say we kind of are with some of those investments from an inning perspective?
Thomas Bené: Sure. I think we're still early days on a lot of those investments. Now, we kind of break up some of the countries in Europe. We talked about the Irish business where we had owned Pallas Foods for quite a few years now. That integration between Brakes and the Pallas business in Ireland has actually gone very well and I'd say in that place where we're close to the end of our full investment as well as benefits that are coming out of there. In the U.K. and France in particular, both those geographies, we still are kind of early days and are investing there to get these distribution businesses and the operating environment, we talked about our multi-temp, up to where we'd like it to be. The good news is, in both places, we think once we get there, that will be a competitive advantage for us, but we do have a few years ahead of us of investments and really bring that organization along to some of those changes.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short from Barclays.
Karen Short: My follow-up quick question would be on International, when we look at obviously the improvement throughout the year, as we look to '19, how should we think about the kind of run rate? Should we think about it as more related to the back half of this year or do you think you'll actually start getting to see a little bit more profitability?
Joel Grade: Yes. And so, again, I think you remember the -- some of the calendar challenges that we outlined in the beginning that actually had certainly a more positive second half than the first half of the year, but I would anticipate and think about that business more along the lines of what you saw in the second half. The first half was clearly impacted by a fairly negative calendar impact. And I think there's certainly an expectation that we continue to grow profits there. I think that's a more reasonable run rate to think about within second half of the year.
Karen Short: Okay. And then just to follow-up on inflation. I know you've talked about modest inflation. So is it -- is there a chance though, do you think, that we end up going back into deflation, I guess, in your fiscal '19? And then also thoughts on inflation, both from an FX perspective and just product cost in International?
Joel Grade: So in the U.S. Broadline, just to your first question, again, our current view is that we anticipate a modest level of inflation. So at this point, we're not seeing what you're suggesting in terms of deflation, but I would say a modest level of inflation. In the European, primarily in the U.K., again, depending on the variability of the sterling, we certainly still anticipate some challenges there given the fact that, I think as we talked about, probably half their product is procured from outside of the U.K. Obviously, they're working hard to do things to manage that more effectively, but that still continues to be an issue and we anticipate that to carry forward a bit.
Thomas Bené: Karen, just on that inflation in the U.S., it has gotten less throughout the year. So the beginning of the year, we talked it was a couple, 2 to 3 points. It has slowed to kind of 1 to 1.5. So it is slowing. We don't necessarily believe that's going to go deflationary, but you're right in assuming that it's mitigating some.
Joel Grade: Well, I think just one other comment on that. I mean, the categories, Tom mentioned earlier in his comments, it does matter in terms of the categories. And we have seen some deflation in some of the center of the plate categories, poultry are less inflation, I would say. And meat has been another one of those, as of late, we've seen some of that. So I think there's -- that gets back a little bit of the GP per case as well and -- but there's been some level of that, that we experienced.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Wolf from Loop Capital Markets.
Andrew Wolf: I wanted to focus on the U.S. Foodservice and the big step-up in the organic case growth for the local customers. Could you kind of help allocate that? I know you hired -- you're hiring sales folks. How would you allocate that between the existing customers doing a little better because it looked like the restaurant sector picked up in the second quarter, account penetration and maybe your sales folks bringing in some new customers?
Thomas Bené: Andrew, I think it's a combination of all those things. We have seen -- which is good news -- we have seen our penetration, which is that same-store turn going up, which is good. That's some of the hardest growth to get, but we have seen penetration improve, which does speak, I think, positively around some of the trends we're seeing in the industry. And then obviously, we continue to focus on new customer growth and that's always an opportunity and certainly something that's the lifeblood of this business. So it's really a combination of both.
Andrew Wolf: And I don't know if I missed this, but could you give us a quantitative -- like, how much -- what is your growth rate in the sales force?
Thomas Bené: We don't necessarily comment on the number of salespeople we've added, but again, we're much more targeted today than we were in the past and we feel good about how we approach the focused kind of resourcing that we do out in the market.
Andrew Wolf: And just one follow-up. Can you give us a sense of the cadence of the acceleration in the organic case growth and sort of sustainability and how's it going quarter towards to-date?
Joel Grade: Yes. So I'll take that. We're actually -- I think we've got also a decent start here in the first part of this year. So in other words, this wasn't some type of a onetime shot at the end of the year. We continue to see some good progress here in the first part of this year.
Andrew Wolf: Okay. So would that -- so the cadence was kind of moderately up and it's maintained or something along those lines?
Joel Grade: Correct.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Marisa Sullivan from Bank of America.
Marisa Sullivan: I just wanted to touch on gross margin outlook for fiscal 2019 and just kind of talk through some of the puts and takes. For freight, how should we think about your assumptions for freight if you start to lap the step-up post-hurricanes last year? Are you kind of assuming steady state? Are you assuming that it could potentially get better or worse? And then on customer mix, how should we think about the headwinds and tailwinds? You've brought on some new chain customers that I assume are lower gross margin. How much of a headwind would that be and what are some of the offsets?
Thomas Bené: Sure, Marisa. So I think the -- as you think about the freight, look, I think we do know we're going to start lapping some of that here in our second quarter. I think that based on that, we kind of think about that maybe flat to maybe up slightly. Again, hard to predict what's going to continue to happen in this space. And then as you think about customer mix, that obviously will continue to play a role until we cycle some of that new national customer business. But we look to -- continue to look at obviously category management as a way to offset some of that as well as our Sysco Brand, which we continue to be very focused on. So if you think about the combination of inflation, the work we're doing around category management in our Sysco Brand, our revenue management tools we talked about to help us manage through that inflation and even deflation, if it flips on us, we feel like -- we feel pretty good about our gross margin focus. We are not looking to see a step-up necessarily in gross margin on a percentage basis, but we aren't necessarily looking to see it go the other way either. We're just looking to manage it as best as possible in the new year.
Marisa Sullivan: Got it. Just as a follow-up on private label, you've obviously seen some nice growth in the penetration. How much more runway do you think there is for increasing private label penetration? Will it come more from the local customers or do you actually see some opportunities on the contract customer side?
Thomas Bené: I think we see it actually on both. And there probably maybe even more opportunity on the contract side. I think there's work we still have to do there to create the environment that's easy for all those customers to participate more in Sysco Brand, but we still see an opportunity in the local customers as well. It's really a balance of making sure we're bringing out the right type of products. You heard me talk about the Cutting Edge Solutions and we're now at 1 million cases. A majority of those items are Sysco Brand items and we can continue to bring innovative solution-type products to the marketplace. We are seeing good traction there and we think that creates even more runway for us on the Sysco Brand.
Joel Grade: Yes. And Marisa, again, just as a reminder, that's -- we don't necessarily -- we don't set a target per se in terms of it, but we certainly do expect -- anticipate some continued runway there. And again, it's all driven by our ability to continue to drive value-added products in the marketplace. That creates a pull on our demand for those products and ultimately grows our percentages.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse from Goldman Sachs.
Karen Holthouse: A couple of follow-ups to things that you've talked about already. First, on the International business, should we think of next year's year-over total investment dollars could still be going up or still high but maybe a step-down from this year?
Joel Grade: Karen, this is Joel. I would think about that as still having some level of increase next year.
Karen Holthouse: Great. And then just maybe remind us as we're looking into the third -- or the fiscal first quarter, any sort of things we should be keeping in mind in terms of laps related to hurricane disruptions last year, either on the case growth or the cost side?
Joel Grade: I don't know that I'd sort of overemphasize that. I mean, there may be a little bit of it, but I mean, the reality of it is, I mean, we managed our way through that pretty well. Again, over the last question, Marisa, on the freight, there's probably going to be a little bit of overlap when we saw some of that big impact in the second quarter, but in general, I -- we're not anticipating anything real significant there in terms of the overlap.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania from BMO Capital.
Kelly Bania: Curious in terms of both freight and fuel prices. I guess, in the context of your performance this quarter and as you look out over the next few years and part of your three year plan, can you just help us understand the magnitude of the pressures from those factors? Are there items that are coming in better than you expected to offset those pressures? Or are you just maybe conservatively forecasting those areas with some cushion in order to still kind of beat or meet your targets?
Joel Grade: Well, I guess, I'll start. And I think the main way I'd think about that from a freight perspective, I mean, obviously the three year plan and there's a lot of puts and takes on a lot of these numbers. We certainly have committed to a level of growth in gross profit and OpEx in a relative basis and certainly feel good about the fact that we have -- again, feel strongly about achieving those numbers. In other words, some of the takes that we may have on fuel in terms of the freight from the gross profit area, we certainly anticipate strong results in growing our local cases and our brand, our category management, our revenue management. There's certainly all these things that we've factored into this whole thing, realizing not everything goes exactly how you think it's going to all the time, but feeling very good about that number. On the fuel side, again, from a magnitude perspective, I mean, there's a couple of cents per case in fuel that have been impacting us here. But certainly, and as we've talked about, we've done a lot of work around some derivative hedges to make sure that we're giving ourselves some consistency, some stability around those numbers and that's certainly, if it's kind of on a rolling basis, a year ahead. And so I think that's certainly good -- at least 2/3 of our fuel purchases are covered by some of that and so there's certainly some level of consistency we achieved through that. So I guess, what I would say to you is, I mean, the -- we are -- one of our roles in running this company is there's a lot of puts and takes that go into some of this stuff and we certainly believe there's enough levers to pull in different places to -- that neither of those two things are going to have any dramatic impact to us as we look at our three year plan, but challenges nonetheless.
Thomas Bené: Kelly, the only thing I'd add on the operating expense side is with that fuel pressure that Joel talked about and this more our side now, the delivery driver, retention and hiring along with some just challenges we're seeing starting to see in that same way in the warehouse, we just have to be really good at driving productivity in our supply chain. And so those are real headwinds that we'll be dealing with. And what we're very focused on is how do we cover those through productivity improvements, whether that's in the way we -- our cases that we deliver per truck and per route and all the metrics that we really focus on to improve the overall productivity of our operation. So that's -- to Joel's point, we have a lot of that, that we try to build in. We've got a lot of work to do. And we probably have more headwinds than we've had in a few years, mostly driven by the tight labor market and some of the recent fuel increases.
Kelly Bania: Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe, Joel, just one other one for you just in terms of the quarter, the operating income growth. If my math is correct, it seems to imply that the Brakes operating income was kind of flat year-over-year. Is that the right way to think about it for the quarter?
Joel Grade: I think it's roughly that. I think it's not the -- if you kind of back out all the FX impacts and on an adjusted basis, our whole International operation was up a little bit. And so I think Brakes was probably off a bit. I would not -- I'd call more down slightly than flat.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel from Guggenheim.
John Heinbockel: Two things. On the selective, very surgical MA hiring that you did over the last year, were those predominantly experienced distribution foodservice salespeople? And, I guess, those investments have worked. Were those markets kind of one-off or is there opportunity to do the same thing very strategically in other markets and get a similar return?
Thomas Bené: John, so I think there -- the approach we now have, I would tell you that there's opportunities in many markets. And some markets are bigger than others where we've got -- where our -- maybe our market position is a little stronger, but many markets have those opportunities. And as far as the type of individual we're hiring, I'd say it's a combination. We certainly are still finding folks who are looking to join Sysco who got experience either in the industry on our side kind of the industry or even on the operator side of the industry. And then we also, with our new program, have brought in some folks more earlier in their career and we now have a program, a development training program and onboarding program that allows us to do that. And so it's really a balance of -- we're looking for the best people in general, who we feel like would be successful working for Sysco.
John Heinbockel: Is the greatest impact of that -- of this hiring cycle, say the last, I don't know, 6, 9, 12 months, is that still ahead of us or we're at that run rate now?
Thomas Bené: If you're talking about from a total number, we did a majority of that this last year or the year that we're in, right, that we're talking about. So there's little bit of an overhang as we go into '19. We continue to hire obviously. We have -- we turn up a bit of the sales force every year. So we're always in the market hiring and we're always going to look at putting those people where the biggest opportunities exist. And so you should think about it more as we're going to continue to use the tools we have now to deploy a selling organization in the right places. As we talked earlier, hopefully, continue to drive more productivity because of things like e-commerce and focusing them more on consultative selling versus order taking. But generally speaking, I wouldn't think about a further ramp-up of more MAs in fiscal year '19.
John Heinbockel: And then just lastly, the outbound driver shortage. Do you think -- has that had any adverse impact on top line over the past, whatever, six months, one year? Or is it really more throwing more cost and more dollars at the situation? And then what can you do as you think about giving drivers sort of an ability to do more? Is there any way to restructure how you load trucks, how you lay out the processes so that the existing drivers can actually do more out on the road?
Thomas Bené: John, it's a really good question and an important point. I think -- if you think about one of the things we've talked about recently is we even got an initiative out there. We talked about small vehicle initiative. And part of the reason for that is there are really couple of drivers of it, not the least which is the fact that it enables us to get around with smaller drops to customers to increase our -- and improve our service level. But one of the things we're also learning is that because those trucks don't require a certain class driver, that we -- the pool of potential candidates to fill those routes is larger. And that's something that we're going to be accelerating in fiscal year '19 because we've gotten the learnings now and seen some of the benefits. So that's certainly one way that we're going to try to deal with this ongoing challenge. And then additionally, you talked about -- look, anything we can do to move more effort into the warehouse and make it easier for that delivery driver to do his job not only creates satisfaction for them, but also helps us deliver and meet the service requirements of our customers. Ultimately, as you articulated, I think it had probably maybe a small impact in certain markets when we can't get the drivers that we need from a top line perspective, but more importantly, I think it's affecting our cost and it's why we've got to continue to look for new and different ways to manage that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ajay Jain from Pivotal.
Ajay Jain: My question is more industry-specific. So even if it's not evident in your results, I'm just wondering if there's any industry-specific softness that might be impacting your competitors more than Sysco. So in terms of overall spending in independents, traffic and based on net unit growth for independents, are you seeing any change at all from an industry perspective as you're heading into fiscal '19?
Thomas Bené: Ajay, I actually think we see a lot of positive trends still in the industry. So I don't think we see really a lot of negative headwinds relating to industry performance. If you look at the quarter 2 for various parts of the industry that were fairly positive, certainly still some traffic challenges across some of the segments, but the spend was up very nicely. And so I think we continue to feel pretty good about it. The food-away-from-home, while growing less maybe than it did for a while, is still positive. And so we're seeing pretty good trends. And we think that not the least, which is like this delivery trend, you think about food delivery, the results we're hearing is they're seeing pretty significant growth, like 40% to 50% growth in that area. So that just creates more opportunities for consumers to get the products they want from restaurants. So we're seeing a lot of positives.
Ajay Jain: Okay. And obviously, you finished the three year growth plan on a high note. And I think, Tom, you mentioned in the prepared comments that, that figure excludes Brakes. So if that's the case, I estimate you did something like $105 million of operating income growth in Q4 alone. That's 3x more than the prior quarter. So does that sound right? I think you were at $526 million through Q3.
Joel Grade: Yes, Ajay. I'll take that. It's Joel. I mean, so obviously, part of that is some seasonality. Our third quarter typically is a smaller quarter. So it's just purely -- excuse me, compare Q3 and Q4. Again, I wouldn't expect that to actually be similar. And as we talked about heading into this quarter, I guess, you're correct. It is -- there is no impact whatsoever Brakes with that number. It is a -- we had a strong quarter. We anticipated some year-over-year impact on some corporate expenses that we had in the prior year versus this year, but in general, we had a strong quarter and certainly finished the year and the three year plan out in a strong way.
Ajay Jain: Okay. And just finally, I think you had some kind of calendar shift in the reporting for Brakes. So Joel, I think you mentioned that Brakes didn't play a role in the fourth quarter performance, but I thought that there was some kind of a change to conform to your fiscal year ending in June from December at Brakes. So can you quantify if there was any benefit as a result of vendor allowances in the latest quarter for Brakes in terms of the year-over-year incremental impact, if there was any?
Joel Grade: Sure. So we don't quantify specifically. What I can say to you is you're correct. We did talk about a calendar shift that impacted, I'd say, negatively the first half of the year and more positively the second half of the year for Brakes. However, that had zero impact at all on our three year plan. The vendor allowances you're referring to in any sort would actually be anything would be in their business and that would all be within Brakes and so there's no impact at all in any of the numbers that we had as far as our three year plan. It's a very pure number and we exceeded it, what we actually had called out earlier. We came out ahead. We feel very good about it.
Operator: Your next question comes from John Ivankoe from JP Morgan.
John Ivankoe: I wanted to go get back to a couple of questions ago and tie that in to your prepared remarks where you mentioned the additional delivery options. I mean, clearly, we understand some drivers don't necessarily need CDL licenses and they can be in sprinter-type vehicles. But I wanted to get a sense, are we beyond pilot at this point and you're kind of thinking about doing that where it makes sense nationally? And secondly, does this type of service make sense to be driven in that your main operating companies? Or are you considering a number of smaller distribution facilities, I guess, kind of spokes, if you will, within different metropolitan areas can actually be closer to the customer to where the driver can go back and forth and reach more customers in a day than just operating out of the operating company itself?
Thomas Bené: So I'd say, look, we've been in pilot mode for a while and we've looked at both what I would call metro urban markets as well as more standard operating companies and we have learnings from each of those. We will continue to add these in the market. We feel like it's -- the results have been positive. And it's really -- there's no one set situation. These are not fill-in -- these are not recovery-type vehicles, meaning if we have something that's missed or a product comes in late that we get it out to the customer, this is actually part of our everyday delivery and routing. And so we're seeing lots of different benefits in different markets for different reasons, but a little bit of all the things you talked about are certainly options for us and something we'll continue to learn about and as we expand it.
John Ivankoe: And when you look at the total addressable market, I mean, how much do you think that the total addressable market for Sysco grows just because you can -- it's a different kind of customer, it's a different amount of case volume requirement, maybe in some cases, you actually pay for delivery? How big of an idea is this, if you're ready to talk about that?
Thomas Bené: Well, first of all, it's still very early as we're going through this learning, but I don't necessarily think it opens up a new market for us. I think it's just being more efficient with what we do today. And whether it's the size of the drop and we have a smaller vehicle than a larger one making that drop or allows us to get into some places that are a little harder to deliver to, but I don't think necessarily opens some new market for us.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation.

Tom Bené : Thank you, Neil, and good morning, everyone. I’d like to start the company’s key themes that drove our results for the quarter along with some comments on the current macroenvironment that we are operating in, followed by a discussion of our U.S. Food Service Operations business and concluding with the discussion of our International and other business segments.  Joel will then discuss the financial results in more detail. This quarter, we were able to deliver solid results that include adjusted operating income growth of 7.1% compared to the prior year and adjusted earnings per share of $0.67.  There were number of key business drivers that impacted the results for the quarter including strong gross profit dollar growth, despite adverse weather in multiple geographies and continued investments that we are making across our business. Turning to the macro environments, the overall trends continue to be generally favorable in the United States. This led to improved spend for the Retail and Food Services sectors and somewhat favorable conditions for Food Service operators as sales at restaurants continue to rise offsetting somewhat lower traffic counts. We also see continued growth with local customers as they increased their reach through innovative concepts and additional delivery methods. Economic growth in the International markets in which we operate was mostly positive including modest growth in the Food Service sector.  Looking at our results, sales grew 6.1% to $14.3 billion driven by strong performance from our local customers, the addition of new customers accelerating our national customer growth, product cost inflation and an acquisition.  As we shared during our Investor Day, we are focused on M&A activity as a part of our strategy and have recently closed three acquisitions, HFM in Hawaii, Kent Frozen Food in the UK, and Doerle Food Service in Louisiana.  We are excited about all three companies and the talented associates that we are bringing into the Sysco family. However, only the results of HFM are included in our third quarter results.  Gross profit grew 5.6% driven by positive case growth and effective ongoing management of product cost inflation. While we continue to face some challenges from inbound freight cost, the trend has been somewhat improving and was less of an impact in the third quarter.  Additionally, the growth of Sysco brand, which now comprises nearly 46% of local cases resulted in incremental gross profit dollars. Sysco brand continues to be driven by customers’ interest and our growing breadth of products offered across multiple categories and tiers along with continued progress from our brand revitalization efforts and new innovative products from our cutting-edge solutions process. From an expense perspective, adjusted operating expense for the quarter grew 5.2% driven by ongoing strategic investments in the business and a few operational challenges that impacted the quarter. Some of those investments include supply chain transformation work occurring in Europe, the investment in marketing associates in the U.S., and the continued investments in technology that will ultimately translate into a more enriching experience for our customers.  One example is the investment we are making in Sysco Labs. Our Sysco Labs teams, in conjunction with our business technology team, continue to enhance our technology offerings to customers including further enhancements to support the ordering process and how customers receive products from us, all intended to make it easier for customers to do business with us.  Overall, we delivered adjusted operating income growth of 7.1% to $536 million and with the addition of tax benefits, EPS growth was meaningfully higher than the prior year as adjusted EPS grew 31% to $0.67. The operational improvement in our business is a direct result of our business strategy that is predicated in our disciplined profitable and stable growth with an emphasis on local customers.  We have continued to make strides in the execution of our strategic priorities and focusing on satisfying the needs of our customers.  Transitioning to our quarterly results by business segments, beginning with U.S. Food Service operations. Sales grew 5.1% for the quarter, gross profit grew 4.1%, adjusted operating expenses grew 5.9% and adjusted operating income grew 1.2%. For the quarter, top-line results were strong as local case growth in our U.S. Broadline business was 2.6% including the acquisition of HFM and has now grown for 16 consecutive quarters. We continue to see strong growth from our local customers who are able to introduce new and fresh concepts to consumers are positively responding to. National customer case growth was 2.2% driving overall case growth of 2.4%. The solid case growth performance translated into healthy gross profit dollar growth of 4.1% as customer mix continue to improve as we grew local cases faster than national cases.  Additionally, the previously mentioned growth in Sysco brands also contributed positively to the gross profit dollar growth.  Turning our attention to cost, our adjusted operating expense growth for the quarter was 5.9% driven by increased supply chain cost in both warehouse and transportation due to a combination of weather impacts and the continuation of ramp up cost for new business, our ongoing investment in our selling organizations, specifically marketing associates in an effort to accelerate our local sales and increased bad debt expense as a result of year-over-year comparisons to a very strong prior year.  Moving on to International Food Service operations, we had strong results for the quarter with sales growing 10.7%, gross profit growing 12.9%, adjusted operating expenses growing 13% and adjusted operating income growing 11.6%. Top-line growth was strong for the quarter despite winter storms that had a negative sales and cost impact across parts of our European and Canadian businesses due to reduced shipping days.  Additionally, we continued to experience acute product inflation in the mid to high-single-digits across the European business also impacting our gross profit growth for the quarter. From a cost perspective, we continue to make investments in our supply chain transformation across Europe including a recently announced integration of Brakes France and Davigel to become Sysco friends.  The merger of these two businesses will position us well for continued success in the French marketplace enabling new capabilities and allowing us to offer unique multi-temperature service to better adapt to our customers’ growing needs as well as to provide access to new customer segments.  In addition, we are investing in new capabilities such as technology solutions and modernization of existing facilities which are being implemented across the business to enrich the customer experience of doing business with Sysco, which will ultimately lead to improved loyalty and accelerated case growth with our local customers.  Despite the positive top-line performance and the various investments mentioned, the sequential improvement in operating income results for international were largely related to the Sysco calendar timing shifts for our European business.  We continue to focus on executing against our long-term plans by investing in necessary capabilities across the international business and leveraging our position as a platform for future growth.  Finally, SYGMA continued top-line growth during the quarter with sales up 4.6% and piece growth of nearly 2%. However, the business continues to struggle with expenses including inbound trade issues and increased transportation expenses due to driver challenges and third-party spend to meet the high service level expectations of our customers.  In summary, we are encouraged by the solid fundamentals of our business, specifically the top-line growth trajectory we are on while continuing to invest in our future growth. As we approach the conclusion of our initial three year plan, I remain confident that we are on track to achieve the high-end to $600 million to $650 million range of adjusted operating income improvement target.  Additionally, we remain confident in our ability to deliver our new three year plan including the financial targets we laid out during Investor Day as a part of this plan. We continue to make the necessary investments in our people, technology and training that will lay the foundation for future growth.  And I’d like to thank our dedicated Sysco associates for all that they are doing to execute on our customer and operational strategies, which will ultimately improve our customers’ experience of doing business with us and also for making Sysco the distributor of choice for our customers.  Now I would like to turn the call over to Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer. 
Joel Grade : Thank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Tom mentioned earlier, we are pleased with the top-line fundamental results for the third quarter. Sales and gross profit growth were strong as we saw positive impacts from case growth, inflation and continued Sysco brand growth.  Adjusted operating income reflect continued investments while with some ongoing challenges this quarter. However, we are able to generate operating leverage leading to adjusted operating income growth of 7.1% and with the additional tax benefits, adjusted earnings per share of $0.67.  In addition, we continue to generate meaningful free cash flow as we posted $768 million in the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2018. As for our quarterly results, for the third quarter, sales grew 6.1%, gross profit grew 5.6%, while adjusted operating expense grew 5.2%, which resulted in an adjusted operating income growth of 7.1% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 31.4% to $0.67 per share. For the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we saw foreign exchange benefit to sales of approximately 1.6%. Sysco experienced inflation across all of our segments in the third quarter. In our U.S. Broadline business, we experienced 2.6% inflation driven by a few categories including meat, dairy and produce. With our International business, inflation was a combination of both product cost increasing and currency translation in the UK. During the quarter, we had gross profit growth of 5.6% driven by overall volume growth and improved Sysco brand penetration.  As Tom mentioned earlier, trade expense trends have somewhat improved and were not as significant of a headwind as in previous quarters. Adjusted operating expenses grew 5.2% for the quarter. The increase in expense was largely driven by supply chain costs both warehouse and transportation, which were partly related to adverse weather and increased fuel costs, the previously announced investment in our selling organization and increased bad debt expense in our U.S. operations.  Additionally, we continue to make investments in transformation and integration in our International businesses. During the quarter, we achieved operating pre-tax leverage as gross profit dollar growth outpaced adjusted operating expense growth. We saw a gap of 40 basis points this quarter and we expect to continue to improve this trend in the fourth quarter.  As it relates to taxes, our results for the third quarter were impacted by a benefit from a constitution of $330 million to derisk and fund our defined benefit retirement plan, which was deductible using fiscal 2017 tax rates, tax benefits from stock option exercises and additional tax credits. Cash flow from operations was $1.1 billion for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2018. Net CapEx for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2018 was $356 million or about 0.8% of sales, which was roughly $39 million lower compared to last year.  Free cash flow for the quarter declined $232 million driven by a deferred tax payment from the second quarter of fiscal 2018 due to relief from Hurricane Harvey and the contribution of our defined benefit retirement plan.  However, free cash flow for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2018 was $768 million, which was $81 million higher compared to the same period last year.  Now I would like to transition to three business updates. First, regarding our new effective tax rate following tax reform. As a reminder, due to the way our fiscal year fell from July to June, our U.S. statutory rates for fiscal 2018 is 28% and our U.S. statutory rate for fiscal 2019 and beyond will be 21%. Over time, we expect that our effective tax rate will be in the range of 25% to 26%.  However, we anticipate that for fiscal 2018, our effective tax rate will be slightly lower as we continue to work through various initiatives and opportunities. Second, regarding the annual savings from lower taxes.  We’ve invested a portion of those savings in our associates by increasing our ongoing contributions to the Sysco 41-K plant. We continued to evaluate our options with regard to how best to utilize the balance of the savings and we will do so consistent with our capital allocations priorities.  We believe this is an opportunity to reinvest in our business and further strengthen our competitive advantage.  Finally, regarding CapEx, we have previously forecasted investment of 1.4% and 1.5% of sales for fiscal year 2018 as we plan to move spend from fiscal year 2019 into fiscal year 2018. Based on current spend levels, we anticipate finishing the fiscal year somewhat lower than previously forecasted.  In summary, I remain confident that we are on track to achieve our three year planned financial objectives including the high-end of the $600 million to $650 million range of improved adjusted operating income compared in fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2015 excluding Brakes. Fundamentals of our business remains strong as we expect to deliver solid local case growth, good gross profit dollar growth and improved cost management, while continuing to help our customers to be successful.  Operator, we are now ready for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question is from the line of Judah Frommer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. 
Judah Frommer : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. First maybe just on the tax reform reinvestment. There is a little bit of confusion out there with the second three-year plan and whether anything has been restated for tax reform? I think, based on the CAGNY disclosure, it’s only EPS, but if you could help us out with what is and what isn’t good in that three year plan that that would be helpful?
Joel Grade: Yes, it’s Joel, Judah, thanks for your question. Just to really make sure I am understanding your question properly. You are asking a benefit ultimately on the new three year plan of the tax reform. And so that’s what I am answering. At CAGNY, we talked about this benefit of $0.20 to $0.25 on the EPS line, which continues to be our view of how we see that little before. So that’s our – that’s current guidance we’ve given and that’s our continued current view of it. 
Judah Frommer : Okay. So, like the operating income guidance, that would include any potential reinvestment of tax reform dollars?
Joel Grade: Yes, I would say it this way. I mean, the three-year plan we’ve laid out – if you recall it doesn’t create a slightly increased level of capital investment, which wasn’t directly related to tax reform. But the answer to your question is that the net income impacts in the operating income over the next three years factor considers those areas where we have invested in the benefits thereof. 
Judah Frommer : Okay. That’s helpful. And maybe just quickly, just in terms of the independent landscape and kind of all three public players, before talking the same way about the attractiveness of the opportunity there, is there any bumping up against larger competitors when you are competing for independent business more than there was, let’s say three, six, months ago?
Tom Bené: Hey, Judah, this is Tom. I’d say, look, this business as we talk for a long time continues to be very competitive. I don’t think there is anything newer that we are seeing from either the bigger publicly traded guys or even the regional players that are out there.  I think everyone knows that this is an attractive space and so, they always have and they’ll continue to participate in this space and it’s coming upon us to containing to do things that differentiates Sysco from everybody else to continue to earn that business. But I wouldn’t say there is anything new or different that’s come about lately. 
Judah Frommer : Okay. Thanks a lot and good luck. 
Tom Bené: Thanks. 
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Vincent Sinisi with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Vincent Sinisi : Hey, great. Thanks very much. Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to ask about freight. It was the current thing to hear that you said it improved somewhat this quarter. Just wonder if you can give us some color on, I mean, to our understanding certainly the capacity is still constrained. So was it more what you are doing when you are negotiating on the rates are – just give us a little more color on there and then kind of, are you holding things status quo from a freight perspective as we go forward the next couple quarters?
Tom Bené: Hey, Vini, it’s Tom. So, look, the freight environment obviously continues to be somewhat challenging out there and I know everyone is seeing that, hearing that. I think our point here is there have been a few things that we’ve been able to do and we talked about this over the last couple quarters that we needed to be able to work with the suppliers and work with the carriers both to improve the situation we ran into especially in our second quarter or the fourth quarter of last calendar year.  The more freight on the road obviously creates pressure for everybody. There is driver challenges and there is obviously just capacity challenges. I think the combination in Q3 will be probably saw as a little bit of softening of some of that pressure that was there and at the end of last calendar year or in our second quarter.  But also I think our teams doing a nice job working with our various carrier partners ensuring that we were getting the loads we needed and the coverage that we expected as part of our agreements. And candidly working with suppliers too to help soften some of the impact that’s out there. As it relates to going forward, I think it’s anybody’s guess.  I mean, we continue to manage this thing. It’s knock up I think on a lot of us at the end of last calendar year and we are doing everything we can to manage it. It’s still impacting us, but hopefully, we will see more of what we saw in Q3 – or Q3 going forward, but it’s a little too hard for us to call that from where we sit. 
Vincent Sinisi : Okay. Thanks, Tom. And then, maybe just a quick follow-up on Brakes, specifically, more on the fundamental kind of the integration temperatures zones and all that, can you just kind of a little update where we are in terms of progress there? 
Tom Bené: Sure. 
Vincent Sinisi : Thanks a lot. 
Tom Bené: So, If you think about the Brakes acquisition, we’re now about 18 months into the acquisition and over the last, call it, year or so, we spent a fair amount of time reinforcing of the Sysco approach and model to the business I’d say in that first nine months, we are just getting our bearings straight on what we acquired and what we had there.  And what was going on in the market as you also know, at least in the UK a lot of things were happening in the UK market with Brexit. So with this last year what we’ve done is, spent more time focused on what are kind of things that we need in place to sustainably grow this business, similar to what we do here in the U.S. with a focus on local customers.  And so what we’ve learned over that time is that there are investments we need to make in the supply chain area, specifically, and we’ve always talked about this transformation in the UK, but multi-temperature which is common ground here in the U.S. and not the way we operate is not necessarily that way in all of Europe and certainly in the business that we had acquired.  So we are investing in multi-temperature, which means, think about that is, one facility being able to provide all three temperature frozen, chilled and dry on one truck and we didn’t have that in all markets. And that’s an ongoing investment we are going to make. We’ve also have a better sense of what capability we had from a technology perspective in each of the countries and we are making some investments there.  And I’d say, lastly, there is some structural things that we needed to get in place to make sure we could operate the business the way needed to across this international segment and that’s with some resources we are putting in place in Europe, specifically to oversee a lot of the efforts we have going on over there. So it’s been a – it’s you hear and you see obviously the number of investments we are making there.  We believe it really is important for us to continue to position ourselves well for the future and ultimately to start to get the value that we believe exists in those markets and in those businesses we acquired. 
Vincent Sinisi : All right. That’s helpful color. Best of luck guys. 
Tom Bené: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Chris Mandeville with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Chris Mandeville : Hey, thanks for taking my question. Joel, if I could get some clarity and I apologize if I didn’t understand it correctly here, but, on the new three-year outlook, are you still evaluating how you might use tax reform on a go-forward basis and leaving things open to possibly adjusting your three-year goals on the EBIT line or is it’s effectively final you remain confident in growing EBIT $650 million to $700 million over 2017 numbers?
Joel Grade: Yes, just to be clear, there is only lack of clarification on this, you should ask it again. No, we are not adjusting our targets for our next three-year plan. Our targets for our next three-year plan is $650 million to $700 million as we talked at out Investor Day. We are simply – what we had said is we are continuing to evaluate the options for investing that, but certainly again, our targets are what they are.
Chris Mandeville : Okay. So the timing could shift a bit, but nonetheless the end target is same, okay. And then, just any insights on how cases may have trended in U.S. during the quarter? And how Easter and/or weather may have affected yourselves? And then, any willingness to discuss quarter-to-day trends?
Tom Bené: Chris, just on – I am missing pieces what you are saying. Are you just talking about how weather affected the U.S. or just share trends in general?
Chris Mandeville : Yes, so, it’s just in terms of the case cadence throughout this quarter, how Easter and weather impacted the overall quarter and then, if you see willingness to discuss quarter-to-day trends?
Tom Bené: Okay. So, actually, we talk through, we certainly had weather impacts, both in the U.S. and in some of our International businesses as everyone is pretty aware of what happened in the U.S., specifically, let’s say, in the Northeast, but also some around the whole eastern corridor. So we certainly saw some impacts for that weather on our volume.  The other thing that we did not talk about last quarter, that we went back and did a little bit of work on, look, as we think about the shift that happened at the end of last quarter around the New Year’s holiday, we also probably had a small impact in our business in Q3, because of that shift that took place in Q2, meaning, we got a – what we think about a 50 basis point impact, volume that went into Q2 that hit the prior year would have gone into Q3.  So I’d say, those kind of things slightly impacted our volume for this quarter. But we continue to feel pretty good about the overall industry trends. There has been some choppiness because of that weather, you saw that in the March sales numbers for a lot of our restaurant operators.  But, generally speaking, we feel good about the fundamentals in the business and believe that these segments continue to be an opportunity and as we’ve talked numerous times, given our market share position, we believe there is plenty of opportunity for us to grow whether it’s in restaurants or other segments across the Food Service landscape.
Chris Mandeville : And is there any real ability to quantify the weather impact and/or the Easter benefit as many restaurants call that out?
Tom Bené: I don’t think it’s necessarily easy to quantify it, because you get so many year-over-year impacts. We believe – we certainly know when we lose shipping days that we – you don’t easily get those back in this business, as we all know, it’s not like, hey, I didn’t go out last week because of the weather, I am going to out twice this week. That’s not usually how it happens. So, I think the reality is, you lose those days, but we deal with this year in and year out. It just have to be a little more affected in fiscal year – in our fiscal year 2018. 
Joel Grade: Chris, we haven’t quantified that and like I said, so I think, to Tom’s point here, I mean, it’s not something we try to overly big deal, we are simply acknowledging the fact that both from a volume perspective and probably from an expensive, we had some areas that were impacted. But we are not trying to oversell it. 
Chris Mandeville : Okay, thanks guys. 
Operator: Your next question is from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.
John Heinbockel: So, on the investment in MAs, how much do you think that, that contributed to the 6% SG&A growth in the quarter? Could that be 50 BPS or something like that? And then secondly, given the timing of onboarding those folks, when do you think they start to make an impact on local case growth?
Tom Bené: Good morning. Thanks for the question. So, I’d say, when you think about the expense impacts, specifically the U.S. business that you are asking about, there really were three big areas of impact. Certainly, marketing associates and the investments we are making in the sales organization was one of them. I am not going to give you an exact number or as a percentage of that.  But it’s a pretty important investment that we are making and we believe that that in addition to some of the technology that we are putting in place to support that organization is important and what I would say is, think about these as somewhat planned investments and we went into both this three-year plan knowing what we needed to get done and why we’ve committed to the numbers we’ve committed to and this was a key part of that investment strategy.  So, think about it is planned and something that we think. From a timing, how long it will continue and how long it takes these MAs if you will to get up fully up to speed. I think, three to four quarters is still probably appropriate. What we’ve gotten better are getting folks ramped up and trained. We’ve got much better process and programs in place than we had in the past.  It still takes a while to get these guys really impacting the business in the marketplace. So I’d say, I wouldn’t suggest we’re done with it after this quarter. We’d probably have another quarter or so of investment around the selling organization.  The other two areas in expenses were around the – and Joel talk about this, when we do have some times with weather impacts is, we’ve got our fixed cost obviously are there. Often times, we are paying our warehouse depot and our drivers even if we are not shipping cases. So we do have incremental expenses associated with some of our operating expense.  Fuel obviously is also up and we know that and we are dealing with the impacts of fuel and the operating expense. And then the last thing we called out was bad debt and part of that was just year-over-year. We had a really good year last year in bad debt and we had a less favorable year this year. And I’d say, more consistent this year was what we had maybe in our history, it’s not like we had a huge issue, but versus prior is why that stood out. 
John Heinbockel: And then just as a follow-up on the MAs. So, correct me if I am wrong. I think you kind of went from flat to maybe up 2% something like that in growth in MAs. Is that about right? And would that kind of pickup, can that add a couple 100 basis points once these guys are fully mature to local case growth? Or is that too much?
Tom Bené: I am not going to try to quantify that. I don’t – we certainly believe that, as we’ve talked in the past, John, the ability to better analyze the opportunity is what enables us to focus these resources. So we are in the past, we might have just added resources and hope we put them in the right place and focus on the right things. We now are much more surgical in that approach.  And so, we certainly believe that by adding them in the areas of where we have opportunity, we will accelerate our growth in those areas. But it’s not everywhere and it’s not certainly – it’s not something that – it is something that we think about.  We’ve built it into our new three year plan. So it’s certainly embedded in the numbers we’ve shared with you all. But I can’t necessarily quantify if we hadn’t couple percentage in MAs, that’s going to drive a couple incremental percentage points of sales growth. 
Joel Grade: Hey, John, it’s Joel. Maybe if I can just add one little perspective on this – from that – I’ll just give you maybe two little data points here. Number one, you may recall, lot of conversations we had, as we are heading into this, even in the second year of this three-year plan, we are at an – what I would call, somewhat of an accelerated trajectory and people were actually – we are getting a lot of questions around, hey are you going to outperform what you’ve talked about this and that.  We remain very firm on this, because part of that is a $600 million to $650 million target, it’s included some of the investment what we are talking about here and so, given we remain very constant and consistent in terms of how we stuck to that number.  And then the other thing is, from a corporate expense perspective and one of the things I think we’ve done a good job of, and we will continue to is, it’s been saving some dollars on the corporate expense side and then reinvesting some of those dollars into our operations that ultimately will drive long-term benefits.  So, I think there is a book- some of the effect of what you are seeing in both those cases here. But, again I think very consistent with what we’ve talked about and just to get a little bit of other perspective, I wanted to give you and the rest of other people on the call as it relates to some of the costs. 
John Heinbockel: Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
Edward J. Kelly : Hi, guys. Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. 
Tom Bené: Good morning, Ed. 
Edward Kelly : Hey, Tom, can I ask you about the independent business or the local business and just an update from you on what you are seeing from that customer segment from a demand perspective? There has been, I think just, some concern about whether things may be slowing down there or not, it’s obviously a very hard channel to track. So just talk about what you are seeing on the demand side there and what your expectation is going forward?
Tom Bené: Sure. So, look, we haven’t really seen a big change from what we said. I think we continue to believe this is a very important and growing segment of the restaurant space for all the reasons we’ve talked about, They are much more capable of flexing their business and their model to the changing consumer dynamics that are happening out there.  They also – if you think about, whether it’s the technology that’s out there or this delivery that wasn’t off and available to these folks, those kind of things are out there. So there are lot of things that are happening in that space. We continue to feel good about and we see at least from our numbers and our dealing with these folks that we think there is still runway there.  Clearly, there are some cost pressures that they are facing, obviously product cost inflation is impacting them some. Some markets, the labor challenges that are out there are certainly impacting them and labor – I think it’s always going to be a challenge for the restaurant industry as we go forward here.  But generally we feel good and as I’ve said earlier, given our share position, we feel like there is plenty of room for us to grow and as we’ve talked in this local area, we’ve now grown our business for 16 straight quarters and we continue to believe that we can deliver the kind of growth we’ve talked with you all about. There is some growth happening in what we would call – kind of the micro change. So think about that as these emerging concepts we’ve talked about.  There are some of these folks that are starting to get more traction. These are the – they can be start out as three or five units and then they continue to add as they get traction. So we are seeing some pretty good growth within that segment of the independent market. 
Edward Kelly : Okay. I just got a follow-up quickly on the cost side. Can you talk about when we should expect the cost in U.S. Food Service to begin to normalize a bit and see the true underlying EBIT growth within that business shine through?
Tom Bené: I think, as we get into fiscal year 2019, you should start to see us get back to a little more balanced top-line versus cost. You know, as Joel just said, I think we purposely plan some investments in these businesses and base we are executing that plan that we had built.  But as we get into fiscal year 2019, you should – as we talked about for our next three-year plan, we are very committed to the gap that we have between our top-line, our gross profit, and our expense growth and I think you should expect that as we get into fiscal year 2019. And that’s through across our business, we are very focused on those numbers.  We’ve delivered them. We’ve exceeded what we had said in our first three year plan and I think you should expect that we’ll deliver what we communicated in our new three-year plan. 
Joel Grade: And quite honestly, without that happening, we wouldn’t be able to deliver that present NAV gap and we certainly feel – again we certainly feel good about our ability to do that. So I think that’s certainly the way to think about this. 
Edward Kelly : Great, thanks guys. 
Tom Bené: Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Karen Short with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Karen Short : Hey, thanks. Just a quick question on your operating profit goals. You stated you are still planning to be at the high-end for this three years, and then 2018. Can you just give us an update where you are now?
Tom Bené: Sure. Yes, we are at $561 million through, essentially through 11 quarters. 
Karen Short : Okay. 
Tom Bené: So we think we are in a good place. 
Karen Short : Well, so I guess, just as I look at the way you have delivered each quarter this year, it seems like the fourth quarter, there is definitely a lot larger percent will be – need to be achieved in the fourth quarter this year. Is there anything specific about the fourth quarter that we should think about? I mean, if you were to get 100-ish million in the fourth quarter, that would be a lot bigger than you had in the past?
Tom Bené: Yes, I mean, I agree. I think, but, number one, again just, certainly we continue to feel good about it. Two, it’s certainly a big quarter for us typically as there is some seasonality, it’s typically a strong quarter and so, obviously, Q3 being a smaller quarter and Q4 typically being a larger one.  We do anticipate some positives on some – couple expense comparison areas as well. But I’d just say in general, nothing shattering there, but we certainly continue – we certainly expect – continue to expect to get those numbers we talked about. 
Karen Short : Okay, thanks. And then, in terms of freight, I guess, in general. I guess, obviously, you said, you had a plan in place to help mitigate some of the headwinds, but did it also get easier this quarter to pass on freight or is that kind of unchanged?
Tom Bené: Hey, Karen. Yes, I think – look, as time moves on, it have to become a little easier, but that’s primarily in the contract customers, okay? I mean, if you think about the way this works, it comes to us for the independent customers isn’t just another part of inflation if you really think about it.  The cost of the products, the landing cost of the products go up and so it takes what’s already normal inflation of 2.5% or so and takes it up even further. So, in the independents, it’s a little harder, but as you have some more time, you can pass that along. And from a contract customer, given the cycle on the way that freight impacts actually hit us and ultimately we pass those along to the contract customers, we are able to pass more of that along. So, the longwinded answer is, yes to some extent. And that’s certainly helping as well. 
Karen Short : But I guess in that context then fourth quarter for you should be better than third sequentially, shouldn’t it?
Tom Bené: I think, what you maybe should expect is, we are hoping a continuation of what we had in the third quarter. I would necessarily say better. Having said that, we are still a little nervous about is the summer season kicks out, there is all kinds of new freight that’s on the road. Things like produce, I mean, there is a lot of movement of freight in this country and summer season seems to be a big season. So, we are a little nervous about that relative to what we saw in Q4 of last year. But, time will tell. 
Joel Grade: But just the one thing I’d add to that, I mean, to be clear, we are not banking our ability to hit the $600 million to $650 million based on an assumption in improved freight market. That have to – right. 
Karen Short : Right. I wasn’t requiring that. Okay, and just last question, within the local organic case growth, I know that you’ve been asked this before and it’s hard to do, but do you have any more insight into how much it’s really coming from same-store sales or I guess, same-door sales versus new doors?
Tom Bené: Well, we do manage in our business, what we would call penetration, so think about that is what you are asking is how much is coming from current customers buying more as well as business that’s new or business we’ve lost. Our penetration numbers are positive, which would suggest that we are getting more sales.  But Karen, as you know, that’s highly variable, every customer and every concept and every market can be a little bit different depending on what’s going on in that market. So, it’s hard to take that across the business, but as I said earlier, we continue to feel pretty good about a lot of these customers in the space. Not everybody has got a winning concept, not everybody is succeeding. But, we feel good about the customers that we do business with and many of them are doing well. 
Karen Short : Great. Thanks very much.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Andrew Wolf with Loop Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Andrew Wolf : Thanks. Just wanted to ask you about the gross margin., it’ s getting a lot better sequentially on a consolidated basis. So would ascribe that mainly to less inflation making the markets a little more efficient for distributors for – or is it max or pricing, give us a sense of what you think drove the improvement there?
Joel Grade: Yes, I’ll start Andy and I’ll let Tom to chime in here. I mean, first of all on the inflation comment, I mean, I would say broadly speaking, inflation – there wasn’t much of it really a significant change there from that perspective. I think what we continue to see that ultimately drives, again, solid improvement in margins.  We continue to talk about a continued good mix of local case growth, our brand growth and continued to be strong and so that’s certainly always, again, a positive contributor into our overall margin. I think the point Tom made, we just talked about in this last conversation regarding freight. Again, that doesn’t suggest that we’ve had some dramatic shift there.  But the ability that overtime – that variability to pass some of those cost along particularly to the contract customers as that ultimately translates some of the margin improvement as well. So, again, I wouldn’t see, really there has been any sort of macro swing that’s kind of mathematically caused it.  But just in general, when you couple those things with continued enhancements with the technology and utilization of the technologies to improve our pricing through our revenue management, I think it’s just overall continue to allow us to do well in that area. 
Andrew Wolf : Okay. I just wanted to follow-up real quickly if I could, on the International side of the business where for the first three quarters it’s still substantially down, but this quarter you are up a bit. First I just want to make sure I heard your explanation, what’s this quarter’s increase in operating profit internationally, just mainly driven by the harmonization of the calendar – the fiscal calendar at Brakes? Just wanted to make sure I heard that right. And I am – what I am really trying to get you is what the implication for Q4, should it be a better improvement?
Joel Grade: Well, so, Andy, so I think what I would say to that is, again, number one, keep in mind, Q3 for our International business is a small quarter in terms of dollars. But, I mean, so percentages get bigger based on smaller dollar movements. But I mean, there is certainly some element of calendarization that was one of the main drivers of the improvement in this quarter and we’ve talked about that over the last few quarters.  We anticipated some of the negative impacts, certainly in the first half of the year and we’ve talked about the second half being better and you started to see some of that in this quarter. So, I think, again that’s – and you’ll see some more of that as we have anticipated in the fourth quarter as well. So I think, obviously there is lot of work being done to continue to announce the underlying operations of that.  But certainly again, gives us certainly as we anticipated, first half of the year and some calendar impacts that some which we picked up here and we’ll pick up a little more in Q4. But, that’s not to suggest recovering all that, but that’s what you are seeing there.
Andrew Wolf : Thanks. That’s helpful. So, we can now think of modeling the International operations in terms of seasonal leverage and such similar to U.S. part assembly?
Joel Grade: Yes, I would say, it’s certainly much more similar. Obviously, the stuff that we’ve called out heading into this year, we certainly anticipate smoothing out, again keep in mind, we saw it one quarter to go where you are going to see some of that. But starting in our next fiscal year, yes, I think that’s a fair comment, Andy. 
Andrew Wolf : Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Bill Kirk with RBC Capital. Please go ahead.
Bill Kirk: Thank you. I have another question on International. I think it will be in the Q tomorrow, but what impact did the currency have on top-line and on profitability for that segment in the period?
Joel Grade: Yes, you know what, you are going to have to – you’ll have to wait for the Q now and I don’t have that right in front of me and certainly the last segment itself. As an overall enterprise, our foreign exchange contributed about little over about 1.6% in terms of top-line. It had fairly similar – that impacts from gross profit and OpEx but at the end of the day, on the net bottom-line, there was a minimal impact for the enterprise as a whole, but you’ll have to wait on the impact, specifically for that segment until tomorrow. 
Bill Kirk: Okay. And maybe another way to get to the same idea. What were the cases – what were case growth for International segment in the 3Q?
Joel Grade: Yes, so that’s not actually something we break out our volume metrics in our International business or not the same in all cases as they are in our – what we call our U.S. or Canadian businesses. And so, we don’t actually have, again, there is different volume metrics across those businesses. We haven’t get – what I would call harmonized volume metric for that segment. 
Bill Kirk: Okay. That’s all for me. Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Marisa Sullivan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Marisa Sullivan : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I am not sure if you stated this exactly so far, but what is your expectations for inflation moving into the fourth quarter and then into the back half of the calendar year?
Joel Grade: Yes, I think the way I’d look that is, it’s pretty consistent with where we are at, maybe slightly up, I think is our view. I don’t know that I’d necessarily call out anything really dramatic there. But certainly, again our three year plan expectations that we’ve laid out at our Investor Day were, I’d say, little below where we are at today and what our expectation is here as we move forward over the next few months.
Marisa Sullivan : Got it. And I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks, there was some operational challenges, was this just related to weather or is there anything else to call out there that might continue into the fourth quarter?
Tom Bené: What I talked about, Marisa, was, primarily the weather-related impacts that we had. And some of the ongoing transportation challenges, fuel, obviously was also an impact for us in the quarter. So I think, fuel obviously is going to continue, but, a lot of the weather ones. Obviously, we are hoping we don’t have those problems. 
Joel Grade: Yes, and I think one of the things, I mean, we do a better re-ramp up or bit of staffing in this time of year and when we had a little bit of a – given weather impact on volume that outsize of negative overall impact operational metrics.  The only other thing I’d add is, I did mentioned, we still – kind of we mentioned this in our Q2 and the – as we’ve taken on some of this new business, mostly on the contract side, we have not mitigated some of those start-up cost as quickly as we would have liked. And so, there was a little bit of that in Q3 as well. And we do think that that will certainly, that’s kind of mitigated now and we should be in good shape going forward. 
Marisa Sullivan : Great. That’s helpful. Thanks so much. 
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital. Please go ahead.
Kelly Bania : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to ask again, maybe a different way on operating expenses. Can you help us understand of the growth and operating expenses this quarter and last quarter, maybe how much of that is maybe some of the investments and things like MA and technology, that maybe you have to accelerate some of your momentum versus maybe some of the things that are out – a little bit more outside of your direct control in terms of the operating expenses?
Joel Grade: Yes, Kelly, again, we kind of talked about each of these – I would say, I’m not going to probably quantify specific level you would like each of those areas. But I think the important thing to remember is, many of these expenses in the quarter were planned expenses and again, it’s built into that three year plan that we laid out 2.5 years ago at this point.  And, knowing we needed to make some investments in these areas of business it’s not a big part of what’s happening in the U.S. I think, look, we just talked about some of these operational expense challenges and those are real, certainly on the transportation and warehousing side, whether it’s the ramp up of new customers, or some of the weather impacts where we’ve got the expense without the volume and sales are real and then the bad debt was the other one.  So, those are the big areas. And when we talk about sales and MAs, I would include in that this technology investment we are making to make that selling organization more efficient, more effective and certainly continuing to work on how that experience our customers have with doing business with us gets improved. So, those are the big focus areas.  But as I said earlier, most of these were planned. It just relates to the selling side of this and I think, as we talked earlier, we should start to see those mitigate in the first part of fiscal year 2019. 
Tom Bené: Yes, and again, I just – Kelly, I just remind you, I mean, again, we – part of my prepared comments, I did talk about we continue to anticipate seeing better expect this gap between GP and OpEx improve. And then, certainly, obviously, our next three-year plan as we laid out at out Investor Day continues this path as one of that point spreads and again, we feel good about where those are at.  Again, there is just some – again, we’ve talked, as we headed into this last part of the three year plan, while making some of these investments, you are seeing some of it. But we certainly still feel good about all of the – we talked about here both for the last part of this three year plan as well as the next one. 
Kelly Bania : Okay. Thank you, that’s helpful. And then, maybe just another one in terms of freight. You mentioned a little better performance this quarter, last quarter, but do you think we’ve hit the peak in terms of impact of that or is this something we are going to be doing for a couple of years here? And also, at what point do we get to a level where either on freight or fuel that surcharges kind of come back in the industry?
Joel Grade: So, we’ve talked a little bit about freight this morning. I think we feel good about what happened in our Q3 and some of that’s driven by, probably industry, and some of it’s driven by actions that we were taking. It’s really too hard to call it right now, whether we think that level of performance is going to continue.  And I think as I said earlier, a lot of this has to do with capacity and as capacity gets tight, then obviously the challenges, if anybody who is moving a lot of freight start to show up. And so, we obviously receive a lot of freight from suppliers. Because the pressure is really been on drivers and the drivers – that’s not going to change overnight.  There aren’t a lot of drivers coming into the workforce as they are probably necessary. And I think we’ve all got to continue to work for find better ways to move freight, rail at one point was a good option. It’s not been as great of option in the last year or so. But, it’s something we got to continue to look at. So we are going to continue everything we can.  But it’s hard for us to sit here and make a call on that. Regarding fuel and surcharges, that we have in place a surcharge approach for fuel primarily, and that process is out there and articulated to our customers. So, as fuel continues to grow, we have a process to mitigate some of that as and recover all of it. But we do have those plans in place. 
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Karen Holthouse : Hi, thank you for taking the question. Just another one on the commodity inflation side. We are now a couple quarters in a row in the 2%, 3% inflation and I think when it initially moved, it started to move up a lot of that, what sort of attributed to noise around hurricanes and maybe produce? Are you starting to view it maybe as a little bit more structural or starting to see pressure in sort of the underlying grain or protein areas?
Tom Bené: Yes, I wouldn’t see us getting anything really dramatic there. I mean, I would say, from a produce perspective, we are actually still seeing some level of produce inflation that I would say frankly as probably little higher and a little longer than we anticipated.  So that’s kind of still there. The main categories here are dairy, produce and meats. And so, I think, I don’t know that I’d really call Karen, anything really kind of underlying structurally that’s really outrageous there. But that again, I would just – I would say, the produce is probably been a little bit higher and a little bit longer than we anticipated. 
Karen Holthouse : Okay. And then, on the current three-year plan throughout 2020, it sounds like this year is going to come in a little bit below sort of the implied case during – previously talked about, sort of pretty balanced cadence between the three years. How should we think about that as it translates into the next two years? Would it still be sort of balanced between 2019, 2020 or would 2019 potentially be a little bit of a catch up year?
Joel Grade: Yes, so, I guess, sort of I would say is, just as a reminder, I mean, Karen, we’ve been very consistent in the time of the fact that we are very confident in our ability to achieve the objectives we’ve set up for our last three year plan, which is sort of the high-end of the $600 million to $650 million. We feel – we are very much, we feel on track in terms of heading into our next three year plan or it’s just being the first year of next three year plan.  And one of the things we’ve talked about as well at our Investor Day is that, there is, we are pretty balanced in terms of the growth that we are experiencing year-over-year as part of these plans. And so, well, certainly this year we anticipated a little - as Tom talked about, with some of the investments we’ve made, we did anticipate some higher level of expense coming into this year that suggests a little bit of a bigger ramp over the next couple. But I would just say in general, we are kind of on track on where we said it’s being and feel good about where we are at. 
Karen Holthouse : Okay. Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question is from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
John Ivankoe : Hi, great. Thank you. Just a clarification, I think of two different comments that you made. So, do you expect on the corporate basis, GP dollar growth gap to expand versus OpEx in the fourth quarter, but still not with expansion in U.S. Food Service, is that correct?
Joel Grade: Yes, I didn’t go into the second part. What I was really saying you is on the – on an overall enterprise basis, I was expecting that to expand, yes. 
John Ivankoe : Okay. And – but I did hear, when as you were talking about optimizing the sales force, especially the new sales force, that you would – you kind of expect improvement beginning in fiscal 2019, so perhaps that you interpreted that fourth quarter would be relatively slow as third quarter. So, correct me if I am wrong.
Joel Grade: Yes, I don’t know that we actually gave that kind of guidance, John. As you know, it does takes a little bit of time as Tom has pointed out for those sales people. I wouldn’t necessarily look at this – there has been anything dramatic on that in Q4. But again, we didn’t guided that.
John Ivankoe : Okay.
Tom Bené: And also, John, that’s one piece of the overall cost puzzle for all the businesses and certainly the U.S. business. So, I wouldn’t assume anything in that. 
John Ivankoe : Okay. Fair enough. And finally, obviously, digital is very important for your customer, very important for your sales force efficiency and effectiveness. I mean, is there a certain point that you expect that you can have much more effective and efficient sales people? I mean, does that happen in early 2019 and based on that type of comment, I mean, are there any markets and specifically that you piloted that shows what the margin opportunity is with technology? 
Tom Bené: We continue to feel really good about the work we are doing in the technology space and we continue to see improvement in the number of customers who are using our technology solution to both order products from us and operate their business.  We also have seen, certainly as we’ve talked a little bit more improved penetration in customers who use the technology solutions. But, broadly speaking, we feel good about where we are at in that space and feel like it’s going to continue to be an investment we need to make and one that will drive some benefits for us long-term. 
Joel Grade: I think the only other thing I would add to that is, just as a reminder though, I mean, there is some of the investments we’ve made that we’ve talked about in our sales force are very targeted. So, in other words, this isn’t necessarily in anyway sort of reflection of – like we were actually anticipating over time, both increased productivity from our sales force as a result of the technology, but the investments we’ve made here are again, I would say, very targeted based on areas where we see additional opportunities to penetrate our market. So, just as a reminder to that as well. 
John Ivankoe : Thank you. 
Operator: And at this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks. 
Neil A. Russell :
Tom Bené: Thank you, everyone.
Joel Grade: Thanks.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Sysco’s third quarter and fiscal 2018 conference call. You may now disconnect.

Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: Thank you, Neil, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results represent continued momentum in the business, most notably in the top line fundamentals, driven primarily by solid case growth. The quarterly results also include some circumstances that created gross profit and expense challenges as well as some tax-related impacts that Joel will describe in a few minutes. Nonetheless, our strategy of delivering disciplined profitable growth remains our focus, and we are confident in our ability to deliver on our full year fiscal 2018 financial targets. Our results for the second quarter include: sales increase of 7.1% to $14.4 billion, driven by U.S. Broadline local case growth of nearly 5%; gross profit growth of 5%; and adjusted operating expense growth of 5.3%, which delivered an adjusted operating income increase of 3.9% to $579 million; and an adjusted EPS increase of 34% to $0.78. Further adjusting to remove the beneficial change in our statutory tax rate, adjusted earnings per share grew 13.8% to $0.66. Joel will take you through the details in a few minutes. We achieved these results in a favorable macroeconomic environment propelled by steady spending from businesses and households in the United States. Market conditions in the U.S. for foodservice operators remained somewhat favorable as sales at restaurants continue to rise, offsetting somewhat lower traffic counts. Economic growth in the international markets in which we operate is mostly positive, including modest growth in the foodservice sector. However, significant food cost inflation in our UK business, driven by a combination of both product cost increasing, along with less favorable currency translation, impacted both our volume growth and gross margins. Transitioning to our quarterly results by business segment, beginning with U.S. Foodservice Operations. Sales grew 6.6% for the quarter, gross profit grew 5.1%, operating expenses grew 5.9% and operating income grew 3.6%. For the quarter, local case growth in our U.S. Broadline business was very strong at 4.8% and has now grown for 15 consecutive quarters. Local case growth, excluding acquisitions, was also strong at 4%. Cases grew by nearly 2% with national customers, driving overall case growth to a healthy 3.5%. The national customer case growth is the result of recently added new customers and we will continue to look for opportunities to grow in this segment in a disciplined and profitable manner. While we are pleased with the gross profit growth we delivered this quarter, we continue to face challenges from escalating inbound freight costs, which have provided headwinds to our gross profit dollar growth. The industry is facing driver availability challenges, which is leading to increased lane rates for many carriers. As a result, our cost to move products has increased, and we've had to utilize more spot loads to transport goods. We are actively working to mitigate these risks and continue to ensure that Sysco remains a preferred customer with various carriers we work with. From a product perspective, Sysco Brand continues to grow with local customers, making up almost 46% of cases purchased, which is up 37 basis points for the quarter versus the prior year. The consistent success we've seen is driven by a few factors, including the breadth of products that are offered across multiple categories and tiers, along with continued progress from our brand revitalization work and new innovation concepts. Some examples of this work include products that offer our customers unique value through labor savings as well as on-trend products that fulfill specific customer needs. Our e-commerce ordering utilization continues to grow, and early indicators tell us Sysco customers who shop via digital platforms have higher penetration numbers versus customers who do not. We are pleased to see increased utilization. However, we continue to believe that providing choice to our customers in how they want to interact with us is the right strategy to ensure the best possible customer experience. Turning our attention to cost in our U.S. Foodservice Operations. Our operating expense growth for the quarter was roughly 6%, driven by volume-based supply chain costs, startup costs related to some new national account business recently signed, continued investment in our selling organization and increased fuel prices. In supply chain, some of these costs are offset by improvements in productivity that are result of reengineering the delivery process to be more efficient while also providing higher service levels. In the selling organization, we are once again adding marketing associates in an effort to accelerate our local sales and are doing so through a targeted insights-based approach where we have the greatest opportunities for growth. We continue to believe that our consultative approach to selling is the key driver for local case growth, and we believe these efforts will continue to enrich our customers' experience of doing business with Sysco. Moving on to International Foodservice Operations. We had mixed results for the quarter with sales growing 9.3%, gross profit growing 4.1%, adjusted operating expenses growing 11.9%, and adjusted operating income declining 28.8%, driven by the reporting change from a calendar year to a fiscal year, investments in our supply chain transformation, and new change initiatives targeted to grow local customers all within our European business. Additionally, we had transition costs associated with the acquisition of a large customer in Mexico. Our business in Canada had a strong quarter, with gross profit dollar growth of more than 4% and an operating leverage gap of nearly 2 points. This led to strong operating income growth, driven by an improving macroeconomic environment, increased restaurant traffic and improved execution of our customer-centric strategy. Our business results across Europe were mixed. Looking at overall product costs, the UK continued to experience acute inflation of about 6% during the second quarter, driven by a combination of Eurozone sourcing and the relative impact of the pound sterling versus the euro. Also in the UK, we continue to invest in the supply chain transformation to multi-temperature facilities and fleet as well as new initiatives such as technology solutions that are being implemented to enrich the customer experience, which will ultimately lead to improved loyalty and local case growth. Outside of the UK business, France and Ireland are performing well. France is driving solid top-line growth while recently completing key IT milestones that will help us to integrate the Davigel and Brake France businesses. This is another important step to build on our position as a leading European foodservice provider. In Ireland, we are ahead of expectations in cost synergies from the merging of Brakes Ireland and Pallas Foods. And finally, in Sweden, we recently acquired a small produce company that has broadened the range of fresh fruit and vegetable products offered to our customers and we are seeing positive trends as a result. As for our business in Latin America, we continue to be excited about the growth opportunities in this region. In Costa Rica, we continue to see solid growth and have continued our expansion of Cash & Carry locations to complement our Broadline footprint. In Mexico, we're absorbing the costs of adding a new customer and are due to annualize that addition next quarter. We remain confident in the performance of Mexico and expect continued growth in the future. Our SYGMA segment continues to grow and performed well this quarter, producing high single-digit growth in sales and gross profit while expanding gross margins by 6 basis points. Operating income grew approximately 6%, and we are focused on continuing to improve operational performance that will contribute to long-term operating income growth. And lastly, our Guest Supply entity continues to be a great business model, serving our hotel customers with various products and services, which help them to be successful. Although their overall results were slightly down for the quarter, we are confident in their ability to deliver growth in fiscal year 2018 and remain excited about the long-term potential for this business. In summary, we feel good about the fundamentals of our business and about the trajectory we're on for fiscal 2018 to close out our initial 3-year plan. Despite the inbound freight and unique expense challenges we experienced in the second quarter, we continue to make progress on our customer and operational strategies to improve our customers' experience. One example of this is Sysco's redesigned website sysco.com, which we'll be launching this week. This site will be enhanced to further enrich our customers' overall experience of partnering with Sysco and to provide all those looking to engage with Sysco, a clear understanding of the company's differentiated position within the foodservice industry. Showcasing Sysco's breadth of industry-leading innovative solutions, including products, services, and customer-facing technology, the updated site will reinforce Sysco's brand and recent positioning at the heart of food and service. With that, now I'll turn the call over to Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer.
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Thank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Tom mentioned earlier, we are pleased with the top-line fundamental results for the second quarter. Our earnings growth reflects strong sales and case growth, partially offset by challenges from inbound freight, increased investment in our sales force and national customer startup costs in our U.S. operations. In addition, our continued transformation investments and integration costs in Europe, as well as the reporting change from a calendar year to fiscal year impacted our performance for the quarter. This morning, I'll start with our quarterly results. For the quarter, sales grew 7.1%. gross profit grew 5% while adjusted operating expenses grew 5.3%, which resulted in adjusted operating income growth of 3.9% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 34.5% to $0.78 per share. As Tom mentioned, when further adjusting for the tax benefit, our adjusted earnings per share grew 13.8% to $0.66. This further adjustment assumes a consistent statutory tax rate to the previous year and provides a better apples-to-apples comparison of performance on an EPS basis. For the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we saw foreign exchange benefit to sales of approximately 1%. Sysco experienced inflation across all of our segments in the second quarter. In our U.S. Broadline business, we experienced 3.3% inflation, driven by a few categories including meat, dairy and produce. The pace of inflation increases in some of these categories was rapid, ultimately driving overall inflation. Within our international business, inflation was a combination of both product costs increasing along with currency translation in the UK. During the quarter, we had gross profit growth of 5%, driven by overall volume growth and improved Sysco Brand penetration. As Tom mentioned earlier, the increased inbound freight expense is a headwind for gross profit dollars as both the product cost and associated inbound freight both reside in our gross profit line. Adjusted operating expenses grew 5.3% for the quarter. The increase in expense is largely due to overall volume growth, new customer startup costs, increased investments in our sales force and increased fuel prices in our domestic business as well as investments in our transformation and integration costs in our international business. As a result, we did not leverage operating expense growth to gross profit dollar growth in the way that we would have liked to. However, we expect to improve this trend in the third quarter and for the remainder of the fiscal year. As it relates to taxes, our results for the second quarter were impacted by excess tax benefits from stock option exercises and additional tax credits. In addition, per the new tax reform legislation, we incurred a provisional estimated charge of $115 million for our onetime transition tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings. And we incurred a provisional estimated benefit of $15 million related to the remeasurement of our accrued income taxes and deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the change in our U.S. tax rate. Because we are halfway through our fiscal year, our U.S. statutory tax rate is prorated to 28%, retroactive to the beginning of our fiscal year. Our second quarter income tax expense include a tax benefit of approximately $64 million related to applying the lower rate to year-to-date earnings. Our U.S. statutory tax rate will change to 21% in fiscal year 2019. Cash flow from operations was $933 million for the first half of fiscal 2018. Net CapEx for the first half of the year was $255 million or about 1% of sales, which was roughly flat to last year. Free cash flow for the first half of fiscal 2018 was $679 million, which is $313 million higher compared to the same period last year. The significant improvement in free cash flow is largely driven by cash taxes that were not paid in the second quarter due to flood relief associated with Hurricane Harvey. We continue to expect strong cash flow for the full fiscal year 2018. Now I'd like to transition to three business updates: first, regarding second half expectations. We still expect to see a stronger second half of the year including the international segment, as we align the Brakes Group calendar year to our fiscal year. Second, regarding U.S. tax reform. We currently estimate $200 million to $300 million in annual savings from lower taxes as a result of the Tax Act. We will continue to evaluate our options with regard to how to best utilize these savings and will do so consistent with our capital allocation priorities. Finally, as a financial update, we expect our earnings per share for the second half of fiscal 2018 to be positively impacted by $0.09 to $0.13 as a result of tax reform changes related to the ongoing effective tax rate. In summary, I remain confident that we're on track to achieve our three-year plan financial objectives, including the high end of the $600 million to $650 million range of improved adjusted operating income comparing fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2015, excluding Brakes. The fundamentals of our business remained strong as we expect to deliver solid local case growth and good gross profit dollar growth along with improved cost management. Operator, we're now ready for Q&A.
Operator: Your first question comes from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets.
Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi. Good morning. Was hoping you could just help us kind of understand the components of the pressures on the margin, the inbound freight, the investments in the sales force and the startup costs. Can you quantify those? And just particularly on the inbound freight costs, how are you thinking about passing those along if those continue? And what is the mechanism to pass those on, on the local side and the multiunit side?
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: Good morning, Kelly. Let me take a cut at that and then give Joel an opportunity as well. Let's start with the freight and the margin side. So inbound freight obviously does impact our gross margins. And as I think everyone's fairly aware, there's been significant increases, specifically in spot loads in the marketplace, driven by carrier challenges with drivers primarily. A lot of it started with some of the recent storm activity in the our first quarter or the third quarter in the U.S. and has continued and we continue to see that impacting our business. We're able to pass on some of that certainly to our contract customers, and we are doing everything we can to try to move that along as quickly as possible. But on our local customers, it's obviously a little more sensitive. We're having to deal with both product inflation and the cost of that inbound freight. And it's just a balancing act of how much of that you can move through at any point in time with those local customers. And so, we continue to work on that. We, I think, are doing as good a job as we can, leveraging in some of those tools we've built in our past and we've talked about regarding revenue management. But the fact remains that the rates that are increasing in some of those spot loads are dramatic, and we are struggling to be able to pass all that along. That's one of the primary drivers obviously of the margin impact. The other things that we can talk more about is some of that customer mix is impacting margin. And obviously, the impact of inflation, while we're able to pass along some of that on a percentage basis, it's affecting the gross profit percentage. And then on costs, you'd asked about cost, a couple of comments there. The investment to sales force, we are, in fact, adding additional marketing associates. We believe that we got into a point where you heard us talk about leveraging data and analytics to target those resources. We're at a place where we believe we now can add effectively. Even though we're getting some leverage with e-commerce, we feel like there's enough opportunities, and we know where those opportunities are that we're now adding marketing associates again. And we feel really good about that and really do believe that will help us continue to accelerate our local case growth. So those are a couple of the headlines. Joel, I don't know if there's anything you want to add to that?
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Yeah, I think the only other thing I'd add is, we talked about some of the startup costs, again, we certainly have continued to talk about our disciplined approach to growing our business. And we did, as Tom mentioned earlier, take on some additional multiunit business and have incurred some startup costs associated with that. And so, I think the one thing I would take away from a lot of that stuff, certainly, some of the challenges in the inbound freight were certainly actively again (22:21) to do something with. And these other areas with some of the investments in the sales force as well as some of the startup costs for some of these multiunit customers certainly over time obviously, we expect some benefit out of that to come through.
Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay, that's helpful. And then just another one on the local case growth, obviously very strong, ahead of your target for the next couple of years I think the strongest growth on the local in several years over the past couple of years. But just curious if you feel like that was market share gains on the local side or you feel like that local customer in general is improving? I know it's hard to pinpoint, but what's your sense just from talking to your customers?
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: I think, Kelly, it's a combination of all. I think we're certainly having success and gaining some share in certain markets. And I think as we've talked we feel pretty good about that local or independent customer, that restaurant operator, in particular their ability to continue to grow in the local marketplace. So I think it's a combination of both.
Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Sinisi with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey great, good morning guys. Thanks very much for taking my questions. So just to go back, I know the big question on folks mind of course around is kind of the margins. And as you had mentioned in the past, in an inflationary environment, should we basically think of it as obviously the dollar's going up, the percentage going down. But I guess, more of my question is, as we're getting into the second half of the year when you're starting to go against compares that are less increases from last year, should we – I guess, maybe just any thoughts on how you see that in the back half of this year for folks would be helpful.
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: So again – Vinnie, good morning.
Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning.
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: One, I think you got it right. Obviously, as with inflation, margin dollars are going to go up generally and the percentages are going to be pressured a bit. And we are seeing that. As an example, our gross profit per case has actually gone up in the second quarter. So we feel good about that. Remember though, this inbound freight thing is going to impact our gross profit line as well, so you got to continue to keep that in mind. That's beyond the inflation. And then I think as you think about it going forward, we're going to have some of those inbound freight challenges, we believe, will still be with us in the next couple of quarters. We're going to do everything we can to mitigate that and pass along where we can, but we know that's going to continue to be in there. And I think not knowing exactly how inflation is going to play out and as you guys know and as we talked about a lot, it's not – even though it's an average number we talk about, there are certain categories that are moving a lot more than others and produce is a great example of that, certainly impacted by some of the activity and the storm activity that's affected various parts of the U.S. So longwinded way of saying I think modeling going forward, you should probably expect some continued pressure on the gross margin percentage. But we should be continuing to be able to grow our gross profit dollars at the rates we've talked about, and our – for case gross profit, we anticipate to also be favorable.
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Yes. And I would just add, I mean, I think when you look at some of the other components, I mean, our Sysco Brand percentage continues to perform well. We continue to have benefit from category management. So I mean, there are some puts and takes on this. Certainly, we're calling out some of the headwinds, some of the challenges, but we certainly have some good things happening as well. And so, I think in general, we actually feel good about that moving forward. And certainly, on the margin piece, again when you factor out the impact of the freight and some of the inflation impact, again, I think overall, our margins are actually in a decent place as well.
Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, all right. That's helpful. And then maybe just a quick follow-up. Just if you can give a little bit of an update just on the UK business? Obviously, we know that you've got inflation and some currency effects going on there. But just maybe more on kind of the fundamental investments that you guys have been making. I know you said kind of we're making these now for the longer term. But if you could give us an update maybe how kind of far in you are? Is that something that we should expect to kind of wind down over the next couple of quarters? How should we think about that?
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: So good question. And so the UK is probably, of all those markets, the most unique. Everything from the Brexit impacts that are still obviously not all that clear and yet would be – ultimately the outcome of that's going to be in the marketplace. Because we source a lot of products for the UK out of other parts of Europe, that impact – the Brexit – Brexit basically, but on the pound sterling versus the euro, it's certainly having an impact on our costs. Therefore, the inflation we're having to try to pass along in the marketplace is quite high. And so, we've struggled to be able in all cases move that completely through and remain competitive. So we talked about the impacts both on our gross profit, but also on our volume in that market. And some of that's driven by the competitiveness, and some of that's driven by the consumer not being as confident in that market as maybe they are certainly here in the U.S. And so, I think we're going to continue to see some of that on the margin line. Regarding costs, when we acquired that business, they were on their journey of this multi-temp transformation. We are accelerating some of that across the UK and looking to get that in place. And so we still have certainly, I'd say another year or so of investments there that we have to make to get that up and running. And we feel good about it. We think it's the right thing for the long-term and it will certainly put us in a very solid position in the UK. But that investment's going to continue for a little while here.
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Yeah. And I think just a couple of things on that also. Just in addition to the multi-temp transformation, there are some things that we're doing even from, in terms of the way we go to market there that we're making some investments as well. And so again some of that's going to be ongoing. The one thing I'll remind you though, and that we've been calling this out over the last couple of quarters, just to remind you. I mean there was a calendarization impact that you saw this quarter, and again we've certainly been foreshadowing here because as we switched the Brakes Group from a calendar year to a fiscal year, again, all those things were true about some of the investments in here. But again, just a reminder, some of the – I'd say somewhat acute performance that you saw this quarter certainly also, in large part, is related to some of the transformation in the year or the calendar, excuse me, transforming from a calendar year to our fiscal year, and some of that impacts is going to – you'll see some of that picked up in the second half of the year.
Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. Okay. That's helpful color. Thanks very much, guys. Good luck.
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: Thanks.
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC: So a couple of things. Let me start with, is inflation continuing to run here in this quarter kind of in that 3% range? And with respect to, have you seen any change in pricing, right? Because you look at the pickup in local case growth, I assume that had very little to do with any change in pricing on your end, so the price environment remains rational, is that fair?
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: Hey, John. Yes, a couple. So inflation, yes, we expect it to continue kind of the same pace that it has been. And from a pricing standpoint, no, we didn't see really any major changes or impacts. And certainly, we aren't investing in price at this point. So don't believe that's an issue or will be one going forward other than the normal competitive environment we operate in.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC: And if I look in the U.S. business, the margin pressure this quarter, do you think was that evenly split between inbound freight and impact of inflation, right? So inbound freight may be in that 10 basis point to 15 basis point range or is that not right?
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: I don't know, we want to get that specific. Let me just remind you and everyone. We feel actually really good about the gross profit increase this quarter. We were up 5% in the U.S. and that's a really positive number even of the case growth numbers that we shared. So yes, all those things are impacting that number, including the addition of, while our local was good, we also had an increase in the CMU business, so that national account business, and those all impact that gross margin number.
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Yes, I would say, John, just on a real high level, there's probably a little more impact of inflation than the other, just kind of a high level.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC: All right. And then lastly, right, if you think about getting to $650 million for the year, right, your target pre-Brakes, U.S. EBIT probably has to step up from where it is, 300 basis points or 400 basis points in terms of growth. What's the biggest thing that changes? And is it more on the SG&A line? Or I imagine it's more on that line than gross or is that not right?
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: Yeah. It's on the SG&A line clearly. I mean, you saw the numbers. Again, we feel really good about where we're at from the top line and a gross profit perspective and we had some cost challenges that we're dealing with, but yeah.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Wolf with Loop Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Andrew Wolf - Loop Capital Markets LLC: Thank you. I just wanted to start with the inbound freight. Is that a structural thing that you kind of – or let me put it this way. Is that something you can fix structurally by increasing contracting or hauling it yourself? Or is that just something that's sort of you're stuck with and it's going to have sort of pass through as the market allows?
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: Look, I think we're doing everything we can to try to mitigate the impact. I think the part that's less controllable is as the overall shortage of drivers is there, the carriers are choosing what products they're going to haul and who's going to pay them the best rates to haul those products. From a service standpoint for us and, I think, you all know in this industry we've got to have our products available for our customers and they've got to be there when they need them. So, we've got to make sure we've got them in our facilities. So the big impact to us has been having to pay higher rates to get the products here, so we can make sure we're servicing our customers. And we're always trying to balance that. But getting the products in the facilities to be on hand for our customers is job one for us. So a longwinded way of saying, I think you should expect that we're doing everything we can but we're going to continue to see some challenges here as we try to impact that. It's not like we're going to pick up a lot more loads ourselves because we're not going to necessarily add the fleet to do that or move our outbound organization to handle inbound. So it really is something we've got to manage through our carrier partners.
Andrew Wolf - Loop Capital Markets LLC: Okay. Thank you. And just related to that as a follow-up, do you have any sense that – is that at all related to some of the things we've seen on the retail side of food – Walmart and Kroger have sort of – were getting shorted or they weren't happy with their logistics and tried to penalizing some of the vendors. Is this at all related to that or maybe some of the resources in the trucking world are going to make sure that's handled, or do you have any feel for that?
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: It'd be hard for us to comment on whether that's driving it. I think we know what's started a lot of this was the storm activity. And we know then carriers were either being diverted to carry and handle other products that those areas of the country needed. There's been some rail issues, as I think have been well-documented that also put some additional pressure on the trucking industry. So there're probably a lots of things, but I don't know if we can comment or know anything specific to the points you made.
Andrew Wolf - Loop Capital Markets LLC: Okay. Thank you. And sort of a housekeeping and then I'll cede. For Joel, on the $200 million to $300 million range from tax reform that seems like you expect, it seems like a fairly wide range. Is that because you and your tax folks are still kind of figuring it out? Or is it more some of the discretionary things you can do with CapEx and other things?
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Yeah, I would say I mean probably a little bit of both. But I think – obviously, this thing is somewhat complicated and there's certainly a lot of things we're looking to do to optimize this, which would certainly impact the dollars. But I mean suffice it to say, certainly with the significance of our profits in the U.S., it's certainly going to be positive opportunity for us.
Andrew Wolf - Loop Capital Markets LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Marisa Sullivan with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Marisa Sullivan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you. Good morning and thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to touch back on the expense outlook for the second half. You called out a number of factors that impacted your second quarter customer startup costs, fuel costs, increased investments in international. How much of those do you expect to persist into the back half of the year? And which of those would actually alleviate and help you to get that better back half performance? Thank you.
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: Thanks, Marisa. So I think certainly, the startup costs, we anticipate those, obviously, going away or being much less in the third quarter and beyond. The investment in the selling organization, obviously, we're going to have that with us for a while, but we look at that also is them providing growth on the top-line. So the investment there, we think, gets covered pretty quickly with some of the other top-line benefits. And then as it relates to a couple of the other things, the calendar move was a one-time thing in the European or the UK – sorry, the European business, that calendar year to fiscal year. So those are the primary things. We talked about fuel – that isn't really – the fuel rate, that will probably continue here for at least another quarter or so. But those are the primary ones, I'd say.
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Yes. And I think some of the other investments we talked about in Europe also. I mean, those again, those continue to be ongoing. But I mean obviously, Marisa, there's certainly things that we're doing, we're working on that also ultimately – those aren't simply the only categories or things that we're dealing with, that we're focused on here. And so again, we said a couple of times, I mean, we certainly feel good about the remainder of this year and as we head into the second half of the year, I think certainly anticipate some of that cost pressure to mitigate some.
Marisa Sullivan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. And then just quickly to follow-up on that. For the MA sales force expansion, do you expect that to continue in the second half? Or was that more just the onetime step-up in 2Q? And then was the sales force investment, was that mainly just in the number of MAs that you're hiring or you're also seeing any wage pressures in that part of your business?
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: Great question. So think about it as we've added the resources now, so it's somewhat of a onetime or of an acceleration. And now that they're here, obviously, the costs will continue. But we don't look to continue to accelerate that beyond necessarily those numbers at least at any significant pace. And from a wage pressure standpoint, we really aren't seeing anything new or different for our business.
Marisa Sullivan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. That's very helpful. Thank you so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Shane Higgins with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Shane Higgins - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, and good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just circling back on the previous question. What was your productivity for the U.S. marketing associates during the quarter? And has it kind of capped out here? And should we expect it to decline slightly as you guys step-up investments in the selling organization?
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: Hey, Shane, so we don't necessarily talk about our share productivity metrics for our selling organization. But if your question is, are we feeling like they are continuing to be productive and grow in their productivity, the answer is yes. Obviously, the e-commerce work that we've been doing and the utilization continuing to grow is enabling that. In addition, the way we're resourcing and supporting them with this consultative model, we also feel like it's continuing to drive productivity. The opportunity we saw was in targeted areas where we were underdeveloped, and we felt like we had now enough inside knowledge around where we could target those resources to drive incremental growth, specifically with our local customers. So that's why you're seeing the investment we're making, but we feel really good about that organization and the progress we keep making and the leverage we're getting with them across the business.
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: And then Shane, the only other thing I would add is that I mean, as we one of the great, I would say, advances we've made as an organization is the ability to actually rollout new sales associates, once they get through their training with actually larger territories than we used to have with some of the tools, some of the things that we've talked about here. There, I would say, even the newer people are more productive faster in the world we're in today. And so I think that's also a benefit.
Shane Higgins - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great, I appreciate the color. And then just a question on the lower corporate tax rates, I mean do you guys think that gives you an advantage versus some of the smaller private distributors out there? I'm not sure how their taxes are, or if they're similar to yours or if they're completely different. Thanks.
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Sure. So again, this is probably a little bit of me giving an opinion or speculating here. But I would say in many cases, as we've gone down the acquisition trail, we certainly have some exposure to some of the smaller distributors that are in our industry. And I would just say this. In some, not all, but in some cases, certainly, part of their goals of family-owned business is to minimize their tax that they would pay. And so, I would say that in general, our ability – again, given the amount of profitability we have in the U.S. and sort of again, just the amount of tax that we pay relative to our overall profitability, I would say that we have a good opportunity over and above, in some cases, what they may have. Again, that's a very general statement, not necessarily certainly applies to all. But I would certainly say that there's probably some opportunity there for us versus some of the – particularly, the smaller family-owned competitors.
Shane Higgins - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: All right, great. Thanks. That's it for me.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Thank you. First, just a question on international. I mean, we've talked about the fiscal or I guess, the calendar to fiscal calendar shifts a couple of times. I'm sorry if I missed this, Joel, but did you quantify in dollars or in basis points whatever you want to do, how that hurt the second quarter and therefore how it may help the third?
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: We didn't, John. We have called it out for a couple of quarters now that we're certainly looking at the fact that this quarter, we'd see a negative impact of that. That would then be somewhat picked up over the last couple of quarters but we did not quantify that.
John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. But that amount was not adjusted out of operating income as one of the operating income adjustments for the international segment, is that correct?
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: That is correct. We did not provide any of that, no.
John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: All right. Thank you just for clarifying that. And then certainly, it's interesting, and I think you touched on this a number of different places. But it is interesting that you're adding marketing associates at this point in the technological cycle. Obviously, you're putting some of the technology initiatives in the hands of the customers, allows them to order easier and allows your salespeople to focus more on selling and consulting as opposed to order-taking. Is there may be a point in your forecast, I don't know if it's 2019, 2020, 2021, whatever it is, where you expect the sales force to become much more efficient, in other words, utilizing technology themselves to the extent that they can, cover bigger territories, as you mentioned? Just want to get a sense when that you can inflect that to where we can actually start to leverage the salespeople as opposed just in incremental costs, which I think was the case in the second quarter?
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: So John, let me try to take a shot at that. So again, this was what I said a couple of minutes ago around how we're thinking about this. We actually feel really good about the productivity we're getting out of our existing selling organization. You got to think about though is there's a difference between better managing the current customers and trying to acquire and drive our relative share in the marketplace through incremental business. And so I think you need to think about the two of those in conjunction. And the adding of the salespeople really on a more very targeted basis is all around trying to improve our position in certain markets where we believe we've got significant opportunities. And given our share position relatively in the industry, we've got plenty of room to grow and we've talked about that. And so, it's a combination of, yes, you should expect us to continue to get productive with our current selling organization with existing business. But as we look to take on new business, we do need resources in place. And those resources not only are the people but the training and the support that goes along with that. So there's – it is an investment, but one, we feel really good about and one we feel like will create a nice return for us.
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Yeah. And just to reiterate, Tom said that extremely well, and I think the one thing just to reinforce, this is not – you should not take away from this that for whatever the reason there is an – productivity impacted a negative way of any of the stuff. We certainly look at this as an ability to continue to take share again in a targeted way. And so that to me is a separate and distinct from the fact that we also have some continued increases in productivity through some of the tools we've talked about. They're not mutually exclusive here in terms of adding MAs and driving productivity that they can (45:05).
John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay, understood. And certainly in the press release I mean I think selling expenses were called out. And so when you see that you just assume that we're just going through I guess an investment phase before we can start to get some of that full benefits and maybe that's where a lot of the questions are arising from.
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: I think that's fair.
John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay, all right. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mandeville with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Christopher Mandeville - Jefferies LLC: Hey good morning. Joel, just excluding the calendar change to international and how that might affect Q3, should we be expecting the underlying business to have a better second half versus first half?
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: The underlying business in international or just in general?
Christopher Mandeville - Jefferies LLC: In general.
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Yeah. So yes, the answer is yes. And certainly, part of in my script, I wanted to make sure I called that out. I mean we do anticipate an improvement in the second half of our year over the first half of our year. And so, I think in a number of different areas but I would certainly say the answer to that is yes, and again, we certainly tried to call that out in the script.
Christopher Mandeville - Jefferies LLC: Okay. And then just one on the modeling front for me, assuming you guys are still looking at CapEx of 1.3% to 1.4%, as a percentage of sales, that would assume or that would imply a pretty sound acceleration in the back half of this year?
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Yeah. that hasn't changed. We typically experience actually a heavier amount of CapEx in the second half of our fiscal than we do in the first half. And again, our first half CapEx is very consistent with where we were in the last year. And so, we do anticipate some level of acceleration in the second half.
Christopher Mandeville - Jefferies LLC: Right. And then just a follow-up on that, when it comes to D&A is there any ability to help us guide with that line item since it's been moving around quite a bit?
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Yeah. No, I mean, I don't – we haven't typically guided that. I don't think there's anything really unusual to go there. I mean, just as you had modeled just our normal CapEx I would think just keep a normal view of D&A I think is reasonable. There's nothing really exciting there.
Christopher Mandeville - Jefferies LLC: All right. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Edward J. Kelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Yeah. Hi, guys. Good morning. Hey, Joel, can I just clarify just from a guidance perspective? So, you're still talking about the upper end of the $600 million to $650 million, excluding Brakes. What should we be thinking about for Brakes at this point? I think at one point, you were expecting that business to be flat year-over-year. I don't know if that's still the case. I'm just trying, as we piece all this together, what should we be thinking about from Brakes in this year as we try to get ourselves to total EBIT?
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Yes, sure. Thanks for the question. And so, what I'll tell you is we're going to give you a little – an update on that probably in our Q3 call. I would say, it's likely that will be slightly less than flat, although some of that is due to – and the reason I'm hedging in terms of the timing of this is that there were some actual tax reforms that happened in the UK and in France as well that we're still working through to be able to quantify the impact of that also factored into that number. And so again, I would anticipate that there'd be somewhat less than we guided. But again, I'd like to get a better number before I quantify that for you, we will plan to do so.
Edward J. Kelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: As we think about international as a whole, is it possible for international to be flat this year? What I asked that question because EBIT was down about $40 million in the first half. And I'm just wondering how big of a ramp we should be expecting in the back half of the year with this calendar change.
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Yes, again, I don't want to be not responsive to your question, but we just haven't guided that number. I would just suffice it to say that again, that there will be some level of pickup in the second half of the year. But again, we haven't guided specifically of what that was like. And keeping in mind, as Tom talked about earlier, I mean, there's been somewhat of an acceleration and where we've seen opportunities that we anticipate long-term benefit from to accelerate some of the investments that we made both in the multi-temp and in some of the (49:40) as well.
Edward J. Kelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Just to follow-up on the question on tax reform. As you go through the process and think about the possibility for reinvestment, can you maybe just talk about the process, what you're considering? I mean, you could probably make the argument that you've already made some reinvestment, given what we've seen on the startup side on the SG&A. But just thoughts around how much of reform, at the end of the day, you think you're going to end up keeping versus putting back into the business and how you think about that?
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Yes. So I think the main takeaway I'd have from that, number one, one of the things I talked about in my prepared remarks is around making investments in our business that are in line with our capital allocation priorities. And the reason I said that specifically is that we've done a lot of different questions around, will you invest in pricing, will you do some of those things? And the answer to that is that, that's not part of what we're talking about here. When we talk about investing in our business, we're talking about opportunities. Again, part of our capital allocation priority is to continue to find ways to accelerate items, to invest in assets and technologies and people and in ways that ultimately drive long-term value for this organization. And so, I would look at it and think about it more that way, and again certainly not – we're not thinking about as just turning around and investing that ultimately in price. And so I think – and again, as you know, our capital allocation priorities, I think, are quite balanced between investing in our business, providing value to shareholders. And I think that again, our overall investment moving forward is going to be very consistent with that.
Edward J. Kelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ajay Jain with Pivotal Research Group. Your line is open.
Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC: Yeah. Hi. Good morning. I had a question on just the currency impact. I'm guessing the currency should have helped this quarter as opposed to being a tailwind. And I don't think that's been the case for a while. So now that you have clean comparisons for Brakes year-over-year, can you confirm what the currency impact was in Q2 on a consolidated basis, or even just for international specifically? So I'm just wondering if you have any color on the relative impact from currency on revenue expenses and the earnings impact overall.
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Yeah, Ajay, it's Joel. I would – on a top-line basis, it was just a little bit over 1%. We also had – there was obviously impact on the gross profit, impact on the expense. For the most part, that washed out as you translate that down to our operating income line. But we did have some benefit on the top. Again, certainly, there was somewhat – again, a little bit relative strengthening in the sterling and the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. is really what's driven that recently. But at the end of the day, again, the overall impact on the operating line is not a lot, but on top, we did get 1%.
Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC: Okay. That's helpful. So really no flow through to earnings, you would say, from currency?
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Yeah, I would say nominal amount, but nothing of what I'd consider real significance there.
Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC: Okay. I had one follow-up on tax reform and my question is twofold. So maybe it's a little early to talk about the consumer-related impact, but do you have any preliminary sense on whether there's been any kind of impact, like any discernible impact on restaurant spending in general in terms of what you're seeing and what you're expecting going forward? And then I was also interested in how your customers are reinvesting the tax benefit. I don't know if you've got a lot of direct visibility into that, but I'm also curious if you expect to see any benefit being ploughed back into wage adjustments by your multiunit or Broadline customers.
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Well, why don't I start and I'll let Tom add his thoughts on as well. I mean – a couple of comments there. I mean, I think broadly speaking, anything that ultimately is positive for the consumer or positive for the overall economy, we certainly would view as a positive for our industry and so I'd certainly start with that. Yes, I think the question of, have you seen impact or what do we anticipate from a restaurant perspective, I'm sure, I think, it's varied to some extent across restaurant types. Again, one of the things I've mentioned a little bit earlier in terms of the smaller distributors, a lot of our local restaurants tend to be family-owned businesses. And so again, this is really me just opining as much as anything else. But to some extent, more family-run businesses tend to try to look at ways to minimize tax. So I'm not necessarily sure on the local level that there's going to be still that – again, in all cases, it will be different, but so much impact from that perspective and their ability to plough some of that back into the business. On the multiunit side, probably some extent more so. But again, I would just go back to saying in general, where there's a positive macroeconomic opportunity there, I think that certainly provide something we see positive benefit for our industry. And I don't know if there's anything else do you want to add, Tom?
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: Yes and you guys have probably seen some of the restaurant data, I mean, some of it was good for December. If you think about same-store sales versus – traffic continues to be a challenge in certain areas for sure, but same-store sales seemed to be growing and that's helpful. Also if you look at the relative improvement throughout the end of last year, it was stronger obviously than the first part of the year. So I think a lot of the indexes that are out there, a lot of the data that's being shared across the restaurant industry is somewhat positive during this quarter. And so we're hopeful that that continues, the consumer confidence that Joel is referring to and that we're all hearing about, reading about, you hope translates into increased – hopefully increased traffic but certainly increased sales in the restaurants.
Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bob Summers with Macquarie Securities. Your line is open.
Bob Summers - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Good morning, everyone. I guess I want to leverage that last question a little bit and maybe ask it in a different way, which is when you look at prior instances where you – the consumers had tax relief, can you go back and look at a discernible change in trend within restaurants and your business? I mean, I think it's widely speculated on the Street that with sort of restaurant spending being high at – top of the list that you'll be a beneficiary, but empirically I'm wondering if you have any data from the last 30 years or so.
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Yeah.
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: Bob, I don't think – I mean the data that's out there, we have not spent any time looking at that, it's probably something worthy of us and the industry looking at, but I can't honestly (56:51) say we've got that data in front of us. But we tend to believe a lot of the things that we're all seeing and reading. And I think that that will – we know in this business, consumer confidence, unemployment all those things are positive drivers for foodservice and for restaurants in particular. And so we're hoping that all those things do, in fact, continue to provide some nice tailwind for this industry.
Bob Summers - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. And then separately on the incremental hiring of salespeople, which I think as I look at advantageously or as a positive, that seems a little different than maybe you've been talking about over the last pick a timeframe. One, am I interpreting that right? And then two, I guess if it is different, what's driving the change?
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: It's a great question Bob. And I think you are interpreting it correctly that over the last probably year-and-a-half or so I would say we are more stabilized with our selling organization. We're very focused on building out this consultative model. And so where we were maybe adding some in the past it was more around the support resources versus the actual selling resources. We're now at a place both because we have the insight and data to tell us where we should be focusing. And we've I'd say optimized might be the right word that current selling organization we felt like it was the right time to be able to start to add. So we just feel like we're in a much better position from an insight and knowledge basis and know where we have the opportunities to go ahead and start making those additions.
Bob Summers - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. This concludes today's conference call. And you may now disconnect. Have a great day.
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: Thank you.

Operator: Good morning and welcome to Sysco's First Quarter Fiscal 2018 Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. We will begin today's call with opening remarks and introductions. I would like to turn the call over to Neil Russell, Vice President of Investor Relations and Communications. Please go ahead.
Neil A. Russell - Sysco Corp.: Thanks, Tiffany. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Sysco's first quarter fiscal 2018 earnings call. Joining me in Houston today are Bill DeLaney, our Chief Executive Officer; Tom Bené, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, please note that statements made during this presentation that state the company's or management's intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and actual results could differ in a material manner. Additional information about factors that could cause the results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's SEC filings. This includes, but is not limited to, risk factors contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 1, 2017, subsequent SEC filings, and in the news release issued earlier this morning. A copy of these materials can be found in the Investors section at Sysco.com or via Sysco's IR app. Non-GAAP financial measures are included in our comments today and in our presentation slides. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures are included at the end of the presentation slides and can also be found in the Investors section of our website. Additionally, due to the Brakes Group acquisition that closed in July 2016, we've previously referenced financial performance results both including and excluding the acquisition for our fiscal 2017. Beginning this quarter and going forward, as we now have a full year's worth of financial results, we will be referencing financial results for Sysco in total. The one exception will be for operating income, as we still plan to give visibility on our original three-year plan target which did not include Brakes. Additionally, we have scheduled our Investor Day for December 7 in New York. We look forward to seeing you there. To ensure that we have sufficient time to answer all questions, we'd like to ask each participant to limit their time today to one question and one follow-up. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Bill DeLaney.
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: Thank you, Neil, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased with our start to fiscal 2018 as reflected in the solid financial – as reflected in the solid first quarter results Sysco reported earlier this morning. For the quarter, sales increased 5% to $14.7 billion; adjusted operating income increased nearly 6% to $662 million; and adjusted earnings per share increased 10% to $0.74. These results were achieved in the midst of several devastating natural disasters during the latter part of the quarter which adversely impacted our business and that of our customers in several key markets. We estimate that our operating income for the quarter would have been approximately $10 million higher if not for the lost sales and reduced productivity caused by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. Tom and Joel will provide additional perspective on the financial impact of these unprecedented events later on in the call. Additionally, I'd like to take a moment to express our gratitude to all of the first responders, volunteers and charitable organizations who worked tirelessly to support those in need. I'd also like to thank our dedicated associates who sacrificed personally to ensure delivery of product to those customers with critical needs such as hospitals and shelters. Further, it has been incredibly gratifying for me to witness the tremendous outpouring of support amongst thousands of our associates for one another through Sysco's Disaster Relief Foundation. Moving now to the current economic and market environments in which we operate. We are hopeful that the recently reported and improved GDP trends in the United States could ultimately lead to demand lift for our domestic customer base. While it's difficult to totally isolate the impact of the extreme weather experience in Texas and Florida in September, it appears that current market conditions in the United States for foodservice operators are modestly favorable. Larger check sizes at restaurants continue to offset somewhat lower traffic counts while consumer sentiment remains at relatively high levels. Conversely, economic growth in the European markets we operate in is more muted. In addition, significant foreign exchange-driven food cost inflation in our UK business continues to pressure our pricing, which has impacted our volume growth and gross margins. We are highly focused and actively engaged in addressing these challenges in a manner that is beneficial both to our customers and to Sysco. Turning to Sysco's current state, we continue to execute our customer-centric strategy at a high level. The fundamentals of our business are strong and we are well-positioned to achieve disciplined, profitable and sustainable growth in the future. I'm confident that we will be able to continue to leverage quality sales growth in our domestic Foodservice business by continually improving the implementation of our commercial, supply chain and cost reduction strategic initiatives. The prospects for our international businesses are also compelling as we see significant potential over the next few years to penetrate the markets we currently serve, enhance operating best practices, and further expand our geographic footprint. To summarize, we're off to a good start in fiscal 2018 and remain confident in our ability to deliver another strong year and achieve our current three-year plan financial targets. In closing, I would like to express my appreciation to all of our associates for their ongoing efforts and contributions as we strive to fully realize our vision for Sysco: to be our customers' most valued and trusted business partner. And now I'll turn the call over to Tom Bené, President and Chief Operating Officer.
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Sysco's financial results announced this morning reflect solid operating performance and continued progress against several of our key multi-year initiatives. While we did experience some temporary headwinds, including the impact of the hurricanes on some of our customers, rising inflation, and a challenging inbound freight environment, we remain on track to achieve a successful year and ultimately deliver on our three-year operating income target. Looking at our first quarter results by business segment, beginning with U.S. Foodservice Operations, sales grew 3.9% for the quarter, gross profit grew 3.8%, and gross margins remain flat. Adjusting for the hurricanes, gross profit dollar growth would have been approximately 4.3%. The growth in gross profit dollars can be attributed to the continued focus on category management including positive momentum from Sysco Brand and a balanced approach to pricing with our ongoing revenue management efforts. For the quarter, local case growth in our U.S. Broadline business remained strong at 2.8% and has now grown for 14 consecutive quarters. Adjusting for hurricanes, we believe that local case growth would have been over 3%. Our multi-unit customer segment declined, driving overall case growth to a modest 0.3%. As we've discussed, we have proactively managed our business in a more disciplined, profitable manner with multi-unit customers. We have recently begun to add some new customers and should see multi-unit growth begin to build in the second quarter and continue throughout the remainder of the year. While we do see customers' preference – consumers' preferences in restaurants continuing to include new, unique and customizable options that are fresh and healthy, we also see relative strength in concepts that offer convenience, low cost for consumers, and familiarity. These combined preferences benefit both our local and emerging multi-unit customers who provide value in terms of quality, dining environment, and a reasonable price point. From a product perspective, we continue to invest in our Sysco Brand as part of a larger brand revitalization effort including a reinvigoration of our portfolio that offers cleaner, fresher images for our branded products. These changes, along with new innovation, have positively contributed to brand growth, up another 82 basis points versus prior year. Regarding our supplier community, there were many examples during the recent storms where our supplier partners were there to support us and our customers who were in need. And I also want to share our thanks to all of those who supported us. Our digital ordering presence continues to grow and has now improved to approximately 40% of local cases ordered. This increased utilization is a result of our solid technology platform including improved product images and content, enhanced system capabilities, and increased levels of training. Also, as we centralized our support model for multi-unit accounts with tools such as order guide management, both Sysco and our customers have begun to see the benefits of working together to drive efficiencies in the business. Turning our attention to cost, our adjusted operating expense growth for the quarter was 3.2%. While there were some definite headwinds that drove our supply chain costs, we continue to see positive momentum from productivity initiatives and ongoing process improvements. We are now implementing next evolution of tools to help streamline hours, improve delivery, and drive warehouse efficiencies. From an administrative cost perspective, we continue to focus on managing these expenses throughout the organization. Effectively managing overall cost structure remains a key priority for us, and we continue to focus on a variety of opportunities to deliver improvement. A key pillar of Sysco's strategy for growth and value creation is the continuous assessment of new market opportunities. As many of you know, we recently acquired HFM FoodService, a Hawaii-based broadline distributor with approximately $290 million in annual sales. HFM has been providing quality service to Hawaii and Guam for over 50 years. We're excited to welcome them to Sysco family. Acquiring HFM provides Sysco with direct access to the growing Hawaiian market and is in clear alignment with our strategy for disciplined, profitable growth of the business. We will report this business in our U.S. Foodservice segment going forward. Moving to International Foodservice Operations, we had mixed results for the quarter. With sales growing 6%, gross profit growing 3%, and adjusted operating expenses increasing 5%. Driven by investments in our European supply chain transformation, transition costs associated with a new large customer in Mexico, and currency translation in Canada. Overall adjusted operating income declined by 8% for the quarter. Our business in Canada is off to a great start this year. We are experiencing local case growth in most regions, especially in major markets. We are also thoughtfully sharing and implementing strategic initiatives from our U.S. business, such as revenue management and other customer-centric solutions, including online ordering, to their business. These capabilities, along with a more focused approach to local customers, have translated into accelerated local case growth. Additionally, we are effectively managing our cost structure and improving supply chain efficiencies to help maintain a healthy gap between gross profit growth and expense growth to drive our overall performance. Our European business is facing some macroeconomic headwinds, as customers are experiencing slower restaurant traffic and an overall slowdown in Food Away From Home in the UK. Additionally, the UK continues to experience acute inflation due to weakness in the pound sterling, which resulted in high food cost inflation of about 9% during the first quarter. While we expect these headwinds in the UK to continue throughout our fiscal year, we are actively managing the business to mitigate these impacts. As for our business in Latin America, we are excited about the growth opportunities in this region, although there were some weakness due to the recent earthquakes in Mexico City and expenses related to the addition of a large customer in Mexico that I mentioned earlier. In Costa Rica, we continued to see solid growth as we continue expanding our Cash & Carry footprint. Additionally, subsequent to the close of our first quarter, we have completed the purchase of the remaining 50% of the Mayca business in Costa Rica. We will use cash to complete this transaction, and our debt levels will not be affected. We initially purchased 50% of the business in 2014, and we are very pleased with the performance thus far, as adjusted EBITDA has doubled in the past three years. We look forward to continued success with the Mayca team. Lastly, our SYGMA segment continues to grow. We are focused on implementing operational improvements that will contribute to long-term operating income improvement. In summary, we feel good about the fundamentals of our business and about the trajectory that we're on for fiscal 2018, to close out our three-year plan. Despite the severe weather-related challenges we faced in Q1, we continue to make progress on our customer and operational strategies to improve our customer's experience, and I remain confident in our ability to deliver the high end of our adjusted operating income growth target of $600 to $650 million. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer.
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Thank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Bill and Tom mentioned earlier, we are pleased with the results for the first quarter. Our earnings growth reflects continued momentum from our business, including strong local case growth and good gross profit dollar growth and cost management. This morning, I'll start with our quarterly results on a comparable 13-week basis. For the quarter, sales grew 4.9%; gross profit grew 3.8%; while adjusted operating expense grew 3.2%, which resulted in adjusted operating income growth of 5.6%, and adjusted earnings per share grew 10.4%, to $0.74. During the quarter, our results were impacted by both the impact of multiple hurricanes and a lower tax rate that, when factored together, would have resulted in operating income growth of more than 7% and earnings per share of $0.72, which is in line with our planned expectations. For the first quarter fiscal 2018, we saw inflation of 3.8% in our U.S. Broadline business. The pace of inflation has been rapid for a few categories, such as meat, poultry and dairy, ultimately driving overall inflation. During the quarter, we had gross profit growth of 3.8%, driven by local case growth and improved Sysco Brand penetration. Adjusted operating expenses grew 3.2% for the quarter, driven by increased transportation expenses and unusually lower bad debt expense in the prior year. In addition, our expenses include the impact of labor and related costs during the storms that we continued to pay, despite lower volumes in those affected areas. We continued to maintain a gap between gross profit dollar growth and adjusted operating expense growth. While the gap was not as strong as in prior quarters, we still feel good about the performance and the ultimate translation into adjusted operating income leverage and continued progress toward achieving our three-year plan objectives. Part of the compression of that gap can be explained by the impact of hurricanes and inbound freight, which negatively impacted cost of goods. In fact, adjusting for the impact of the hurricanes, the gap between gross profit dollars and expenses is approximately 1 point. As it relates to taxes, effective tax rate in the first quarter was 32.7% compared to 32.9% in the prior-year period. Cash flow from operations was $83 million for the first 13 weeks of fiscal 2018. Net CapEx for the quarter was $135 million or about 1% of sales which was roughly flat to last year. Free cash flow for the first 13 weeks of fiscal 2018 was negative $52 million. It's important to note that the first quarter often produces negative free cash flow, largely due to investments in working capital. However, we continue to expect strong cash flow for the full fiscal year 2018. Now, I'd like to transition to three (sic) [four] (18:10) business updates. First, regarding second quarter expectations, we expect to see further softness in the International segment followed by a modestly stronger second half of the year as we align the Brakes Group calendar year to our fiscal year. Second, as we previously discussed, we will realize a one-time net benefit and depreciation expense related to technology changes. This benefit will be approximately $50 million recognized evenly over four quarters. Third, regarding share repurchases, we've been aggressive in the market as we've seen opportunities to repurchase shares this quarter. We've maintained our approach in purchasing shares opportunistically, but we do not expect that pace to continue for the balance of the fiscal year. Finally, a new accounting standard became applicable in fiscal 2018 that requires access – excess tax benefits or detriments from stock compensation to be recognized within the income statement in the income tax line. For the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we recognized the benefit of $15 million (19:25) as a reduction of income tax largely from stock option exercises that occurred in the first quarter. These tax benefits are difficult to predict and depend on factors such as our stock price and option exercise activity. Absent these tax benefits, we continue to expect our effective tax rate to be between 35% and 36%. In summary, we had a solid quarter that reflected the continued momentum in our business. I remain confident that we are on track to achieve our three-year plan financial objectives, including the high end of the $600 million to $650 million range of improved adjusted operating income comparing fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2015 excluding Brakes. The fundamentals of our business remain strong as we continue to deliver strong local case growth and good gross profit dollar growth and cost management. We are committed to serving our customers and delivering a high level of execution in all areas of our business. I'll now turn it back over to Bill before we go to Q&A.
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: Thanks, Joel. As you know, I will be stepping down as Sysco's CEO at the end of the calendar year, so this is my final earnings call. I'm the sixth CEO in Sysco's 47-year history as a public company, and serving in that capacity over the past nine years has been an honor. In addition, I have been truly privileged to work alongside hundreds of committed and highly-capable associates throughout my nearly 30-year career. Today, I would like to especially thank all of our associates who have supported me throughout my tenure as CEO. We faced many challenges together. Most importantly, we have together, as one Sysco, driven significant and much needed transformational change, expanded our international and domestic footprint, increased revenues by nearly $20 billion, and doubled Sysco's market capitalization. The great news is that there remains a lot of opportunity ahead and really good work to do. Tom Bené is the absolutely right person together with our leadership team to take Sysco to the next level, and I am confident you will be well-served by his leadership going forward. In closing, I just would like to note that I've been actively involved with Sysco's Investor Relations program during much of my career, including my early years in various Treasury functions and, of course, the past 11 years as CFO and now CEO. To those of you whom I've crossed paths with over the years, thank you for your interest in Sysco and for the respect you've provided me both in good and challenging times. I wish you all the very best. Operator we're now ready for Q&A.
Operator: Your first question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open. John Heinbockel, your line is open.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Can you hear me?
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: Yeah.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Can you hear me, guys? (22:45)
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC: So, I was going to say in light of the 4% inflation rate in the U.S., flat gross margin was actually a fairly decent outcome. So, maybe talk about where we sit with the evolution of revenue management. And kind of what you're doing at the margin here on price elasticity?
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: So, John, good morning. It's Tom. What I would say is that we talked a lot over the last couple years about all the tools that we've been building in the revenue management area and that we felt good that they were going to help us both in deflationary and inflationary times. And what I would just reiterate is that a lot of those tools – because what we are seeing in some of these categories is fairly heavy inflation in a couple of the ones that Joel highlighted: meat, poultry, dairy. And so what they really allow us to do is effectively pass on the pricing where we can, but do it in a balanced way such that our customers aren't feeling significant impacts over the short-term as well. So, it's really a matter of week-by-week providing our salespeople the right information, insight and guidance on how to basically price and be competitive in the marketplace.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Okay. And then maybe as a follow-up, the – when you look at what needs to be done at Brakes, right, and I know you've obviously made some management changes there. If you think about the two or three things that Sysco can bring to Brakes in terms of best practice sharing, what are they? And what is the margin opportunity at Brakes today when you look at the delta versus where you guys sit in the U.S.?
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: So, I assume – let's start with margin. When you talk about margin, you're probably talking about gross margin. And generally speaking, the margin – gross margin in Europe tends to be higher than what it is in the U.S. But their cost structures tend to be a little higher as well, which ultimately affects the operating margin. A lot of the activity that we've started to share, they have their own kind of category management approach and program, but we're starting to share more information between the European team and the U.S. team around how we might think about that process going forward. So, there could be some benefits regarding the product costs. But I'd say the bigger areas are probably around how we leverage some of the solutions we've built around the sales model here. We've talked over the last couple of years about the solutions that we've built out, whether it be things like business review or the revenue management capability, or even how we think about building out the branded portfolio in our Sysco Brand, and those all remain, I think, opportunities for us to help leverage some of that learnings out of the U.S. and share those best practices in Europe. And we've started that process already with that team.
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: And, Tom, if I could just add one other thing to that. It's Joel. I think the supply chain piece is probably the other part that I would just add to that. I think, obviously, some of the investments that we've talked about that we continue to make are around continuing to enhance their transformational work on the supply chain side as well as, again, to (26:00) around putting some of those best practices in place. So, I think, just to add one other thing to Tom's point. I think I would – the other part I would single out is an opportunity for us.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you. And, Bill, congratulations on your retirement.
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: Thank you, John.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Edward J. Kelly - Wells Fargo: Yeah, hi. Good morning, guys. And, Bill, good luck in the future as well.
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: Thank you.
Edward J. Kelly - Wells Fargo: So, I just wanted to start it – start on SG&A, particularly within the Foodservice side of the business. It was certainly higher than what we were expecting, up 3.2% on basically 30 basis points of case growth. Can you just provide more color on the impacts here? How much did the hurricane actually hurt that line item? The bad debt expense that you mentioned on the comparison side, what did that mean? And then can you talk about diesel costs and the impact that that had in the quarter as well?
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Yes, sure, Ed. This is Joel. I'm going to start. I think a couple parts to that. Number one, there was some impact on our cost per case as it relates to, again, what I'll just call overall productivity. In other words, there's certainly as part of that, there are admin costs that we continue to pay where we're not shipping case volumes in those areas. And so, that would have a negative impact on that leverage. From a bad debt perspective, a lot of that's related to some actually positive bad debt results we had in the prior year that were, I would say, significant relative to what would be normal for us. So, when that comparison hits, it actually elevates what would be a growth in our admin costs for this year on that side of it. I think a couple of other pieces of that, again, certainly from a segment perspective, as what I've talked about mostly relates to the U.S. side. We certainly did have some higher levels of expense growth in our International businesses, so much we've talked about. There's some start-up cost with a new customer in Mexico and some investment costs that we've put into the UK Again, all of that now is actually factored into our cost structure, which would not have been something you had been used to seeing as much last year because we'd always talked about ex Brakes but, obviously, includes all that and – so, I would say those are really some of the primary callouts and, again, the hurricane, again, did have some productivity impact there, without a doubt. But I think it's a few – collection of a few things. We still feel good about our ability to manage costs still in this area going forward.
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: The only other thing...
Edward J. Kelly - Wells Fargo: Yes, got it.
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: Yeah. The only thing you mentioned...
Edward J. Kelly - Wells Fargo: I'm sorry, Tom.
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: ... was fuel. And so where's (28:48) about a penny detriment on fuel versus prior year. And the buildout, the cost comments that Joel made from an operating perspective, when you think about the way we run our business and the impacts of the – some of the storms, we still are basically paying all of our associates, drivers, warehouse, et cetera, without any case activity during those times. And so, that's what drove some of that incremental expense from an operating perspective as well.
Edward J. Kelly - Wells Fargo: Okay. Great. And then just one follow-up. Profit per case on U.S. Foodservice has been really strong the last months – been strong for a while, but the last couple of quarters seemed notably strong. Can you just talk about that acceleration and the momentum? And then how does that change over the next few quarters as you have some new business coming in?
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: So, Ed, I assume you're talking about gross profit per case.
Edward J. Kelly - Wells Fargo: Yeah.
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: Yeah. So, it's a really good question given the inflationary environment we're experiencing. So, we continue to see our gross profit per case improve, even though, obviously, we haven't seen margin expansion during this time of inflation. So, we continue to feel good about that and that's a combination of things. It's the category management effort we've had going. We talked earlier about the increase in Sysco Brand, another 82-basis-point improvement with our local customers, which is again, as you think about the challenges on inflation we're seeing, our ability to give customers options, including Sysco Brand, and help them maintain their cost, while also delivering improved margins for us, is a kind of a win-win in there. And so, as we see our case volume increase, we would actually expect to see us continue to be able to manage that accordingly. And so, we do feel like you're going to see some improvements there, predominantly in this multi-unit side, as we continue to go forward throughout the year.
Edward J. Kelly - Wells Fargo: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital. Your line is open.
Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to elaborate a little further on the international comments. I think you mentioned some further softness expected in 2Q, but an improvement in the second half? Did I hear that correctly, if – and can you elaborate on that?
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Yes, Kelly. I think, again, as I talked about – I mean, some of this is really related to what I'll call some timing elements of the fact that the previous fiscal year with Brakes was on a calendar basis. And just essentially moving that now to where their fiscal year aligns with our fiscal year does cause some changing of the way some things are recognized. And so I think, from a timing perspective, again, that impact is going to most notably hit us in the second quarter, which again, used to be their – the final quarter of their calendar year. And again, – but certainly we'll expect some level of pickup in that, in the second half of our year.
Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay, and the other question I wanted to ask was just on the corporate multi-unit trends. Do you continue to expect those to improve, I think, starting next quarter? Can you quantify the magnitude of that there, and is this a positive or a negative for gross margin within the U.S. Foodservice? 32:10: So, I guess – let me take that at a high level, Kelly. It's, definitely, from an improvement – the trend's going to improve, okay? So, what's been going on as we've talked, we've been very thoughtful about the way we approach the multi-unit segment of our business. And we have had, obviously, some situations over the last year where we've not renewed some business, or lost some business there. And so, what we now are getting ready to do is lap some of that as we go into Q2, and we have picked up a couple of new customers as well. And so you – the combination of those things will in fact improve the multi-unit sales trends that we've been seeing for the last kind of three to four quarters. As far as gross margin, obviously, overall, that business is a lower margin than our local customers. As far as us sharing a specific number with you, it would be really difficult for us to do that. But you certainly will expect, as we get overall customer growth volume growing, that there will be some benefits to the gross profit dollar line. And it could have some impact on margin.
Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Sinisi with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks very much for taking my question and, Bill, of course, best of luck to you in the next chapter here.
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: Thank you, Vinnie.
Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Just – absolutely. Just wanted to – I guess, just first going back to inflation. Just to kind of get your sense versus what you guys were expecting heading into the quarter. Obviously, 3.8% was a bit above probably most of our estimates on the line here. Just wanted to see kind of versus your internal expectations, and if any changes have happened since. And maybe – I know you mentioned there's been some kind of changes where you can promote some of your private label. Has that been kind of a meaningful change with the higher inflation?
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Here, let me take the first part of your question and then I'll let Tom chime in on the other. I think the – it's Joel. I think the – certainly, Vinnie, I would say that the level that we've seen here in Q1 – say, it's fair to say, is higher than we anticipated. And I guess I would say that the speed to which it actually happened in a few of the categories we called out was, I'd say, something that happened faster than we anticipated. But I think, at the end of the day, it certainly, as Tom pointed out, I think that some of the things that we've done, in particular, RevMan, CatMan, certainly provided us with the tools and resources, and certainly provided our sales team with the opportunities to manage this fairly well and, again, I certainly – somebody called out earlier, I mean, the fact that our U.S. Broadline – our U.S. Foodservice, excuse me, segment was relatively flat from a margin perspective, I think, is pretty strong relative to where (35:02) – despite, again, as you pointed out, things that happened probably faster than we anticipated. Do you want to add anything to that, Tom?
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: Yeah. I think the only thing I'd add, Vinnie, is that obviously, we continue to see some inflation through at least the balance of the calendar year. There are some things, like produce, that we think might be impacted more, given the recent fires in California. So, there are going be some continued areas we're going to have to deal with. And again, as w talked – from the first question – I think we feel good about the tools we've got in place to manage through this. But as Joel said, these categories that move fairly quickly and fairly aggressively is where we run into the biggest challenge and we just – always you (35:42) need a little time to maneuver around that and work through it, but I think we're doing a pretty good job.
Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Very helpful. And then, just a fast question on the International side, and I'm sure we'll get more color in December. But just around Brakes – it seems like the UK, obviously, has more of kind of the macro issues there. Would you say, though, that kind of the basis (36:07) of the business now, just over a year into the integration here, has been going relatively according to plan? And maybe just if there's any changes in any of the regions, more just on a competitive front or pretty much in line with your expectations?
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: Hey, Vinnie. So, yeah, I would say it's relatively as we had expected and on plan. Now, having said that, we are making investments over there, as we've talked. The transformation efforts in the UK continue. We're looking to make some other investments in some of the other parts of Europe, including France. And so, I think we continue to believe that it's a great business, and one we see lots of potential out of. But there are some things we've not – need to get in place and operating the way we'd want, to get that type of growth in the future. The only other thing we already talked about with the UK in particular, and some of the macroeconomic challenges they have, the inflation there driven by the currency issues are significant. So, 9% inflation is a massive number. And we are seeing impacts from that. And we see that unfortunately, continuing for some period of time here. So, I'd say that's the only other piece of this that – that's different than what we had hoped or expected. Obviously, with Brexit happening, we knew there was going to be some impacts but it's sustained at fairly high levels for quite a while now.
Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Very helpful. Best of luck, guys.
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: Thanks.
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short with Barclays. Your line is open.
Ryan Gilligan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. It's Ryan Gilligan on for Karen. And thanks for taking the question. Did you say what operating profit was excluding Brakes? We're just trying to get to what the three-year incremental operating profit is now and by our rough math it seems like you're up to $460 million, so you would need to generate almost $200 million the rest of this year to get to the high end. Does that sound right?
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Yeah. So, this is Joel. I mean, we actually – if you want to take the dollars ex Brakes, we added $52 million operating income dollars, again, ex Brakes and so that takes us to a total of $469 million for the – for, now, the nine quarters of the three-year plan.
Ryan Gilligan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. And would the $50 million D&A (38:19) benefit contribute towards the plan as well?
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Yes. Yes and, again, that's going be spread evenly across the four quarters of the year.
Ryan Gilligan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. And on tax reform if it's passed and corporate rates are lowered, what are your views on whether or not incremental profit dollars will drop to the bottom line versus get computed (38:37) away?
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Well, yes. First of all, it's – to you speculate on anything coming out of Washington right now is a little bit interesting. But I think the – yeah, look, we're a company that obviously has a large percentage of our profits in the United States and so, certainly, just based on that fact it certainly seems like a positive opportunity for us. I think the – in terms of passing some of that along, I – to be honest with you, I get asked this question a fair bit. I don't know that most of our customers spend a whole lot of time thinking about the correlation of prices and tax reform necessarily. So, I don't personally anticipate that being a significant issue either way, as it relates to this. But, certainly, again, overall, from our company's perspective, again, were that to happen, I think there's certainly some positive opportunities for us.
Ryan Gilligan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: That's helpful. Thank you, and congratulations, Bill.
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: Thank you, Ryan.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mandeville with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Christopher Mandeville - Jefferies LLC: Hey. Good morning. Just on the private label or brand penetration itself, if we think about it over the next three to five years within both Broadline and local, where do you think that ultimate penetration goal could go? And maybe in that context, when you guys are having your conversations with your suppliers, how are those discussions going these days? Do you feel like maybe you're able to receive some greater concessions out of them if they're not necessarily providing innovative or value-added product?
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: Chris, from a Sysco Brand perspective, as you know, we've continued to see this grow over the last couple of years and our total business is up 62 basis points and 82 basis points with our local customers. So, we continue to see opportunities there. And we get asked this often is how high is – could it go? And I don't think we really have a good view of that. And the reason I say that is what we continue to focus on is bringing very high quality products to the market at very competitive pricing. And I think as our customers continue to feel different impacts whether that's the cost of labor, wage rate increases or other challenges they might feel in their business, product costs' always going be there. And we bring them alternative solutions with Sysco Brand. So, the other thing we've done – we've talked about is we've been focused on bringing innovative solutions and products with Sysco Brand to the market. And I think the combination of those things continues to be well-received by our customers and that's why we see these increases. So, I know that didn't answer you directly, but what I'd say is we continue to invest here. We feel good about it. I talked about this brand revitalization effort. We've been doing a lot of work around refreshing the look and the feel of those brands and making sure that they're on trend whether that's with fresh and local products or that's with the ripe (41:37) types of products, whether that be organic or wholesome type products. So, we – we're doing a lot of work in that area and it's – appears to be resonating nicely with our customers.
Christopher Mandeville - Jefferies LLC: All right. And the last one for me very quickly in terms of ROIC in the quarter as you calculate with and without Brakes, what was then numbers for those?
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Yeah, the number, I think, in aggregate was 12.3%, as an overall enterprise. Actually, Chris, off the top of my head, I don't have that number without Brakes.
Christopher Mandeville - Jefferies LLC: That's okay. We can follow up. Thanks, guys. (42:14)
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Marisa Sullivan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Marisa Sullivan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to touch on the U.S. Broadlines business. When you exclude inflation in case growth, it looks like there were some other negative pricing impact to U.S. Broadline sales growth. So, can you just give us a little bit more detail on this and was it related to an inability to pass through all the inflation or was it a decision by Sysco to get sharper on pricing or was it a more competitive environment? Just more color there would be great.
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: Hey, Marisa. I'm not sure exactly what you're referring to. I think we feel really good about the U.S. Broadline business and we talk about it in context here of our U.S. Foodservice Operations segment. And given we talked about some of the impacts of the storms on both volume and on gross profit dollars, and obviously the impacts on costs as well. So, I think when you think about everything that that business went through in this first quarter, we continue to feel very good about how we're managing it, including some pretty significant inflation in the quarter. So, I – the fact that we're basically flat on our gross margin given all those circumstances, we feel actually very good about that business.
Marisa Sullivan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Right. And then have you – are you at the point where you're getting any push back on the ability to pass inflation onto customers now that it's close to 4%?
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: Again, I'd say as we always talk, that's an average. So, category by category, sure, we run into some challenges from time to time and that's where we leverage things like Sysco Brand. And, candidly, we share a lot of information with our customers, so this isn't about just us moving our pricing. We share a lot of industry information with them, what's going on in the various categories and why the costs are going up from suppliers the way they are. So, it's – we're pretty transparent in that area and we try to spend a fair amount of time educating our own people so they can obviously educate our customers.
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: And the only thing I'd say, Marisa – I mean, again, we had a – despite all those things, we still had a very strong local case growth as well. So, I mean, when we combine that with some of the – again, holding a flat margin during this time, I can overall – certainly, on a customer-by-customer basis, could there be some pushback? Sure. But I think overall we've done a good – really good job there.
Marisa Sullivan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. And then, just lastly, I'm wondering if you can give us a little bit more color on the sales performance of your non-restaurant customer and how you're thinking about sales and margin opportunities within that segment.
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: When you say non-restaurant customers, are you just talking about other segments within...
Marisa Sullivan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Like hospitals. Well, it'd be like hospitals, schools, kind of the – some of the institutional customers.
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: We feel good about them. I think that we continue – we're fortunate that we've got this broad segment that we operate in, our customer segments, and our mix is such that while restaurants certainly represent a big chunk of it, there are lots of other customer segments. As we've talked in the past, we see growth in areas like the foodservice management and also in the retail foodservice. So, I think the other segments continue to grow. Healthcare's always been a pretty good-sized segment for us and we are performing well there also. So, I think we feel great about the balance that exists across the segments. And I'd like to mention (45:47), other than making some decisions around certain multi-unit customers, we feel really good about where we are.
Marisa Sullivan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks so much and best of luck, Bill.
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi. One quick housekeeping one. Could you give us an idea of what the blended interest rate on your debt was this quarter?
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Yeah. Karen, we'll have to get back to you on that.
Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. And then, looking at some of your commentary earlier about seeing strengths in brands that are familiar, convenient value, is that really a comment on maybe some strengths in fast food relative to casual dining as a category with what you're seeing in your customers?
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: I think it's commentary not necessarily on fast food but on independent restaurants and what we continue to believe is why they are positioned well to grow. And so, there are, obviously, more flexible menus, more ease of creating the right environment for consumers. And so, it has more to do with just acknowledging that there are lots of things still happening in that restaurant space and these newer concepts, whether they're independent or small multi-unit chains, they are continuing to see growth because they are bringing the kind of things that consumers are looking for to the market.
Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And then one other quick housekeeping. Are there any calendar shifts we should be thinking about into the next quarter with Christmas switching – moving off of the weekend? And then also, I think you lose New Year's Eve compared to last year?
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Yeah, Karen, I would say that we don't anticipate anything significant there.
Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Wolf with Loop Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Andrew Wolf - Loop Capital Markets LLC: Thanks. Good morning. First, Bill, congrats on your career.
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: Thanks, Andy.
Andrew Wolf - Loop Capital Markets LLC: And best of luck with everything. You're very welcome.
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: Thank you. I appreciate it.
Andrew Wolf - Loop Capital Markets LLC: So, I think, Tom, in your introductory comments, it sounded like ex hurricane, the U.S. business accelerated a little on the case side and was a little better on the gross margin side. So first, just to kind of check that, if you take the markets that were not impacted by the hurricanes, was case growth in fact – the local case growth, over 3%?
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: Yes. In many cases it was.
Andrew Wolf - Loop Capital Markets LLC: Okay. But in total – I mean, I'm just trying to get some – because, obviously, estimates are one thing and then there's other ways to sort of get...
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: Well. (48:38)
Andrew Wolf - Loop Capital Markets LLC: I guess, another way I want to ask it is – and it's sort of related so, is – how are these hurricane markets doing post hurricane? There's a lot of different theories, some is people are pent up and they want to go out to eat. Others is businesses are closed, people are moving. Are those markets normalizing? And are they running decently?
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: Yeah. I would say, ex a couple of key geographies, right? So whether it's here in the southeast where there are restaurants that are still closed or in parts of Florida like the Keys, where things are – many things are still closed. Much of the market is starting to get back to a normalized state. So, I would say yes, in general.
Andrew Wolf - Loop Capital Markets LLC: Okay. And related to that, the math, if you just take the math of what you said, it looked like the $10 million hurricane impact to the operating profits really came out of the case side and the gross profits. But it also sounded like, from what, Joel, some of your commentary, it might have also been in the OpEx side which I also would have expected. So, could you talk a little about that $10 million? Is it a, kind of, a hard estimate or how did you get to that?
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Well, so look, it's a fairly – I get it. It's high level. It's ball park. It's directional. I – it's, I think, again reasonably, and accurate, I think it is – yeah, we looked at it mostly all along the lines of what you said, from a volume and gross profit impact. Certainly from a productivity impact, again, as we described it earlier, it's interesting, I mean (50:14) our costs to some extent didn't go up, if you want to call it that. Because we had – we're paying people, whether it's drivers, whether it's administrative people, we're paying them, irregardless of whether we're shipping cases or not. And so, I would say, in general, from a productivity standpoint on a per case basis, we actually had some impact there. But I – so again, it's – again, Andy, it's not an exact science but we certainly got what we thought was a pretty reasonable view of it. And what we quantified was mostly on the gross profit piece of that. And probably, maybe a little conservative on our part but we thought it was a reasonable view of what happened.
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: And, Andy, that was all based on case...
Andrew Wolf - Loop Capital Markets LLC: Got it.
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: All based on case volume, right. We didn't project any impact on a rate basis from gross profit per case. We just looked at purely at cases. And you asked about the 3%, we think that's a fairly conservative estimate, given what our run rates were in those markets.
Andrew Wolf - Loop Capital Markets LLC: Got it. Thank you. And just wanted to follow up on Brakes, and my last question is – just like, as you look – Joel, you mentioned you're reconciling or harmonizing the fiscal years, and that obviously has some tweaks to it. But is most of the slowing from just what's going on there with the cost inflation and consumer – fundamentals side, with what's going on in the UK? Or how would you portion it, between timing reconciliations and a little fundamental slowing, or some fundamental slowing?
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Yeah, I'll start and Tom can chime in. I'd say, Andy, it's really some of both. Again, I think what I would say to you is that some of the timing issue is going to become more accelerated in the second quarter, which is why we're calling that out. Which again, will then rebound to some extent, in the second half of the year. But I would say for this particular quarter, it was some of both.
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: I don't have anything really incremental to add. I mentioned earlier some of the other impacts from – as you mentioned, from inflation and some of the macros in the UK.
Andrew Wolf - Loop Capital Markets LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Kirk with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
William Kirk - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you. Could you talk a little about the rationale for the recent deals off mainland U.S.? You gave some details on HFM, but how do you think about this deal and the completion of the Costa Rica stake versus opportunities that would be, kind of, more in and around your core or existing infrastructure?
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: Let me – I'll talk about those two, and then I'll let Joel embellish on kind of our broader strategy there. The – let's start with the Mayca in Costa Rica. So, as I mentioned, that was a business that we went into a joint venture with back in 2014. We feel great about the partnership we've had with the folks at Mayca. And as I shared, the results have been very positive over the last couple of years. So we exercised our option to basically acquire that business completely recently. And so, that's an example of where we started down a path with a partner and liked the way it progressed, them leveraging what they could from Sysco, and obviously them doing a great job in their marketplace. Separate that from HFM, which is just an outright acquisition and a market within the U.S. that's been white space for us. Other than some export business into Hawaii, we don't really have much of a footprint. We'd have no footprint there, and we didn't really do a lot of business there, so it's a white space opportunity that we're very excited about. They're a terrific distributor with businesses on a lot of the islands, and are really excited about what we can do together in Hawaii. As far as other types of acquisition, I'll let Joel talk a little bit about how we think about it and where you might see us focusing.
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Yeah. I think the way I would characterize it, I mean, it's a little bit coincidental, I would say, in terms of timing, that we had two acquisitions we announced that were both on islands here. But I think in general, I would tell you that our overall strategy around M&A, it's – those are both very consistent with that. We're very – continue to be very focused on opportunities within our own domestic and core markets, or areas that might supplement our existing businesses, as well as geographic expansion. And so, I would just say, again, the timing probably a little coincidental on those two things, but our acquisition strategy has remained very consistent. And those two deals are very much a part of our overall strategy.
William Kirk - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you. That's it for me.
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Shane Higgins with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Shane Higgins - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, good morning. Just a question and some clarification here, on how the local case volume trends were during the quarter in the markets that weren't impacted by the hurricanes? Did those accelerate throughout the quarter?
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: Shane, did they accelerate? So, I mean, when you think about this, we're – we break our U.S. out into six markets. And so, as you guys know, I mean, different things drive the business in different markets, not the least which is overall population growth, economic impact. So, what – as we said earlier, we saw good growth outside of those other markets, generally speaking, in the U.S. And so, we feel pretty comfortable with the numbers we've shared regarding the impacts due to the hurricane in primarily what we call in our South and Southeast markets.
Shane Higgins - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks for that. And how are case volumes trending 2Q to date?
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: We continue to feel very good about the growth that we've had in the – both local, and as I mentioned, change in multi-unit.
Shane Higgins - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks. And just had a question on the – you guys called out some challenging inbound freight environment. Could you just give a little bit of color on kind of what changed there during the quarter, and what you guys are doing to mitigate these headwinds?
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Yeah, I would just – I'll take that. It's Joel. And I would just say in general, the way to think about it is that there's been some level of shortage of drivers in inbound freight, and that's something that was happening somewhat prior to the hurricane, and then that got accelerated by the bad weather. So, lots more sheetrock being moved, and I would say carriers are taking the opportunity to move more expensive loads, and that doesn't always necessarily – that pinches supply on our side. And so, that was something – again, at the end of the day, our product costs is basically the cost of our products plus the costs of inbound freight. There's some increases there from an inbound freight perspective and, certainly, that's something, as we move forward, continue to find ways to mitigate that – it's continued somewhat here and as we moved into this quarter.
Shane Higgins - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. And then congratulations, Bill. That's it for me. Thanks.
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: Thanks very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ajay Jain with Pivotal Research Group. Your line is open.
Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC: Yeah. Hi. Good morning. Bill, I also wanted to say congratulations and wish you good luck in your retirement.
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: Thank you, Ajay.
Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC: Now that you've anniversaried Brakes, would it be possible to break out the actual currency impact, both in terms of revenues and operating profit? Maybe you already mentioned that earlier and I might have missed it, but it would be nice to get a sense of the actual operating performance in International after stripping out the currency impact, especially for the markets that Brakes operates in. So, if you can comment on case trends for International and also the overall currency impact, that would be great. I'm assuming that you can track those things a lot more easily now that you've cycled Brakes.
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Yes, so Ajay, again, so the breaking out specifically – again, we're – we don't – we don't typically do that. What – here's what color I would give you, though. I mean, and actually general, the impact of foreign exchange overall for us has been relatively negligible for this quarter. So, there is – some of this stuff we've talked about that Tom referred to in terms of the weakness of the sterling really has played itself out in the selling margins. Because there's a fairly sizable percentage of products that the UK, or that are bought outside the UK, which has impacted the selling margins, but if you actually look at the overall impact of foreign exchange – again, the U.S. dollar's been somewhat weaker out there, the Canadian dollar, as well as the euro. Then there has been some impact where the sterling has continued to weaken. But – yet overall, on the top line and certainly on our operating income line, there's been a relatively minimal impact overall on foreign exchange. More on the top than overall, but again, not much on our operating income line when you aggregate everything.
Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC: Okay. So, going forward should we infer that you're not going be breaking out the currency impact based on the year-over-year comparisons?
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Well, I guess, I would say in this particular case, it's – it was not significant and we didn't do it. If it's something really significant, we'll probably break it out.
Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC: Okay. And just one follow-up in terms of the U.S. local case growth, you've had a pretty impressive run now in terms of local case volume. So, over the past couple of years since the start of your three-year growth plan, has there been any noticeable shift in terms of where that volume is coming from at this point? Are you selling more cases to existing customers or is the local case growth coming more from new business? I'm sure you'll probably say it's a little of both, but if you can comment, that would be great.
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: Sure. And it is obviously both. We track both penetration which means more sales to existing customers as well as new lost business. And I would say in each of those areas, they've continued to grow. In Foodservice and generally, new business is very important because there are a fair amount of customers each year that cycle for various reasons. And so, I'd – it's a pretty good balance actually of both though. And I'd say the thing for us that we've really tried to focus on is penetration because we believe that the more products and service that we can provide a customer, obviously, that also provides more – what we call maybe stickiness or loyalty from those customers. You heard me talk in the past about loyalty and we continue to have a positive trend in our loyalty metrics, including about a 3-point improvement in the first quarter. So, we feel good about what we're hearing from our customers as far as what we're providing them.
Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. I think at this point my question is limited to some comments that Tom made in, I think, his prepared remarks around not just the move towards healthy, local, organic in terms of consumer preferences which is pretty easily understood. But also the comment around convenience, low cost, and familiarity. I interpreted that either in terms of traditional fast food which is obviously done very well over this cycle, but it could also mean things that aren't necessarily restaurants, like convenience stores or maybe other types of Foodservice operations that are more hybrid in terms of what their approach is. So, could you elaborate on that sub segment and how big of an opportunity that is relative to the business that you're currently serving?
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: Sure. First of all, I think you articulated it actually pretty well. And so, I think that that's – it was good to hear that what we said is – was translated, I guess, by you in the right way. I think, there's some of this is certainly the retail segment that we've talked about. We do see it continuing to grow. But the other segment that we all know is growing is this – kind of think about as prepared meals and this ability to get your – whatever your favorite restaurant is delivered to you now versus having to either go there to dine in or even to go pick it up. And we continue to see that movement happening. And there are lots of different folks getting into that space now in these prepared foods that are both retail, but also in many cases in foodservice outlets that are handling that. And so I think the more those folks continue to grow, that just provides more opportunities for our customers to grow and for consumers to get access to things that they like and enjoy. And so, that's really – is what we were trying to refer to there.
John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: So, that sounds more independent restaurants and chains or maybe that also includes some smaller chains in that segment? And are you alluding to meal kits as well? Or is that a different segment than what you want to be doing?
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: Yes to your first part of your question and comment. And as far as meal kits, yeah, it's part of it. It's a fairly small segment and while I think it's still got some growth in it, as we've all seen, there's a lot of movement going on in that space right now. I think what we're seeing, though, is there are – think about it, instead of someone like a Blue Apron where you're having to get something shipped to you, there are local outlets that are accomplishing that same type of solution for customers or for consumers on a local level, whether that be an independent or a chain who are providing that same type of service.
John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you.
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: Yes.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Christina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today’s conference is being recorded. Thank you. Neil Russell, Vice President, Investor Relations and Communications, you may begin your conference.
Neil Russell: Thanks, Christina. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us and thank you for your interest in Sysco. With me in Houston today are Bill DeLaney, our Chief Executive Officer; Tom Bené, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, please note that statements made during this presentation that state the Company’s or management’s intentions, beliefs, expectations, or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, and actual results could differ in a material manner. Additional information about factors that could cause results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the Company’s press release issued this morning and in the Company’s SEC filings. For discussion of additional factors, impacting Sysco’s business, see the Company’s Annual Report on Form-10-K, for the year ended July 1, 2017, which we expect to file shortly with the Securities and Exchange Commission and Company’s subsequent SEC filings with the SEC. A copy of these materials can be found in the Investors section at sysco.com or via Sysco’s IR app. Please note, that our fiscal year 2016 results included a 14th week for the fourth fiscal and 53rd week for the fiscal year ended July 2, 2016. In fiscal 2017, the fourth quarter included 13 weeks and the year included 52 weeks. As such, the results discussed on this call will include GAAP results and non-GAAP results adjusted for certain items. We will also share the adjusted non-GAAP results on a comparable 13 weeks and 52 weeks basis to provide reasonable year-over-year comparisons. The reconciliation of these another non-GAAP measures to the corresponding measures are included at the end of the presentation slides and can also be found on the Investors section of our website. Additionally, our results for fiscal 2017 incorporates the financial performance of the Brakes Group, as such we will reference throughout our presentation today Sysco’s financial results both including and excluding this acquisition. To ensure that we have sufficient time to answer all questions, we would like to ask each participant to limit for time today to one question and one follow-up. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Bill DeLaney.
William DeLaney: Thank you Neil and good morning everyone. Earlier this morning Sysco reported strong fourth quarter and excellent fiscal year-end financial results. For the quarter on a comparable 13 week basis, we delivered sales growth of 14% to $14.4 billion, adjusted operating income growth of 14% to $667 million and adjusted earnings per share growth 20% to $0.72. For fiscal year 2017 on a comparable 52 week basis sales grew 12% to $55.4 billion, adjusted operating income grew 20% to $2.4 billion and adjusted earnings per share also grew 20% to $2.48. These results were driven by our 65,000 associates providing our customers with the products, services and business solutions they need to run their businesses successfully. I'm especially pleased with our local case growth performance in the United States, our overall gross profit growth while expanding gross margin the right way and our focused expense management throughout the Company. In addition our European acquisition of the Brakes Group at the beginning of the fiscal year contributed meaningfully to our sales and earnings growth. Our results for the quarter and the year were achieved in a modestly growing U.S. economy, disparate regional economic conditions in Canada and mixed economic backdrops in the United Kingdom, Ireland, France and Sweden. While we continue to transition some large contract customers in our U.S. foodservice operations. Our case growth with local customers in that business segment improved during the second half of our fiscal year. Favorable consumer confidence throughout much of the country contributed to restaurant check size increases, even though year-over-year traffic trends were unfavorable in certain customer segments. Taking a moment to reflect on our steadily improving and strong business performance over the past few years, there is no doubt that our customer-centric strategy with a one Sysco approach has been executed at a high level and that we are well positioned to deliver disciplined, profitable and sustainable growth moving forward. We aspire to be the most valued and trusted business partner for all of our customers and are committed to delivering on our targeted financial objectives for Sysco’s shareholders. We will continue to develop new and refined current key strategic initiatives such as category management, revenue management, enhanced customer facing technology and multiple productivity improvement measures in order to further differentiate our industry leading customer offerings. We will do this by deepening our customer insight work, continually enhancing our technology capabilities and by attracting and developing highly capable and increasing diverse leaders and associates. In closing, I would like to thank all of our associates for contributing to our success this past year and for driving our strong performance through the first two years of our 2016 to 2018 three-year plan. I'm confident that we will achieve the high-end or a $600 million to $650 million adjusted operating growth goal, which excludes the impact of Brakes. Further we look forward to presenting our new 2018 to 2020 three-year plan later this calendar year. In the spirit of looking forward and positioning Sysco well for future success, we recently announced that Tom Bené will become President and Chief Executive Officer of Sysco effective January 1, 2018. Tom is a strong accomplished leader and most deserving successor. I look forward to working closely with Tom together with our senior leadership team over the next few months to ensure smooth transition process. And with that, I will turn the call over to Tom.
Thomas Bené: Thank you Bill, and good morning everyone. Fiscal 2017 was a successful year for Sysco and I'm proud of the results our associates have accomplished this year. They are executing at a high level as we continue to achieve the key strategies levers of our current three-year plan, including delivering accelerated case growth through a focus on local customers, growing gross profit dollars and managing overall expenses. Fiscal 2017 was marked not only by our strong performance in which we continued our relentless focus on the customer, but also because of the some important highlights that include the addition of the Brakes business in Europe, a completion of the successful transition of 12 operating companies from SAP through enhanced version of our legacy ERP system, and validation of our customer-centric approach to our business as reinforced by the improvement in our customer loyalty scores. An example is our approach to giving customers a choice in how they want to interact with us, whether it’s through our best-in-class sales force, via our mobile platform or through a phone call. I would now like to discuss our segment results starting with U.S. Foodservice Operations including some highlights of key strategic initiatives that are helping to differentiate Sysco in the marketplace. In addition, I will speak to the performance of our International Foodservice Operations. Our U.S. Foodservice segment had a solid year with fiscal 2017 results on a comparable 52 week basis of sales growth of 1.5% and gross profit growth of 4%, while adjusted operating expenses grew 1.7% resulting in adjusted operating income growth of 7.8%. We once again experienced strong growth in our local business, up 2.4% in U.S. Broadline. This was partially offset by declines in case volume for our multi-unit business due to our efforts to deliver disciplined profitable growth. This resulted in approximately 1% total case growth overall. As we progress through the next year, we expect to see those trends around our multi-unit business begin to improve. Importantly, as we strive to provide value for our local customers through innovative product offerings and value-added services, along with e-commerce capabilities, we are seeing them reward us with growth for the 13th quarter in a row. Looking at gross profit growth for U.S. Foodservice Operations, on a comparable 52 week basis, we delivered growth of 4% and gross margin expansion of 48 basis points, as we manage the deflationary environment in the first part of the year very well and are now working our way through an inflationary environment. Poultry, produce, seafood and dairy are driving the current inflation and we expect inflation to continue for the balance of the calendar year. Our strategic focus on accelerating growth of local customers is working. It all starts with an insight-based customer-centric approach that permeates everything we do. For example, we have improved the capabilities of our sales force through investments made in training, technology and targeted specialized resources and as a result our marketing associates are spending more time working with our customers on value-added activities and consultative services such as menu analysis, inventory management and business reviews. These services foster a deeper relationship with our customers and further enforces the importance of sales force play in helping our customers succeed. From a cost perspective, within U.S. Foodservice Operations our expense management was solid as we limited growth to 1.7% on an adjusted 52 week comparable basis for the year. Looking at U.S. Broadline, cost-per-case for fiscal 2017 improved by approximately $0.01 compared to the prior year. And on a fuel price neutral basis, cost-per-case increased by one penny. The consistent performance we have been to achieve is driven by key strategic initiatives which are supported by the expansive network of dedicated hard working front line associates in the warehouse and those team members delivering our products; through their efforts we have consistently been able to deliver a high level of service to our customers. Looking at the overall performance for the U.S. foodservice operations on a 52 week comparable basis, I'm pleased with how all of our associates executed our plan; as our adjusted operating income performed well and we were able to improve adjusted operating margins by 45 basis points for the full-year. Moving to international foodservice operations; on a 52 week comparable basis sales and adjusted operating income nearly doubled both largely driven by our recent acquisition of the Brakes Group. During the year Brakes performed reasonably well in midst of challenging environment in the UK as they exceed our expectation for EPS accretion contributing $0.14 per share. They are also making good progress in their supply chain transformational efforts as they move to multi-temp capability across the UK. Growth in France remains steady and Sweden continues to produce favorable results. We also continue to see long-term opportunities for growth across our new European business. Additionally we are in the process of integrating our Ireland businesses and things are progressing well; we expect to achieve modest benefits from these activities. Looking forward, we are excited about the long-term opportunities to create value for our customers in the European business. Over the next few years we will invest capital and resources to build on the existing foundation of the business as we continue to work on key strategic initiatives that will position us well for the future. We remain pleased with our performance in Canada despite the continued softness in Alberta which has been driven primarily by the energy market decline. Our Canadian business has seen positive momentum in the growth of its local business driven by improved sales execution and implementation of our customer focused initiatives such as category management and revenue management. In addition we are effectively managing costs by streamlining administrative expenses to improve productivity. As a result, we expect the Canadian business to continue to deliver positive performance. Turning to Latin America we are excited about the new facilities in both Costa Rica and Panama. Specifically in Costa Rica, we recently opened a 180,000 square foot state-of-the-art facility with the test kitchen and training facilities. This new space is enabling new products and full product lines to be available to our customers and we are excited about the accelerated growth potential those offerings will deliver. As we enter the new fiscal year, we do so with strong momentum and I believe fiscal 2018 will bring opportunities for Sysco. Our ongoing focus on customer insights and delivering against their needs for innovative products and consultative services will enable our sales force to continue to add significant value and deliver growth with those local customers. We will need to effectively manage the ongoing transition to an inflationary environment with our customers while staying focused on gross profit growth and we will continue to focus on driving efficiency from our supply chain through our expansive network that is built to provide a high level of service to our customers. In summary, fiscal 2017 showed important progress against our customer-centric strategy for Sysco. Our customer and operational strategies are firmly aligned around improving our customers' experience, engaging our associates at the highest level to improve execution and delivering on our financial objectives. Finally, as I work through the leadership transition with Bill, I'm personally honored to be given the opportunity to lead this amazing Company and I'm incredibly excited about the future for Sysco. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Grade for further details.
Joel Grade: Thank you, Tom and good morning everyone. As Bill and Tom mentioned earlier, we are pleased with the results for the fourth quarter and for the year. Our quality of earnings growth for the year reflects continued momentum from our business including strong case growth, excellent gross profit dollar growth and solid cost management. This morning, I will set with our quarterly results on the comparable week 13 basis excluding Brakes, where we delivered sales growth of 3.4%, gross profit growth of 4.2% which included margin expansion of 14 basis points and adjusted operating expenses growth of 2.6% resulting in adjusted operating income growth of 9%. As Tom mentioned earlier, we saw inflation of approximately 2.6% in our U.S. Broadline business for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. The pace of the transition from deflation to inflation has inferably rapid, as produced, poultry, seafood and dairy were increasing and driving overall inflation. We do not see negative impacts on our ability to grow gross profit dollars. However, it is important to note that this change from deflation to inflation pressures gross margin as a percentage of sales. Shifting gears, I would like to transition to our results for the year on a comparable 52 weeks basis excluding Brakes. Sales grew 1.6% and gross profit dollars grew 4.1% which included margin expansion of 43 basis points and adjusted operating expenses grew 1.7% which resulted in adjusted operating income growth of 12.4% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 13.6%. We continue to maintain a healthy gap between gross profit dollar growth and adjusted operating expense growth, which translated into an strong adjusted operating income leverage and continue to progress towards achieving our three-year plan objectives. Cash flow from operations was $2.2 billion for the year, up approximately $309 million from last year. Free cash flow for the year $1.6 billion, which is about $150 million higher compared to last year. These changes are largely due to improved business performance, improve working capital management and favorable year-over-year comparisons due to the U.S. Foods termination payment last year offset by higher fiscal 2017 cash taxes due to prior year deductions related to the U.S. Foods payment and a deferral from flood relief. Net CapEx for the year was $663 million or about 1.2% of sales, which is $159 million higher than last year primarily due to ongoing capital investments and the addition of Brakes. Net working capital performance has continued to improve. We have nearly achieve our three-year goal of four days and have improved our net DSO by 3.8 days compared to FY 2015 driven improvements in all three areas, payables, receivables and inventory. Our fiscal 2017 results include certain items that were related to the Brakes acquisition including amortization associated with the transaction and accelerated depreciation related to our enhance business technology strategy. The accelerated depreciation related to technology has concluded and will not be part of our fiscal 2018. Lastly I’m pleased with our adjusted return on invested capital performance which ended the year approximately 13%. Excluding Brakes our ROIC was approximately 16% which exceeded our original three-year plan objective of 15%. Now I would like to close with some commentary and the outlook for fiscal year 2018. After two years, we have been able to achieve $417 million of operating income growth since fiscal 2015 and I share Bill's confidence that we will achieve the high-end of our $600 million to $650 million adjusted operating income growth goal which excludes the impact of Brakes. As such, we anticipate another solid year in fiscal 2018 driven by gradually improving results throughout the year. The return to an inflationary environment will likely continue for the balance of the calendar year creating a gross margin headwind as a percentage of sales, but it should not hamper our ability to grow our gross profit dollars. As we have previously stated, our capital allocation priorities include key focus on investing in our business. Capital expenditures will increase during fiscal 2018 and are expected to be approximately 1.3 to 1.4% of sales including Brakes. The increase compared to our recent run rate is driven by a few factors, including increased investments and facility expansions and improvements and increased technology investments. To accelerate the success we are having with customer facing technology and increased investments in technologies to support our shared services organization. Even with the increase in capital spend we still expect continued strong cash flow performance for fiscal year 2018. As such, we expect to continue to grow our dividend in fiscal 2018 and finally we have completed our $3 billion two year share repurchase program during fiscal 2017. Our share buybacks in 2018 were in line with our capital allocation strategy and involve opportunistic purchases and buybacks that offset dilution. In summary, we had a strong year, reflecting continued momentum from our business driven by strong local case growth, excellent gross profit dollar growth and good cost management. We achieved a healthy spread between gross profit growth and expense growth that has led to strong leverage for our earnings. We also have been able to effectively turn those earnings into cash and grow our free cash flows. These results are just the ongoing commitment of our associates to serving our customers and delivering a high level of execution in all areas of our business. We remain committed to those high levels of service and executions translating into enhanced financial performance in both the near and long-term. Operator, we are now ready for the question-and-answer session.
Operator:
Operator:
Kelly Bania: Hi, good morning, just wanted to go back to the comment about the operating income targets and the confidence in reaching the high-end I guess implies an acceleration, you mentioned kind of some gradually improving results in terms of expectations for next year. So I was just wondering if you could elaborate on that where that is. It sound like may be some of the multi-unit trends may be could improve next year or just could you walk us through the thought process there?
Joel Grade: Sure, absolutely. This is Joel. So yes. Number one, I think the key point as I have talked about is, we certainly as Bill and I both said, are constant in our ability at the high-end of that target. And I would say that the acceleration that I talked through the year really is partially related to some of the improved multi-unit volume throughout the year. In addition to that, in terms of timing, there are some elements of incorporating the Brakes business into our business that will result in some level of increasing transition between the first half and the second half of the year. And so, again that I think as we have kind of talked about here, I wouldn’t look for anything dramatic there, but just a gradual acceleration I think over the course of the year is what we are really talking about.
Kelly Bania: Great. And then just to ask also about the independents, the growth with independents again was strong. Just curious if in your discussions with them if you are sensing any change in their confidence or any change in how their outlook over the next couple of years?
Thomas Bené: Hey, Kelly. Good morning, it’s Tom. I think we continue to feel that the independent segment is well positioned to continue to perform at a decent level. Obviously as we talked, there is been some I would say some softness in restaurants in general, but I think we still feel like the independents are well positioned whether it’s the product offering that they have, their ability to be flexible to meet the changing consumer needs. I think the other thing just as always a reminder is because of our - whether it’s our current share of the market or the fragmentation that exists generally in foodservice, we continue to believe that there is lots of opportunity for us to grow and whether that’s in independent restaurant segment or other segments of our business.
Kelly Bania: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.
John Heinbockel: So, Tom, I’m curious, if you look out the next year or two, what is the prognosis on accelerated growth in some of the centers of plate categories, seafood meals or produce, given that you have made some changes organizationally, is that maybe we see an acceleration in part of the business or is that going to take a little while longer?
Thomas Bené: Good morning, John. What I think specifically to those areas we are fortunate at Sysco, we have got an organization and a business structure that is exists around specialty meat and produce that positions us well. And so, I think we continue to believe that center of the plate is an important category and I think we look at that and say whether it’s the way we have structured ourselves now or the fact that we have got those capabilities that we are well positioned to grow. And so, whether or not that’s going to be a significant acceleration or not probably has much to do with what is going on broadly in the marketplace, but I think we feel like we are well positioned and we continue to work on improving even our current position in those areas.
John Heinbockel: Okay. And then something completely differently, if you think about the international business again framing first, relative to the U.S., I know the goal has been right U.S. to grow GP 100 basis points above SG&A. Is that something that you can duplicate internationally or given where Brakes is can the spread be wider for some period of time?
William DeLaney: Well first of all John its Bill, good morning and I'm not sure that we have spoke into a 100 basis points [gaps] (Ph) going forward, but we certainly have talked a lot about that we are pleased with the way we are growing the GP relative to the expenses and we certainly do need to continue grow that faster. I think when you look at internationally, we will continue to report that segment and you have got a mix of things going on there; certainly a mature business in Canada where as Tom just said in U.S., we still see a lot of opportunity for growth up there and to leverage some of these strategic initiatives that we have rolled out for the most part in the United States to do that over in Canada, and we are swiftly here moving forward. Brakes itself, you heard Joel kind of alluded to it, we have owned it now for about a year, we are really pleased with that acquisition, there's a lot of upside potential, we are in a normal part of a transition process now where we are going to be continuing to invest in some of the transformation work that they had already started to make their warehouses more efficient to put to a big merger that they did in France together and to continue with our integration work in Ireland. So I think Europe is a little harder to call on it, but you know certainly growing the bottom line the right way both in terms of top-line as well as leveraging the GPs is that mantra will continue there just as it will in the U.S.; and then in Latin America, smaller markets to be sure and we are really building for the future there with some of the countries that we are in, with the management team as we are partnering with them there. And as Tom mentioned we have got a new facility or two coming along. So I would look at international as a little bit more variable relative to the U.S. side, but certainly our overall levers that we talked about here over the medium to long-term which is to grow volume and to leverage that volume and to get a good return on invested capital, those will continue throughout the Company.
John Heinbockel: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Bill Kirk from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
William Kirk: Hey guys, thank you for taking the question. I wanted to go back towards the inflation in food, it looks like restaurants their pass through or their pricing hasn't been as strong in the last couple of months as it had been over the last call it two years and that's happening at the same time their food product inflation has now arrived. So that sounds to me like something that's hard for the vertical to manage. Can you help me understand if that dynamics is important and maybe what tier of the vertical it would impact the most?
William DeLaney: Yes I will start Bill, its Bill here. I'm not as familiar with some of that data that you're just referencing, and I would just tell you generally what we have seen over the years and we have talked a lot of about this on calls like this. When you have an inflationary period and where that overall inflation is in the 2% to 3% area, it's usually at a level just for the customer in a particular restaurant were able to pass along. So generally a 2% rate is a kind of sweet spot for our customers and not a huge challenge for us; now we did point here earlier that the transition from deflation to inflation has been a little more rapid than normal, and there are certainly some categories where we are seeing more than 2% to 3% inflation. So that becomes a challenge both in terms of how we work with our customers and they work with their patrons, but I wouldn't say we are seeing anything out there today that would be overly difficult for our customers to pass along.
William Kirk: Okay, and related to that during this transitional period gross margin percentage comes under a little pressure. Would there be any way to discern - is increased competition is part of that or if that’s just a natural pressure during the inflection?
Joel Grade: Yes. let me just address that, it’s Joel. I think the main reason really calling that out is really more of what I will call a mathematical function of the inflationary pricing and so I think even in the previously deflationary periods we have talked about that that there was an element of that that was driving a margin as a percentage. So I think the main thing for you to take away and just have to remember, our key focus is on gross profit dollars and so while again there maybe some mathematical pressure on the margin percentage, at the end of the day we feel good about our ability to generate gross profit dollars which is ultimately the focus that we will continue to go after.
William DeLaney: And look, I think that’s a really key point, we continue to make it - we are going to be going through and we are in the midst of going through transition now in this environment and our revenue management tools, this will be the first time that we have really utilized those in an inflation environment. So, that’s an opportunity to continue to manage the price movements more effectively than perhaps we had in the past, but if I really want to emphasize, our ability to grow the gross profit dollars to 4% in a deflationary environment that approach deflation of 2% over most of the fiscal year. It’s really an extraordinary achievement and its one that in my judgment we would have not been able to produce those numbers if we didn’t have the tools available to us that we do today in terms of [CapMan] (Ph) and [RevMan] (Ph) a lot of the sales concentrated work that Tom was speaking to. So, obviously our job is to manage and to work closely with our customers through these dynamic periods, but we are much better positioned today to work through this, but the key here really is gross profit dollars that is what we pay our bills with and that’s what drives the earnings growth that John Heinbockel was referencing earlier.
William Kirk: Okay. Thank you for that that context. That was useful. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from Marisa Sullivan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Marisa Sullivan: Question. Wanted to touch on Brakes and to get your thoughts on accretion that you are expecting for next year and where you see opportunities both on top-line and then also in productivity?
William DeLaney: Yes. So, I will start with the accretion number. I think as we have talked about when we originally had announced the deal, we have anticipated in the first year, a mid single-digit accretion and the second year, I think in the low double-digits of accretion. We certainly believe that continue to be the case. So, I think I would look at that as probably roughly similar to the current year as far as that goes. Tom, I don’t know, if you want to talk about the top-line.
Thomas Bené: Yes. And then regarding just generally how we are feeling about it, as I mentioned the UK market certainly had some choppiness in it, but I think we are feeling good about where we can be positioned there. We had good movement in growth in France and we feel good about our business in Sweden and obviously with what we are doing in Ireland we continue to feel pretty good about that as well. So, I think overall we feel like we remain pretty well positioned and I think we are just obviously going to have to keep an eye on what is going on from a market perspective, but I think we are positioned how we are performing we feel pretty good. We do have some investments we need to make over the next year there and we feel like that’s an important part of us continuing to build on the work they had started pre-acquisition and we shared and talked a little bit about that earlier.
Marisa Sullivan: Got it and just to change topics, want to touch on the Sigma business. Can you comment on the sales growth trends excluding 53rd week question and also was curious to see the gross margin up a little bit year-over-year, wonder if you could give some more context on that.
William DeLaney: Sure, I mean related to Sigma, we had good top-line growth from Sigma perspective. We had some new customers that have come on board in that business over the last year and so I think that's driving some of that top-line, obviously very competitive out there still in this space and we continue to work through that part of it. From a margin standpoint again I think that has much to do with some of the - think about how that business has managed on a cost plus basis, there's some margin impact of that, but it's mostly driven by new business that is driving the improvements there.
Marisa Sullivan: Got it, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Shane Higgins from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Shane Higgins: Thanks, good morning guys. Just wanted to get a sense of how local case or both U.S. Broadline and local case has kind of trended during the fourth quarter and what you guys are seeing in terms of trends, any color you can give 1Q to-date?
William DeLaney: Hey Shane how are you. Well as we said, we had solid, what was it Joel? 2.4 for the year and 2.7 for the quarter coming off of the third quarter we were over three on the local side, so we were pleased with that. You know as I mentioned and Tom alluded to I think as well, we have been transitioning some large contract customer business, some of it our own choice, some of it not, we are in the midst of continuing to do that but we are in a good place there and we expect those trends to gradually improve as we talked earlier you know later in the year. So overall cases flat to one, but local cases 2.5 to 3.
Joel Grade: I would just remind you too, I mean it’s part of our - again this is now the 13th quarter in a row we have grown our local cases and in addition to that if you think about the range that we said at the time when we thought about this original three-year plan, I think that you know this range is 2.5%-ish was right close to where we are at and so I think we feel good overall above that.
Shane Higgins: Great and just a follow-up on the gross profit dollars and impact of the transition to inflation. Did that actually benefit that 4% type number that you guys put up for the quarter, the return to inflation and how should we think about that impacting your gross profit dollar growth in the first quarter.
Joel Grade: Yes, so I think the way I would think about that for this quarter, I think certainly again we are pleased with the 4% plus growth. I think the transition as I mentioned and Bill mentioned as well was fairly quick and so while we don't have a real significant lag in terms of turning over pricing there is some lag and so what I would just say in general is that in fairly rough and rapid uptick in a few categories that I would say again slow to little bit the acceleration of the gross profit growth. So that's how I would think about that in terms of how it impacted this quarter. But again, as we talked about going forward, we certainly are confident in our ability to grow our gross profit dollars despite that inflation as Bill talked about. The overall inflation number is well within the range of modern inflation that we think works in this industry well and so feel good in general, but to answer your question directly there wasn't I'd say a major impact in this quarter on that.
Shane Higgins: Great. Thanks, I will get back in the queue.
Operator: Your next question comes from Karen Short from Barclays. Your line is open.
Karen Short: Hi, thanks. Joel just to clarify one thing in terms of the Brakes accretion, mid single-digit year one, I think you said low double-digit year two, is that pennies or percent?
Joel Grade: Pennies.
Karen Short: Okay. And then I guess I was curious on a couple of things. One of your competitors last week commented on Technomics outlook for independent restaurants. And it just seemed very counter intuitive, I mean when you talk to any restaurant analysts that independents are actually slowing. So wondering if you could give some color on that and I just had one other housekeeping question.
William DeLaney: Yes, I will take a shot of that Karen. Technomics you know there is a lot of different sources as you know in the industry that we all rely on to get as much data as we can, and a lot of the data crosses over between custom segments and is somewhat defined differently by different people. Technomics has been kind of that consistent barometers, it’s been out there for years and they do a good job. But the reality is while their data comes from people in our industry that they interview and talk to and so I would characterize it as directional and I would tell you six or nine months ago people were saying that the independent was going to grow a lot faster and be in the upper 2% and I don’t know if that totally bought into that. And now we are seeing that their forward view in the medium term, even short-term is lower than 2%. So from our perspective I think it’s good information, it’s consistently done. You have got an economy out that’s growing at about 2%. And I think in industry there is no big shocks in this industry right now, so there is nothing going on anywhere close to similar to what we saw in 2009. So what I’m trying to say is that I think there is no big secular trends going on, there is some cyclical things, there is always weather, there is comparisons. But I think I 1.5% to 2.5% range out there at different points of time is where we have historically have been and that is certainly how we are looking at it in terms how we work through our strategy and how we plan the business. So I wouldn’t get too excited about it being where it was six months ago and I wouldn’t be too excited about the most recent forecast. And the key is growth here and the business is still growing and it’s growing - those check sizes are growing and we are well positioned to take advantage of that growth and Tom pointed out.
Karen Short: Okay, thanks. And then I just was curious, I know you don’t want to be pinned down to a spread between gross profit dollar growth versus OpEx growth, but as we look kind of to the next three-years, once we get into 2018, just may be qualitatively could you give us a sense of where you think operating profit growth will come from more, is it more on the OpEx opportunity side or do you think it’s still fairly down the same gross profit, or gross margin, gross profit opportunities in OpEx?
Joel Grade: Yes, I think the way I would think about that Karen first of all, as we talked about, we will certainly give more guidance on our next three-year plan later this calendar year. But I would look at this as a very balanced approach to growth, which certainly we have talked about our three-year plan and I would certainly think about as we move forward. Again I think both from the focus on local customers, growing local cases and overall profitable cases, focus on growing our gross profit dollars and again being very effectively, aggressively and thoughtfully managing our costs is really a very balanced you know is how I would really think about this moving forward.
Karen Short: Great. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ajay Jain from Pivotal Research Group. Your line is open.
Ajay Jain: Yes, hi good morning. Joel I think you mentioned that you're at $417 million in operating income growth towards that three-year target. So I wanted to first confirm that number and I was also wondering if you can confirm how much incremental growth you had in the latest quarter. Correct me if I'm wrong, I thought you are already close to around $410 million at the end of Q3, so that might imply not much incremental growth in the fourth quarter?
Joel Grade: So, first of all $417 million Ajay is the number, now keep in mind when you're looking at comparatives you're looking at a quarter of last year that had the additional week versus this year. So the incremental growth on a quarter-to-quarter basis purely is not something you're going to be able to look at just directly. So the incremental growth - Neil if you want to take that during the quarter?
Neil Russell: Yes sure Ajay you're right. If you're looking at 13 week versus 14 week it's relatively modest, but if you look at 13 weeks versus 13 week comparable the rate of operating income growth is pretty much in line with what you're seeing throughout the year.
Ajay Jain: Okay. I was asking about the sequential increase from Q3 and Q4?
Joel Grade: We had $52 million ex-Brakes, so if you're comparing to the $417 million again is part of the three-year plan; so $52 million on a comparable quarterly basis what we added in the fourth quarter this year when you factor 13-13.
Ajay Jain: And I just had a question about the U.S. case growth, can you talk about the sequential decrease, typically total case growth should be higher compared to case growth in the street business and that wasn't the case in Q4. I know you mentioned in your prepared remarks that they always had transitioning of the less profitable business about 1%, but if you adjust for the calendar shift and the transitional impact for those multi-unit accounts, what was the case growth for the non local portion of the U.S. Broadline, can you quantify that or at least confirm its positive or negative?
Thomas Bené: Yes. So, a couple of things, as we talked, we had consistent improvement in the local growth over the last 13 quarters quite honestly, but we talked about the 2.7% in the fourth quarter for local; the contract business or the CNU we talked about it was in fact negative for the quarter and that's consistent with what we have talked about as we have looked at our portfolio and as Bill mentioned earlier we had certain customers we made some decisions on and there are customers who had made some decisions around doing business with us. But we continue to feel really good about the overall number that 1% comes from a combination of the contract business declining and the local business continuing to be strong; and my comment about improving is we do see some lapping of that happening in fiscal year 2018 and we also have some new business, will be coming on later in the year.
Ajay Jain: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Chris Mandeville from Jefferies. Your line is open.
Christopher Mandeville: Hey good morning. The majority of my questions have already been asked, but I guess I was hoping you could touch on wage pressures and the availability of qualified labor, has that worsened at all over the last 12 months or what kind of level of growth can we expect as we look to 2018?
William DeLaney: Chris I will start and I will let Tom and Joel jump in here too. I think there's two things going on as it relates to labor, certainly with our customers in certain parts of the country there continues to be some pressure to source employees as well as labor wages and rates to pay and of all that. So, that continues to be phenomena out there that we are working closely with our customers on. And on our end of it, when you hear us talk about flat cost per apiece in the most simplicity way what that really is about especially on the supply chain and the operation side of the business is to be keep our wage and benefit increases in line with our productivity increases and productivity obviously comes in a different way. But it’s largely productivity in the warehouse on the truck how we manage overtime all those types of things. And so, we are pleased with where we are there right now. I would say most of our contracts and most of our annual increases are in line with that productivity goals that we have set, but it something we have to manage very aggressively and very hard, but over the last few years we have done a nice job of it.
Joel Grade: Yes and I think as Bill covered the financial part of that, from a retention standpoint, we measure employee retention and we feel good about where we are today and where we have been as it relates to lot of those types of roles. So, I think the marketplace is I guess in a decent place and obviously I think we as a employer doing a nice job of attracting and retaining the people we need.
Thomas Bené: I think the only thing I would just add, just lot of the questions that we get - questions on minimum wage loss and this and that and the other thing and that’s an impact on our customers in terms of the things they are dealing with that doesn’t necessarily or doesn’t really impact us at all and that most of our labors as well double or wage rates.
Christopher Mandeville: All right. That’s helpful. And I guess I have got a random one for you. I’m curious as the Brakes business is been affected by the recent [Agra call] (Ph) in Europe and if so can you help us understand how and whether or not that’s incorporated into the new outlook?
Thomas Bené: I don’t know if we can help you with that one today, Chris. So we will come back to you.
Christopher Mandeville: All right. Thank you again guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
John Ivankoe: Hi. Two questions if I may. Firstly, the restaurant industry or at least some of the public data that we see show June is kind of one of the softer months of the quarter and that softness continuing from June into July it’s not actually getting a little bit worse. So, just wanted to get a sense in terms of what you are seeing just in terms of the broad industry and independent restaurants specifically?
William DeLaney: Hey, John. Look, I think what we see is it moves around, okay. So there is periods where you have a couple of months where it’s spikes up or at least goes up somewhat and then it comes back down and sometimes it’s hard to explain from one quarter even one month or two months stretch to another. So, I don’t know that I would get overly excited about one or two months of data, it’s somewhat mixed out there. Consumer confidence is positive for the most part our restaurant operators and customer feel good about the business not quite, maybe is feasibly good as they were a few months ago, but my experience tells me that these numbers move around and they are still very much on a range that as I said earlier it translates to go to the industry and that’s certainly good for us.
John Ivankoe: Okay. And then secondly regarding the CapEx, I think the guidance is 1.3% to 1.4% of sales and I do understand for you that that moves around. Maybe a little bit forward looking on that comment, I mean is that’s the new level of CapEx as a percentage of revenue as we think about your capital needs over the next couple of years where might 2018 be kind of a peak or a trough I guess and the level changes in the years after?
Joel Grade: Hey John this is Joel. I think you're first comment was probably the right one in that that does move around somewhat. I don’t know that I wouldn't look at that necessarily as the new norm, I think I would characterize it as the fact that we have strong cash flows, we have opportunities to invest as I have talked about in some things to continue to transform the Brakes business as well technology initiatives and some facility opportunities we have. So I would certainly look at that, I would call as much opportunistic and again just really consistent with our priorities of continue to reinvest in this Company and we will benefit if that is long-term rate.
John Ivankoe: And is there anything discrete, I think you said a number of things in your prepared comments, but is there anything discrete that we can point to in terms of capital spend on 2018 that will be a material benefit in 2019 or beyond?
Joel Grade: No, I wouldn't look at it that way. Again, across the category as I talked about, again our return on invested capital continues to grow, we certainly feel good about the investments we are making but there is nothing I would finger point as one discrete item.
William DeLaney: I mean I would say the aggregate John, the incremental part of that will be a benefit in 2019 and probably more beyond 2019 to be fair, these are capital investments we are making.
John Ivankoe: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Andrew Wolf from Loop Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Andrew Wolf: Thank you, just a quick housekeeping to start with and I might have missed this, but did you say how much acquisitions helped sales in the U.S. foodservice segment.
William DeLaney: We did not.
Andrew Wolf: Did you provided that number so is...
William DeLaney: Andy I guess the biggest acquisition - we certainly talked about Brakes, which is clearly been a significant acquisition for us, but in terms of any small fold ins we didn't get it. Its minor I will tell you just in general, it certainly remains a point of focus here for us going forward in terms of our teams and we see opportunities there're different opportunities. As we talked earlier, we still see some fold in opportunities in this country and in Canada, both on the Broadline but in particular on the specialty side of the business. Certainly with Brakes we have a platform over there now in the countries that we are in as well as some other countries to grow and invest overtime. You know it's a long-term investment and then what I spoke to as it relate to Latin America that's probably although modest in size at this point in time, you know probably will be the most wide open area that we have for acquisition opportunities.
Andrew Wolf: Okay, so I mean I'm sort of throwing in a number of somewhere less than 1% for the whole business not just for the U.S...
Joel Grade: It's well less than that, again when you take the Brakes number out again for this year that's was with a key focus. Bill talked about certainly a focus for us moving forward.
Andrew Wolf: So on the inflation side for the case growth slowed yet the gross profit dollars were the same as last quarter, so clearly there is some pass through or lot. Could you speak to the cadence of that, did it improve or are there any other players out there who might be struggling, looking for share and maybe using price as a lever. Could you just give us a sense of what's going on in the market as you see on price pass through.
Thomas Bené: Andy this is Tom, I think the first thing I'd start with is when we talk we talk a lot about this, it remains very competitive out there. We have lots of competitors in general and from a market perspective I think we continue to look at leveraging all of the capabilities we have whether it’s things like the category management we talked about to make sure we have got the best cost on products or its revenue management tool, so we make sure that we are pricing products appropriately in the marketplace and making sure we are taking care of our customers. We still feel really good about obviously our ability to grow and our ability to do it in the right way and I think that’s really what you are seeing. I don’t think there is any specific thing that’s happened in addition to that. This is really about a balanced approach, making sure we are focused the right levers of the business that starts with that local customer where we can incremental value and doing the things that help basically get recognized and rewarded by them for providing the right products and the right services in a right way. So I don’t think there is anything beyond that that you should read into it.
William DeLaney: No, I don’t think so either, I mean guess I’m going to go back and reiterate a couple of points I made in my prepared comments that as you know the way we look at this business is we are in a sort of long haul here and we have got a very customer-centric strategy that’s predicated and more and better growing customer insights in terms of what they need to run their business better, how do they deal with commodity pressure, how do they deal with price increases, how do they deal with non-traditional competitive forces in the marketplace. And so, that customer insight work that we have done over the years we are going to continue to invest in that, deepen it, broaden it, accelerate it where necessary. And that’s what brings us to where we are today and where we have come over the last several years which is a strategy and a platform here that starts with the customers. But very much is about differentiating ourselves in the marketplace from all types of competitors, and in particular, utilizing our sales force more efficiently, more productively providing them tool they need to provide consulted service that Tom referenced to our customer base and leveraging our supply chain. We have got a footprint globally now today and growing brand and differentiating products and services in a way that provide values to those customers, but also providing that wide range of products fresh, frozen, dry whatever folks are looking for, utilizing the brand in a way that provides value for them, but also where we can source from around the world. And then obviously technology is another area that we continue to hear from our customers. Anything we can do to help them run their businesses more efficiently, we need to do. And that’s where you have seen us pivot here over the last couple of years and on the margin, invest more of our spend on the technology side, in the customer facing side, in the things like supplies on fly, cape, Sysco Labs that are trying to stay current at least with the evolving needs of our customer base. So clearly it’s a competitive business and clearly a lot of competition, but we feel we are very well positioned here not just for today, but continue to go forward as long as we stay close to our customer base.
Andrew Wolf: Thank you. And a similar question just to follow-up. On the multi-unit side, it sounds like you are stacking better trends there with both sales and profitability. And it sounds like some of the other large players at least one of them sounded sort of has the same expectation. Is it kind of tough market for I think the distributors, but sort of lacking price discipline. But it seems like - just want to get your sense, do you think that might be changing somewhat either from your perspective or again from the market perspective?
William DeLaney: I think what we have been really consistent on Andy is that we continue to see opportunities for growth, we are about growth, but we look at growth a little differently than we probably did 10 or 15 years ago, it’s about profitable disciplined, sustainable, i.e. repeatable growth and doing it in the right way in the communities that we serve. So I don’t know that there is anything really different out there, this is a strategy that we have put together and executed I think increasingly well over the last few years. It’s going to remain competitive out there and we all go after the business hard, but I think everybody understands it we have got shareholders out there that we need to provide returns for as well.
Andrew Wolf: Yes, thank you.
William DeLaney: Sure.
Operator: Your next question comes from Vincent Sinisi from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Vincent Sinisi: Hey guys, thanks very much for taking my question here. I wanted to just go back to the comment that you made that - you have made in prior quarters as well of course about some of typically the larger customer exits, some that you decide some maybe not, just trying to get a better sense of kind of the dynamics of the competitive environment like are you able to kind of follow some of those customers like where do they go or if you're getting them from others where do they come from is that more kind of shifting between the three larger players or are there any other dynamics to be aware of?
Joel Grade: So, Vini I assume we are back talking about really the contract side of the business here. I guess we have said and I will reiterate is that Bill just said this as well. We are very focused on kind of disciplined profitable growth and wanted to make sure that we are making the right decisions and sometimes those decisions that we make drive a customer to make a different decision; we certainly know when we lose the customer where it goes and we certainly know when we gain a customer where it came from. But I wouldn't say there's anything unique or different going on in the marketplace, it's always been competitive, it continues to be competitive and it's really about making sure that we are making the right decisions for Sysco and for our shareholders and that's how we try to approach this business and so aside from that I wouldn't say there's a whole lot else to say.
William DeLaney: Yes, and we stick close them Vini. I mean this business what goes around comes around in this business, sometimes in that part of it takes a while, but we certainly maintain a relationship as best we can and we are investing for the long-term so it's not unusual for a customer perhaps to move on and then come back to Sysco at some point in time in the future.
Vincent Sinisi: Okay. And then just a quick follow-up to the comments on the 2018 CapEx, I know you guys have said in the prepared kind of facilities expansion, tech investment things of that nature, I'm sure we will get more color in the fall, but anything you could tell us today in terms of anything that we should be kind of be expecting with any of those and also maybe a split between the U.S. and in the international sides of the business?
Joel Grade: This is Joel. I think as we have talked a little bit before, I mean it's a pretty broad portfolio of investments we are planning to make that we certainly anticipate benefits from in aggregate over the upcoming years. Again, it's really focused around just broadly opportunities to reinvest in our facilities, add capabilities and expansions there, technology again really focused to the most part around our customer facing technologies and the customer experience as well as opportunities to enhance our shared services platform to drive further efficiency and then from the standpoint of investing in the continued transformation opportunities in Brakes. I think again that would be broadly characterizing the high points of that and so I think you have a little bit of a sense from this year's earnings where the amount of investment that we put into Brakes, we called that out as we talked of our FY 2017 CapEx, it's probably reasonable and fairly consistent here over the next year.
Vincent Sinisi: Okay. Great, thanks Joel and Bill, Tom best of luck to you guys over the next few months here preparing for the transition.
William DeLaney: Thanks Vini.
Thomas Bené: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Zack Fadem from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Zachary Fadem: Hey good morning, thanks for fitting me in. Quickly on the three-year plan, you said you're tracking at the high-end of the six to 650 range, but as you look at the year ahead with a little more clarity on the current operating environment is there still potential to come in above the high-end and if so what are the drivers that need to happen to get there?
William DeLaney: Hey Zac. There is always potential, but I think where we are at right now is we are trying to signal that we feel good about the high-end and that’s where we would like to leave that for today, but certainly we are not going to stop at 650 if we don’t have to and that’s really our message for the day. We have said now several times that the markets are going to be somewhat fluid here, but overall we now operate in several large markets, we are well positioned if not the leading player in all of those markets and we see plenty of opportunity for growth and we are much more disciplined about how we go after growth today. So, if you put all this in some type of historical context that 650 is about $200 million higher than where we started two years ago. So, I’m not ready to go above that today, but we certainly feel good about the number.
Zachary Fadem: Fair enough. And is there any directional commentary you could provide on Broadline case growth in the next year, for the national account level should we anticipate further calling here? And then second, should we think about continued share gains for the local customers in 2018?
Thomas Bené: So on the contract side, as I said earlier, I think you will see us showing some improvement in those numbers as we get into fiscal year 2018, because of the both lapping some of the decision were made last year and also we have some new business that will be coming on. So, I think you should feel like there will be some improvement there. Regarding the local business, I mean we continue to feel really good about how we are positioned and as we talked about why we feel like we are able to succeed in that space has really more to do with how we are focused on delivering the value for those customers. I did say in my prepared comments about our loyalty score is going up. And I think one of the things as we think about what drove that, we talk to our customers a lot and what we have heard was everything from they are feeling about our marketing associates and continuing to add a lot of value through our selling resources and that means we are accomplishing the things we said, which is making them much more capable on and be more consultative and how they are working with our customers. We also heard good things around our technology platform, so I think we feel really good about the types of strides we are making the strategic initiatives we have been talking about. And so I think to us that’s confirmation that the things we are trying to do for these customers is working.
Zachary Fadem: Got it. Thanks so much Tom, really appreciate the time guys. Best of luck.
William DeLaney: Thanks Zack.
Joel Grade: Thanks Zack.
Operator: Our last question comes Bob Summers from Macquarie. Your line is open.
Robert Summers: Hello. Thanks guys for squeezing me in. I just wanted to a dig a little more into the deflation, inflation dynamic and better understanding and maybe you have something here from the customer insight work that you have done. But, the situation seems unique and that overall product cost have been coming down in aggregate for the last you call it 20 months against that backdrop restaurants have generally been taking pricing. I’m not really sure what that pass through has been to the end operator. But as you think about the resistance to price increases what is the risk, hat there is more margin risk here than you have seen historical in inflection points?
William DeLaney: Hey, Bob. I think the risk is that it spikes in some high cost boxes. In another words, - if it were to spike into double-digits as it has in the past with meat or poultry that type of thing. That would move the number overall and those boxes tend to be expensive and that puts a little more pressure on our customer and we have to manage that the right way. So, as I said earlier I think the range right now is still in that range that is manageable, but I think the bigger issue is one or two key categories that are high dollar categories may spike. Things like produce and dairy they are going to move around. They move around multiple times within a 12 month period generally. So that would be maybe my contingent caveat there that if it were to spike up in meat, poultry, seafood not as big a category obviously that would put more pressure on the customer, but right now it's in the manageable range.
Robert Summers: Okay, thanks.
William DeLaney: Sure.
Operator: Thank you for joining us today. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: Thank you, Neil, and good morning, everyone. Earlier in this morning, Sysco reported strong financial results for our third fiscal quarter. Specifically, sales increased 13% year-over-year to $13.5 billion, driven both by a 3.5% local case growth in our U.S. Broadline business and new sales from our Brakes business which we acquired last July at the beginning of our fiscal year. Adjusted operating income grew 14% to $500 million, and adjusted earnings per share grew 11% to $0.51. Our results for the quarter reflect excellent performance across a majority of our businesses and build upon our increasingly strong and consistent performance over the past few years. These results were driven by our 65,000 dedicated associates successfully and cohesively executing Sysco's customer-centric strategy at a high level. Further, these results were achieved in markets that for the most part are experiencing modest economic growth and stable employment levels. While the energy-related downturn has resulted in regional economic headwinds in certain areas of the United States and Canada and political developments continue to contribute to economic uncertainty in some of the countries we operate in, overall consumer confidence generally remains favorable. Our business strategy is predicated on disciplined, profitable, and sustainable growth with particular emphasis on the following pillars: utilizing customer insights to enrich our customers' experience with Sysco; continuously improving productivity in all areas of our business; enhancing our product, service, and business solution offerings; and leveraging our talented associates while further developing our rich culture. In recent years, we have made tremendous strides in more effectively and consistently executing the specific initiatives developed pursuant to this strategy. By putting our customers first and embracing the right kind of properly-paced impactful change, we've built a foundation that has both supported our improved business performance and positions us well for continuous improvement as we move forward. The other key pillar of our business strategy is to continually assess new market opportunities for profitable, long-term growth. To that end, we see many exciting opportunities ahead for our international business in Canada, Latin America, and Europe. In closing, I am encouraged by the strong, positive momentum we currently have in our business and am pleased to report that we remain on track to achieve our recently upwardly revised adjusted operating income growth target through fiscal 2018. In addition, we are also in the process of developing Sysco's new three-year plan through fiscal 2020, and look forward to sharing that publicly later in the calendar year. Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom for additional discussion about our recent business results.
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, our associates are executing at a high level as we continue to deliver on the key strategic levers of our three-year plan: delivering accelerated case growth through a focus on local customers, growing gross profit dollars, and managing overall expenses. This morning, I'd like to discuss our segment results with a focus on U.S. Foodservice Operations and International Foodservice Operations. I will also highlight some of the key strategic initiatives of our U.S. business that are helping us to differentiate Sysco in the marketplace. Starting with our quarterly results for U.S. Foodservice Operations, sales grew 2.2% and gross profit had growth of 4%, while adjusted operating expenses grew 2.3%, resulting in adjusted operating income growth of 7%. Overall, our U.S. Foodservice segment had a strong quarter. We experienced strong growth in our local business as we accelerated case growth to 3.5%, which was partially offset by declines in case volume for our multi-unit business, resulting in 1.8% total case growth. Importantly, as we strive to deliver disciplined, profitable growth as a part of our three-year plan, our continued focus on providing value to our local customers through innovative product offerings and value-added services, along with improved e-commerce capabilities, has enabled our growth with these customers for the 12th quarter in a row. Looking at gross profit growth for U.S. Foodservice Operations, we delivered growth of 4% and gross margin expansion of 35 basis points as we continue to manage the deflationary environment well. As you all know, the industry has been in a deflationary environment for an unprecedented six consecutive quarters, and that trend is finally beginning to shift toward inflation. Meat prices are abating, and dairy and produce prices have begun to rise. Based on those changes, we are anticipating overall modest inflation in the fourth quarter. Our strategy around accelerating growth with local customers is working. Over the last several quarters, we've improved the capabilities of our sales force through investments made in training, technology, and targeted resources. And as a result, our marketing associates are spending more time selling and focusing on delivering benefits to our customers versus spending time on non-value-added activities. In addition, our insights-based approach to understanding and meeting our customers' needs continues to guide our efforts. As an example, one of the insights we've received from customers was around providing healthier product options. In response, we created a good-to-grow promotion during the third quarter that highlighted the large variety of fresh and healthy produce options available to our customers. Furthermore, we brought innovative products to market through our Cutting Edge Solutions program. This program introduces new product ideas to customers, which can help them reduce labor costs and/or improve the quality of their menu offering. These are just a few of the programs that have translated into improving loyalty scores for Sysco this past year. We are committed to delivering value to our customers while also providing a more consistent experience of doing business with us. From a cost perspective within U.S. Foodservice Operations, our expense management was solid as we limited growth to 2.3% on an adjusted basis for the quarter. Looking at U.S. Broadline, cost per case improved by approximately $0.02 compared to the prior year. And on a fuel price-neutral basis, cost per case improved by $0.01, ahead of our three-year plan objective. In our supply chain area, we are seeing positive momentum from our productivity initiatives and ongoing process improvements which are driving efficiencies. One example is our slotting initiative that's helping our warehouses to build pallets faster and more accurately. In the area of delivery, we are seeing progress in improved routing and delivery metrics through the leverage of enhanced technology. While there's still a lot more work to be done, we are seeing improved operating expense trends, and we are focused on continuing this performance throughout the balance of the fiscal year. Additionally, we are continuing to thoughtfully manage our administrative expenses through a more consistent approach that is improving our overall efficiency while maintaining service level to our customers. Looking at the overall performance for U.S. Foodservice Operations, I'm very pleased with our level of execution, which enables us to deliver solid operating income growth and improved operating margins by 34 basis points. Moving to International Foodservice Operations, sales were up $1.3 billion and adjusted operating income increased $6.6 million, both driven largely by our recent acquisition of the Brakes Group. During the quarter, Brakes performed well amidst a challenging environment in the U.K. and is continuing to make progress in their supply chain transformational efforts. Growth in France remains steady, and Sweden continues to produce favorable results. Additionally, we continue to see opportunities for growth across our European business. Lastly, although we are in the early days of integrating our Ireland businesses, things are progressing well, and we expect to achieve modest benefits from that integration. Looking to Canada, we are pleased with our performance despite the continued softness in Alberta which has been driven primarily by the energy market decline. Our Canadian business overall is leveraging the many learnings and successes of our U.S.-focused initiatives and is now implementing many of them. For example, we've introduced the category management and revenue management processes, and we are offering multi-channel ordering via online and telephony, as we provide our customers the ability to choose how they order from Sysco. These initiatives are a few examples of how we are enhancing our customers' experience, as we support the growth of our local business. In addition, we are effectively managing costs by streamlining administrative expenses to improve productivity. As a result, we expect the Canadian business to continue to deliver improving positive performance. Turning to Latin America, we are excited about new facilities in both Costa Rica and Panama. Specifically in Costa Rica, we have opened 180,000-square foot, state-of-the-art facility with a test kitchen and training facilities. This new space will enable new products and full product lines to be available to our customers, and we're excited about the accelerated growth potential those offerings will deliver. In summary, our customer and operational strategies are firmly aligned around improving our customers' experience, engaging our associates at the highest level to improve execution, and delivering our financial objectives as a part of our three-year plan. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Grade for further details.
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Thank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Bill and Tom mentioned earlier, we are pleased with the results for the third quarter. Our ongoing quality of earnings growth reflects continued momentum from our business, including strong local case growth, solid gross profit dollar growth, and good cost management. This morning, I like to cover our third quarter results for the company both excluding and including Brakes. For the purpose of comparing to our three-year plan, I'll start with our quarterly results excluding Brakes where we delivered sales growth of 2.3%, gross profit growth of 4.3%, which included margin expansion of 34 basis points, and adjusted operating expense growth of 1.9%, resulting in adjusted operating income growth of 13.6%. We continued to maintain the gap between gross profit dollar growth and adjusted operating expense growth above 2%, which translated into strong adjusted operating income leverage and continued progress toward achieving our three-year plan objectives. As Tom mentioned earlier, we now expect modest inflation for our fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 in our U.S. Broadline business. While it is important to note that this change from deflation to inflation can pressure gross margin as a percentage of sales, we do not anticipate inflation to negatively impact our ability to grow gross profit dollars. Shifting gears, I like to transition to our results for the quarter including Brakes. Sales grew 12.7%, and gross profit dollars grew 18.3%, while adjusted operating expenses grew 19.3%, which resulted in adjusted operating income growth of 14.3%, and adjusted earnings per share growth of 10.9%. On an adjusted basis, our Brakes Group operations contributed approximately $0.01 per share to our consolidated earnings per share this quarter. As Tom noted earlier, Brakes performed well during the quarter and continues to make progress in their transformational efforts. The reason the performance was accretive rather than dilutive, which was our original expectation for the third quarter, was largely related to changes in deferred taxes for our European business. Additionally, there are negative tax impacts to our domestic business, also driven by changes in deferred taxes. As a result, our adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter was 35%, compared to 34.3% in the prior-year period. These changes, along with increased interest expense, ultimately impacted our adjusted earnings per share growth of 10.9%. Cash flow from operations was $1 billion for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2017, which was $36 million higher compared to the same period last year. Free cash flow for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2017 was $630 million which was $11 million lower compared to the same period last year. These changes are largely due to improved business performance, improved working capital, and favorable year-over-year comparisons due to the US Foods termination payment last year, offset by higher cash taxes from deductions related to the US Foods settlement and a deferral from flood relief. Net CapEx for the first 39 weeks was $395 million. We now expect the total CapEx for FY 2017 to be in the range of approximately 1% to 1.1% of total sales, slightly above our previous guidance. Investments have been related to capital improvements in the business, including supply chain opportunities at Brakes. Net working capital performance has continued to improve. We have improved net DSO by 2.7 days compared to fiscal year 2015, driven by improvements in all three areas: payables, receivables and inventory. As a reminder, we are measuring these results ex-Brakes, consistent with our three-year planned targets. Our third quarter results include certain items that were related to the Brakes acquisition, including amortization associated with the transaction and accelerated depreciation related to our revised business technology strategy. As a reminder, the accelerated depreciation will continue through the end of fiscal 2017. One last item before closing. This month, Sysco voluntarily withdrew from a multi-employer pension plan previously disclosed in our 10-K, and has recorded a $35.6 million withdrawal liability subsequent to the third quarter of fiscal 2017. We consider this fourth quarter charge to operating expense as a certain item. In summary, we had another high-quality quarter reflecting continued momentum from our business, including strong local case growth, solid gross profit dollar growth and good cost management. We are committed to serving our customers and delivering a high level of execution in all areas of our business, which will improve our financial performance in both the near and long term. Operator, we are now ready for Q&A.
Operator: Your first question comes from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO capital. Your line is open.
Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to ask about the independence, I guess, a little bit. Always hard to gauge, but with 3.5% growth there, very strong. I was just curious if you feel like you gained some share there with that customer this quarter, and anything to call out that you think is driving that that you're doing or regional trends or types of restaurants that are really kind of outperforming among that group.
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: Hey, good morning, Kelly. It's Tom. Thanks for the question. So, let's start with – I think we feel really good about the work we've continued to do in this segment. And if you think about where we said we'd be on our three-year plan, we're right where we've said we would be, which is around 2.5% local case growth. So, obviously, good quarter this quarter. And what I would say is I think over the three-year time, our goal was to continue to gain share in this space, and I feel like we continue to make progress there. But I think what I'd attribute it to is continued just execution of our strategy. If you think about these customers, we've been very focused on them. I think our value proposition is resonating with them. And I think based on that, we're seeing more and more customers support Sysco and partner with us. If you think about new business growth, we're also seeing some new business growth in this space. But overall, I would say it's really just more consistent continuation of the work we've been doing, and I think we're seeing the recognition of that effort with these customers.
Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Great. And then, I guess just to follow up on that with the core gross margin expansion of 34 basis points, I guess a little bit slower than the past couple quarters. So, can you comment a little bit more on the drivers there and also elaborate on that comment about potentially the return of inflation maybe weighing on gross profit margin percentage but not impacting gross dollar profit growth? I think there's still a lot of confusion on that front, if you could talk about that a little bit.
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: Okay, I'll start and then I'll toss it to Joel for some of the further discussion around the deflation and inflation. So, I think gross margin percentage, yes, it probably slowed a little bit versus where we've been, but I think still very strong. And I think you are starting to see a little bit of impact of that starting to move from deflation to inflation that could be impacting that. But just as a reminder, the areas we continue to talk about regarding gross margin improvement are the category management effort we've had for a few years now, continued improvement in Sysco Brands. So, you saw again additional growth in Sysco Brand with our local customers. Obviously, that shift of mix to higher local case growth versus corporate multi-unit is going to impact that as well. And then, obviously, now revenue management is kind of part of the way we operate day in and day out. So, I think those are all key drivers, what continues even as we start to see a little bit of slowing of the deflationary environment start to happen. Why don't I toss it to Joel? He can talk a little bit about some of the categories that are starting to shift a bit. You heard me talk a little bit about it and then maybe just idea of gross margin dollars versus just gross margin percent.
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Yeah, so, Kelly, the question you asked in terms of the impacts, yeah, just as a reminder, the deflation tends to impact the margin percentage, and so we've seen some benefits over the last few quarters that we've called out the impact of deflation on our margin percentage. But we typically would see that as a headwind in terms of the gross profit dollars. As we shift to more modestly inflationary environment, one of the things I think you – again, and certainly I called this out in my script as well, we do anticipate some impact on the margin percentage, which we began to see in this quarter, but we certainly also do not consider that an impediment to growth in our gross profit dollars. And so, again, we've talked oftentimes in this industry that a couple percent of inflation is what we would view as the – some of the optimal state. In other words, so an opportunity where costs that come through to us, we can pass to our customers, our customers can pass to theirs. And so, I wouldn't look at this more the return of inflation in a negative way. Again, gross profit dollars, we certainly feel good about our ability to generate. Again, we may see erosion in our margins. To Tom's point, in terms of product categories, just remember again, we talk about one number, but it's certainly made up of a lot of different product categories. And some of the things that you're seeing here is some lesser level of deflation in our meat area, though that area still is deflating. But other areas such as produce, and we've seen some in bacon and other product categories that are continuing to actually accelerate in their inflationary characteristics. And so, all told, again, looking at some more modest levels of inflation as we head into the fourth quarter.
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: Kelly, this is Bill. I just would add that in addition to everything these guys just took you through, we're now talking about gross margin improvement over gross margin improvement. So, there's a little bit of math in this thing right now in terms of year-over-year comparisons. So, we're actually quite pleased with the performance. And to Joel's point, I think the 4% gross profit dollar growth we feel very good about, and that's been a target of ours. And so, I think whether it's modest deflation or modest inflation, we certainly want to stay locked in on growing the gross profit dollars. So, I would just say that as we get back into some modest inflation, if we can hold the margins flat, little up, little down, that type of thing, I think we'll be pleased with that. And you should see a very good gross profit dollar growth.
Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short with Barclays. Your line is open.
Karen Short - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, thanks. Just wondering, given the growth that you're seeing, and I mean it looks like the momentum is here to stay for a little bit. Can you just give us an update on where you're at from a capacity perspective? How much more whittling down, I guess, you have to do with some of your less profitable customers? And then, I had a follow-up.
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: Good morning, Karen. This is Tom. So, I assume when you say capacity, you're just talking about overall warehouse capacity?
Karen Short - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes.
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: And so, I would say we are fine in that regard. You heard me talk kind of over the quarters about different efforts we're talking where we may have some capacity constraints to get more capacity out of our facilities and more throughput, and a lot of those initiatives in our supply chain area have been working very well. So, we're going to continue to focus on those where we have challenges. But we think we feel very comfortable at this point about our ability to not only handle our existing customers but continue to grow this business within our current footprint.
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: I think one of the things you did hear – Karen, it's Joel – from us also is this approach to a disciplined approach to growth. And certainly, part of that is around the idea of a very thoughtful and carefully thinking about opportunities where they may exist to either add or retain, and how that fits in with the overall network of facilities that we have. So, again, certainly, something we do consider. But again, as Tom said, I think we're in a decent place there.
Karen Short - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then, I just wanted to switch gears to SYGMA for a second. Because SYGMA was up, I mean, decently on tougher comparisons. So, wondering what kind of drove that shift suddenly in the quarter.
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: Well, you heard me talk over the first couple quarters about some of the challenges we've had in the SYGMA business. And some of that had to do with some of the operational aspects of the business specific to certain customers, and also the deflationary environment we've seen. So, I think as you start to see some of that deflation slowing as we talk, there's some benefit we're seeing there. And we continue to focus on improving our operational effectiveness. I'd say that those are probably the two biggest drivers of the kind of shift in our performance, although I would say while we feel better about the quarter, we still feel like we have a lot of opportunity in the SYGMA side of the business.
Karen Short - Barclays Capital, Inc.: All right. Great. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Marisa Sullivan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Marisa C. Sullivan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to start with some operational expenses, including Brakes. They came in a little bit higher than expected. How much of that was Brakes, and is there anything else to note during the quarter that might have drove higher OpEx?
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: No. I mean, I think part of what you may be seeing in the Brakes, again, if you remember there is some seasonality in that business. And so, some of the things you see there is just on a smaller base of business as a higher relative expense. But I – I would not say there's anything of any significance there at all in terms of that comparison. It's really more related to what I talked about there in the smaller business. I think we're very pleased overall with our expense performance. Again, we maintained a gap in our overall business in the nearly 2.5% to 2.5 points between our gross profit dollar growth or operating expense growth. Again, as Tom pointed out, on a cost per case basis with our U.S. Broadline, we came in actually, on a fuel adjusted basis, $0.01 better, which is actually a little better than the goal we talked about of a flat cost per case. So, in general, I would just tell you what you're seeing there again is a little bit more reflective of the smaller businesses seasonality as it is anything else. But overall, we're very pleased with the expense results.
Marisa C. Sullivan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. And if I could just follow up on the topic of deflation. As you've started to see it come back in some categories like dairy or produce, have you been able to pass along the higher product cost to your customers? And are you generally seeing rationality in the – amongst your competition when it comes to passing through the return of inflation?
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: This is Tom. Yeah, I'd say, Marisa, that we're – again, we're talking about mild numbers at this point, and as Joel said earlier, this industry historically, I think, operates pretty well at these kind of lower inflation levels. So, we're not seeing anything that would concern us right now about our ability to pass along those prices. I mean, in the category like produce, when you get some of the weather issues they had in California earlier this year, you'll get some spikes in certain areas that have to be kind of managed closely. But generally speaking, we feel fine about how it's affecting the business right now.
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: Yeah, I would actually distinguish dairy and produce from other items in our mix. Those are very volatile items, dairy maybe even more than produce at times. So, I think in the course of 12 months, Marisa, you could see those go up and down within that period. As I think we alluded to, the meat, center-of-plate items, obviously, high dollar boxes there. They drive a lot of this thing over the medium to long term. Still some modest deflation going on in the meat side, but we would expect that to continue to turn in that direction as well. So, I would look more in terms of long-term thoughts on deflation more in terms of wait and see on the center-of-plate items. And I think dairy and produce will, for other reasons, be up and down from time to time.
Marisa C. Sullivan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. Thank you so much.
Operator: Your next question from the line of Chris Mandeville with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Christopher Mandeville - Jefferies LLC: Hey, good morning. So, I guess, I'm just looking to tackle capital allocation here. I think you've essentially exhausted your $3 billion ASR at this point. Can you just remind us of what you have remaining for just general buyback programs and then potentially update us on your order of importance when it comes to capital allocation?
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Sure, be happy to. So, we think about capital allocation really in number of few key priorities, starting with investing in our business. And so, certainly technologies, facilities, fleets, et cetera, those are the kinds of things that, as we talked about today, actually are getting our CapEx numbers even up slightly, and that certainly reflects our continued emphasis on reinvesting in our business as a key priority. Certainly, dividend was a key part of our strategy that obviously is very important to a large part of our investor base, and remain committed to growth in our dividend as we have over a long time in this company. Pursuing strategic M&A, and both in our core space and adjacencies and additional geographies certainly remains a key focus of this company. And then, to the points you're bringing up, again what I call a balanced view between paying down debt and buying back shares is really the other key component of our capital allocation. I think the question specifically you asked, so just as a key point, we're a good majority of the way through the two-year $3 billion ASR that we announced a couple years ago, following the termination of the US Foods merger. I would call our share repurchase strategy opportunistic. That would certainly fall into that category. And in addition to that type of repurchase, we also, as a reminder, do continually repurchase shares to offset option dilution. So, hopefully, that...
Christopher Mandeville - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Yeah. And then, I guess, just my second question as it relates to case growth itself. If I recall in the last earnings call, you guys were actually sounding a bit cautious heading into this quarter itself. But obviously with the results, they were really quite impressive and must have seen some nice acceleration in the month of March. I'm just curious if you can provide any real color on the case growth cadence and if you've seen some continued trends quarter-to-date.
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: Yeah, I'll start here, Chris. And kick it to Tom, since I'm usually the one who's most cautious. So, part of the reason for the caution, we had had a couple quarters where we were between 1.5% to 2% case growth. And we were heading into a quarter, being the March quarter, that's a hard quarter to predict early in the quarter, March, because of the seasonality within the quarter, March is a big, big percentage of the overall sales and earnings. And we'd had a pretty mild winter the year before. So, we were a little bit cautious. At the same time, the point I made and I will continue to make, Tom mentioned it as well in his prepared comments, is we feel very good where we are in the three-year plan, and frankly, where we are in our plan for this year. We're running about 2.5% local case growth over the seven quarters now and over the three quarters for this year. And we would love for people to kind of look at us the way we look at the business, which is we've got a three-year plan and it'll be a rolling three-year plan over time. And there's going to be some ebbs and flows in any individual quarter or even couple quarters in a row. But overall, we're running this business certainly for the long term, but also understanding that we've got some three-year financial objectives out there. So, we're very pleased with what we're seeing here. We've got some good momentum, as we said in our earlier comments. And I'll let Tom give you a little more color on that.
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: Chris, I think the only thing I'd really add was more – and some of that caution might have also been around the corporate multi-unit because at the time, we had been slowing in that area. We obviously rely heavily on how each of those concepts themselves perform. And so, I think that's always something that we are thoughtful about as we go into any quarter. So, I don't think there's much else to add to what Bill said. I think we feel really good about where we're at, and I feel like we've got good momentum which is important going forward.
Christopher Mandeville - Jefferies LLC: All right. Best of luck, guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim. Your line is open.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC: So, maybe for Tom. When you look at the local case growth, roughly how much of that is coming from existing customers? Could it be two-thirds or 70% or something in that ballpark? And then, maybe talk a little bit about growing share with those existing customers going forward, both from other broadliners and then specialty distributors. Does one have more potential than the other?
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: Hey, John, good morning. So, look, I think – let me say a couple things. One, I'd say, we definitely feel like we are improving our level of penetration with our customers, which is selling more to our existing customers. To give you a number on what percentage, I think that's probably a bit of a stretch and...
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Okay.
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: But I think we feel like we are continuing to further penetrate and gain our share of wallet with those customers. And we obviously are growing new customers and adding customers to the portfolio as well. So, I think we have a good balance of both of those working, and I think we feel really comfortable with where that's at. As far as where that's coming from, it comes from a lot of different places. It's hard to, again, peg, is it just in the specialty area? I think we continue to perform well in the specialty areas. But I also would say that the broadline business is really doing very well. And a lot of what you see is the sheer size of our broadline business especially in the U.S. That's where a lot of the growth is going to come from, is from more within our existing customers and certainly picking up some new business from other broadline competitors.
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: John, the other thing I would add there, which kind of gets buried in these numbers as well is we're having the best year we've ever had on retention of local customers, off of a very good year last year. So, it's all of the above. You certainly always want to have new business coming in. But in addition to penetration, we're managing the current portfolio very well.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC: And then, maybe just shifting gears a little bit. On to Brakes, I guess we knew it was seasonal, maybe we didn't appreciate how seasonal. But you think about the amount of deleverage there, is it solely that deleverage or is there a mix issue as well? And does it have to be that seasonal? You sort of wonder, is there an opportunity for you to do things somewhat differently, and so it's not so skewed, 3Q versus the first half?
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Yeah, I mean, John, I think – I mean, first of all, this is Joel. I mean, this – as you know, it's our first full year of this acquisition.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Yeah.
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: So, we're certainly seeing some of those things for ourselves for the first time as well. But I would just say, again, if – keep in mind, just in terms of the order of magnitude of the size of their business, there's certain fixed costs that size leverages in different ways. And so, I think there's always going to be an element of some of that. And I think that's – but certainly to your point, I mean, there are things that as we go along, we'll continue to find ways to try to take a little of that seasonality out. Now, we did anticipate it. Again, last quarter, we called it out that certainly the second half of what is our fiscal year is a weaker time for them, particularly in our third quarter. So, again, we certainly anticipated some of that. But again, over time we'll certainly get smarter there, and look to find ways to continue to drive a little less seasonality in the business. But it certainly is inherently there.
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: Yeah, John, I think on that one, to Joel's point, we need to get through 12 months with this business and kind of really understand their cycles. I think the top line probably will remain pretty seasonal. There's some CapEx we need to invest in over there. We need to better understand how they work with their big customers and their suppliers. So, I think over time there may be an opportunity for us to better understand, not just the seasonality, but the efficiency of some of these things and – so hopefully, as we get into the fourth quarter and we talk to you in August, we'll have a better handle on that. But I think, over the next year or so, it will still take some time to work through some of that, and we'll give you the best guidance that we can.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: Yes.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Sinisi with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks very much for taking my question. Just wanted to ask on the international front. Quite a bit of commentary upfront just around kind of the opportunities and the different geographies. Any further color you could provide at this point in terms of kind of either timing effort or capital that may be allocated to those, that would be great.
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: I think I was the one who was so effusive upfront there, Vinny. So, I'll start. I think Tom hit on up some of it. I mean, we certainly feel good with some of the earnings momentum that we have up in Canada right now. We've had to go in there and obviously look at our cost structure pretty aggressively, and we continue to do that. As Tom also mentioned, some of the initiatives that we've rolled out now for a couple, three years, and four years really in cat man's case, we're looking at how to deploy those in Canada in a way that makes sense for that country and that market. And there's some things that we're already doing up there with the telephone sales and that type of thing. So, we're learning from Canada and vice versa. And so we feel good about that. The Latin American business, a couple joint ventures, Bahamas, smaller in scale but exciting in terms of what we see over the medium to long term down there in terms of growth potential, new facilities in Costa Rica and Panama, that kind of thing coming up. So, that's really what I was talking about. And then, we just talked about Brakes, and lot of opportunity in Brakes. There's going to be opportunities to certainly improve how we execute over there. I think there's going to be some investment opportunities. And at the same time, we still think from an acquisition platform standpoint, it's just a tremendous vehicle for us to do more in Europe over time.
Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then, maybe just following up on that, Bill, and thank you for the commentary. Just on kind of on the international margin, I know you said, obviously seasonality, still early, still learning, Brakes specifically. But that it was a bit lower, of course, in 3Q. Anything else to call out outside of just kind of continuing to work through Brakes, and how we should just kind of generally think about that profitability in that line of business kind of on a go-forward basis?
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: I don't think so right now. I'll let Joel weigh in. We're just now beginning our planning process for next year with them. So, I think as we finish up this year, like I said a minute ago and as we get into their planning process, to the extent that there're some nuances here or some things that we think we can maybe work with them to do better or differently, we'll certainly give you some guidance there. Joel?
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Yeah, Bill, I actually don't really have anything else to add to that. I just think it's, in general, again – just always remember, again, order of magnitude, a little bit smaller businesses, so more impacted by some of the cost structure and smaller volume quarters. But other than that, there's – again, we'll keep getting smarter about this, as Bill said, and I talked about earlier. At least, again, we've had these people as part of our company now for not even a year yet, and so we'll continue to be able to refine our talking points around that and hopefully give you guys continued clarity as we go forward.
Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks, fellas.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Yeah, hi, guys, good morning.
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: Hi, Ed.
Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Bill, last quarter, obviously, the market hated the fact that your total case growth was roughly flat. And then, this quarter, it really kind of came back pretty good. You had talked about, post Q2, about the multi-unit side. And I think if I remember correctly, some business that didn't renew because you didn't like the pricing. Did something else happen this quarter? Was there a new business here to fill the void? Just thoughts around that. And then, as we think about total case growth going forward, I think what a lot of us were doing we're kind of assuming that you'd be flattish to up modestly for three quarters now. And it doesn't seem like that's going to be the case. So, I guess, how should we be thinking about this going forward? Was Q2 just an anomaly?
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: I don't believe in anomalies. So, I won't say that. I can't say that with all of our people listening right now, Ed. But now, look, let me start, and I'll have Tom give you a little more color on the large account, what we call the CMU part of the math here in a little bit. But I think the way we should be thinking about it is the way we're trying to run it here, which is we've got these three-year targets, and we have an annual plan. And we bifurcate it today, because when we talk about disciplined, profitable, sustainable growth, we really run this thing, even though we run them out of our operating companies, we run them differently. And a lot of the large accounts, they're much more complex relationships and they're longer term generally. And there's going to be normal ebbs and flows in those negotiations as well. And while we've done a great job over the years growing that business, and frankly, retaining the business, when you do lose an account or two accounts, even if you are maybe the catalyst in that transition, i.e., Sysco, that's going to make an impact over, not just one quarter, but a couple quarters. And obviously, perpetually, you're always bringing on new business. Hopefully it's not four quarters, so you have a chance to mitigate it. So, I think you're seeing a little bit of that with the new business offsetting. I'll let Tom go there. I think the bigger point is more on the local side, which is we're looking to grow that, in the current three-year plan, 2.5% or more. And if you go back and look at Q1 and Q2, we were between 1.5% and 2%. So, we certainly weren't where we needed to be, and I think now you're seeing a strong quarter here in the third quarter. And so far, this quarter we're seeing similar types of results. So, when we talk about momentum, that's really what we're talking about there and our ability to leverage it. So, feel good about the local case growth, feel good about our ability to leverage it. Feel very good about where we are, relative to our three-year plan. And I just think the CMU side of it, the way I'd like you to think about it is we're managing this in a very disciplined way. We're not trying to get rid of customers. We're trying to work with customers in a way where we can grow, support their growth in a way that's profitable for both of us. But to the extent that there is turnover in that account base, it will impact the numbers a little more significantly.
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: Yeah, I don't think I have really that much to add. I think Bill answered that pretty well. The only thing I'd go back to, we've said earlier around the local, is we feel like we're very focused on improving our share wallet with our existing customers, and we're seeing good momentum there. And then, sure, we're always looking at new business opportunities in that space. But I would say it's not anything unique or different this quarter than what we've been doing. I think we just feel like we've got good momentum, and we're continuing to execute our plan accordingly.
Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. And then, just one quick follow-up. And we're kind of beating a dead horse a little bit here, but it's probably worth it. As you think about inflation and deflation and your goal to drive gross profit dollar growth, a couple hundred basis points faster than SG&A, you would rather have an inflationary backdrop than a deflationary backdrop in order to achieve that, number one. And then, number two, sounds like you'd encourage us to really think more about, as we analyze you as a company, more about how you're achieving that gap and how you're growing gross profit dollars over really what your gross margin is doing in any given quarter. Is all that fair?
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: I would say yes and yes. And on the first one, what we would prefer is modest inflation, let's call it low-single digit, Ed.
Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: Sure.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Zack Fadem with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Zachary Fadem - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hey, good morning, guys. I'm curious if you have any thoughts on the disconnect between the improving consumer confidence trends, yet underlying restaurant traffic, particularly chains, looks to be pretty choppy. I'm curious if you think there's been any change out there with regard to the reallocation of consumer wallet. And if you see this variability as more temporary or if you think restaurant spending can reaccelerate from here going forward.
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: Yeah, I'll take a stab at that, Zack. It's hard. I mean, it's hard to really get a handle on it. These trends aren't exactly new, so I think the traffic phenomenon, it's probably – it's been a few quarters now where we've seen somewhat less traffic. It's not dramatic, but a little bit less. But the nice thing is the check amount is covering that, and we're still seeing some real growth at the restaurant level. It obviously changes from subsegment to subsegment from quarter to quarter. And obviously, within the individual operators. I think the good news here is while there's consumer confidence or some of the other feedback we get from surveys we do with restaurant operators that we participate in, it is positive. So, I think you always want to be in an environment where people are looking forward or feeling better about things. And I think that's a good thing. So, if the economy can continue to at least move along even modestly and if that translates into our business, that will keep our customers positive and obviously that keeps the business in a good way. So, I think right now, we'll take it. It would be good to see a little more traffic. But the fact that people are positive is very good.
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: The only thing, Zack – this is Joel – that I could add, just to remind you and others, yeah, and we certainly talk about restaurants, as we should, frequently. But always keep in mind, about a third of the business is actually outside of the restaurant space, as well. So, things like healthcare, thing – sports stadiums, universities. Those types of government institutions. And I only just say that as a reminder that some of the opportunity we have is part of Sysco's kind of what we've begun portfolio diversification, if you want to call it that, and the ability to have some level of buffering, if you want to call it that, and some of those trends. So, just as a reminder. No other comment there.
Zachary Fadem - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thanks, Joel. And I had a couple housekeeping items. Sorry, if I missed this. But what was the specific impact of deflation in the U.S. this quarter? And then, also, with respect to the volume uptick, was the U.S. Broadline all organic growth for the most part, or was there any small M&A or anything like that in there as well?
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: So, I can take that. (50:16) I'll call it slightly deflationary for the quarter. And the other one I would consider – there's some M&A growth, not a large amount. So, it's considered mostly organic.
Zachary Fadem - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Got it. Thanks, Joel. Appreciate the time, guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Shane Higgins with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Shane Higgins - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, guys, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Obviously, your cost per case continues to come down. Expense management has been pretty strong. Are you guys seeing any signs of the labor cost inflation in the U.S.? Any indications that you're seeing upward pressure on wages in any of your markets?
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: Well, certainly, our customers have been experiencing that for a year or two now. So, that's been one of the benefits of the deflation, is that we've been able to work with our customers well on that while they were incurring a fair amount of labor increase. As far as our labor costs go, to your point, Shane, we're managing it very aggressively. And I would say we're doing a decent job managing both the head count as well as the costs. So, we're keeping those in line. We're a heavily incentive-based company. So, when the company performs, our people do well, our sales people are on commission. So, it's a heavily incentivized cost structure here on the payroll side.
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: I think the only thing I'd add – this is Tom – is that the minimum wage changes you might see around that Bill referenced that certainly impacted some of our customers, don't really impact us much because we're generally well above the minimum wage with all of our employees.
Shane Higgins - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. And then, just a quick follow-up on your M&A outlook. I know that's – still you mentioned it was a strategic priority. What are you guys seeing today in terms of the M&A environment? Just any color you could give. Do you guys see a lot of willing sellers out there? And do you anticipate more opportunities over the next year?
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: I think the first thing we see is a pretty wide open space for us, both domestically and international. So, it comes down to prioritization and just the right kind of acquisitions whether they're what we call fold-ins into our broadline, additional businesses that can complement the specialty companies that we have or international. So, there's plenty of opportunity. Obviously, over the last couple of years, three years, really we've been more locked in on some larger deals. So, we're remobilizing our team here to staff up for going out and being – if not more aggressive, certainly broader in our thinking up and down the line in terms of opportunities there, as I said. So, we think there's good opportunity. How that translates into (52:59) acquisitions, that's always a little bit more difficult to predict. You need willing sellers. You need an environment where they can take their proceeds and reinvest them in a way that works for them. But we think it's actually a very good environment right now for acquisitions.
Shane Higgins - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks. I'll get back in the queue.
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: Sure.
Operator: Your next question comes from Bill Kirk with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
William Kirk - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you for taking the question. It sounds like you're pretty confident in your ability to pass food inflation to your customers. But how do you feel about their ability to then pass it on to the final consumer in the face of some of their existing traffic deceleration?
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: Yeah, I think what we've seen over the years, and this really just comes from data that we see – industry data, that kind of thing, is that most restauranteurs and the restaurant industry in general, and then to Joel's point, that's only about 60% of our customer base or revenue stream. It's a very interesting phenomenon. Year in and year out, they pass on about 2%. And so, when you hear me talk about – and we've been saying this quite consistently for years. When you hear us talk about low-single digit or modest inflation being a good environment, that's good for our customers, and therefore, it's good for us. And so, I think if it stays at those levels, they should be able to pass it along reasonably well. If it were to go back up to the 4 or 5s, that becomes more difficult. And obviously, in our situation, you don't necessarily pass it all along every day. It depends on the category and that kind of thing. But within a reasonable period of time in a modest inflation environment, I would agree that we should be able to cover it.
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: I think the only thing I'd add is just keep in mind, I mean, we are still in a deflationary point with meat. And again, a couple of the other categories. Again, we talk about dairy, produce, some of those, to Joel's point earlier, tend to be more volatile in general. So, again, I still think we're certainly in a decent place there. And again, certainly a modest inflation level is something we feel good about in this industry.
William Kirk - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. That's all for me. Thank you.
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ajay Jain with Pivotal Research Group. Your line is open.
Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC: Yeah, hi, good morning. Obviously, with Brakes, you did better than expected in Q3. I was just wondering if you can give an update on your outlook for Brakes in the fourth quarter. To what degree you expect Brakes to be a net tailwind or a drag on earnings?
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Yeah. So, thanks for the question. Yeah, it's – so, again, as we guided previously, we certainly anticipated that the second half of their year – again, certainly second half of our fiscal year, if you want to call it that, would be less favorable in terms of accretion than the first half, where we also – we talked about that as – in particular, the third quarter, we expected some modest dilution. And then, that in the fourth quarter, we expected some modest level of accretion. So, we certainly maintain that belief as we head into the fourth quarter.
Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC: Okay. And as a follow-up, it looks like adjusted operating expenses outpaced gross profit dollar growth for the first time, I think, in about six quarters by about 100 basis points. And I know you've already gotten some questions about this and you called out seasonality with Brakes in response to one of the earlier questions. But the fact is, Brakes was accretive, so can you give any clarification on what's driving the higher relative expense growth to gross profit, and if this is some kind of inflection point?
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Yeah, I'd just – again, as I mentioned earlier, there's nothing there that I would call out as something that I would consider any type of inflection point or change point there. Again, I would just tell you that, in general, in a quarter, our smallest, their smallest, it tends to be a little less leverage on cost than there are in some of the other quarters. Again, our core business actually had very strong leverage between gross profit dollar growth and expenses. I don't anticipate – again, there's really nothing to call out there, honestly, in terms of that (57:43) business outside of this.
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: Yeah, just keep in mind, I think everyone knows this because you're probably ahead of me on your modeling, but Brakes is a higher gross profit, higher expense business. So, when you get into a quarter where you have this seasonality, which is even more pronounced than our seasonality, that's going to accentuate that even more. But that's really why we break it out the way we do. We're actually quite pleased with how we manage the expenses from the core business, if you will, to Brakes to the corporate office. So, I would say right now, we're feeling good about the expenses. We need to keep growing the gross profit, keep that spread, to Joel's point. But that is totally consistent with what we talk about. We talk about discipline. We talk about that and the customer mix, and we talk about profitable. In this business, what we mean with profitable is to keep that spread there. So, overall, we feel fine on the expenses.
Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC: Hey, if I could ask one final question. I just wanted to clarify a comment from your prepared remarks. So, correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought you mentioned that accelerated depreciation for SAP would continue through Q4. So, does that mean the add-back for depreciation ends in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, or do you continue to benefit from technology restructuring next year, and by that, I mean incrementally benefit next year?
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Well, so, again, I think the comment there was around the fact that we actually have, as we talked about during the announcement of our revised technology strategy, that because of that and because we're moving away from the SAP platform, that there would be actually accelerated depreciation that we would reflect up until the end of our fiscal 2017. And then, at that point is when we are actually completed with that transition which we are certainly on track to do. And so, the accelerated depreciation that you're seeing in our numbers will end, if you will, at the end of fiscal 2017. And then, there would be some level of benefit we would see from that although, again, I think, as we've talked about that as well, there're some opportunity to reinvest in additional technologies, particularly around customer facing. But to answer your question directly, the accelerated depreciation that you're seeing ends at the end of this year, and you will not be seeing that starting fiscal 2018.
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: And it's all embedded in the three-year plan targets.
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Correct.
Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Just another question on gross profit per case. And looking at the gap between inflation, assuming moderate deflation by 1% or something like that, it looks like the gap between gross profit per case and the rate per case growth came in pretty sharply this quarter, still positive but smaller than it's been, which you wouldn't necessarily expect given the sort of favorable mix shifts in the business. I don't know if there is anything you can do to help us decompose how much of that would be related to just the multi-unit piece of the business, or just help us understand why that sort of trend changed. Thanks.
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: This is Tom. You might have to help a little bit with – so, you talk about gross profit per case which we don't really talk about. Are you talking about gross margin and the slowing of the gross margin percent improvement?
Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Well, you can look at gross profit growth and gross profit growth versus case growth, and get an idea of what gross profit per case growth looks like. And the gap between that has been running 500 basis points or so ahead of – in the U.S. Broadline business. 500 basis points or so ahead of inflation or deflation the last couple of quarters. And then, this quarter (01:01:23) like 200 basis points. So, a pretty sharp compression. If you can help us understand what could be driving that.
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: I don't really see anything unique or different from what we've been talking about. I think it's obviously the mix of our business continues to drive some of the change. That's certainly, as we talked about, on the gross margin percentage also lapping. We're year-over-year now lapping growth rate upon growth rate from a gross margin percentage perspective. But I guess the last thing I'd say is we feel very good about our 4% gross profit growth in the U.S., and I think relative to the overall case growth that we're seeing, which was slightly below 2% for that same gross profit growth. So, I think we feel very good about where we're at. Joel, if you have anything to add (01:02:13).
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Yeah, Karen, I think – this is Joel. I mean, the main thing I would continue to focus on here is around the – again, as we talked about, the growth in gross profit dollars and that growth relative to our operating expense dollars. And so, the reason we keep talking about that is at the end of the day, whether it's inflation, deflation, et cetera, that gap certainly drives the efficiency in operating margin. And that's certainly, again, something we're very pleased with. And so, I would just continue to remain focused on those things that really ultimately drive the operating profitability.
Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you. The question was on the market share that you're taking relative to the broad foodservice distribution industry. Is it happening in some of the smaller independents finally where they're just having a difficult time keeping up with merchandising and technology, and maybe, for lack of a better word, poor sellers of their business to you? And then, secondly, and I think related, and about an hour ago, Tom, you talked about improved e-commerce capabilities for your independent restaurants. And just hoping to get an update on that, and whether you're seeing gradual improvement or maybe something more of step function in terms of how things are changing on that front. Thanks.
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: Sure. So, I'd say, just back on the market share. So, we obviously are very focused on continuing to grow our share across the business. I think, as you know, there are lots of competitors out there. So, to isolate in one area or another is really hard to do, given we compete with so many different types of folks, literally market by market. So, I would just say that we continue to be focused on delivering the right value proposition for those customers, which includes all the things that I've been talking about. So, I won't reiterate all of those. One, in particular, that you did ask about was where we're at on the technology rollout, and we continue to feel really positive about that. We're now seeing across our local customers around 25% of those customers ordering via our online applications. So, we feel really good about the progress we're making, and we continue to feel like that's going to be an area that we'll continue to see growth. But we also – I want to remind everyone that our approach and our strategy around this is to do this in a way that supports whatever our customers are looking for, meaning giving them choice. Whether that's through online or that's through the marketing associate or through some other way of ordering with us. But we feel great about the progress we continue to make and think it's a combination of all those things that are helping us continue to gain momentum.
John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Our last question comes from the line of Steve Gojak with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.
Steven Ivan Gojak - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Just two quick questions. Just on the corporate management case growth, what was that this quarter, and any impact from customer exits or wins there versus, I believe, the minus 2% last quarter? And then, secondly, just your thoughts on the competitive environment in the third quarter versus the last several quarters. Any change there in it being more or less aggressive. And then, within that, following up to a prior question, as you move from an inflationary environment to a deflationary environment, those competitive pressures, and then the cost and demand pressures on the restaurant operators themselves impact the ability to pass through any sort of price increase or inflation, again, even though you're seeing modest inflation right now? Thank you.
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: I guess, let me start with – we don't communicate the actual numbers on our corporately managed growth. But you know roughly from our prior conversations, we're around 50/50 on our local versus CMU business. And so, we talked about our local and U.S. Broadline being up 3.5%, and our total of 1.8%. So, you can surmise from there. I missed kind of the second part of that, I think it had to do with the inflation-deflation...
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: Kind of environment, how would that be accentuated by inflation?
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: So, I don't think – I mean, we've talked about, it remains highly competitive out there. I don't think that the inflation or deflationary environment necessarily affects or changes that competitive nature and who we're competing with. We all deal with some of those impacts as an industry. And obviously, all of us have our way of dealing with those.
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: Yeah, look, Steve, I think that's probably the best answer we have here. Our focus always starts with the customer. So, as their challenges become greater, certainly they probably put more pressure on their suppliers. But we also think that's an opportunity for us to differentiate ourselves relative to many of our competitors, if not all, in terms of what our offerings are across products and services and just basic relationship management that we've done for years.
Steven Ivan Gojak - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Great. Thank you.
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: This concludes the third quarter fiscal year 2017 earnings call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning and welcome to Sysco's second quarter Fiscal 2017 conference call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. We will begin today's call with opening remarks and introductions. I would now like to turn the call over to Neil Russell, Vice President of Investor Relations and Communications. Please go ahead.
Neil A. Russell - Sysco Corp.: Thanks, Kelly. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your patience as we worked through some technical difficulties. With me are Bill DeLaney, our Chief Executive Officer; Tom Bené, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, please note that statements made during this presentation that state the company's or management's intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, and actual results could differ in a material manner. Additional information about factors that could cause results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's SEC filings. This includes, but is not limited to risk factors contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 2, 2016, subsequent SEC filings and in the news release issued earlier this morning.

As such, we will reference throughout our presentation today Sysco's financial results both including and excluding this acquisition in an effort to provide you with clear visibility to the three-year plan objectives. To ensure that we have sufficient time to answer all your questions, we'd like to ask each participant to limit their time today to one question and one follow up. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Bill DeLaney.
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: Thank you, Neil, and good morning again, everyone. This morning Sysco reported a quality second quarter and a solid first half of the year. These results were driven by disciplined volume growth, sound margin and expense management and the contributions from our new colleagues at Brakes who joined Sysco in early July. Further, our favorable performance over the past several quarters validates that our ongoing focus to improve our customers' experience with Sysco and to increase productivity in all aspects of our business are key to our future success. We achieved these results across the markets that we serve in the midst of uneven economic growth, significant political change and increasing uncertainty for consumers. All these factors are providing both opportunities and challenges for Sysco and our customers. Some data points reflect positive implications for long-term consumer demand such as steady unemployment levels, modest U.S. GDP growth of 1.9% for the quarter, increased consumer confidence and strong financial markets. However, the restaurant industry, which represents approximately 60% of the Foodservice market has not strengthened to the level of growth we have seen in the past. Restaurant traffic continues to show year-over-year declines, and more specifically, recent data from MPD shows decline in traffic of 0.5% for the quarter. Moving to our second quarter results, and excluding the impact of Brakes, we grew adjusted operating income 13%; are generating 3% gross profit growth while managing expenses extremely well. After incorporating the impact of Brakes, adjusted operating income grew 28% to $558 million and adjusted earnings per share grew 21% to $0.58. Turning to our first half of fiscal 2017 performance, overall, our team executed well and we are making good progress toward the achievement of our key financial objectives. Specifically, during the first half of the year, adjusted operating income grew 14%, driven by gross profit growth of 4% and minimum expense growth of only 1%. The business results inclusive of Brakes reflect adjusted operating income growth of 26% to $1.2 billion and adjusted earnings per share growth of 25% to $1.25. As we enter the second half of our fiscal year, we have positive momentum in the business and are optimistic about delivering quality earnings growth. We will, however, face some near-term headwinds in the third quarter, specifically, continued industry softness, challenging year-over-year comparisons, and the seasonal trough for Brakes will likely impact our results. Now, moving beyond the results for this fiscal year, we have reached the halfway point for the three-year plan which we established for our business prior to the acquisition of Brakes. I am pleased with our progress thus far toward achieving our financial objectives to accelerate local case growth, achieve gross profit growth, and to limit operating expense growth. Overall, we have grown adjusted operating income by $350 million. Considering our strong performance to-date and our confidence in our ability to sustain our current level of execution, we are raising our three-year adjusted operating income growth target to approximately $600 million to $650 million through the end of fiscal 2018. Joel will provide more details on this guidance increase in a few minutes. In summary, I am confident in our ability to both deliver this increased adjusted operating income target and accomplish our strategic objectives over the long-term. Moving forward, we will build on our momentum by maintaining our customer-centric approach in all that we do, while focusing on targeted, disciplined and profitable growth. In closing, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank all of our 65,000 associates for their efforts and contributions as we strive to fully realize our vision for Sysco to be our customers' most valued and trusted business partner. And now I'll turn the call over to Tom Bené, our President and Chief Operating Officer.
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Sysco's financial results announced this morning reflect solid operating performance and continued progress against the key levers of our three-year plan, including: delivering accelerated case growth through a focus on local customers; improving gross margins; and managing overall expenses. This morning I'll be providing an update on our business results based on our segment reporting structure which highlights US Foodservice Operations, International Foodservice Operations, SYGMA, and all other. During the quarter, US Foodservice Operations, which is primarily comprised of U.S. Broadline, Specialty Meat and FreshPoint experienced local case growth of 1.6%, which was offset by declines in case volume for our multi-unit business resulting in flat case growth overall for U.S. Broadline. Importantly, as we strive to deliver disciplined growth as a part of our three-year plan, our continued focus on providing value to our local customers through innovative product offerings, value-added services, and improved e-commerce capabilities has enabled our growth of local customers for the 11th quarter in a row. Gross profit in US Foodservice Operations grew 3.6% for the quarter and gross margin increased 81 basis points, driven by a combination of factors including the acceleration of local case growth at a pace greater than our multi-unit volume growth; our category management efforts, including a continued focus on Sysco Brand and new product innovation to support our customers' needs; a full suite of revenue management tools and routines that are focused on delivering a more proactive and disciplined approach to pricing; and the impact of deflation. From a cost perspective, our expense management for the quarter was strong and remains a key area of focus for us moving forward. For US Foodservice Operations, during the second quarter we limited total adjusted operating expense growth to 0.7%. For U.S. Broadline specifically, cost per case improved by $0.02 for the quarter, and on a fuel price neutral basis cost per case was flat, in line with our three-year plan objectives. As it relates to our cost performance, we've made strides in both SG&A and supply chain. In our supply chain area, we are seeing positive momentum from our productivity initiatives and ongoing process improvements which are driving efficiencies specifically in the warehouse. One example is our labor forecasting tool which focuses on the efficient scheduling of labor and results in effective allocation of resources. In the area of delivery, we've made good progress, though there is still more work to do. Additionally, while we are now lapping the benefits associated with lower fuel prices from last year, we continue to manage expense through lower fuel consumption and higher efficiency. Moving to International Foodservice Operations, which is comprised of Canada, Europe, Bahamas, International Food Group and our joint ventures in Mexico and Costa Rica, sales were up $1.3 billion and adjusted operating income increased by $68 million, both driven largely by our recent acquisition of the Brakes Group. During the quarter, Brakes performed well in the UK amidst a challenging environment. Brakes continues to make progress in their management of the supply chain within the UK, which is helping them be more efficient and will ultimately improve overall service and reduce cost. Growth in France has been steady, driven by a combination of solid top line growth and a balanced approach to cost, and Sweden continues to produce favorable results as well. We are generally pleased with our performance in Canada, especially considering the downturn in Alberta, which has been impacted significantly by the energy market decline. We expect the Canadian business to continue to deliver positive results as we are effectively managing cost and delivering productivity within a recent deflationary and somewhat soft market environment. Additionally, our joint ventures in both Costa Rica and Mexico had solid performance in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Turning to SYGMA, we continue to make progress against our key long-term business initiatives despite some near-term challenges. In summary, our customer and operational strategies are solidly aligned around improving our customers' experience, engaging our associates at the highest level to improve execution, and delivering our financial objectives as a part of our three-year plan. I remain pleased about the programs and processes we are putting in place, which allowed us to raise our three-year plan adjusted operating income goal. Now I'll turn the call over to Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer.
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. As Bill and Tom mentioned earlier, we are pleased with the results for the second quarter. Our earnings growth reflects continued momentum from our business, included solid local case growth, strong gross profit dollar growth, and good cost management. The results that I'll cover this morning include Brakes, which significantly impacted our results. In summary, for the second quarter of fiscal 2017, sales grew 10.7% and gross profit dollars grew 19.2% while limiting adjusted operating expense growth to 17.1%, which resulted in adjusted operating income growth of 27.7% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 20.8%. Sales during the quarter were positively impacted by the inclusion of Brakes in our results, partially offset by deflation of 1.8% in U.S. Broadline. Moving to gross profit and gross margins, beyond the addition of Brakes, the key drivers of improvement included customer mix, category management, revenue management, higher Sysco brand penetration in our local business, and deflation. Categories most impacted by deflation are center-of-the-plate proteins, dairy, and produce. We expect the deflationary trend to continue at least through the fiscal year. That said, we are managing this environment effectively, as evidenced by our strong gross profit dollar growth. During the quarter, we managed expenses very well excluding Brakes, as evidenced by only 0.4% growth in adjusted operating expenses. As it relates to taxes, our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 34.9% compared to 30.7% in the prior-year period. The increase in tax rate is primarily driven by a $21 million benefit to income tax expense as a result of the favorable resolution of some international tax contingencies that occurred in the prior year. Compared to the prior year, adjusted net earnings grew 15.8%. Cash flow from operations was $605 million, which was $136 million higher compared to the same period last year. Free cash flow was $331 million, which was $99 million higher compared to the same period last year. The significant improvements in both are due mainly to favorable year-over-year comparisons due to the US Foods termination payment along with improved business performance and working capital, partially offset by higher cash taxes. Net CapEx for the first half of the year was $274 million, which is in line with our forecast for the year. Spending has been related to investments in the business, including the transformational work at Brakes. I'm pleased with our net working capital performance to date. At the halfway point of our three-year plan, we've had an approximate net 2.5-day improvement versus fiscal 2015 toward our goal of a 4-day improvement. This is driven by improvements in all three phases of working capital, payables, receivables, and inventory. Our second quarter results include certain items that were related to the Brakes acquisition, including amortization associated with the transaction as well as accelerated depreciation related to our revised business technology strategy. Now I would like to transition to a few business updates, first regarding seasonality of our business. As we've stated in the past, typically the third quarter is slower for our business. In the U.S., the coming third quarter will face some comparative challenges, as we experienced an unusually mild winter last year and have now lapped fuel price benefit we've previously discussed. Additionally, Brakes business is more seasonal than our U.S. business, as the performance is more heavily weighted to the first half of the year. Accordingly, we don't expect the same accretion each quarter. For the second quarter, Brakes was approximately $0.07 accretive to our business on an adjusted basis. For the first half of the fiscal year, accretion from the Brakes transaction at $0.11 on an adjusted basis is ahead of our initial expectations. Looking ahead, we expect Brakes to be modestly dilutive to earnings per share in the third quarter and modestly accretive in the fourth quarter. Second, regarding the increase in the three-year target to improve adjusted operating income in FY 2018 by $600 million to $650 million as compared to FY 2015. As a reminder, please remember that this target represents our commitment, exclusive of the results from Brakes, consistent with how we've spoken about our three-year plan all along. As Bill and Tom mentioned, we're very pleased with our performance in FY 2016 and year-to-date FY 2017. We're able to significantly outperform our initial expectations to achieve our adjusted operating income improvement goal. We have grown the gap between gross profit dollar growth and expense dollar growth to be larger than we originally estimated. Going forward, we expect to continue driving leverage between gross profit growth and expense growth. This includes our ability to manage both our SG&A expenses and supply chain costs effectively. These factors have created positive momentum for us to achieve our FY 2017 and FY 2018 objectives and have given us confidence to raise our target. I should note that the entirety of the increase in planned adjusted operating income growth is projected to be realized in FY 2018. In summary, we had a quality quarter, reflecting continued momentum from our business, including solid local case growth, strong gross profit dollar growth, and good cost management. That said, we have more work to do in order to achieve the full financial objectives of our updated three-year plan. We are committed to serving our customers and delivering a high level of execution in all areas of our business that will improve our financial performance in both the near and long term. Operator, we are now ready for Q&A.
Operator: Your first question comes from Shane Higgins of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Shane Higgins - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted to drill down a little bit on the case volume trends in the U.S. during the second quarter and particularly around the elections. Did you guys see a lot of noise around that and how have trends been 3Q to-date?
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: I'll start, Shane. I'm going to let Tom jump in here pretty quickly. I think it's been hard to really discern a consistent pattern on trends. The numbers for this quarter are a little off the first quarter, but not that much. I think we saw some things around the holidays that we think probably impacted a little bit. And I think I've got this right, I think October was a little slower and then early November was good and it kind of leveled out again. So it's kind of up and down by weeks. Some of it's the way the calendar falls for us this year with the coming off the 53-week year, but I would just tell you it's a little slower out there right now, but I can't tell you that we saw anything that was necessarily tied to the elections. But go ahead, Tom.
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: Yes, Shane. Again, I probably can't comment much about the election and the impact specifically of that. But I think to Bill's comments, one of the things if you think about the local case growth, we've been fairly consistent over the last couple of quarters. The big change in our case growth that you're probably referring to, as you're seeing, is in our Corporate Multi-Unit business. And we did have some slowdown in that in the second quarter, some of that driven by potentially some marketplace type of things, but others driven by some decisions we made in partnership with customers around making sure we're focused on disciplined and profitable growth.
Shane Higgins - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, thanks. Just as a follow-up, I guess, and I think you may have partially answered this question. But just trying to gauge your level of confidence in achieving these upwardly revised operating profit forecast, given that the case volume trends in the U.S. have been slowing a bit still. I know it sounds like maybe you're focusing more on the local case volume growth and that's what gives you guys confidence?
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: That's exactly right. Obviously, we need balance. We need case growth in all parts of the business, but the local case growth emphasis has been something that we've been very much focused on here over the last couple of years. So I think – look, there's going to be ebbs and flows in any business cycle or three-year plan, but we're very confident or else we wouldn't have put that out there. And I think if you go back and look at the first half – basically, the way I look at it is because we've been getting questions on when would we adjust our expectations, we're halfway through the three-year period. We performed very well and we are confident going forward. And if you look at the last six quarters, again, this is ex-Brakes, you'll see that we're right on our numbers on an average basis on the case growth and the local case growth. And where we beat our expectation is really to Joel's point, we're a little ahead on our gross profit growth over that six-quarter period and, again, there're ups and downs, and we're right on our expense number. So we've got a nice overall performance here and we just felt halfway through that period would be good to review that and reassess it. And there's always going to be challenges, Shane, in any period of time, but we feel very good about those targets.
Shane Higgins - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: All right. Great. Thanks so much. Good luck.
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: Sure.
Operator: Your next question comes from Karen Short from Barclays. Your line is open.
Karen Short - BMO Capital Markets: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just some color, again, going to your revised target. Can you just – it sounds like you just answered this, but it sounds like the upside to the new target is more based on gross profit dollar growth versus better than – or that your expectation is that operating expense growth will be a bigger driver. Maybe just some color there.
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: No. Let me try that again, Karen. What I was attempting to say is, in other words, why did we pick this period of time to an adjust it. And so we're halfway through it. We're performing very well and – excuse me for a second. We have a little bit of an echo in our room here. So we reported very well on the volume and we're going extremely well on the gross profit for the first six months and the spread with expenses is very good. So I think what we're really saying to you is we like where we're at through the first six months and we've got good momentum in the business. Look, in any given quarter, six-month stretch, we may exceed on volume and maybe fall off a little bit on another line, or exceed on gross profit. So I think the message I'd like you to take away from this thing is we're managing this thing well. The numbers may fall out a little different line-by-line but, overall, the level of execution and where we are to this point in the plan is what gives us the confidence to move forward.
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: I would just add. Karen, it's Joel. I think as we move forward and similar to what we've talked about when we raised our target from $400 million to at least $500 million, I would say there's a – it's just a bit of a shift towards a larger percentage of this based on expense both from initiatives that were taken on, opportunities we saw to take additional costs out, as well as in this case probably a bit softer view from a volume perspective. And so I would think about that more from the perspective of expenses than, again, over-performing moving forward in gross profit dollars. To the point Bill made, just additional clarification.
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: The ultimate key here, and we've said this for years, at least I have, is we're executing better right now, is this is how we talk about the business internally, this is how we manage it. We got to have good quality top line growth, and that comes down to mix and that comes down to certainly emphasizing the local. And when we get that and we're able to do that with a lot of these initiatives that are bearing fruit right now, we need to grow the gross profit at a meaningful spread above what we grow our expenses at. And that's what you've seen.
Operator: And your next question comes from line of Zack Fadem from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Zachary Fadem - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hey, guys. It looks like Brakes is performing much better than what you guys had initially guided both in terms of top line and margin relative to Q1 particularly. Can you talk us through some of the initiatives going on in that business that's driving performance? And what should we anticipate for Brakes in terms of top line and margins for the second half of the year?
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: Yeah. I would say Brakes is performing well. I don't know that they're performing better than we would have anticipated. I think there's some seasonal timing issues here that Joel spoke to, and I'll let him give you a little more clarity on that. But they've got their challenges, obviously, in the UK. And there's a lot of really good initiatives going on in France and in the UK, for that matter, and in Ireland. So we're pleased with what they're doing right now, but I wouldn't – we just can't extrapolate that every quarter, I think. And Joel will tell you more about that.
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: I think that the main takeaways in terms of the forward look that you're asking about is something what we've talked about here today. I mean, again, the results of Brakes certainly are more heavily concentrated in the first half than the second half of the year. And as we look to the third quarter, again, as we've talked about today, that's really primarily driven by some fairly strong seasonality impact in Q3. So we certainly anticipate that, as I called out in the script, to have some, I'd say, moderately dilutive impact in the third quarter. I would say offset somewhat by what we expect to have some marginally accretive impact in Q4. But their business is very much, again, very fairly heavily weighted towards the first half of our fiscal year. That's really the way to think about that moving forward.
Zachary Fadem - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks, Joel. And can you also talk a little more about the impact of fuel prices? Just as you start to lap the benefit and fuel prices start to grind higher here, can you talk about the level in which fuel surcharges start to kick in for you and how we should think about the impact to top line and margins for the rest of the year?
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Yeah. So we talked earlier about the fact that, in this quarter, we actually start to lap some of those results. And that, in fact, did happen. The last few quarters, I think we've talked about a roughly $0.04 impact on fuel price. And so, again, what we always focus on internally is managing to a flat cost per case ex-fuel. And, once again, in this quarter, we've done that. The fuel benefit this quarter was somewhat less. It was about $0.02 instead of $0.04. And, again, when I talk about fuel benefit, I mean, fuel pricing benefit, and so to be very specific on that. As so, again, as we've talked about today, some of the benefits that we've been enjoying over the last few quarters we expect to lap as we move forward, and so some of those benefits you've seen, again, you won't see as much. Again, as we've talked about, in terms of the surcharge, it's certainly not a dollar-for-dollar impact. As fuel prices go up, there are certainly again – there's some cost impact for us on the operating expense line. There's also some opposite effect, if you will, from a margin standpoint in the fact that we have either adding or taking away fuel surcharges depending on the pricing. But again, I would just tell you as we move forward, for the most part again, the benefit we've seen we're lapping and so we don't expect to see as much of that. Obviously, we take an active participation in some of the hedging programs to ensure we have some certainty from our costs. But overall, again, hopefully that clarifies some of the impact.
Zachary Fadem - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: It does, yes. Thanks, Joel. I appreciate it, guys. Thank you.
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from Edward Kelly from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi, guys. Good morning.
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: Hey, Ed.
Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Can we dig into the case growth just a little bit more? So your local case growth slowed a little bit, not a lot, right? But the total case growth did slow quite a bit. You mentioned stuff about market, but then you also mentioned revenue management. How much of the sequential slowdown in overall cases is related to revenue management? And maybe could you also just as part of that take a step back and remind us of what you're really looking to do there?
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: Hey, Ed. This is Tom. So I don't think I actually talked about revenue management particularly. I talked about the Corporate Multi-Unit volume that was affected, but I can talk a little bit about revenue management. And if the question is around do we believe that the work we're doing in revenue management might be slowing down our case growth with our local customers, we have not seen that. And so as a reminder, what we're doing in revenue management is really more about creating some processes, some tools to drive a little more consistency with how we price. And so that takes out some of the variability that we've historically seen, and it allows for us to be much more proactive and consistent with our customers – really across all our customers, but the biggest impact of that's probably more with our local customers where there was a lot more flexibility at a local level in the past. And so we feel fairly confident that we don't have any issues associated with that process being in place and that affecting our case volume with our local customers.
Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: I guess I assume that when you said the decision on disciplined profitable growth having an impact on case growth, I thought maybe that's what that was. So maybe could you talk a little bit more about what you meant by that?
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: That's more about what we call CMU, our Corporate Multi-Unit business. And so what I mean by that is that as we continue to evaluate every opportunity out there, whether it's a renewal of a piece of business or a new piece of business, we're being very thoughtful about those decisions, especially as it relates to some of those larger Corporate Multi-Unit type customers. And that's where you're seeing some the volume softness showing up, where we've made some tough choices, and we're going to continue to evaluate those kind of opportunities as they come up and make sure that, again, we're doing the right thing to drive a disciplined approach to growth and certainly making sure that we're keeping profitability at the forefront of our mind as we make those decisions.
Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: So just as we think about the business going forward now and the outlook into 2018, how are you thinking about that total case growth number at this point, given the headwinds and some stuff you're doing internally?
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: Ed, I think we're thinking about it the same way. I think overall we were looking for about 2.5% case growth and, if anything, a little more on the local side. But I think what you're hearing from us today, there's going to be some ebbs and flows, and in the short term it probably won't be quite that strong. We'll see. This quarter, as Joel pointed out, is a hard one to predict because of some of the seasonality issues and that kind of thing. So I don't think our goals have changed. We've got a three-year plan. And basically the way we look at that, the way we look at any plan, is there's a top line piece to it, and that's the case volume that we're talking about, and that the mix is critical to get it the right way. And then there's a bottom line piece, which is where we raised the target to the $600 million to $650 million ex-Brakes. And then there's how we get there. And so it's hard to predict how much we'll see on the GP line versus the expense line, but the key is that spread, as Joel took you through and we feel good about that, but I don't think we're changing our overall targets. It's just, as you know, any plan ultimately probably gets achieved in a way somewhat different than the line-by-line details.
Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Thanks, guys.
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: Sure.
Operator: Your next question comes from Kelly Bania of BMO. Your line is open.
Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. It sounds like Q3 will have some challenges from seasonality, some weather comparisons. But with the comment about continued industry softness, I guess, one, does that imply that you've seen similar trends in January? And I guess are you surprised that total case growth and the multi-unit case growth is so weak on that side despite the economic backdrop you painted? Or maybe I guess as a follow-up to the last question, can you quantify the impact of some of these decisions around the multi-unit chain side of the business that may be impacting case growth?
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: Let me start, Kelly, and we'll jump into this before we're done. I think the key on our third quarter is – this is the one quarter of the year where you've got the third month more than the other three quarters that really drives the numbers. So we're always a little bit cautious. And so I can't tell you that we've seen anything so far. The volume is fine right now. But this is the slower, weaker part of the quarter. And so March is such a factor that – given that we did have a pretty mild winter last week year, I think what we're calling out there along with the Brakes' seasonality, there could be some pressures there relative to expectations. So that's really all that is. But early part of the quarter, we're not seeing any disturbing trends at all, but just real cautious there because March is such a big deal. I think I'll go back to Tom maybe on the CMU part of it.
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: Kelly, as you think about some of the comments I've made, what I don't think we want you to take away is that this is all driven by industry softness that's creating some of the challenges within our Corporate Multi-Unit, our CMU case growth. Some of it is decisions that we have made and that's what's driving some of that case impact that you're seeing in the second quarter. And so some of those impacts may continue based on those decisions that we made, but I wouldn't read into that that that's necessarily a significant softening, although we called out some from an industry standpoint, it's really more about some internal customer decisions that have been made. Is that clear?
Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States): That's helpful. And, I guess, the other component of Broadline from education and hospitality to healthcare, can you talk about case growth, I guess, for this group of customers? Or was this all on the restaurant side?
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: We don't typically go in that level of detail, Kelly, but I think actually we're pretty constructive on what we're seeing on the restaurant side right now.
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: Yeah. And as we've also talked in the past, I mean, there are segments within the industry that are growing a little bit faster than the core, and that continues to be in that retail foodservice area as well as that lodging segment has continued to perform well. So I think, again, it's more specific to some customers than it is to the necessarily industry or the marketplace.
Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Great, thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Marisa Sullivan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Marisa C. Sullivan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to see if I can get a little bit more color on what was driving the local case volume trend. For new customers added, was that more from existing or was that new customers? And then for declines, I guess, both local and chain, is that from closings, competition? Any other color there, too. Thank you.
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: So again, I'd reinforce the couple of comments made on local. Let's start with the point that our strategy has been to focus on local growth over the last couple of years and the reason for that is we believe we can add the most value there for our customers. And we continue to see our strategies and our initiatives playing out and that our customers are seeing that benefit and value that we bring. So that's where you're seeing most of that. Look, we feel good about our – both our penetration in some of those local customers and also our ability to continue to retain the customers we have and get new customers brought into the fold. So it's a combination of all of the above, and we continue to manage that on a day-in day-out basis. From a competitive standpoint, I think, look, as we've said many times, it's a very competitive environment out there. It remains very competitive. I wouldn't say that we're seeing anything that's necessarily dramatically different than what we've seen. Certainly in market-by-market, there are some competitive situations that we deal with, but on a national basis, I'd say it's very consistent, it's very competitive out there, and we continue to feel good about our position in each of the markets.
Marisa C. Sullivan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. And then I just had one follow-up on deflation. Was the gross margin support that you got from deflation lower in 2Q than it was in 1Q?
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: I don't know that we are able to quantify that. I would say we continue to see deflation playing a role, as I talked about. It's one of the, certainly, impacts in addition to the revenue management work we're doing, all the category management work and, obviously, the mix of both our customer mix, as we talked about, local versus our corporately managed and also our Sysco Brand mix.
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Yeah, I wouldn't say there's anything dramatic there, Marisa.
Marisa C. Sullivan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. Thanks so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC: So really for Tom, when you think about revenue management and balance, right, between investment and price promotion and case growth, what kind of discussions are you guys having in terms of, are we investing enough, are we not, is there enough, is there elasticity, is the macro getting a little bit better? You think about balancing the two, is there some opportunity that might not have existed six months ago or nine months ago to invest a little more or the elasticity's just not there?
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: So, John, you don't want me doing the elasticity questions anymore?
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC: I figured you are tired of them.
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: Okay.
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: John, you asked a lot of questions in there. I'm trying to kind of work through the various components. Look, I think if you think about the environment we've been operating in, this overall deflationary environment, what we have to do kind of each and every day is navigate that by product category, by geography, and certainly even by customer type. And so what we're trying to do through whether it's revenue management work we've done or certainly even our category management work is we're trying to create the right balance. So that we can provide that consistency to our customers, but at the same time, make sure that we're getting any benefits we can as those shifting markets take place. And so I think really the short answer is, we continue to feel good about the tools we put in place, and we think we're creating a much better environment for our customers and, obviously, we're able to balance that for ourselves to make sure that we can maintain the margins we need to in this business. We may trade up decisions every single day. And so I think it's really more about just our ability to have visibility to those decisions and try to balance those as best we can, keeping our customers obviously at the forefront of all those decisions.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC: And is it easier, when you think about the fruitfulness of investments, better to do it in a more inflationary environment versus deflationary or no?
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: I don't know that we kind of look at it one way versus the other. Look, the gross profit dollars at the end of day are what drives this, right? And as we all know, when the market's deflating, those dollars are harder to come by than when the market's inflating. But having said that, there's a balance both ways. It's category by category. If you think about – not everything is moving in the same direction all the time, so we have literally product categories that are slightly inflating today and we have a lot more that are big ones, that are deflating, like these and like dairy and produce. And so we just have to – it's not as easy as one or the other, it's really about this balance that we constantly have to strike and, quite honestly, our customers have to balance as well.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC: All right. And maybe lastly for Joel. It sounds like your commentary on Brakes is that it's sort of breakeven in the second half. Then would be accretive on a, whatever, $0.11, $0.12 for the year. Is that sort of what you thought at the outset of this? First half maybe ended up being a little bit better. Second half, I don't know if it ends up being a little worse. But is that where you thought it would shake out?
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: I think, as I'm really saying here, I think it's maybe a little better than we had anticipated, but I think as we've gotten into this, and again, we're still seven, eight months into the deal now, I think your commentary about sort of the first half and second half of the year part has become pretty clear to us at this point in terms of the way that's going to look. And so, again, I would say overall probably the accretion number's a tad higher than we had anticipated originally. But certainly, again, a lot of clarity for us now in terms of the way the seasonality of the business shakes out.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from Vincent Sinisi from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Thanks very much for taking my question here. Two fast ones. I'll ask them just quickly upfront. First, on the near term, I appreciate the color around the Brakes' seasonality. But for 3Q specifically, I guess, that was one of kind of three larger headwinds that you talked about in terms of last year's benefits. Just wondering if any further color or quantification around the weather as well as the fuel benefit. And then, secondly, just in terms of Brakes, this is more longer term, of course. As you get kind of more time and experience under your belt, do you think that we should expect at some point to have that kind of more interwoven within your three-year outlook? Thanks very much.
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: I'll start, Vinnie, and just let me take the second part first. So what we are attempting to do here is to continue to be very transparent in terms of how we set the three-year goals, and that was before the Brakes acquisition and to continue to report on that. But I think as we get through the end of this fiscal year and actually prior to that, we're in the beginning of that process now here, beginning to think about our plan for 2018 – our 12-month plan for 2018. I think as you see us finish the year and then in particular come out in the fall with the new year, you'll see us talk more. We'll be talking about the enterprise. We'll be talking about what Sysco did. You won't probably see as much Brakes, ex-Brakes, other than we will track for the third year and we'll give you color and specifics on how we're doing versus that three-year plan relative to the ex-Brakes portion or the legacy part of the business, if you will. So bottom line is, as we get into the new year, we'll be talking about it as one. We'll have a plan that's predicated on that, but we'll still give you color for that last 12 months. The first part again?
Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Just in terms of the other two factors for the third quarter, any further quantification?
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: I think look, what we're doing there is we've had a couple really nice years here. I think Tom talked about 11 quarters in a row of local case growth and we've had several strong quarterly earnings numbers, and we expect to continue to put up good numbers. We've said all that. I think all we were trying to call out there is that the third quarter has some unique challenges that we didn't have in the first couple quarters as it relates to a mild winter last year and the Brakes seasonality. The fuel wraps, I don't think we're sitting here and saying fuel is going to be any big headwind or anything. We're just calling out some things in terms of just managing expectations between the third and fourth quarter, that kind of thing.
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Just to the point Bill just made, we're not calling that out as a headwind. We're just simply saying the benefit we've seen is really going to wrap, and so I think of it more as just a non-factor as much as anything.
Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Okay, great. Thanks very much, guys.
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: Sure.
Operator: And your next question comes from Ajay Jain from Pivotal Research Group. Your line is open.
Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC: Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask on SYGMA and if you can talk about just the sequential deceleration in Q2. I think when you reported the first quarter, I thought maybe you would turn the corner with respect to SYGMA. And so I was just wondering if you went through a similar revenue management process as you talked about with U.S. Broadline. And then as a related question, was there any unusual impact from any major SYGMA customer or specific set of customers? You cited the NPD data that the traffic that was down 0.5%, but I don't get the sense that the traffic trends or deflation would explain all of that sequential weakness with SYGMA.
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: Hey, Ajay. Look, as you know, SYGMA is a very, very logistics-oriented, very thin margin, very competitive business. And we are doing some good things at SYGMA. We've got good leadership there and very experienced leadership there. And from a business standpoint, from a strategic standpoint, we're seeing some encouraging things. To your point, the second quarter wasn't quite what we planned it to be. We're certainly hoping to make some of that back here in the second half of the year. And there are always conversations with customers of all types, whether they be local or CMU in the Broadline or SYGMA customers to work out the economics on the business, and those customers continue to – or those conversations continue to take place at SYGMA. So we do expect to see improvement here over the balance of the year, but it continues to be a very competitive business and a challenging one to run.
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: The only thing else I'd add, Ajay, is you mentioned revenue management or the pricing. Again, driven by the type of the customers and the way this operation works, we don't really – we aren't in the middle of that pricing discussion the same way we would be with our other customers because those agreements are between those customers and the suppliers, and we're really handling mostly the logistics components of that transaction. So it really doesn't come into play the same way. And the last thing you asked was there any really loss of customers, and there was not. As we continue to work with the same customers here, there is some impact because of that pricing in an inflationary environment that we have to deal with. But I would say we still, to Bill's point, feel good about where this business is. We've got some opportunities still that we're working on, but that's really the headlines on SYGMA.
Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC: Okay, thank you for that. I had one follow-up question, and this is really in follow-up to the earlier questions about the relative impact from Brakes over the next couple of quarters. It just had such a disproportionate impact on earnings in Q2, I think it drove most of the earnings growth. So I'm just trying to better understand how it becomes dilutive all of a sudden in Q3. Is it all a function of seasonality, or is there any incremental weakness with the core business trends at Brakes or any additional cost pressures that are behind your outlook for Brakes in Q3?
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: Let me clarify something first. We had a very solid quarter without the impact of Brakes. I want to be really clear there. We're on our plan and I'm real pleased with the numbers we put up as we had discussed. To your point, it was a bigger impact in this quarter than it was in the first. And, Joel, I'll let you reemphasize what you said.
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: I think, again, to Bill's point, there was a 13% operating income growth ex-Brakes this quarter. But regarding Brakes, we actually – again, the concentration of profit is very much in the first half, again, versus the second half of the year. And so just the thing really to call out here is just to emphasize the seasonality. Again, they're fairly heavily seasonal business. They are, again, a smaller business obviously than we are as an enterprise, and so there's more impact on seasonality for them than we might see as an overall enterprise. And so I would just say that, again, the way to think about this in – concentrated first half of the year in terms of some of the benefit we expect that they would provide, and again, seasonal third quarter, offset somewhat by a bit of improvement in the fourth quarter as we head into the second half of our fiscal year.
Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC: Great, thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi, thank you. The question is really from a restaurant operator perspective. Obviously, your Broadline customer is seeing negative same-store traffic. They're seeing increases in labor costs. And one of the normal places for them to protect their profitability would be going back to their food supplier and just trying to get some margin back from the food supplier as they're basically seeing pressure elsewhere. So I just wanted to get a sense whether the restaurant industry is putting increased pressure on you to maybe give back some of that gross margin. And then secondly, can you talk about some of the – I guess I'll just use the words non-traditional, but it's becoming traditional, things that you are doing with your customer, whether from a technology or merchandising or maybe more value-added food products that actually helps protect their profitability that we don't necessarily see from the outside?
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: So, John, I appreciate the questions. So a couple things are embedded in there. But the comments you made about the pressures that the operators are feeling and how is that translating into our business. If you recall though, given the trend we've had on deflation, one of the things they actually have experienced is a fairly significant decrease in their cost of products over the last couple of years due to these heavy deflationary times, especially if you think about some of the products that are center of the plate for them, the proteins and some of those areas where that's a big, big part of the impact. So they're seeing that. That's helping to offset some of the things they might be feeling on the labor side. Having said that though, as late as last week – we continue to meet with customers and talk with them about opportunities to help them drive even more productivity and efficiency. You mentioned innovative products. It's one of the areas that they are looking to us not only for innovation – think about it as new items – but innovation in the terms of, how can they bring a meal to the table for less cost because there's less prep time or requires less labor on their part. So we continue to have those conversations, and our customers quite candidly are looking to us to deliver that. And when we talk about value-added services, things like our menu planning and analysis, things like our business review, those are the type of conversations we have with them so that we can keep ahead of whatever might be coming, whether it's inflation down the road or it's just other challenges they might be facing. So we look at that really as our job, is to create the environment where these customers can be successful regardless of what else is going on in their business. And obviously the food cost and the things we do are a big part of that as well.
John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: And if I'm still on, could you update us on the Sysco eCommerce platform? And maybe I could have asked the question in a better way; with deflation trends now moderating – in other words, your costs are beginning to flatten out, maybe they start to increase in the next six months or so, do you anticipate the customer coming back to you and asking for more of that gross margin back?
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: Regarding that one, I'll jump to eCommerce. Look, it's always competitive out there. They are always looking for ways to make sure they can manage their business effectively. So we're going to continue to look at lots of different ways we can bring that value to them beyond just cost and pricing, but we need to obviously be competitive and we're very focused on that each and every day. Regarding eCommerce, we continue to see this be a growth area for our customers and their utilization. We've talked over the last year about us getting our platform to a good place, and we feel like we are in a very good place today. We've got a competitive tool out there that our customers are using, and we see customers in the 20% plus range in some markets who are leveraging eCommerce now. So we continue to see this being an opportunity for customers to order in a different way, but as we've also said, our approach has been more around giving them choice, whether that's through their marketing associate, our salesperson calling in, or ordering online, they've got that ability. But we do see the online or the eCommerce component of that continuing to grow.
John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from Karen Short from Barclays. Your line is open.
Karen Short - BMO Capital Markets: Hi. I just actually had a follow up with respect to your goals. There hasn't really been any discussion about ROIC. Obviously your original goal for ROIC were in that 15% range. Any color on where you think you can get that I guess given the raised guidance on the operating profit?
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: Sure, Karen. I'll start, and Joel, jump in here real quick. So the goal we called out, again pre-Brakes, was 15%. And I would tell you, without the Brakes transaction, we're trending very nicely toward that goal right now. We also said obviously when we announced the Brakes deal that that would impact return on capital, so will delay us to some extent to get back to that number. But again ex-Brakes, we're performing well and I think, Joel, you might want to just talk about the CapEx and working capital?
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Yeah, I would just reiterate that I mean I think – I'm actually very pleased with our return on invested capital performance ex-Brakes and in terms of achieving that goal, and certainly I think we're in a good place there as we speak today. With Brakes, also pleased there, and but it's – so that is somewhat dilutive. From a CapEx perspective, one of the things we called out is we certainly are on track in terms of our capital spend. Feel good about that both from the way that we've both proactively and in a disciplined way invested in our business both here in the US and Canada and then of course as well as some of the transformational work is with Brakes. And from a working capital perspective we continue to perform well. And so, again, talked about the fact that we've gotten about 2.5 days towards our goal of 4 days really across the three areas, and so in general, again, feel pretty good about the way that we are heading at that from ROIC perspective.
Karen Short - BMO Capital Markets: Great, thanks so much.
Operator: And there seems to be no further questions at this time. I do thank everyone today for their time and participation in the call. You may now disconnect.

We will begin today's call with opening remarks and introductions. I would like to turn the call over to Neil Russell, Vice President of Investor Relations and Communications. Please go ahead.
Neil A. Russell - Sysco Corp.: Thank you, Lindsey. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Sysco's First Quarter Fiscal 2017 Earnings Call.

As such, we will reference throughout our presentation today Sysco's financial results both including and excluding this acquisition. To ensure that we have sufficient time to answer all questions, we'd like to ask each participant to limit their time today to one question and one follow-up. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Bill DeLaney.
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: Thank you, Neil, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased with our start in fiscal 2017 and this morning we reported strong first quarter financial results. These results reflect our relentless focus on improving our customers' experience with Sysco that benefits a several key business initiatives that we've implemented over the past few years and the contributions from our new colleagues at Brakes who joined Sysco in early July. For the quarter, and excluding the impact of Brakes, sales grew 1%, gross profit grew 5%, while operating expense grew less than 2%, which resulted in adjusted operating income growth of 15%. After reflecting the business results of Brakes, adjusted operating income grew 24% to $627 million and adjusted earnings per share grew to $0.67. While we benefited from some favorable year-over-year expense comparisons, which Joel will touch on in a few minutes, these results were achieved in an uneven economic environment that is impacting our customers' business. Some metrics reflect positive implications for longer term consumer demand such as steadying unemployment levels, modest GDP growth, increased consumer confidence, and healthy momentum in the housing market. However, the restaurant industry, which represents approximately 60% of the foodservice market, is not currently experiencing the level of growth we've seen in recent quarters. Restaurant traffic continues to show year-over-year declines and restaurant spend has decelerated as well. More specifically, recent data from both NPD and NavTrak show weakening overall sales trends. That said, we continue to execute our business plan and key initiatives very well. I'm pleased with our progress to date toward the achievement of our three-year financial goals, and I remain confident in our ability to accomplish our strategic objectives over the long-term. Our improved and increasingly consistent performance for the past two years is attributed to multi-year foundational work we have carried out in customer insights, category management, revenue management, supply chain efficiencies and administrative expense management. The benefits of these work streams have positioned us to continue to effectively support the needs of our customers and profitably leverage our volume growth. Moving forward, we will build on this momentum by maintaining our customer-centric approach while focusing on targeted, disciplined and profitable growth. Both Tom and Joel will provide more detail about the specific initiatives we are currently implementing and their related benefits. Turning to the Brakes transaction, we continue to work closely with our experienced and talented leadership team to support their growth, drive out there transformative initiatives and identify additional acquisition opportunities. I'm very excited about the long-term benefits that this business will provide Sysco. In summary, we are off to a good start to fiscal 2017, and I am encouraged with the progress we are making as we approach the midpoint of our three-year plan. I'm especially appreciative of the efforts and contributions from all 65,000 of our associates, as we strive to fully realize our vision for Sysco, to be our customers' most valued and trusted business partner. Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom Bené, Sysco's President and Chief Operating Officer.
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Sysco's financial results announced this morning reflects solid operating performance and continued progress against several of our key multi-year initiatives. Our favorable operating performance continues to be driven by our ongoing focus on the key levers of our three-year plan, including delivering accelerated case growth through a focus on local customers, improving gross margins and managing overall expenses both in our supply chain and administrative functions. This morning I'll be providing an update on our business results based on our new segment reporting structure which highlights U.S. Foodservice Operations, International Foodservice Operations, SYGMA and all other. During the quarter, U.S. Foodservice Operations, which is primarily comprised of U.S. Broadline, specialty meat, FreshPoint and our European imports business grew sales 0.8% driven by overall case growth in the U.S. Broadline of 1.8% with local cases driving our growth at 1.9%. Gross profit in U.S. Foodservice Operations grew 4.3% for the quarter and gross margin increased 68 basis points driven by a combination of factors including our ongoing category management efforts which is how we now go to market with an improved product assortment and centralized approach for majority of our product procurement, which in turn helps us drive out cost for ourselves and our suppliers. Second, improved Sysco brand performance with our local customers, the deployment of a suite of revenue management tools and processes that bring more discipline to our sales and merchandising teams, and ultimately more consistent pricing to our customers and the impact of deflation. During the quarter, we continue to focus our sales teams on initiatives and activities that will help our customers succeed and grow their business. We have been implementing a variety of sales training and support tools that build overall capability within our selling organization and we have restructured some of the work within that organization to both free up our marketing associates' time and provide access to more targeted resources to better support our customers. These efforts in conjunction with ongoing enhancements to our e-commerce tools, which allow our customers to choose how they place the orders with Sysco are enabling us to better leverage our marketing associates to spend more time supporting our customers with unique programs, innovative products and other business building solutions. From a cost perspective, our expense management for the quarter was solid and remains a key area of focus for us moving forward. For U.S. Foodservice Operations, during the first quarter, we limited total adjusted operating expense growth to 1.8%. Our supply chain performance is progressing well, and we are seeing positive momentum from our productivity initiatives and continuing process improvements that are driving efficiencies. For U.S. Broadline, cost per case improved by $0.04 for the quarter, and on a fuel price-neutral basis, cost per case was flat. The continuous improvement efforts in our facilities and a continued investment in training for our warehouse associates and drivers has allowed us to build further capability throughout our supply chain. One such example is the implementation of a labor forecasting tool that enables us to proactively manage hours at our facilities based on the anticipated workload for each shift. We also remain on track to deliver our previously-communicated administrative cost reductions both in corporate and within the operations. Moving to International Foodservice Operations, which is made up of Canada, Europe, Bahamas, International Food Group and our joint ventures in Mexico and Costa Rica, sales were up $1.3 billion and adjusted operating income increased $50 million, both driven by our recent acquisition on the Brakes Group. We appreciate the Brakes Group early performance and continue to look forward to working with the management team on achieving our collective plans in the future. During the quarter, Brakes performed reasonably well in the UK amidst the challenging environment, and performance in both France and Sweden was relatively strong. Our business in Canada is off to a good start for the fiscal year as we are effectively managing costs within a deflationary and somewhat soft market environment. And lastly, our joint ventures in both Costa Rica and Mexico had solid performance in the first quarter fiscal year of 2017. SYGMA continues to make progress against their key business initiatives and had 4% sales growth for the first quarter. We continue to feel confident in their ability to deliver their full-year growth goals and objectives. In summary, our customer and operational strategies are solidly aligned around improving our customers' experience, engaging our associates at the highest level to improve execution and delivering our financial objectives as part of our three-year plan. We have continued to make significant progress in all areas for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, and I remain optimistic about the programs and processes we are putting in place that will enable our future success. Now I'll turn the call over to Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer.
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. As Bill and Tom have mentioned earlier, we are pleased with the results for the first quarter. Our growth reflects continued momentum from our underlying business including solid local case growth, strong gross profit dollar growth and good cost management, as well as a solid contribution from Brakes. The results that I'll cover for you this morning include Brakes, which significantly impacted our results. In summary, for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, sales grew 11.2%, gross profit dollars grew 20.3%, operating expense growth was 19.2%, all of which resulted in adjusted operating income growth of 23.8% and our adjusted earnings per share grew 28.8%. Sales during the quarter were positively impacted by the inclusion of Brakes in our results, though partially offset by deflation of 2.2% in our legacy Sysco business. Continuing with gross profit and gross margins beyond the addition of Brakes, the key drivers of improvement included category management, revenue management, higher Sysco brand penetration in our local business and deflation. Categories impacted most by deflation continue to be the center-of-the-plate protein and dairy. We expect the trend to continue into calendar 2017. That said, we continue to manage this environment effectively as evidenced by our strong gross profit dollar growth. The increase in expenses during the quarter beyond the addition of Brakes were mainly driven by the previously-mentioned higher case volumes and a timing shift of expenses related to our option grants from the second quarter into the first and was partially offset by various decreases in indirect spend, fuel costs, favorable comparisons to the prior year, which included planned investments in technology spend related to our three-year plan, and foreign exchange translation. As it relates to taxes, our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 32.9% compared to 36.3% in the prior-year period. The decrease in tax rate is driven by tax credits, lower tax rates in the UK due to new tax laws that were recently passed, and the mix of business as we grow in the lower-rate jurisdictions. Compared to the prior year, adjusted net earnings grew 20.7%. Cash flow from operations was $249 million, which was $510 million higher compared to the same period last year. Free cash flow was $111 million, which was $492 million higher compared to the same period last year. The significant improvements in both are due mainly to improved working capital performance and payments made in the prior year related to the proposed merger with US Foods. Net CapEx for the quarter was $138 million. I am pleased with our net working capital performance for the quarter. We had a net two-day improvement versus the prior year and a 2.8-day improvement versus fiscal 2015 and are making good progress towards our three-year goal of a 4-day improvement. These improvements are driven primarily by improvements in all three phases of working capital; payables, receivables, and inventory. Our first quarter results included some certain items that were mostly related to the Brakes acquisition including amortization associated with the transaction. As a reminder, in the prior year, we had significant amount of certain items primarily related to the termination of the proposed merger with US Foods. Now, I'd like to transition to three business updates. First, regarding Brakes, as a reminder, we initially guided that the acquisition would be modestly accretive to fiscal 2017 earnings per share by low-to-mid single digits. We are now updating that guidance due to finalizing the treatment of amortization as a certain item and believe this acquisition will be accretive to adjusted earnings per share by high-single-digits in fiscal 2017 with acceleration in subsequent years assuming constant currency. For the first quarter, Brakes was approximately $0.04 accretive to our business on an adjusted basis. It is important to note that Brakes business does have some seasonality as the performance is more heavily weighted to the first half of the year. Accordingly, we do not expect the same accretion each quarter and, in particular, in quarter number three. Second is regarding fuel expense, we expect the favorability we've had over the past two quarters to begin to lap in November. Separately, we are enhancing our fuel strategy. In the past, we used a third-party to forward-buy fixed price contracts approximately 12 months out. Going forward, we are transitioning the management of our fuel expense by using derivatives to hedge our exposure. By separating the management of our fuel purchases from our risk management, we will allow for more effective management of the risk. We'll continue to cover approximately two-thirds of our needs with hedges in place to minimize volatility in price. Finally, we are announcing today the upsizing of our credit facility from $1.5 billion to $2 billion and we'll upsize our commercial paper lines accordingly to provide greater liquidity to support our growing business. In summary, we had a quality quarter reflecting continued momentum from our underlying business including solid local case growth, strong gross profit dollar growth and good cost management. That said, we have more work to do in order to achieve the full financial objectives of our three-year plan. We are committed to serving our customers and delivering a high level of execution on all areas of our business that improve our financial performance in both the near and long term. I am confident in our ability to continue to execute our plan. Operator, we are now ready for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. Please limit your questions to one and one follow-up to allow other participants time for questions. Your first question comes from the line of Karen Short with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Ryan Gilligan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. It's actually Ryan Gilligan on for Karen. Thanks for taking the question, and thanks for all the additional disclosure. It's really helpful. I guess first off, can you just give us the bridge in the year-over-year change in gross margins in the International segment? It seems like Brakes is driving a lot of that improvement, and we're just wondering if this is a new level of gross margin that we should expect or if there's any one-time impact from there?
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: Hey, Ryan. I'm going to start here. I think, look, we have given you a lot of information, and the Q will be issued this week. There will be a little more detail in there, but we're not going to get into bridging individual entities within those segments. But obviously, Brakes did contribute a significant amount. And generally, I would tell you that in Europe, gross margins are higher and expenses are higher.
Ryan Gilligan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. And is there an opportunity to lower your expense – or lower the expense margin to one that's closer to the U.S. over time?
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: Well, they have a lot of good work going on over there in their own transformation, as we've spoken to a little bit before. So there is opportunity on the supply chain. They're doing some things with their warehouses where they're moving from multiple warehouses to service a market to one, which is more similar to what we see, and there's always opportunities on the administrative side of the business. So I think there will be opportunities. That's a big part of their plan. And I don't know that they'll get to our number necessarily because it is a different market, but there's certainly upside there.
Ryan Gilligan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. That's helpful. Thanks. And I guess just last question, can you comment on how cases trended throughout the quarter and the outlook for them going forward, I guess, just given the comparisons start to get tougher the next two quarters?
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: So this is Tom. So as I said, the local cases were up 1.9% in U.S. Broadline, and yes, that's been a little bit of a fall off from what we'd experienced in the last couple quarters of fiscal year 2016. I think based on what we're seeing in the restaurant segment, I think we believe it will be continued to be a slight decline from what it's been at the end of last year, but we still feel fairly confident that we'll see continued case growth in the local segment of our business. We're very focused on, as Bill said in his comments, profitable growth, and we want to make sure that we're focused on those right customer segments, but we still believe we can grow our local cases.
Ryan Gilligan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hey, guys. Good morning.
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: Hey Ed.
Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Can I just start with a follow-up to that last question? Could you just help us understand what you're seeing from an organic case growth standpoint? I don't know how it'd be if you could sort of frame that for us at all relative to the 1.8% and the 1.9%? I'm just curious as to the role that acquisitions are playing into this.
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: Well, let me start, Ed. I'm going to let Joel and Tom maybe add some color here, but I would say that is largely the organic growth that we're experiencing. What Tom said was if you go back a year, I think we're in the mid-2%s to high-2%s in different quarters, not every quarter was the same. So if you go back to my comments, I mean basically we're seeing some slowness out there – softening, I guess, is a better word – in terms of overall growth in the restaurant segment, and ours is off a little bit as well. So it just reinforces the importance of solidifying those customer relationships and getting penetration where there is that opportunity where customers are growing as well as continuing to stay really locked in on retaining our customers and identifying new opportunities as we go along, but I mean the 1.8% to 1.9% is largely the organic growth.
Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Great. That's very helpful. And just one second question here that I wanted to ask you about and I kind of asked about it last quarter too, but you maintain your three-year target. Your results so far had been really impressive. I mean this is a great quarter. Can you just talk to us about how you're thinking about that goal at this point, whether you think we'll get an update at some point relatively soon? And as we just sort of sit back and try to consider how things play out from here, Bill, what are the moving parts that we should really be thinking about from here sort of like good or bad going forward?
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: Well, I think the moving parts, we've touched on here just now. I think we're seeing some softness out there. I think other people are seeing the same thing on a relative basis, and so we're very focused on trying to get our case growth back up over 2%. I think that's very important. We're real pleased with how we're managing the margins and still growing the business and taking care of our customers in the right way, and a lot of the steps we took back in the spring to initiate deeper expense reductions are benefiting us right now. So I think the things that we can influence and control we're doing a really good job with. We're probably a little cautious in terms of the overall macro out there for our customers. We still got two points of deflation out there, largely driven by those center-of-the-plate categories, so those will be two areas where we're probably a little bit cautious. Obviously, we're in our third year now of earnings growth and I think this is the fourth quarter of double-digit earnings growth on an adjusted basis. So obviously, the bar gets higher and we're ready for that. So we feel very good overall about what we're doing, a little cautious on the environment. I think to your first question, the way I'm looking at that, Ed, is we're one quarter into this year and we're just not quite to the halfway point of the three-year plan. So I want to get a little further into this year and get halfway through the three-year plan, and then I think we'll be able to reassess where we are on the goals.
Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Zachary Fadem - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi. So on the M&A impact in the quarter, first of all, was there any M&A impact to U.S. Broadlines beyond Brakes? And then secondly for Brakes, total sales came in a bit higher than I thought. Maybe you could talk about just volume trends there and what the impact of the FX was. And just with the high-single-digit accretion for the year, what are you anticipating for total sales growth for the year for Brakes?
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: Again, we're not going to get into bridges or trends on individual businesses within segments, but I think as Tom pointed out, I'm going to let Tom speak to this, obviously there're some challenges in the UK right now. We thought the Brakes Group performed well given the environment and very nicely in France and Sweden. I think that's as much as I probably can add right now. Tom, you got anything?
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: Yeah, well, maybe the answer to your first question too, Zach, the very little impact on the U.S. cases from the acquisitions as we mentioned a minute ago. So those numbers were basically kind of organic growth numbers. And the only thing I'd add on Brakes is that we think the team's off to a really good start. Bill mentioned the transformational initiatives they've been operating against are all moving along nicely, and I think we feel very comfortable with overall how that business is performing. And the UK certainly has got some bumpiness in their economy driven by a lot of things going on over there right now. I think we feel very comfortable with where they're at and how they're performing (26:09).
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Yeah. And I would just add, I mean you asked about the FX part of that. I mean, obviously, the weakening sterling certainly plays into this, so there is some FX impact on an aggregate basis for the organization. We had fairly minor impact from FX for this quarter.
Zachary Fadem - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then just, I guess, let's all take it on a high level here on the operating environment. Could you comment on the – just a little bit about underlying restaurant trends with them being a little choppy, are you seeing any change to the competitive environment here particularly with the impact of deflation versus food away from home – or food at home widening a little bit? Are you seeing anything as far as just continued challenges for your customers and then competition from your peers?
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: Well, I think the challenges are what I'd referenced. You've got several quarters in a row now where traffic is actually down, and while the spend is up, it's not rising at the same rate it was rising. So there is clearly a softening out there. I mean whether it's because of the election or relative pricing between grocery store and restaurants, I'll let others kind of critique that. Look, I think there's ebbs and flows in any cycles of economies, and I think we're going through that right now. But I think it just puts a premium on quality operators both in terms of our customer bases as well as ourselves. I mean we feel good about what we're doing and we're doing everything we can to support our customers. As far as the competitive environment, I wouldn't say there's any change. It's acutely competitive, as we've talked about before, all different types of competitors out there. We feel we're very well positioned. It does play out differently in some markets, but overall I'd say it's about the same.
Zachary Fadem - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Great. Thanks so much. Really appreciate your time.
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: Sure.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC: So maybe starting a question for Tom. When you think about moving case growth back up, is there a lot of clear things you can do to help your customers stimulate demand or is it really more taking share from other distributors in the environment we're in today?
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: Hey, John. Well, I'd say I'm not sure there's a lot work we can do to help stimulate demand. What we can do is make sure that each of our customers is operating as effectively as they can and that they've got obviously the right products and the right pricing so that they can be successful, but as far as stimulating demand into their – our traffic into their locations, that's a little bit harder, I think, from where we sit. But I think there's a lot we are doing to help them be successful, and I think that's what we continue to focus and we believe very strongly that's as much our responsibility as theirs to help ensure that they're healthy and effective in what they're doing, and obviously with the tools that we bring them every day, we think, makes a big difference there. What was the second part of your question?
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Well, it was really that – if you're going to get case growth back up, it's more market share driven, which I guess, do you think from what you can see, is your share – the rate at which you're taking share from others in this space, maybe the smaller guys, it looks like it's accelerating. Is that fair?
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: Well, I think it's hard for us to obviously know that directly because, as you know, lots of competitors in this environment. We certainly believe we're continuing to grow at least at the industry if not outpacing that. As we talked for the last couple of years, we've tried to focus our efforts in a couple of areas, one where there's natural growth taking place. We've talked in the past about some of the segments where you're seeing growth, whether it be the Hispanic/Latino segment out there where we've really focused some of our energy and efforts to provide support to those operators or certainly looking at geographies where we've got opportunities. So I think we continue to execute our strategy and we feel like it's working and that we're hopefully gaining share from lots of different places based on how well we're taking care of our customers.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC: All right. And then just lastly, if you think about supermarket foodservice, maybe just remind us kind of relative size of that business for you, it's still pretty small, I think, and where you think as you look out three years, five years or longer, how much bigger can that get?
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: Well, it is still relatively small for us. I don't have the exact numbers from Technomic, but I think that they would say that that retail segment, I think, is about 7% of the market. If my guess is – my memory serves me right. And I think that for us we certainly have opportunity to grow there. I think it really is a matter of what's the best way for us to grow there. We talked a couple of years ago about our relationship with Kroger. We feel like we continue to have opportunity as they grow in that space. But I think it really comes down to how consumers decide to purchase their food away from home, and that retail segment certainly, I know, is a big focus for a lot of the retailers see if they can pick up maybe some more share from that consumer.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Curious if you could just talk a little bit about the local case growth. I know it's hard to really know exactly how much the market is growing there, but do you feel like you took some share there? I realize it slowed, but still pretty solid, so just any color around that 1.9%.
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: As we just were talking, I feel like it really is hard. We don't have a good view of the entire market. I'd say what we continue to see is we're getting growth from new customers. We are seeing a little bit of softness in some of the penetration of existing customers. We think that might be driven by some of the more external information that's out there around restaurant traffic, but broadly speaking we feel like we're just serving the broader independent restaurant segment well, and as we do that, we probably are gaining some share, but it's really hard to tell exactly where that might be coming from.
Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Got it. And then I guess just another question on the three-year target, so I realize you may not be updating those or feel the need to update those, but I guess given that Brakes is now just a significant part of the story over the next couple of years, do you have any color just on how we should think about that three-year target with Brakes included?
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: Kelly, I'm going to start and I'm going let Joel give you a little more on this. So one of the reasons we are providing more detail at this time on this segment information is to make sure that we are clear on the International versus the U.S., and then what we will do – so we have a three-year target and we have a three-year goal, and we will continue to track that in calls like this and investor presentations periodically and give you some sense on where we are in that original goal for the businesses that existed at that time, and then how we're doing on the rest of it. So we're going to simultaneously track that three-year goal and also begin to build a new three-year plan here over the next few months, and then we'll put that out to you at some point in calendar 2017.
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Yeah, I think, Kelly, the thing I would add to that is it's just as a reminder. Part of this target was to be very clear with all of you in the way that we are holding ourselves accountable, the way you can ultimately hold us accountable is this very clear and specific target to the legacy business. And so as we go through this, again what you can expect from us is to continue to have a very clear delineation, again, of both how we look at the organization as a whole, but a continued very clear tracking on the things that we talked about on our original Investor Day, and again tracking our targets against that. So, that would be hopefully very clear and separate out for all of you.
Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Great. That makes sense. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Sinisi with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. Great. Thanks very much for taking my question, guys, and congrats on the nice quarter here. Just wanted to kind of reconcile, obviously we know that there were some puts and takes with Brakes and tax and all that type of stuff this quarter, but you did, several times of course, again say today about the softening from the macro, which you had alluded to last quarter as well. So I guess maybe anymore color you can give on that restaurant softness in terms of any particular types of customers or geographies, and kind of going forward, do you expect things to get kind of sequentially worse or more just kind of roughly stay around these levels which are off the kind of previous highs? Thanks.
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: Hey, Vinny. I'll start. Look, the one thing I would point us to is on an adjusted basis, if you exclude the impact of Brakes, we grew our operating income 15%. And that's the fourth quarter in a row where we got double-digit increases on adjusted operating income. So I think what we feel good about and hopefully what that tells others is whether we've got 2.5% or 3% case growth or 1.5% to 2% case growth, we're doing everything we can on the top line as well as how we manage it from there to deliver on our commitment. And so at this point, we feel very good about how we're managing the environment. In terms of where it goes from here, I can just tell you, internally Tom and his team are very, very focused on penetration, on improved retention and where appropriate bringing on new quality customers. So we're doing everything we can in a disciplined way to grow that top line, but clearly it puts a premium on managing our expenses here and continue to find ways to price in a way that works for us as well as for our customers. So, that's the part we can control and influence. As far as where the market goes, it's really hard to call right now given everything that's going on in the country, but we're preparing for where we are at. I think to continue a while longer hopefully, it gets somewhat better, but we're not really – we're really not in the business of making those projections.
Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah, okay. Thanks, Bill. That's helpful. Maybe just a quick follow-up on Brakes specifically. In the past, I think we're all kind of – given the impression that at this point at least it was more or less going to kind of stay on its own largely kind of be run separately over there. Can you guys, I know it's still early, but just kind of give us maybe more of a qualitative sense of kind of the last few months, how that overall integration is going and if you think there are opportunities to kind of bring it more under kind of one roof over time?
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: Again, the way we're looking at this strategically is, there's a lot of exciting things about Brakes. We talked about quality of their team, the part of Europe that they know bring us into and our ability to use that business as a platform for future acquisition growth and a lot of other things. So strategically the way we look at it is, it's a – along with Canada, it's a two foundational parts of our international business, and we expected to continue to grow and to allow us to continue to find ways to do acquisitions, and that's basically it from my perspective. Joel, you want to add something?
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Yeah, I think what I would just say for maybe a little bit of color, I mean, we certainly have regular ongoing conversation in the business reviews with their team, but again, as Bill mentioned, just to remind you, when we talked about this deal initially, it's again, they have a very strong management team, we feel really good about their people and the work that they're doing that continue to transform their business. We certainly see that, again, as an opportunity to run that business stand-alone. Again, there's minimal overlap in the business we have. We certainly continue to look for opportunities though to bring upside in the deal. But, I would just tell you, again, a lot of good ongoing dialogue, but certainly we got a strong management team running that business as a stand-alone entity.
Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks very much, guys. Good luck.
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Marisa Sullivan with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Marisa C. Sullivan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask about gross margin excluding Brakes. It's still up very significantly in the quarter, and so I wanted to get your sense on what were the key drivers? You mentioned four. How would you rank them during the quarter specifically and also how did deflation impact the gross margin this quarter? Thank you.
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: Good morning. So, this is Tom. Let me – I did talk about four different drivers, and I think we continue to believe each of those is contributing to the work we're doing. It's hard to pull out the deflation component. We know it certainly impacts the gross margin percent, but it's also I think probably most important to think about those other three areas that we're focused on, because that's how we manage the dollar side of it. Category management continues to be very positive for us. As you know, we've been basically in that operating model now for the last three years, and it's – well we've gone through I'd say the major cycle with that, we continue to work with our suppliers and we look at long-term partnerships that continue to provide value for us, and ultimately for our customers. So category management continues to be a very important part of what we do and how we operate. Revenue management has been something that now is fully deployed within our organization and I think we've got a really good set of processes and tools and ultimately routines for our sales and merchandising teams to leverage in the marketplace, and it allows us to be I think a little quicker on our feet, and be able to do the things that we need to do to make sure that our customers pricing is right on a regular basis, and it's driving really more consistency for our customers as well. And then lastly, partly with the work we do in category management, but a continued focus on Sysco brand, which brings value also to our customers and obviously delivers additional profitability for Sysco has been a key driver for us, and we continue to see improvement within our local customers, with our local business, and we again saw an improvement in Sysco brand this last quarter. So it really is a combination of all of those, and it's hard for us to kind of tease apart each of them individually, but I can tell you that each of them is definitely playing a role.
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: The only thing I would add there Marisa is, the thing I feel the best about here is going back to Tom's prepared comments, we grew the gross profit dollars over 4% in U.S. Foodservice business, and so deflation hurts you when you talk about gross profit dollars. So, all those things Tom just outlined I think are all key reasons why we were able to do that in an environment where you're looking at a meaningful deflation.
Marisa C. Sullivan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. And if I could just follow-up on the revenue management, now that it's fully deployed, when do you anticipate seeing more of the benefit flow-through?
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: Well, I think it's – when I say it's fully deployed, I mean, it's been out there now for a couple of quarters, and so I think we're seeing the benefits right now. If the question is, does that have an endpoint? I think it's too early to even know that. It's an ongoing process that we follow now, and I think it's really more about being disciplined and how we approach pricing in the marketplace.
Marisa C. Sullivan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Mandeville with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Christopher Mandeville - Jefferies LLC: Yeah, good morning. And, Bill, just kind of sticking with the gross profit dollar growth subject here, when I think about your $500 million EBIT growth goal for over the next three years or through 2018, if you will, can you remind me what the inflation or deflation assumption was originally?
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Yeah, the original model, and I will take it, this is Joel, that was about a 2%. If you recall, we had a differential between our volume and sales growth that we rolled out. We initially talked about at a 2% rate.
Christopher Mandeville - Jefferies LLC: Okay. And then I guess suppose following up to that, now that we're in our fifth quarter of consecutive deflation, but also considering how well you guys have been driving your gross profit dollar growth despite this backdrop, how do we think about kind of you guys reaching that ultimate goal? I believe the original mix was somewhere 55% to 65% of that $500 million EBIT growth goal came from a gross profit dollar growth?
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Yes, I think I will take – I will start with that, I think, you guys can add in. I think we're still looking of that in a relatively consistent way as we had initially outlined. I think the real important part of this though is to – one of the things we've talked about a bit externally is this gap or this delta between our growth in gross profit dollars and our growth in expense dollars. And so one of the things – again, we've certainly done a good job of managing through this deflationary times and still continued to grow our growth in gross profit dollars. We've also done a good job, I think of focusing and driving expenses downward as both Bill and Tom have talked about. And I think, when we looked at that plan and sort of the puts and takes of what was going to drive it, we certainly knew there are – we could've had more inflation, could've had less inflation, some of those factors are what they are, but the reality of it is our continued focus on that gap and that delta between those two numbers I think is really important.
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: Yeah, I think where we're at right now and I think where we've been to your point over the last few quarters is, we're not on track to hit the sales number, okay? I think in that original goal, we were looking at 4% sales growth with two points of inflation and directionally about the same amount of GP growth. So we've got to get the GP a different way, and that's what we've been able to do here so far. We're really encouraged by that as well as managing the expenses, so I think it's more of a play on the top line than anything else.
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Yeah, just the one final thing I'd add to that is the – if you recall when we increased our targets from $400 million to $500 million, that was again primarily driven by some change in some of the way we viewed our expenses. And so, again, if you want to look at that shift again a little bit it was, again, as I mentioned earlier, a pretty good system over the top, it was again a little bit more of a shift towards some of the expense side as we roll out when we increased our targets.
Christopher Mandeville - Jefferies LLC: Right. That's helpful. And then just a quick housekeeping one for you, Joel. What's the reasonable tax rate to be assuming on a go-forward?
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Yeah, so I think at the end of last year we guided somewhere in the 35% to 36% range. So with some of the – one of the things we've talked about of this was actually a tax law change in the UK that moved the statutory rate essentially from 18% to 17%. I would say that would take our view of that probably on the low-end of the guidance that we put out before. A couple of things in this quarter that again we called out that we are seeing some one-time deals, and so I would say the rates you see in this quarter is a bit lower than you should anticipate going forward. But I think the low end of our guidance is probably a fair way to look at that.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ajay Jain with Pivotal Research Group. Your line is now open.
Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC: Yeah, hi. I had a question on the currency impact. I think, Joel, you mentioned that the impact overall wasn't that significant in the quarter, and my understanding is that any hedges that were in place were terminated at the end of last year. And I'm also sure that you're very well aware that there was a pretty dramatic swing in the exchange rate for the pound year-over-year during the quarter. So can you give any more color on why there wasn't any significant drag from currency in the quarter? I would've assumed that earnings would have been better without the currency impact, but I'm just surprised that you're saying there really wasn't that much of an impact at all?
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Yeah, I think, Ajay, I mean, the point I was really making is – without a doubt, I mean, you're correct in your statement regarding the hedges. I think if you think about the magnitude of the Brakes business as a percentage of our entire business, it's really where my comment was targeted at. What we've talked about over the past few quarters was a difference that was primarily driven by the Canadian exchange rate, but that has pretty much mitigated frankly, and again if you think about that business as a percentage of our total, certainly the Brakes earnings would've been higher and if you factor the weakness of the sterling in, but I guess my comment was really on the whole organization, the overall impact wasn't that significant.
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: I mean, to Joel's point, you're talking about 65% of 10% of the business.
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Right.
Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC: Got it. And I also just wanted to follow-up on the earlier questions on the three-year plan, and maybe I'll just frame my question a little differently. So I know you're going to be giving an update later in the year, but since you are tracking your progress pretty closely, can you just at least confirm where the things are right now on a run rate basis relative to that $500 million growth target? So if you were to give a current snapshot, can you confirm whether you're comfortably ahead of plan or if there's still supposed to be kind of like more back-ended loaded assumptions on those three-year objectives? Thanks.
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: As I said, I feel good about where we're at. We're five quarters into it. We've been trending 10% to 15% earnings growth every quarter, that's consistent with the plan. We've got some benefit next year with the depreciation as it relates to the business technology. So from where I sit, I would say we're comfortably on track right now and looking to reassess here at the end of second quarter.
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Yeah, I think the way, and I'll just add to that, I mean, I think at the end of last year we've talked about some initial percentage targets. I think at the end of last year we were slightly ahead of those targets. I think what we've talked about, though, and again, we had a strong quarter this quarter, but on an ongoing basis we've – I've said it, Bill said it before, I mean we'd certainly like to get a couple of quarters under our belt before we think about doing anything differently there. And so that's really the way I would think about our progress. We're feeling good, we're in a good place, but let's see how this plays out.
Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC: Okay. And finally, how would you describe if you could comment on the case volume trends at Brakes year-over-year in the UK market in particular? I mean, can you confirm if they were positive or negative?
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: Again, we've got an international segment. We're going to give you some color on the components of that. I would tell you that their business softened through the calendar year even before Brexit, and I think it's more about just the uncertainty in that economy, whether it was leading up to Brexit or post-Brexit. And if you read all the different accounts, so far it hasn't been as bad perhaps as people thought it might have been and I think we're seeing that as well. On the other hand, there's still a lot of uncertainty here over the next two years or three years. So, I think as Tom said in his prepared remarks, I think they performed reasonably well given the environment.
Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And our last question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Thank you. One quick one and then one question, if I may. Firstly, there seems to be some confusion about what non-GAAP D&A should be for the business in 2017 and maybe even 2018. Bill, I think in the last question you mentioned some technology write-off that you had done recently that may benefit that D&A line, but I hate to ask such a specific question, because a lot of people are – do have some really different estimates. Can you give us a little more specific help on that specific line?
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Well, so let me start with that, and then so I'll take a couple of things on that. So one of the things you'll see are certain item, reconciliation this quarter is that, you can see this in our Q, our D&A is up a bit for this quarter for a couple of different reasons. Number one, as we talked about last year, we actually expected some due to the write-off of the SAP system, there was an acceleration of the amortization related to that, and so there is again say roughly $30 million I'd say of a certain item related to that issue that's part of our D&A. There's also as a result of the Brakes deal, there is both additional depreciation and amortization as a part of that. And so I think if you look at our overall D&A expense for this particular quarter relative to where we've been, those are really the two primary contributors on that line as it relates to this. What Bill was referring to as in his comment earlier, if you recall at the time when we increased our targets from $400 million to $500 million at a while back, we had made a couple of comments as it relates to that. Number one was the fact that a component of that difference was related to the fact that we – it was a changeover in our technology strategy, that there'd be some benefits once again the asset was fully written off. Again, there is accelerated amortization we will be experiencing at the end of last year and through this year, but there'd be benefit of that starting in 2018. So I think that's really what Bill was relating to on that, and so hopefully that gives you some clarity on some of the comments and a little bit of a break down on that. But you should expect that accelerated amortization from that plus the Brakes to be present throughout the rest of this year.
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: I can confirm that's what I was relating to.
John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yes. Okay. Thank you, and I think I did understand that. But I think if you look at Street estimates you'll see that people have some pretty different estimates for D&A, like unusually different estimates for D&A in 2017 and 2018, and that's why I was wondering if you're willing to just give a little bit more specific guidance on that one specific line?
Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.: Yeah, I mean, look, I think you guys need to adjust this quarter, go through a certain item schedule, work with Neil, and I would expect it will get more consistency there.
John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: All right. We will do our best as always. And then the next question, obviously the restaurant industry just speaking from an operator perspective, slower traffic, higher labor cost, I mean, it's one of the obvious things that a restaurant company does is come to their food supplier and try to get as low as prices as possible. Are you seeing your restaurant customers may be asking even more from you than they have in the past, even if they see your gross margin results may ask you to get some of the gross margin back to them as they try to protect their own profitability?
Thomas L. Bené - Sysco Corp.: Well, this is Tom. So I would say, John, a couple of things, as we said earlier, it continues to be very competitive out there, whether it's a chain restaurant customer or a street customer for us. And I think the way we try to look at value we bring to those customers is certainly beyond just price. We offer a wide range of obviously products and services to these folks. We believe we bring them value each and every day. We talked a little bit about Sysco brand earlier, Sysco brand is a great example of where we're able to bring basically lower cost of goods to our customers, and put them in a position where they can earn as much as they can from their offering. But it's well beyond just products and pricing, and so I would say it's the whole portfolio of things we bring to them that's allowed us to be successful, and certainly what we believe is the right strategy for us going forward. But it doesn't take away from the fact that it's competitive out there each and every day, and we just have to make sure that we're doing those right things in the market. We absolutely believe we need to be price competitive and that's one of the components of what we focus on.
William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.: And I think, John, just to reinforce that, this is happening in an environment of two points of deflation right now, so the customers, they're benefiting from a food cost deflation. What we're doing and what Tom addressed earlier with the revenue management is using a lot of tools to be more consistent, more targeted in our pricing. But we still need to compete, as he points out, every day for that business. And interestingly to me, on the data that we see, to your point, whether benefiting from deflation, they've got some labor pressures, they've been out there for a while now, but the restaurants as a group continue to pass long about a two-point increase to their customers, and that has been incredibly consistent through every cycle that we've seen here. So, I think right now they're managing it pretty well and the deflation is helping them. At some point, I guess it could become more acute if we were to see the deflation reverse, but as I think as Joel pointed out, we don't see that happening here, at least not in this calendar year.
John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you.
Operator: And there are no further questions in queue. Thank you for your participation on today's call. You may now disconnect.

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Neil Russell, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.
Neil Russell: Thank you, Christy. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Sysco's fourth quarter fiscal 2016 earnings call. Joining me in Houston today are Bill DeLaney, our Chief Executive Officer; Tom Bené, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, please note that statements made during this presentation that state the company's or management's intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and actual results could differ in a material manner. Additional information about factors that could cause results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's SEC filings. This includes, but is not limited to, risk factors contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 27, 2015, subsequent SEC filings and in the news release issued earlier this morning. A copy of these materials can be found in the Investors section at sysco.com, or via Sysco's IR app. Non-GAAP financial measures are included in our comments today and in our presentation slides. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures are included at the end of the presentation slides and can also be found in the Investors section of our website.

Please note, that the financial results announced today include a 14th week for the fourth fiscal quarter and a 53rd week for the fiscal year 2016 ended July 2, 2016. In fiscal 2015, the fourth quarter included 13-weeks and the year included 52-weeks. As such, the results discussed on the call will include GAAP results and non-GAAP results adjusted for certain items. We will also share the adjusted non-GAAP results on a comparable 13-week and 52-week basis to provide reasonable year-over-year comparisons. To ensure that we have sufficient time to answer all questions, we'd like to ask each participant to limit their time today to one question and one follow-up. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Bill DeLaney.
William DeLaney: Thank you, Neil, and good morning, everyone. This morning Sysco reported strong fourth quarter and fiscal year financial results. Our performance reflects both the soundness of our strategy, the commitment of our associates to supporting the success of our customers and the consistently improving execution of our three-year plan. For the quarter, on a comparable 13-week basis, Sysco delivered sales growth of 2% and gross profit dollar growth of 5% while limiting adjusted operating expense growth to less than 2% which resulted in adjusted operating income growth of approximately 15% compared to the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share grew approximately 15% as well. These results were achieved in a market environment that is experiencing uneven trends and appears to have softened somewhere off-late, while consumer confidence in unemployment data points remain relatively favorable compared to a few years ago. The current sentiment for customer spending and meals away from home seems to be trending slightly downward. Turning to specific restaurant industry data, overall sales trends weakened as reflected in current NPD and KNAPP-TRACK Traffic and spend data. That said, according to National Restaurant Association, restaurant operator expectations remain somewhat favorable. Moving to our results for fiscal 2016, I'm very pleased with our performance during the year. The improving momentum in our business is a result of strong local case growth, gross profit growth, with gross margin expansion and solid expense management. Specifically, for fiscal 2016, on an adjusted 52-week basis, we delivered the following results. Total broad line cases grew 3% and local cases grew 2.7%. Sales grew 1.5% to $50 billion, even with the unfavorable impact of deflation and foreign exchange headwinds. Gross profit grew 3.6% to $9 billion and gross margin increased 38 basis points. Adjusted operating income increased 10% over the prior year to $2 billion and adjusted earnings per share grew 12 %. In addition free cash flow approximated $1.4 billion. And adjusted return on invested capital was 14% for the year. I particularly encourage our progress today toward the achievement of our three year plan financial objectives, especially our goal-to-grow adjusted operating income by at least $500 million from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2018.  Our strong progress towards the achievement these financial objectives is supported by a foundation that was built over the past several years through a series of commercial, supply chain and administrative initiatives. We continue to build on that foundation throughout fiscal 2016 by accomplishing several key objectives, including, Leveraging customer insights to create new and enhanced sales marketing programs, advancing our progress in several key commercial areas; including category and revenue management. Shifting our technology strategy and related spend to a more customer centric focus, And restructuring our business to drive greater efficiency including; Streamlining our market structure, introducing a standard field organization model, and further developing a functional structure in key support areas such as merchandising, supply chain and human resources. All of this is been accomplished by consistently improving the execution of our strategy, that was centered on five fundamental points. Partnership, too profoundly and receive experience of doing business with Sysco. Productivity, to continuously improve productivity in all areas of our business; Products, to enhance our friends through a customer centric innovation program; People, Leveraging talent structure and culture to drive performance and portfolio, continuously assessing new market opportunities and current business performance.  Regarding the latter point; we recently close the acquisition of the brakes group a $5 billion European food service distributor, with significant presence in the United Kingdom, France and Sweden. Brakes is a highly regarded company whose management team and strategy are well aligned with the vision we have for Sysco, to be our customers most valued and trusted business partner. This acquisition will serve as a platform for future expansion in Europe. We're looking forward to working together with the entire Brakes team to execute their business strategy and we feel fortunate to welcome them into the Sysco family.  Joe will discuss with you in a few minutes anticipated contribution of Brakes to Sysco financial results. As we enter the new fiscal year, we are executing our strategy at a high level working effectively together as one Sysco and we remain committed to the success of our customers. We have even bigger goals for fiscal 2017. And I'm confident our ability to achieve our financial and business objectives in the year ahead and throughout the three year plan.  The new fiscal year brings expanded global presence, enhanced technology and continued focus on our customers. Specifically we intend to deliver solid local case growth, increase our gross profit, reduce costs in the right way and put crosses in tools in place that will further enable our associates to provide our customers with industry leading service and support. Our past and future success is driven by the ongoing dedication and commitment of all of our associates. And I think each of them for their effort to deliver a very successful year in fiscal 2016.  And now turn the call over to Tom. 
Thomas Bené: Thank you, Neil, and good morning everyone. Fiscal 2016 was a great year for Sysco and I'm proud of the contributions made by all of our associates throughout the year. Sysco's financial results announced this morning reflect a year of solid operating performance and excellent progress on several key multi-year initiatives that begun to provide a strong foundation for success. Our payroll operating performance was driven by our ongoing focus on the key drivers of our three year plan, including accelerating our sales with local customers by providing them with exceptional service, improving gross margins and managing overall expenses.  This morning I provide an update on some of the initiatives related to our three year plan and how they have continued to positively impact our business results. The first of which is our focus on accelerating local case grow. During the year we grew U.S. broadline local cases 2.6 % unadjusted 52 week basis. Strongest performance we've had several years, also an adjusted 52 week basis gross profit in U.S. broadline group 4.7 % for the fiscal year in gross margin increased 47 basis points driven by our focus on profitable case grow, revenue management activities and improve Sysco brand penetration.  The focus our sales teams had on helping our customers succeed and grow has been further enhanced throughout the school year 2016. During the year we remain focused on improving our industry leading category management practices, only deploying revenue management in the field and enhancing our sales training and support tools to continue to free up our marketing associates time to better support our customers with business building solutions. We also rolled out various promotional programs in key initiatives throughout the year, including those that highlight product innovation and reinforce the Sysco brand which delivers tremendous value to our customers that values delivered through an unrelenting focus on the highest quality products, investing class traceability from a food safety perspective.  Finally, we continue to focus on delivering new and improved customer facing technology solutions, that value to their business and all our associates to be more efficient. On the cost side, the expense management throughout the year was also solid remains a key area of focus moving forward. For U.S. broadline during fiscal year 2016 we limited total adjust expense growth to only 2.2 % on a compatible 52 week basis compared to gross profit growth of 4.7 %. We also reduced our overall cost per case U.S. broadline by $0.04 during the year. I just think of the impact of fuel prices are just a cost per case in U. S. front line was flat.  As we discussed, we've been very focused on reducing costs and improving productivity while continuing to deliver improved service levels to our customers. In fiscal 2016 we reduced expenses and a number of key areas. The supply chain area, we have reduced indirect span will continue to focus on maximizing transportation and warehouse sufficiency. We've also standardized organizational design and reduce the number of our markets in the U.S. from 8 to 6. And throughout the organization we have reduced overall SG&A cost. In summary, our customer and operational strategies are solidly reclined around improving our customers experience, engaging our associates of the highest level to improve execution and delivering our financial objectives as a part of our three year plan. In fiscal year 2016 we made significant progress in all areas, now remain extremely optimistic about the programs and processes we are putting in place that will enable our future success.  Now I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer. 
Joel Grade: Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. As Bill and Tom have mentioned earlier, we are pleased with the results of the fourth quarter and the full year. Our growth reflects continued momentum from our underlying business, including strong local case grow, solid gross profit dollar growth and good cost management. I begin my remarks by speaking to our fourth quarter. For the purposes of matching your models our fourth quarter results reflecting next week include; Sales growth of 10.0 %, gross profit growth of 12.7%, adjusted operating expense growth of 9.6%, adjusted operating income growth of 23.4% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 23.1%. Excluding the extra weeks on a comparable basis, the fourth quarter results include; sales growth of 2.2%, sales profit growth of 4.7%, adjusted operating expense growth of 1.7%, adjusted operating income growth of 14.6% and adjusted earnings per share growth a 15.4%.  Sales during the quarter negatively impacted by both deflation of 1.2% and foreign exchange of 0.5%, partially offset by an increase in sales from acquisitions of 1.2%. Our comparable 13 week basis total broadline case go through the fourth quarter was 2.2%, Local is 2.4%. And corporate manage growth was 2.0%. During the fourth quarter we had some certain items that impacted our results. In the prior year we've acquisition costs $390 million, in the current year. We have re measurement of foreign denominated cash due to lower exchange rates a quarter as well as the premium foreign currency option contracts for the Brakes acquisition. As results other expenses net for the quarter was approximately $141 million primarily driven by certain items from fiscal 2016.  As it relates to taxes, our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 35% compared to negative 6% in the prior year. Both quarter tax rates reduce primarily from the impact of certain items, which lord of net income and resulted in lower tax rates. A similar event occurred last year related to the U.S. suits termination costs which drove an unusual gap tax rate. On an adjusted for certain items basis our tax it would have been approximately 36.8% in both years.  Now turning to our results for the year; our fiscal 2016 including the extra week included sales growth of 3.5%, gross profit growth of 5.7%, adjusted operating expense growth of 4%, adjusted operating income growth 12.1%, and adjusted EPS growth of 14.1%. To provide a relevant comparison the prior year all income statement measures I discuss from this point forward, will be adjusted for certain items and presented on a 52 week comparable bases.  Looking at our full year results; we grew sales by 1.5 % year-over-year despite deflation of 0.7%. We saw continued deflation and sat in center of the plate protein categories, such as meat and seafood along with deflation in diary. Sales from acquisition increase sales by 0.7%. During the year we closed five acquisitions including Gilchrist & Soames, and North Star Seafood. Foreign exchange negatively impacted sales by 1.3% largely driven by the US dollar's strength against the Canadian dollar. The negative impact we have been experiencing on a comparative basis is lessening, as we begin to wrap initial decline in relative value to Canadian dollar. On a constant currency basis; sales would have been up 2.7%.  Turning to case growth; consistent with our three year plan to achieve discipline case growth, we had strong performance for the year. On a comparable 52 week basis, Total broadline case growth through the year was 3%, Local was 2.7%, and corporate managed was 3.3%.  Looking at gross profit and gross margins for the year we grew our gross profit on a solid 3.6% we'll also continuing to see expansion in gross margins, which grew by 38 basis points. The key drivers of gross margin improvements include a category management, more beneficial mix of local business, higher Sysco brand penetration in our local business and deflation. On a constant currency basis, adjusted gross profit growth is 4.8%; adjusted operating expense on a comparable 52-week basis is 2% for the year and by 3.3% on a constant currency basis. This increase is mainly driven by the previously mentioned higher case volumes and incentive accruals; and is partially offset by various decreases, including reducing indirect spending; it is still cost and foreign exchange translation. This progress is reflected in a reduced cost per case as Tom mentioned which is flat, excluding fuel price changes. As a result adjusted operating income for the year was $1.96 dollars, up 9.6% compared the prior year, and up 10.6% on a constant currency basis. Compared to the prior year on 52-week basis, adjusted net earnings grew 8% and adjusted earnings per share grew 12%. For the full year, cash flow from operations was $1.9 billion off approximately 24% from last year. It is important to note that a timing difference in tax payments impacts our cash flow during fiscal 2016. Net working capital improvement by six times a day for the full year compared to last year. This was largely driven by improvements in inventory. Net CapEx for the full year was $504 million and free cash flow was $1.4 billion. Both cash flow from operations and free cash flow include the cash impact of certain items of $280 million in fiscal 2016. As a reminder, the certain items for 2016 are mostly related to the termination of the proposed merger with US Foods. Lastly, we improved our adjusted return on invested capital to approximately 14% during the fiscal year, up from approximately 13% in the prior year. Now I'd like to close with some commentary on the outlook for fiscal 2017. The deflationary trend has been persistent over the last four quarters and will likely continue through the remainder of the calendar year, creating modest sales and gross profit headwind for the first half year. The restaurant environment appears to be softening and as a result, we anticipate modest case volume growth for the next quarter or two. Capital expenditures during 2017 are expected to be approximately 1% of sales, including Brakes. We intend to continue to improve working capital days to achieve our three-year-plan goal of four days' improvement when comparing fiscal year 2018 to fiscal 2015. And we expect to complete our $3 billion, two-year share repurchase program during fiscal 2017. We anticipate a benefit of approximately $0.03 to $0.04 to diluted EPS in fiscal 2017, driven by a reduction in average shares outstanding. Regarding the addition of Brakes to Sysco's financial results, we expect the combined company will have roughly $55 billion in annualized revenue on a pro forma basis.  In our most recent fiscal year, ending December 2015, Brakes reported nearly $5 million in revenue, up roughly approximately 6.5% from 2014. They also reported an approximate 5% adjusted EBITDA margin with a double-digit growth rate. Roughly two-thirds of their revenue comes from the United Kingdom, where they have a leading share. We continue to believe this acquisition will be modestly accretive to adjusted earnings per share by lower- to mid-single digits in fiscal 2017, with acceleration in fiscal 2018 and beyond. This acquisition is also expected to reduce our normalized effective tax rate to about 35% to 36%.  In summary, we had a strong quarter and year, reflecting continued momentum from our underlying business, including strong local case growth, solid gross profit dollar growth and good cost management. That said, we have more work to do in order to achieve the full financial objectives in our two-year plan. We are committed to serving our customers and delivering a high level of execution in all areas of our business that will improve our financial performance in both the near and long term. I feel confident in our ability to continue to execute our plan. Operator, we are now ready for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Merissa Sullivan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Merissa Sullivan: Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask about gross margins and see how much [Technical Difficulty].
William DeLaney: It's challenging when to answer that specifically. I think you will see some correlation over the last four or five quarters, where as we see some deflation, the more margins moved up. We're making good progress on relative margin trends before that, but I would tell you that we believe a significant amount of the improvement is coming from a lot of these initiatives I referred and that Tom spoke to in more detail along the lines of category management, revenue management, the work we're doing in segmentation, tools we're providing our sales force, so I can't quantify exactly but I think it's coming from multiple sources.
Thomas Bené: Yes, I think the only thing I would add is you heard me talk about fully deploying revenue management. We're now at a place where we've got it within our entire organization. And so I think we continue to believe that, as Bill said, a combination of all those things are allowing us to manage the difficult deflationary environment that we've been in.
Merissa Sullivan: All right, that's helpful. And then just as a follow-up. You mentioned the uneven environment. I just want to see if you can comment further on the restaurant industry trends and specifically what you're seeing from both your independent customers and your chain customers. Thank you.
Thomas Bené: Well, it's not just what we're seeing -- I think it's what we're hearing from other folks that are speaking to their results, both in the operator side and some of our peers in the industry. So I think it's just a little bit softer. I think the good news here: People are still relatively optimistic, both the consumer confidence in general and the restaurant operators. When you look at those indices and compare them over the last couple of years, generally, the outlook is favorable, but we're just seeing some softening in terms of the slope of the growth, and specifically, we're seeing it in traffic continuing to be flat, and check size up in some segments, flat in other segments. So it's no one place, it's a relative comment. We're still seeing growth but it's just not the same trajectory that we saw a couple quarters ago.
Merissa Sullivan: Got it. Thank you so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel from Guggenheim. Your line is open.
John Heinbockel: So let me start, either for Bill or Tom, I guess a lot of your end customers are struggling a little bit with the value of creation relative to eating at home, and if you think about the next several years with wage inflation likely to increase in the restaurant space, what do you do today or, more importantly, if you look out over the next two or three years, to help them deal with that? So what are the opportunities as it relates to more Sysco brand, selective price investments. How do you think about helping them compete and maybe drive some market share for yourself?
William DeLaney: Good morning, John. I'll start but I'll let Tom kind of get into the meat of that a little bit more. I think just from my perspective, this market place has been extremely competitive for most of my career and even more so since 2009, and we continue to see that. I think some operators are doing fine. And the best operators are going to do well and the best distributors are going to do well, and I think that will continue to play out. So I think it's -- everyone has their own unique challenges, but if you're investing in your business, if you're listening to your customer base, and if you can scale what you're good at, I think you're going to continue to have good success here. So you hit on a couple things that we're doing, but I'll let Tom take you through and remind the group here all the different things that we're doing to differentiate ourselves to our customers.
Thomas Bené: John, maybe just to build on a couple things; while you're right, there are some reports out there, some traffic headwinds for some of these folks. The good news for them obviously is that in a deflationary environment, is their cost of products in general are not necessarily going up. So that's been a good thing for those restaurant operators. But from our perspective, we spend a lot of our time trying to think about what are those areas where we can help them be more successful. You mentioned labor rates potentially going up; that's obviously a key concern of many of these operators today. And so whether its Sysco brand, where we bring not only value but also things I talked about which is great reliability and traceability and high-quality products. That's a big area of focus for us. The tools, think about some of the innovative products we're bringing. We're focused on how do we reduce the labor costs for these operators. So if there are products that are labor-saving type of products in the preparation, that allows them to leverage some of those things that offset -- maybe some potential labor increases they're seeing. And as Bill said, I think technology and tools in general that allow them to manage their business more efficiently are also things we're focused on. So it's really a combination of things but it's -- you're right, there's a lot of things that they're dealing with and I think the more we can focus on helping them be successful, that's a good place for us to be.
John Heinbockel: All right. And then secondly, I know it's early, but have you seen any reaction or change in Brakes' performance or their end demand post Brexit? Or that ends up being kind of an overblown issue?
William DeLaney: I don't think it's overblown, John, I think it's just too early to tell. Heading into Brexit, I would say as we got into March and April, we did see through their eyes or get some feel for it and the data out there, there was some slowing in their business in the UK just in general, and a lot of that was attributed to the uncertainty of Brexit. And I think the implied thought would be that once there was certainty, that things would kind of bounce back a little bit. I think that assumed that the certainty would remain. And obviously the vote went the other way, so now what you've got is continued uncertainty. So I just think it's going to be an extended period of time here. And I think it'll play out politically, it'll play out economically, so it's a little slower in the UK right now. The good news for us is it seems to be -- we seem to be seeing some good things coming out of France and Sweden; I believe that's about a third of their business.  So I think as far as Brexit's concerned, I think we're all watching it and to this point, I don't know that I've seen clear analysis in terms of what the specific impact is going to be at a certain point in some. My judgment would say that it's going to play out over the next two or three years; it will become business as usual here over that period of time and it'll be somewhat of a headwind in the context of uncertainty that our people will work through in their market place.
Joel Grade: Yes, and I think this one thing I could add -- it's Joel -- I'd just remind you, certainly while there's some short-term instability that this creates, to some extent, we certainly again remain very bullish of this, as a long-term value creator for this company. And a great management team, great platform for future growth, and again, just an overall good long-term view, despite some of those slight -- again, some short-term instability as a result.
John Heinbockel: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Edward Kelly: Hi, good morning, guys, and nice quarter. I'd like to start with just the outlook. So you guys took 20% to 30% of the $500 million EBIT target in 2016, I think, which at the high end of that would be $150 million. You just did $173 million, excluding the extra week, $217 million if you include it. I guess the first part of this question: So what drove that upside to how you were initially thinking about things? And then as we think about 2017, you talked about 50% to 60%, which is probably like $300 million at the high end of the range. That does now seem kind of low, so how should we think bout 2017, given that you're ahead of where you thought you'd be at this point? Thank you.
William DeLaney: Thank you. I'll start. I'll let Joel get into detail a little bit more. I would say in terms of why our performance for 2016 was better than originally what we projected, I think part of it is just having the time to refine the plan and to go deep on the plan. And our execution was just very good. So if you put all this into some type of context, our merger agreement with US Foods was terminated in late June, we regrouped as a management team very quickly, in July we put together the framework of a three-year plan and shared that with the investor group in September, along the way with our Board. And so I wouldn't say we were cautious, but we certainly were thoughtful in terms of what we were leading people to and as we built some momentum, if you'll recall, first quarter, we had a very solid quarter, U.S. broad line, but there's some tailwinds with incentives and it kind of -- or headwinds with incentives and the first quarter was a little flattish and then very strong, second, third, and fourth. So we built momentum as the year went along. To bring it back to numbers, we've been able to manage this deflationary environment very well and create a good spread between our gross profit growth and our expense growth, by managing our expenses very smartly and thoughtfully.  So overall, I would just say the execution has been good and -- very good, and as we got deeper into the year we were able to raise our estimate to $500,000. Not quite ready to do that right now, I'd like to get further into this plan; we're a third of the way through it, so I'd like to see another quarter or two and see how we perform, see how the market place performs, and reassess that outlook at that point in time. Joel?
Joel Grade: Yes, I think that's really the context that I'd put that into. Is that we're through the first year now of our three-year plan, to the point that you made and Bill certainly reinforced. Good momentum to business, and in the end, a little bit of softness that we're seeing in the industry, but certainly feeling good about where we're at. I think the comment Bill kind of closed with is what I would close with, as well. Is that again, it's still early on, and I'd like to give it a little bit of time under our belt before we take a look at if there's anything else we wanted to do there.
Edward Kelley: Okay. And just, I wanted to follow up. One of the, to me, more impressed with sort of under the radar accomplishments for you guys is this dramatic improvement in the free cash flow. Can you talk just a little about what's been driving that and the opportunity that you see left here, no payables, there seems like there's a fairly large opportunity. Just thought on sort of where we can expect that line item to play out over the next couple of years. 
William DeLaney: Yes, sure. I think, a couple things on that, and certainly number one, we had strong operating performance. And so that's certainly generated by a good part of the free cash-flow, you talk about the focus we had on working capital. You know we've had some we aggressive goals the start of a three year plan, and I think one of a primary benefits this year was in focus on inventory and we made some good progress in that area. And I think you'll continue to see the opportunity there again both on the table's area as well as inventory and someone they are as well so we got some continued focus on working capital of that I believe we're making good progress on and will continue to drive that. We did some benefit this year of as I mentioned. And some timing issues on cash taxes, things that were related to of the timing of payments and ability to accelerate some deductions having so that we are we also did have something in some going the other way in the U.S. foods payments that we made the first quarter of this year. so I would guess what I would say in general as I think the level of free cash-flow you are seeing that we experiences years is a pretty reasonable view of what I believe this business can generate here as we move forward, over the next couple years and so I think I think we're good place we're going to continue driving initiatives that were driving improve that performances as well. 
Edward Kelley: Great, thank you.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Zachary Fadem from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Zachary Fadem: Good morning, it looks like there was a conversion in in total broadline versus the local case growth in the quarter can you talk about the driver's hearing how trends played out just throughout the quarter and you mention already the performance of chains verses independence but what about your institutional customers like the healthcare and WeCare vertical power they trending. 
William DeLaney: Zach, would you be more clear what you mean by conversion. 
Zachary Fadem : Well, I mean when you look at the broadline case trend and the local case trend, they both converged at that but you know.
William DeLaney: The numbers okay. And. So I would think for times about the segments a little bit. I think it's just what you said. You know we and I would say by this business understands that where we have the opportunity to bring the most value, it isn't that look we managed highly street-oriented customer base and we continue to focus there in a myriad of ways that we spoke to in terms of a commercial initiatives, supply chain, and all that type of thing. And that's continued to pay dividends force or less than two years plus. As we feel good about that we also want to continue to grow the corporate managed business in the right way, and so you are seeing the slope of the growth of the fall of somewhat but it's still positive and there is still very, very important relationships with others with some very large customers, That work for us as well from profitability standpoint.  So the balance is always the key here and it's -- this is key if you're running an operating company and its key from a -- from the overall corporate standpoint which as you saw here's quarter with pretty good balance, so in any points time one segment you called that for a moment may be going a little faster than the other and that's okay but generally we're looking to grow both in the right way with good discipline and that we've been making great strides are last a year two. So I'll let Tom speak a little about this segment performance.
Thomas Bené: Yes. The only exact I'll add is, around this segment you think you mentioned chains and also healthcare, we continue to feel good about each of the segments in their growth potential for us, honestly healthcare's continued to be growth segment for this industry and I think the chain business while it's going to have it choppiness depending on which customer you're talking about overall that business, I think is going to continue to be solid out there. For us I think it's a really is built on a balance in so looking at different customers in their relative profitability and where we can actually have the most value was where we trying to focus our efforts. And clearly, that's in that local restaurant segment certainly, probably more, so than in the chain restaurants segment. But overall I think we don't see necessarily other than some of the chain number you've seen, from some of those companies we see fairly consistent a performance across these segments. 
Zachary Fadem: And then to touch on breaks out quickly can you talk about just margin opportunities there you mentioned it's a 5% adjusted EBITDA margin, but can you talk about some of the facility and productivity efforts there and how do you think about the long term margin opportunity, and how that can play out. 
Bill DeLaney: Well Joe said, we made significant investment here for the long term, we certainly expect and will grow their business on the top line, they have very similar approach as we do especially in the UK in terms of a disciplined approach, they are as we've alluded to in the past and going through some significant transformative change of their own, a fair amount which is played out in the supply chain in the United Kingdom, where they're consolidating warehouses into warehouses that look more like ours where you have multiple capacity -- storage capacity all in one building which in and of itself what will create cost savings, improve productivity that kind of thing. So certainly, the supply chain in particular and UK is an opportunity for Brakes to expand their margins. But there's other opportunities as well starting with growing with the right customers and making sure that those customers are interfacing with them and ordering product in the way that they want to the chances they prefer. So they've a lot of the same opportunities that we have. 
Zachary Fadem: Great, thanks Bill, appreciate the color guys. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Kelly Ann Bania of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Kelly Bania : Hi, good morning. Wanted to just follow up on the independence, I realize it is moderated slightly but still very solid growth I think if you look over the past several years the lease, so just wondered if you when you analyze that segment what are you seeing there that's really the drivers there that is it still pretty broad based, are there any ethnic categories or regions or when you talk to your customers there is there any difference in take out or dying in trends, just trying to understand what you think the real drivers are for the independent or local case growth. 
William DeLaney: Sure, I'll take that. The thing about the independent segment there's been a lot of discussion around whether it's growing or not the growing, I think the way we look at it is we have significant opportunity to grow in that segment and I think if you think about the fact that there are many distributors in the industry, there's opportunities for us is to earn additional share of that business from our customers. So we're very focused on delivering the kind of things that they need which we talk about a lot of those value drivers for our customers and whether things like Sysco brand of some of the tools that were bring them help them manage their business better. In addition you mention some segments you heard us talk about some of the ethnic segments, we obviously there's been a nice tailwind in the Hispanic Latino restaurant segment, it's been a focus area for us and so we continue to look at those types of opportunities where there's nice kind of tail winds that week can provide incremental value to those folks and also grow our business.  And I just say that overall that segment feels like they're picking up some share potentially in this away from home and whether it additional opportunities for home deliveries you talk about, we here and we all see some of these trends taking place with some of these folks who are creating that opportunity for those local restaurants, and I think they are back benefiting from some of those technology solutions as well. 
Kelly Bania : Great, that's very helpful. Then in terms of deflation I think you know it was called out as one of the drivers or maybe not drivers' one of the factors that favorably impacted gross margin this year, and I think you called it out of the gross profit headwind for the first half of next year. So just curious is that just because of the sales impact or is there a change in how you expect the deflation to impact your gross margin in the first half of 2017. 
Thomas Bené: Hi Kelly, Joel will explain it to you better than I can but it's just the way you think about math. Alright so gross profit is dollars, so when you're selling a case for whatever 0.7% or 1% less than you did same time Lasher you're obviously taking fewer dollars to pay your expenses with that said from on a percentage basis so that they can contribute to an expansion of your margin for saying, I think that's really the main point I mean if you think about portion of our business is being on cost plus. And just in general they were the cost of goods, there is again some margin percentage increase but it is a tip of the headwind on the gross profit dollars themselves of course. Having said that certainly there's great work being done by Tom and his team and our associates actually offset some of that to the extent we can. 
Joel Grade: Tom made an interesting point, which I am I think our customers perspective well we're now a fan of deflation and this is -- we're now as we speak in our fifth quarter of that so that's we don't think that's particularly give thanks for our customers or for us certainly over the medium to long term with that said, if it was going to happen try came the right time for customer bases are dealing with some wage inflation as well, so it's probably been good on the customer side we've been able to manage it well, but we would certainly prefer to see no inflation, modest inflation that type of thing in a more steady state environment. 
Kelly Bania : Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Ajay Jain from Pivotal Research. Your line is open.
Ajay Jain: Bill, in you're prepared comments I think you mentioned a slowdown in traffic up from NPD and I think you cited nap crack also and I think last week case growth was also sequentially weaker slightly U.S. foods. so I just wanted to ask apart from the software industry wide trends are there any kind of company specific factors in terms of any slowdown in case growth and has there been any change in the trend line quarter-to-date in terms of traffic in average check, is there any incremental change in the trajectory a quarter-to-date, thanks. 
William DeLaney: Well, again we're talking about earnings from the June quarter, but what I'm telling you is we've seen Softening and the customer base, both from the date usage side as well as what we see, so well obviously what we're seeing here is there there's some softening in the business, as I also said we're still seeing growth and I would expect that will continue to see growth, perhaps not the same trajectory but also has a big secular development I think it's just we go through these cycles of time will tell whether so many site we're not, but if you -- if you agree all the data that we also are exposed to what you're seeing in this industry is pretty consistent, when you're seeing in the economy right now that its growth but it's modest, and I think that's where customers are dealing with right now. So our focus continues to be you know how do we support our customers to grow their business profitably and do the same for us at the same time and I've never felt better about our ability to do that, we've got a great team here a very solid strategy, we're executing well also you were going to impact and control what we can control and will work through cycles as they come and go.
Ajay Jain: Okay, and I just have one follow up question on Brakes, I think you already got several questions on Brexit. Can you specifically talk about the currency impact and just on restaurants spending overall in the UK because I guess the currency impact could be viewed as threefold you've got to direct P&L impact which is fairly you know straightforward but then the currency also impact the purchasing power of the UK consumers and it also affects your purchase price for the acquisition. so I think you're partly hedged on the currency impact, can you just comment on how big of an incremental impact there is from Brexit compared to what you anticipated, when you consummated the other merger and can you also just talk about current case trends that at Brakes, I think you mentioned that they took a little bit of a step backwards. Can you confirm whether they're positive or negative based on year-over-year comparison, thanks? 
William DeLaney: There are three questions in there; actually I think what I said about Brakes is the UK market in general. What we've seen it is as if from March and April and I was connected to Brexit the uncertainty of the Brexit vote by and instant the vote you know we see some softening over there in that market and the data in the government it will perform -- support that as well [indiscernible], the position I was to come in their numbers you just a because that -- last month but will talk more about that certainly in November when we release for the first quarter, we feel good about this show so we feel very good about this acquisition, about the leadership investing for the long term, acquisition platform all the things we said on from the beginning, so Brexit I'm going to let Joel take you through the currency issues I think we manage it quite well actually as far as the transaction goes, as you said there's normal translation of earnings and that type of thing.  And I wound up in dispute all your points I would just say from my perspective the bigger issue as far as Brexit concern is always is what it comes down to here in our markets as well, is what's the impact on the consumer. I think it's less about foreign exchange at the consumer level. And because of some of the uncertainty we see some softening over there. The weather I mean you hear all the same things whether in London you know in the summertime there kind things, so I think there's going to be some ups and downs will be the better position to talk about in November but overall we're very pleased the acquisition. We have a lot of work to do there and we're very excited about it.
Joel Grade : Yes, I would just add a couple things I mean the translation impacts again certainly will be something will be dealing as we move forward in terms of the prices also as we mention there was actually we had a foreign currency re-measurement that basically resulted from the fact that, at the end of the year, we were holding strong on our balance sheet for the purchase price. Of course, the deal closed right after the year, so we had -- the balance sheet needs to be revalued to the exchange rate that exists at that point in time. Our team did a great job of hedging to protect us on the upside and purchasing currency opportunistically to maximize our ability to minimize that foreign exchange devaluation. But we did experience some of that, and some of which was also reflected in the end purchase price. But overall, again, I would just tell you we'll continue to manage through that stuff and, as Bill said, continue to focus on driving -- focus on the customers and the operational performance of that company.
Ajay Jain: Great, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short from Barclays. Your line is open.
Karen Short: Hi, just going back -- sorry to harp on this softness -- recent softness question. I guess if you had to fill -- kind of rank potential causes, I mean, I would think value equation maybe being out of whack is on the list, but maybe recent unrest, terrorism domestically, Olympics, people staying home…any way you can kind of rank any of that?
William Delaney: I don't know that I'd rank any of that in my top three, but Karen, I'll share a view[ph part 14 1;29] on some of that. You know, we read a lot and try to learn as much as we can from folks that follow all the components of the industry. I just think it's a little bit of a malaise. I just think it's -- you know, you're going to have these cycles and sub-cycles in any point in time, and some of it, we've been going up against some stronger numbers a year ago, so there's some math in it. But it just feels a little bit softer out there. I think people are being a little more cautious with their spend. Maybe the election, maybe -- I'm not sure.  So I guess I wouldn't want to just conjecture here, but I don't think it's the Olympics, I don't think it's any one thing in particular. I just think it's a little softer and it seems to be showing up in multiple places, so I don't think it's a certain type of customer per se or anything like that. I just think it's one of these sub-cycles we're going to go through and time will tell whether it's a three- to six-month deal or longer. But again, from our perspective, we've been managing through some pretty significant headwinds this year, and I couldn't be more pleased with how we've been executing. So, again, we can't totally control the industry top line, but I feel good about what we're doing in our space and how we're driving earnings and at the same time, staying very close to our customers and focusing on what's important to them. So that's the best I can probably give you from our stance.
Karen Short: Okay, that's helpful. And then I'm just curious. One of your competitors recently gave some data on percent of sales from independent restaurants coming from an e-commerce platform -- from their e-commerce platform: at a pretty high 50%. I guess I'm just wondering if you can give some color on where you stand on local penetration as a percent of independent sales and just an update on where you're at with that.
William Delaney: I'll let Tom speak to that more specifically. I would just remind you that our strategy is really predicated on being the most valued, trusted business partner. So we're not setting goals per se for certain percentage of Sysco brand or certain percentage of orders through mobile or digital. With that said, we certainly understand that we need to make the experience with Sysco as easy as possible and certainly, being able to order online when you want to order, the way you want to order, that those are very important and increasingly important to our customers. So we've got a lot of good work going on with our digital platform to make that experience a more positive one and a productive one for our customers. So our numbers are modest but they're beginning to grow but, again, the overall target is here, is to drive the business in the right way, it's not necessarily to hit a particular percentage. Go ahead.
Thomas Bené: So Karen, I'll just build a little bit on that. I think in the past, we've talked about we've been somewhat in this kind of high, single-digit just below 10% through the fourth quarter. Now we're seeing over 10% of our orders for these local customers coming through this mobile or digital platform. So we do see some progression continue to happen, but as Bill said, it's really for us about creating the environment where they can order how they want, when they want, and where they want. And so there were also a few tools we needed to build to be able get in place, to enable them to do that more effectively. And we've got some of those tools now in place, and that we believe we'll continue to see that number grow as more customers have that interest. But we also know from a lot of the work we do that our marketing associates are one of the most highest valued resources we have and that we provide our customers. So we're trying to make sure that we balance the how they order with the service and support they need to get day in and day out from our selling resources. So we feel good about the progress but certainly we'll probably see that continue to grow, but we're very focused on the overall customer experience and letting them choose.
Karen Short: Great, thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wiltamuth from Jefferies. Your line is open.
Mark Wiltamuth: Hi, thank you. Can you give us a little color on the deflation by category, and are there certain quarters where you're going to start lapping at some of the bigger headwinds?
William Delaney: We're lapping them, so it's started. I think generally it's in the meat, seafood, and some dairy. Joel, is that about right?
Joel Grade: That's correct.
Mark Wiltamuth: So is the deflation cooling for you now or is it still as heavy? I mean, it's a pretty big deflationary number this quarter.
William Delaney: Yes, I'd say it's moved around a bit these last three quarters but I'd say relatively steady from where we were half a year ago, six months ago.
Mark Wiltamuth: Okay. And just to get into the softening of the backdrop a little bit. I wanted to get your thoughts on restaurant store growth out there. Because a lot of the health indicators you're looking at are same-store sales measures, so I'm curious: Do you think there's over-storing going on out there as part of the problem? And what's been your percentage of business from new stores over the last several years?
William Delaney: You know, Mark, I think when you go back to 2009, 2010, clearly there was oversupply and overcapacity, and I think there's been a pretty good correction since that time. I believe we've seen some modest reduction in restaurants -- number of restaurants here over the last year or so. But nothing to the degree we saw for or five years ago. There may be a little bit of a modest correction, but I don't think that's an overriding issue, I think it's somewhat self-correcting. We don't really track our sales to new stores. The way we track them, Mark, is we track new business for us, which is make an account to an operator that we didn't sell a year ago this time, and we track watch business, which is just the opposite where we had a sale a year ago and we don't have any. And then we track penetration. So the softening, if you will, is probably showing up a little bit more on the case penetration side right now.
Mark Wiltamuth: Okay. And do you think the strength you've had in local is enough to kind of overpower some of the broader industry softening?
William Delaney: I feel very good about our three-year plan and I feel very good about how we're executing the business and if that's your question -- the bottom line is we feel good about the momentum we have, we feel really good about the year we just passed. And, if it is a little softer, we've got good things going out. We're handling expenses very hard right now and we're very committed to the plan.
Mark Wiltamuth: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Stephen Grambling: Good morning. Thanks for sneaking me in, a couple of follow-ups to earlier questions. I guess, first, related to -- I had a question on EBIT growth targets. I think you had previously looked for 55% to 65% of the goal coming from gross profit and the remainder in supply chain and administrative costs. As you think about the better execution driving the upside, where you think that has impacted those buckets most and where is the biggest opportunity going forward?
William Delaney: Stephen, I think both those lines are critical lines, but certainly you have to start with gross profit. I mean, we make $9 billion in gross profit. That's more than the sales of many, many of the people we compete with head to head. So that's a huge number that we've been able to grow very nicely on an adjusted basis over the last year to two years. And how do we do that? It comes back to the levers we've talked about. Case growth, with a particular emphasis on local case growth, managing the margins, utilizing a lot of the tools, many of which are technology-based today, and taking a good hard look at where our potential is in terms of territories within each district, within each opco.  So assessing the opportunity for growth by territory, by district, by opco; taking advantage of some of the revenue management tools that Tom and his team are -- have put in place over the last year and are just now beginning to mature; continuing to utilize the category management process, both from leveraging our spend but also bringing innovation to that product; staying close to our customers, refining our customer insight where -- to be as current as we possibly can in terms of what the needs of those operators are as they face the challenges, so you have to start with gross profit and the ability to grow those dollars, and we've done a nice job there and I expect us to continue to do well. With that said, as I said in terms of the pillars of our strategy, we need to be more productive in everything we do. And we set some goals out there and certainly running the business at a flat cost per case for yet another year here is a very appropriate yet aggressive goal and it's going to be paramount for us to have success this year to do that. So we've got some good momentum there in the supply chain. We're managing our SG&A very well. So I feel very good about our corporate spend as well.  We're still spending some money in business technology to kind of create those tools that we've been talking about here in particular on the commercial side. So I think we're spending the money in the right place. Over time, we'll continue to flatten out that corporate spend, try to keep the flat cost per case flat in the field. And that combination of good, solid gross profit growth and well-managed expenses should serve us very well.
Joel Grade: I think that one thing I would just add to that even -- if you think about the model and how we looked at that spread between gross profit dollars and operating expense dollars, I think one of the things that we remain focused on is that delta between those two. So even in times when we've had some impact of deflation on the gross profit dollars, again, we've continued to focus on driving the expenses to where we look at that spread. And on a year-to-date basis, we're up a little over 1.5% in terms of that delta between those two. And so the only other thing I may call out is just that to think about -- because that's certainly the way we think about that. And again, whether deflation goes up or down, that relative spread between the two is certainly a key part of our model and something we've done really well on the point Bill has made.
William Delaney: Yes, and I think the difference in this conversation we're having today versus three, four, five years ago is what I spoke to in terms of the foundation that we've built with a lot of our transformative work, a lot of the initiatives that we put in place. We have tools today, we have structure, we have the right people to do this. It's not easy, it's still a very competitive environment out there, but we're in much better position today to accomplish these things than we were five years ago.
Stephen Grambling: Thanks. And within that, you talked about the good work on the digital platform. Where do you think your systems are relative to peers and does this shift away from SAP changeability to implement some of these tools? Thanks.
William Delaney: Well, clearly a big part of our ongoing strategy here was to reallocate what we call our business technology spend more to the customer-facing side of the business. So I think the direction is right, the spend is right, we've making good strides. But we've got some work to do to get the -- not just the digital platform but all the tools we use behind the scenes, both to operate the business and to assess the performance of the business. We still have some good work to do here to improve and that'll be a perpetual opportunity. So good work to do, but I think strategically we're spending the money in the right place and we'll continue to invest appropriately in that part of our business.
Stephen Grambling: Thanks so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Sinisi from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Vincent Sinisi: Great, thanks very much. And nice end to the year, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the M&A landscape and in particular, with your more of an entry into the fresh and the ethnic products, Trinity, North Star, to name a couple this year. Just kind of how you feel your traction's going where you are from an assortment standpoint and how that factors into your thoughts as you look at any potential further opportunities going forward.
William Delaney: I think over the last several years, we've done a lot with specialty meats, specialty produce, gas supply. In terms of bringing those businesses into our company, they're now what we think of as core. Five or ten years ago, they would have been adjacencies. So certainly we've got the foundation there as well and what you've seen here over the last three to five years is we're integrating it much better. I'll let Tom speak a little more specifically, but there's still opportunity out there, particularly on the geographic side, I think, where we have some holes we'd love to fill in geographically but good momentum with the recent acquisitions.
Thomas Bené: I think I'll just add that as Bill said, we really view those specialty areas now as more than a quarter of our business and I think our ability to round that portfolio businesses out across the U.S., we'll create those opportunities like with North Star in Florida. And so we'll continue to look for those opportunities as they come up, but I believe that's an important part of our growth. This whole fresh, the local, those that you've been hearing about and seeing out there are something that we are very focused on through both our produce and specialty meat and seafood companies.
Vincent Sinisi: Okay, great. Thanks, guys. Maybe just a superfast follow-up here. On the ERP, the 12 that are being converted back to the enhanced ERP systems. I think you were at kind of the first, second one a couple months ago. Just a quick update there. Where you are in that process?
William DeLaney: Yes, it's a 12-month process and we've done one of them very well and around schedule. So we're in a good place.
Vincent Sinisi: All right, great. Thanks, Bill.
William DeLaney: Thank you.
Operator: And we have time for one last question. And our last question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
John Ivankoe: Hi, great, thank you. Obviously you ended the year at a gross margin high for the year and it's actually one of your highest gross margins that you've had in many year. So when we think about fiscal '17, is the right run rate of cost of goods sold or gross margins, is it the fourth quarter or should we still consider that we can -- that year-on-year might play an effect as oppose to taking just that fourth quarter result and running that forward?
William DeLaney: I would never take one quarter and extrapolate too much John. I think you look at the year, you look at the trends, you look at the environment that we just described and obviously we have plans to grow the gross profit and manage the expenses very well but I wouldn't try anything off in one quarter, good or bad.
John Ivankoe: And are you at the level when you do look at that percent where you're kind of in a competitively good place where it's a good gross margin for you and in terms of the relative value that you're customers are getting and how you're competition is competing against you? In other words, is there any risk like we've seen in previous periods that some of your competition starts to ease their gross margin in an effort to gain traffic share?
William DeLaney: I can't speak for that. I mean as I've said, I think for a long, long time; it's a very competitive environment out there. There is a lot of sales people out there in the street and lot of very sophisticated customer, so pricing is always going to be a key part of how customers look at value. I think what you've heard Tom say, as we look at revenue management in which pricing is a component, but nothing more than a component, we're getting better in terms of strategically and tactically facing up with each customer one-on-one and really understanding what is key for them but we have the tools that make sure we're highly competitive in their key items but also where there is opportunities in growth. So when you look at our economic model, it's really about having the right price for the right item and the right day for that customer for the street business and remain very competitive with our contract customers. And to do that you need to continue to take cost out and become more efficient. So I wouldn't say that there is anything in particular going on right now that's different than what we've experienced sort of last two or three years. And I wouldn't -- and I also think we still have opportunity to be more consistent in our pricing and that should be a win for our customers and win for us.
John Ivankoe: Very helpful, thank you.
William DeLaney: Thank you.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you so much for joining us today. You may now disconnect your lines.

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Bill DeLaney.
William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Neil, and good morning, everyone. This morning Sysco reported strong third quarter financial results. Our performance reflects both the commitment of our 52,000 associates to supporting the success of our customers and the improving execution of our strategy and three-year plan initiatives. During the quarter Sysco delivered sales growth of 2% and gross profit dollar growth of 4% while limiting adjusted operating expense growth to 1.5%, which resulted in adjusted operating income growth of $60 million or 16% compared to the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share grew 15% to $0.46 per share. These results were achieved with the benefit of favorable weather conditions and an earlier Easter holiday compared to the prior-year third quarter. Consumer confidence data points, while still favorable compared to a few years ago, were somewhat uneven and tracked the volatile financial market activity quite closely. Lower fuel prices were likely a net positive, as the impact of consumer spending benefits and reduced delivery costs offset to some degree the economic slowdown we are experiencing in energy-driven economies in certain parts of Texas and in Montana, North Dakota, and Alberta Canada. Turning to specific restaurant industry data, the overall sales trends remain mixed. According to the National Restaurant Association, restaurant sales have been uneven during the first three months of 2016 after steadily rising throughout 2015. Both NPD and KNAPP-TRACK have also shown recent traffic and sales declines. However, even with this recent shopping industry performance, the overall trend remains generally favorable for our customers, as illustrated by the U.S. Census Bureau sales data for the quarter rising 1% above the prior quarter, representing the 11th consecutive quarter of restaurant sales growth. Moving to our results for the first three quarters of fiscal 2016, I'm very pleased with the increasing momentum in our business. For the nine-month period ending in March, we delivered the following results. Total broadline cases grew 3.3% and local cases grew 2.9%. Sales were up 1.2% despite being adversely impacted by both deflation and foreign exchange headwinds. Gross profit dollars grew 3.3% and gross margin increased 35 basis points. Adjusted operating income increased $100 million or about 8% compared to the prior year, and adjusted earnings per share grew approximately 10%. These results are in line with our three-year planned financial objectives, to grow adjusted operating income by at least $500 million and to grow earnings per share faster than operating income. Our progress towards the achievement of these financial objectives is being driven by focusing on the following four key levers: accelerating local case growth; improving gross margin; leveraging supply chain costs; and reducing administrative costs. Regarding the reduction of administrative costs, we recently began to implement a workforce reduction of approximately 1,200 positions. We've taken a very thoughtful approach to this difficult process by focusing on prioritizing all existing work more effectively, reducing layers of management, and expanding spans of control. We believe our approach will allow us to continue supporting our customers with a high level of service, as evidenced by the fact that we are not reducing the number of marketing associates or warehouse and delivery associates who directly support our customers. During the quarter we also announced our proposed acquisition of the Brakes Group, a $5 billion European foodservice distributor with significant presence in the United Kingdom, France, and Sweden. We're very excited about this opportunity as we will inherit an excellent leadership team, a business whose customer-centric strategy and culture is very similar to Sysco's, and 15,000 highly capable associates. We expect this acquisition will provide a solid trajectory of EBITDA growth over time and excellent platform for further acquisitions in Europe. Equally important, this transaction will not distract us from driving out our three-year plan in our existing business. We continue to target a June or July closing. As we enter the final quarter of our fiscal year, we are executing our strategy at a high level. We have delivered consistent local case growth for the past two years, expanded gross margins for four consecutive quarters, reduced adjusted cost per case in the field, and put plans into place that will reduce administrative expenses. These actions and related results reinforce our confidence in our ability to achieve our business and financial objectives as we move forward. And now I'll turn the call over to Tom.
Thomas L. Bené - President & Chief Operating Officer: Thank you, Bill, and good morning. I'll begin my remarks regarding the third quarter by providing an update on some of the initiatives related to our three-year plan and how they've continued to positively impact our business results. As we have mentioned a few times before, our insights-based approach to understanding, meeting our customer's needs, continues to guide our efforts and is clearly driving improved performance. For example, during the third quarter, our U.S. broadline operations delivered case growth of 3.6%, including local case growth of 3.4%, gross profit dollar growth of 4.8%, including an improvement in margin of 39 basis points. And for operating expense, we reduced our adjusted cost per case by $0.08, or $0.03 on a neutral fuel price basis. And we had operating income growth of 11.5%. We are driving increased case growth through a variety of sales and marketing initiatives that are designed to deliver value to our customers while providing a more consistent experience of doing business with Sysco. I'm pleased to report that the third quarter represents the eighth straight quarter of local case growth. As you know, improving gross margin is another key driver of Sysco achieving our three-year targets. And our strong performance this quarter indicates that we are making progress towards delivering our long-term objectives. During the quarter, we delivered solid growth in key center of plate categories such as beef, pork, and poultry. And we continued our growth in produce, reinforcing the benefits driven from a focus on fresh. We also saw a solid increase of more than 50 basis points in Sysco brand sales with our local customers. These efforts combined with other initiatives such as our ongoing work in category and revenue management as well as the impact of deflation contributed to an increase in U.S. broadline gross margin of approximately 40 basis points, the fourth quarter in a row with gross margin expansion. These improvements are especially noteworthy as we've been able to manage through the current deflationary environment fairly well due in part to our ongoing efforts to improve local case growth as a percentage of our mix as well as our continued focus on our category management process. Separately, the operating expense performance during the quarter was particularly strong. We limited total adjusted expense growth to only 1.5% despite case growth of more than 3% and, as mentioned, we reduced our overall cost per case in the U.S. broadline by $0.03 excluding the impact of fuel prices. From a supply chain perspective, we continue to make good progress towards our goals to improve overall service to our customers, while driving higher productivity in our operations through our continuous improvement process. We've also seen good progress through a series of indirect spend initiatives. And while there's still a lot more work to be done, we are seeing improved operating expense trends and we are targeting a continuation of this performance throughout the balance of the fiscal year. In conjunction with the series of initiatives to support our long-term strategy, we are implementing a new market structure that reduces the number of U.S. broadline geographic markets from eight to six, effective at the beginning of our fiscal 2017 year. Each market team will continue to be led by a market president and include key functional leaders across finance, merchandising, supply chain and human resources to provide support to our operating companies to help to drive solid execution of the various corporate initiatives. We believe that the work we've done in building the capability of the organization through the functional structure over the past two years makes this the right time for us to evolve our structure. This change will reduce overall administrative costs in the field, drive efficiency through a more standardized approach and improve execution to our customers. In conjunction with this restructuring, I'm pleased to announce the promotion of three strong Sysco leaders. Greg Bertrand has been appointed Senior Vice President, U.S. Foodservice Operations, with responsibility for all U.S. broadline operating companies. We also announced that Scott Sonnemaker has been named Senior Vice President, International Foodservice Operations, Americas, and Bill Goetz has been named Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing. These are just a few of the key priorities and changes that are positively impacting our operational and financial results. While we need continue to execute at a high level, I'm confident we are on the right path to achieve our long-term objectives. In summary, our customer and operational strategies are being executed well on the field and our headquarters teams are doing a terrific job of providing our organization with field-ready tools and processes that are enabling our success. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer
Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. We had a strong quarter led by continued momentum from improved underlying business performance, strong local case growth, particularly solid gross profit dollar growth and good cost management, achieved in an environment with continued deflation and currency headwinds. We continue to make solid progress towards our fiscal 2016 plan and our three-year goals. We grew sales in the third quarter by approximately 2% year over year, despite deflation of 0.4%. We saw continued deflation in center of the plate protein categories such as meat, seafood and poultry, as supply recovers from various events in 2015. This deflationary trend has been persistent over the past two quarters. Acquisitions increased sales by 0.9% while foreign exchange negatively impacted sales by 1% in the third quarter. U.S. dollar strength against the Canadian dollar was responsible for the vast majority of the foreign exchange impact. The negative impacts we have been experiencing on a comparative basis is lessening as we began to wrap the initial decline in relative value of the Canadian dollar. On a constant currency basis, sales would have been up 3.1%. Turning to case growth, consistent with our three-year plan to achieve disciplined case growth, we had another quarter of strong performance. Total broadline case growth for the third quarter was 3.3% and local was also 3.3%. This is the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year local case growth for the total broadline. Looking at gross profit and gross margins, we grew our gross profit at a solid 4.1%, while also continuing to see expansion in gross margins which grew by 34 basis points. The key drivers of gross margin improvement included category management, a more beneficial mix of local business, higher Sysco brand penetration in our local business and deflation. On a constant currency basis, gross profit growth was 5%. During the third quarter, we had a few certain items that impacted our results. These include restructuring costs such as charges related technology changes, severance and professional fees of $60 million and about $10 million of acquisition financing costs. On a GAAP basis, without excluding these certain items and the comparable certain items from the prior year, our operating income grew 15% and our diluted earnings per share grew about 27%. The rest of my discussion will focus on the non-GAAP or adjusted for certain items results. Adjusted operating expense grew 1.5% during the quarter and by 2.4% on a constant currency basis. This increase was mainly driven by the previously mentioned higher case volumes and incentive accruals and is partially offset by various decreases, including reducing indirect spending, reduced fuel costs and foreign exchange translation. This progress is reflected in our reduced cost per case. As a result, adjusted operating income for the third quarter was $438 million, up 16% compared to the prior year and 17% on a constant currency basis. As it relates to taxes, our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 33.6% compared to 33.9% in the prior year period. Both quarters' tax rates were positively impacted by the favorable resolution of state tax matters. Compared to the prior year, adjusted net earnings grew 10% and adjusted earnings per share grew 15%. Cash flow from operations was $1 billion for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2016, up approximately 15% from last year. Net working capital improved by about half a day during the third quarter compared to the same period last year. This was largely driven by improvements in both receivables and inventory. Net CapEx for the first 39 weeks was $348 million and free cash flow was $641 million. Both cash flow from operations and free cash flow include the cash impact of certain items of $272 million in fiscal 2016 and $128 million in fiscal 2015. As a reminder, the certain items for 2016 are mostly related to the termination of the proposed merger with US Foods, and for 2015 include items related to the planning of the merger integration. Excluding the cash impact of certain items from both years, cash flow from operations grew $273 million and free cash flow grew $346 million. Now I'd like to close with some commentary on the remainder of the fiscal year. First, we're currently on track to hit our fiscal 2016 financial objectives. Second, we expect deflation to persist for at least another quarter. Third, we had a relatively strong fourth quarter last year, which will make fourth quarter comparisons this year more challenging. And, finally, we now expect CapEx for fiscal year to be approximately $500 million or approximately 1% of sales. During the quarter, we also completed a successful debt offering, the proceeds of which are to be used for the acquisition of Brakes that Bill mentioned earlier. The very attractive coupons associated with this financing, approximately 3% on a weighted average basis, represents both the strength of our balance sheet as well as impressive work by our team throughout the process. In addition, Sysco put in place hedges during the quarter that protect approximately half of the purchase price over the Brakes transaction against unfavorable movements and foreign exchange rates. In summary, we had a strong quarter led by continued momentum from improved underlying business performance, strong local case growth, solid gross profit dollar growth and good cost management. That said, we have more work to do in order to achieve the financial objectives for our three-year plan. We are committed to serving our customers and delivering a higher level of execution in all areas of our business that will improve our financial performance in both the near and long-term. I feel confident in our ability to achieve the financial objectives of our three-year plan and we will aggressively continue to look for incremental opportunities to exceed our goals. Operator, we're now ready for Q&A.
Operator: The first question comes from the line of Kelly Bania from BMO Capital. Your line is now open.
Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a nice quarter here. Just curious if you could talk about the local case growth; continues to accelerate. Maybe just, if you can, provide some historical perspective on when the last time it was this strong. Are you seeing it in both comp restaurant growth or new independent local customers coming into the mix? And then in terms of the private label penetration with that local segment, where do you think you can take that longer term?
William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Kelly, it's Bill. I'll start and I'll let Tom give you a little bit more color. I think in terms of historical context, this is by far the strongest quarter we've had over the last four or five years. And that's very encouraging and certainly something that is bringing the momentum of the business that both Tom and Joel talked about. So in terms of where it's coming from, I think it's the same answer as I would give you if you had asked about margin or even expenses at this point. It's coming from a lot of good work over the last few years on the commercial side of the business that Tom can give you a little more color on, and really good alignment I think with our leadership team throughout Sysco. And I would say this particular quarter, we acknowledged it, there were some tailwinds. And I don't like to talk about weather a lot. I think that the last two third quarters we've talked about weather. Two years ago we had a brutal winter at the beginning of the winter, and last year I think it was at the end of winter, and this year was a pretty mild winter. So I think that helped a little bit. With that said, I think I was also trying to get out there that the data out there right now is a little bit mixed in terms of overall industry growth. So I think we had some tailwinds that we took advantage of. But more than anything, I think it's more and more good execution of key initiatives (22:32) the commercial side over the last three, four years. On the brand – and I'll kick it to Tom real quick – these things tend to go together. When you're growing your business, you're creating differentiation at the customer level, and that's what the brand allows us to do. And so we've brought renewed focus on the brand over the last three years in conjunction with our category management work. And I think we're doing it the right way. And I don't know, we're not really chasing a number here, Kelly. I think what we're saying is the key to all of this is really growing those local cases. And as we do that, we should be able to grow the brand. I don't know that there's a particular percentage that we're trying to get to other than to utilize the brand as a way to differentiate ourselves more effectively. And let me kick it to Tom here and give you a little more color on that.
Thomas L. Bené - President & Chief Operating Officer: Thanks, Bill. And I won't repeat a lot of what Bill said because I think he hit pretty clearly on what the key drivers are. Let me just add on the local case growth. You had asked about current customers and new customers. We spend a fair amount of time looking at what we call new sales, lost sales, and then penetration. And think about that as new customers, any customers that we may have lost some business at or where we've done a better job of selling more to those customers. And I would tell you that all of those metrics continue to head in the right direction as it relates to our local customers, meaning our new sales continue to be very strong. Our lost sales have declined a little bit over the past couple of quarters. And our penetration sales, which is what is delivering more to those current customers, has also been increasing. And that's a key metric for us because that tells us that we're improving in all those areas with our customers, our current customers, and making sure that we're continuing to satisfy their needs. So we feel good about all those metrics and where the business is heading. And then lastly, on the Sysco brand, the only thing I'd add to what Bill said is our focus – a lot of the category management focus is in fact driven towards that local customer. And based on that, the more we bring them differentiated solutions – we've talked about innovation in the last couple of quarters – is when we're bringing them new news and innovation, that actually helps us grow our Sysco brand because generally those products are in the Sysco brand lineup. So I think as Bill said, they go hand in hand, and I think this continued focus by us in bringing new and differentiated products to our customers is helping us grow that. And I would agree with Bill, we don't have a number per se that we're targeting. We know that it's important, and we continue to focus on it quarter-in and quarter-out.
Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Wolf from BB&T. Your line is now open.
Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets: Great, thanks and congratulations on the quarter. Bill, I just wanted to ask you on the sales count, the MAs [Marketing Associates] up and down the street. Is that up sequentially or year over year a little bit, or is the organization driving the good local penetration and general growth with the same head count on the sales side?
William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director: It's roughly the same. I think the mix is a little different. We've put a lot of trainees over the last year and that's begun to level out. Tom, do you got anything?
Thomas L. Bené - President & Chief Operating Officer: No, I think that's the big change. Our base MAs were very much flat versus the past year and this quarter. Actually because we've got good retention with our marketing associates, we're down a little bit in the number of trainees that we have out there because we just aren't using as many in the pipeline. But overall, we're driving these sales with our existing sales force.
William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director: The reason it can be flat, Andy, is because of some of the work that we've done over the last two or three years with the CRM tool, with some things we're doing in terms of territory management to be more rifle-like in terms of going after the business, and that will continue to be a point of emphasis in our sales strategy.
Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets: Okay, that's an encouraging change, I think, from the way the business has historically operated. Do you think going forward, if you wanted to continue to keep this momentum going forward, you can at least leverage sales, get case growth, local case growth, in a multiple of – it sounds like you can. I just want to confirm how you think about that. It used to be a one-to-one relationship between sales head count and internal sales growth. It sounds like you've actually gotten to a point where maybe it's a lot better than that.
William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think it's a little better than that. I think you'll continue to see that.
Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets: And the other question I just want is for Joel. On the $59 million net total restructuring costs, can you just tell us how much of that was accelerated depreciation related to SAP or anything else?
Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I would say maybe about a quarter of that was, I think even a little less than that. There was a part of that that was – it's that stuff then what I'll call a one-time write-off of projects that were in process that were associated with the SAP conversion at the time when that decision was made. We took a one-time charge on some of those. Again, it was split up for the most part between, again, the one-time write-off which was quite a bit higher than the accelerated...
Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets: Okay.
Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: ...depreciation, and then again, a couple other severance-related costs that are part of a certain item.
Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets: Okay. So the project costs didn't go through accelerated depreciation just the one quarter of that, that's it?
Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: That's right. Then something you'll see in the third quarter, not part of the accelerated depreciation, that was a one-time write-off of project costs that were again associated with the SAP.
Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets: Okay. Because if you – yeah, so we should take about $15 million or so off of the D&A just to get to sort of a normalized D&A for the quarter? That's what I'm really trying to get to.
Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: That's probably a reasonable ballpark, Andy.
Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel from Guggenheim. Your line is now open.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC: So really looking at the change in the org structure, the eight to six markets, what changes does that necessitate for the levels below them right down into really out to the op companies? What are they going to have to do differently? Where do you think you pick up execution benefits? And do you think this is kind of the structure we're going to have going forward? Or do you think you'll play around with it a little bit more and look for some more efficiency?
William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think, John – good morning. It's, again, the structure hasn't changed, all we've done really is consolidate it from eight to six. When we went to the structure, the structure's really evolved over the last few years. But when we went to the functional structure a couple years ago, we felt eight was important. There's a lot of ramp-up work and change management work to do when you put this type of structure in place and you've never had it before. We just feel today that in conjunction with everything else that it's a good metaphor, if you will, for – I talk about in the expenses where we can spread our top people a little bit further. We're further along in a lot of our transformative work. And we just felt that we can run the business very well with six. And it impacts not just the market presence, but all the functional leads as well in the four areas. But it really doesn't change that much at all, if anything, at the operating company level. Tom, do you want to -?
Thomas L. Bené - President & Chief Operating Officer: The only thing that it adds is a little more geography for each of the markets, which means a couple more operating companies that report into that market level. As Bill said, the reason we're confident now is we've had enough time with this structure and the functional leadership that we feel like we're driving out consistency across the business and a few more operating companies for each market is not going be a challenge for them. I think that's the only other thing I'd add is this we're very focused on a consistent design. And what I mean by that is both at the market, but also at the operating company and trying to drive a little more consistency which we believe will improve execution and we've seen that so far and we also believe that we'll create a better customer experience because it will be more consistent market-to-market and operating company to operating company.
William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Look, John, I think we'll continue to tweak things to Tom's point. But this structure we really believe is vital and I think it's been a key part of the beginning of the momentum that you're seeing here over the last several quarters. So I wouldn't expect this structure to change. These are $5 billion and $6 billion markets. So when you think about that, it requires a fair amount of focus between the corporate center and that opco, and so we think we've got it about right here at six.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC: And then maybe for Tom, where are we now with the revenue management organization? How much of the benefit are we now starting to see flow through? And where do you think the biggest opportunity is if you think about the next 12 months to 18 months? And I guess both margin and case growth do impact either one.
Thomas L. Bené - President & Chief Operating Officer: So great question. So we now, literally last week, had our training for our last dozen operating companies. So basically by the end of the fiscal as we've said, we'll be fully up and running, meaning a revenue manager in every operating company and the market structure that's been in place now for a quarter will be fully operational. So what we continue to believe is that by leveraging that organization and creating a more standardized set of what I'd call routines and they've partnered nicely with our business technology team in creating some tools for these folks to really focus on ensuring that the product costs in a market is competitive and consistent. And we believe that by leveraging those routines and some of those tools out there that we're going continue to see some benefit on the margin side. It's really there as a support or enabler for cases, it's not a driver of case growth per se, other than ensuring that we've got the right market pricing in place. So we feel good about where we're at. I'm not in a point where I'm looking to peg a number for you, but I think we feel good about the work that's been done and we're continuing to scale it across the organization.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the lean of Vincent Sinisi from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, great, thanks very much for taking my question. Good morning, guys. So I just wanted to ask also for an update on the ERP rollout? I know a couple months back you folks had mentioned a bit of a different approach to that, just wondering if you can give us all an update there?
William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Vinnie. There's not a lot to report there. It's just been a couple months as you point out. So we're putting together plans, there's 12 opcos that we're going to bring back to this enhanced SaaS platform and we're going to start with one company here in the next couple months. But we're on target from a planning standpoint. We've put the teams in place and got great coordination between the operating side of the business and the BT side as well as shared services. So early days, but still very committed and on track.
Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, great. Thank you. And then, just as a follow-up, maybe just going back to your private brand sales that had a nice increase this quarter. I know you mentioned obviously about the independent customer growth volumes coming through. But just in terms of categories that you are seeing, kind of where do you think maybe some of the most opportunity is there? Any expansion plans from the private brands in general? Maybe kind of where you see the bigger changes by our product standpoint?
Thomas L. Bené - President & Chief Operating Officer: This is Tom. I'm not sure there's necessarily any big changes by product category. It's a fairly developed side of our business. And so what I think it allows us to do is, as we introduce new products through the innovation pipeline, most of those are Sysco brand. So that is maybe one new focus area. And I wouldn't say that's necessarily in any specific category. I think the only other thing I'd say is that a lot of what we do in the produce space, and you've heard me talk about the produce growth and this focus on fresh, is in Sysco brand as well. And that, certainly, that continued focus there, that growth that we're seeing in some of those areas are also driving some of the Sysco brand momentum.
Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks very much, Tom.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just the first on the trajectory of margins, you had the single best EBIT growth I think in over about a decade. As we think about deflation moderating and inflation potentially coming back next year, how should we be thinking about the recent level of top line flow-through, particularly if you see case growth come back on the whole?
William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Stephen. First of all, I wish I could tell you when we were going to cross over between deflation and inflation as we were pretty cautious in our comments. So I think we said that we expect it to last at least another quarter, it could be longer than that based on what we're seeing. And so I'm not really sure when to make that call. As far as your question goes, it's one of those great questions that's hard to answer, even whether I'm looking back or looking forward. But I think if you go back and look at some of the things that we've said over the last several months and putting the three-year plan together, our hope here would be, when we can return to a more moderate inflation environment, that we would grow the cases and at least hold margin flat, maybe grow it a little bit. And that's the plan and that's going to take a lot of cohesive execution which we're quite confident in right now between cap man Tom spoken to rev man here a little bit ago, and continue to grow those local cases. So the key is the local cases and the mix, we need to grow both our local and corporate managed cases, so kind of have that in the right ratio. That will help us on the brand penetration. And if we do that, I think we'll be able to manage our margins well.
Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great, thanks. And then as a quick follow-up for Joel, when you say that you're going to be lapping this tougher fourth quarter, I guess, is that primarily focused on just the margin? Is there something else that we should be aware of as it relates to top line comparisons? Thanks.
Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: No, I think you've hit it. And then, again, we had a pretty decent operating income quarter as well in Q4 of last year. So I think we're just calling out that the comparison for this quarter in particular is a bit tougher than we've had over the last three.
Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got you. Thanks so much. I'll jump back in the queue.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi, guys. Congratulations on a great quarter.
William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay.
Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Question for you just from a top line perspective, obviously, a lot of good strong momentum here in broadline's case growth. Can you maybe just talk about sort of like where you are within sort of like the runway here, whether it's penetration with existing customers, private brand in general and even new channels? There hasn't been that much talk about areas like retail, for instance, which I know is something that's newer for you and maybe the opportunity that you see there. So I'm just trying to figure out sort of like the sustainability of the momentum that you're seeing today.
William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Let me start. I think, again, on the momentum part of it, it was a really, really nice quarter and we did a lot of good things and benefited from that. I think from an external standpoint, there were some tailwinds that I don't think you can plan on every quarter in terms of some of the favorable weather comparisons and that kind of thing. And we may be seeing a little bit of a softening out there right now in terms of what we're seeing in our business and the industry. So I think there's the external aspect of that. We can't do much to manage that. But I think, obviously, we're managing within that environment very well right now and we expect to continue to do that. I'll get to your question here in a second. The key, I really think is what Tom spoke to earlier in the earlier question, in terms of sustainability, it has to come from the book of business that we have today in terms of our ability to do that. So certainly our ability to continue to fill a pipeline with quality new account business and that may come from different segments to your point. We are doing some things on the retail side. We have talked a fair amount about some good work we've done over the last couple years on the ethnic side and particularly Hispanic. We have some more opportunity there beyond Hispanic and within Hispanic. The whole area of fresh and organic is an area that provides a lot of opportunities. So whether it's customer segments, product segments, trends in the industry, those are all opportunities for us that we are exploring and beginning to get some traction. With that said, for us to sustain what we've put up here over the last several quarters and, in particular this quarter, we need to continue to penetrate with our existing accounts that's the most profitable business for us, bring in some new accounts from that quality pipeline and do a little bit better and, we're starting to, in terms of our customer retention. So we need to do all of those things and the good news is we are doing those things right now. So I wouldn't overreact to one quarter or another, but when you look at the year-to-date numbers, those are well within the range of what we've targeted for the three years and we remained quite confident that we can deliver that.
Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Just one follow-up for you on something that's quietly becoming a bigger part of your story I guess. So if you look at your free cash flow year to date, just reported-wise to something like 50%, I think based upon what Joel was talking about it, maybe it's up more. But you've obviously had good EBITDA growth, CapEx now trending below your forecast. Can you maybe just talk about where the free cash flow and the CapEx sits within what you're focusing on in terms of improvement within that three-year forecast and what we should be expecting going forward?
William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director: That's great trepidation. Let me start and Joel will give you his color on it. One of the things we're very careful about and meticulous about in terms of the three-year plan was to lock in two or three key objectives that we have financially that we thought would resonate with our investors and potential investors based upon feedback that we've gotten. So we locked in operating income growth, and we also acknowledged that we would expect to grow our EPS somewhat faster over that three-year period than the operating income growth. And we locked in our return on invested capital, and we set a goal out there for 15%. Now obviously, that was before the Brakes deal. But we're on track today within the business as it sits today, Ed, to hit or slightly surpass the 15%. Once we close on the Brakes deal, we'll be able to bring that in and give you some color on the impact of that. But we are very, very focused on the return on invested capital. And, obviously, they come together, to your point, in terms of free cash flow and EBITDA growth. So we don't have a particular delta target, if you will, for EBITDA growth or free cash flow right now, but it's been strong here for some time and I would expect it to continue to be strong. And in terms of how we're going invest it, I think you'll continue to see us invested in the business. You're right, we're a little under where we thought we would be our CapEx this year. I think Joel commented that we expect to be around $500 million for the year, which is about 1%. In any given year, that could go up or down a little bit based on timing. But I think that 1%, maybe slightly more every now and then, is what you should expect there. And we're going to continue to – obviously, we're going to be very focused on assimilating Brakes in the right way and even more focused on continuing to run the business here as we've laid out. So bottom line is I think you'll continue to see us invest in the business, about 1% CapEx, increase the dividend modestly, probably not quite as fast as the earnings go up, continue to look for good acquisitions, and opportunistically look at buying back shares. Joel, do you want to...
Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Zack Fadem from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Zachary Fadem - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hey, good morning, guys. You called out some of the fresh categories in your prepared remarks as specifically produce and proteins. It seems these categories tend to have more specialty competition, particularly for local customers. First of all, would you agree that fresh is an area that you're taking share? And I'm curious how you think about this as a longer-term opportunity, just given your scale versus the specialty mom-and-pops.
Thomas L. Bené - President & Chief Operating Officer: Why don't I jump in? First of all, it's hard to tell whether we're taking share, but we're certainly seeing good growth in these areas. So as you I think know, we have our own specialty companies in these areas, FreshPoint on the produce side, and also a variety of specialty meat companies across the enterprise. But we're very focused on these categories, and I don't think it's necessarily a new thing for Sysco. But what we know is if we can perform well for our customers in these maybe more challenging categories at times of delivering fresh meat and produce, then that allows us to do the other things also and also do them well. And so we've had a focus on quality and making sure that we've always got the right products out there. We've got a great program in place through our Sysco brand around traceability, which is also very important. So we definitely believe that even as large as we are, we're able to compete in this space. And we're continuing to focus on how we can be better every day for our customers. And so I think we feel good about our performance to date and feel like we can continue to grow in this area, but it's an ongoing day-to-day management of that business to be successful.
Zachary Fadem - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Got you. And just with the volatile inflationary environment right now, can you talk a little bit about pricing guard rails for your MAs? How much autonomy do they have on pricing? And can you talk a little bit about just your approach, to the extent you can, to ensure that you aren't leaving money on the table, yet still being competitive on price?
William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director: What I'd say is that we still believe in pricing is local in this business for local customers. And so while they have some autonomy through our revenue management work, we're continuing to do a much better job of giving them tools and process to ensure that we're competitive locally but that we're also managing the business. So I would say we continue to believe it's important for them to have that flexibility for our customers. We want to make sure we're competitive on the street each and every day. And we're trying to create the environment where we're doing that together, meaning the salesperson and the company with both customers and our objectives in mind.
Zachary Fadem - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Got it, thanks for the color.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ajay Jain from Pivotal Research. Your line is now open.
Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC: Hi, thanks for the question. I mainly wanted to get some clarification on your outlook for the operating expenses in the fourth quarter and for fiscal 2017. So is $70 million still the right number based on your guidance for this year for total charges? And if that is the right number, am I right in assuming that you're looking at $10 million or $11 million in fourth quarter charges? And then the same question for fiscal 2017, are you still looking at, I think it was $130 million in charges for next year?
Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: This is Joel. We've talked about when we talked about the couple recent announcements that we've had that we anticipated around $70 million for this year and around $130 million for next year. Those estimates still hold. So I don't know if that answered your question, but the numbers that we talked about earlier, we still feel good about in terms of as we look forward.
Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC: Okay. And the severance is on top of those numbers. Is that correct?
Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: There's an element of severance actually built into those numbers, Ajay. So we made some estimates in terms of severance. The $70 million and $130 million basically were comprised of, the way I think about it, really four different things. It was this one-time write-off this year in this quarter, which we talked about in terms of the construction in progress write-off. It's accelerated depreciation, it's severance and what we call conversion costs, things that essentially are due to moving from the SAP system to our enhanced version of SaaS. So I would think about that really as grouped in kind of those four different areas. And so severance again, we have severance estimate that was actually part of that number for those two years.
Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC: Okay, and I had one follow-up question. I think it's follow-up to one of the questions that was asked earlier on the transition from deflation to inflation, so assuming that there is some inflation that reappears next year in fiscal 2017. So I understand the gross margin percentage increases when you have deflation, but would you say there's also some underlying benefit when you're seeing your cost of goods going down as it's been going down over the past two or three quarters, both from fuel and deflation? So would you say it's possible that your input costs are going down at a faster rate than you're passing along to some of your broadline customers? And does any of that benefit start to get offset as you start to deal with inflation again whenever that happens?
Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC: There's an element of that, Ajay. I mean, there's the math aspect of it and then there's an element of that. Obviously, in our business where you turn your inventory every 20 days, you can't hold the prices for too long given the competitive environment that we're in. So to Tom's earlier point, we're always trying to strike the right balance there with what the customer's needs are. So that's certainly part of it. But I would also say to you that – I'm not a big fan of deflation, so I think the longer it goes, the more challenging it becomes. People start to expect prices continue to go down. So it's not a good place to be, but it's explainable. I mean, a lot of it – the way we've kind of got here is the center of the plate, these protein categories are flat to now down, whereas a year, 18 months ago, they were up double-digit, and the rest of the categories are roughly flat, maybe up a little bit or down a little bit. So it's primarily being driven in the protein area and that's what – that's a theory that you will have to watch closely in terms of when we come out of it. But I would just echo what I've said for years and I think what Sysco said for even longer than that, that the best environment for us and for our customers is when you have a moderate level of inflation ideally across multiple categories, 2%, 3%, whatever. And I would say it gets more challenging if you go to where you have 5% or 6% inflation, we've seen that, and it's certainly challenging over the medium term when you have deflation. So bottom line, I feel really good about how we're managing it. I think a lot of these commercial initiatives I spoke to earlier and as Tom has spoken to have come at just the right time in terms of managing through this process. And, yes, there's some short-term benefits with deflation to your point, but medium to long-term, not where we want to be.
Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: And I would just add one thing if I could, it's Joel. Just as a reminder, the way it impacts our financials, yes, there is some margin benefit to that. However, ultimately the dollars on the gross profit side we roll through are less when we have deflation typically. So that certainly is the headwind for us, just as a reminder of that.
Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC: Okay. And one final question if I could. Since you called out the Easter calendar shift in your prepared remarks, can you quantify that at all because of the sales impact?
William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, I don't think the Easter thing – we called it out just because it was real. But Easter, from my experience, is not quite as big a deal as it used to be years ago. It certainly not as big a factor as Mother's Day, but it was a factor. I think the weather was a bigger factor, Ajay. I think you have to – when you look at the delta and the case growth, it'd be great to think it was all us, but I think part of it, I think, was driven by just a pretty mild winter in most of the markets that we serve. So to me that was a bigger deal than the holiday.
Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC: Great, thanks.
William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Wiltamuth from Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Mark Gregory Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC: Hi, good morning. I wanted to get a gauge for how big the pressure was from those oil-related states? How big is that for your overall mix of sales? And when do you think you'll start lapping out of that?
William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director: I have no idea when we're going to lap out of it. Just like I probably can't predict when we're going to move from deflation to inflation. Matt, we haven't talked about that publicly. I think, again, we're making an effort here to give you our perspective of what's going on as it impacts – as fuel impacts us. So I think on the good news on the tailwind side of it, there's some flow-thorough we believe with the consumer level. It's hard to quantify that from what we see, but it certainly is enhancing discretionary income. Prices started to pick up here a little bit of late. It has certainly helped us on our cost structure, although we've managed costs extremely well outside of that impact. And we're just pointing out that the downside of it is in a good portion of the Southwest as well as you get up into Montana, North Dakota, and into Alberta, Canada, it goes the other way. So it's meaningful in those markets. And I think if it persists and becomes a more meaningful number, we probably will give you some color on that, but right now we haven't.
Mark Gregory Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC: Okay. So what do you think the primary factors are to kind of give you your better performance on a local case volume trends versus these disappointing results we're seeing out of KNAPP-TRACK and some of the other casual dining metrics?
William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Oh my, that's a hard question for me to answer. I can speak to our performance and I think our performance comes from continuing to differentiate ourselves relative to our competition and it remains a very competitive marketplace. And so Tom spoke to the penetration and that's big as well as improved retention. Obviously, as I've said now two or three times and as we've said really since there's been a Sysco, that local case growth, that street case growth is a key focus for us, whereas some of the data that you're citing there is more chain-driven. So I think there's a little bit of a customer mix reconciliation there as well.
Mark Gregory Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC: Okay, thank you.
William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi, great. Thank you. Firstly, could we talk about digital as a percentage of sales either in broadline or local case volume, just kind of where that is? And if you've – and I don't remember, I'm sorry if you have, if you've publicly stated where you think that can go, let's say, by 2018 and the implications that it may have for your business?
Thomas L. Bené - President & Chief Operating Officer: So we haven't talked about where we think it can go. What we have talked about is that our approach here is to provide the options to our customers to order in whatever manner they choose. And so we continue to believe that's the right approach. We feel great about our marketing associates and the work they've been doing. We know that we need a good viable online system and that's what we've been rolling out through our mobility platform. And, obviously, we still have orders that are placed in other means, called in or faxed in. Having said that, we continue to feel good about the work we're doing. The mobility piece, think about mobility as more a handheld or the iPad, iPhone type of – or Android device. We obviously have desktop. And so our – as I think we've said before, our online purchases are still relatively small in the street, just slightly under 10%, but growing. And we feel really good about the progress we're making there. But we haven't pegged a number by a certain date because we really believe it's going to find its level place based on what the customers' needs and expectations are.
John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you. And, secondly, is there any implication at all if the UK leaves the EU in terms of your Brakes acquisition? In other words, Brakes, which has operations in the UK and the EU, are they completely separate and would that have any impact on your business at all?
William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, hard to assess at this point. And there'll be an impact, John, there's going to be an impact in Europe obviously and the UK in particular. It's hard for me to tell at this point where we are with Brakes to really give you any specific color on that. So we're watching it and we're certainly well aware of when we entered into those discussions. So there's no point in me conjecturing on that. I think we've just got to watch and wait for the vote and see where it goes, but again, just like in this country, people are going to go out to eat and we're very, very fortunate to be getting ready to close the transaction with a very well respected strong company with a great leadership team that's got a lot of good things going on. So we'll deal with whatever comes there, but right now I think we're very excited about the team that we're going to inherit.
Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. And I would add, just as a reminder, I mean, we're in this thing for the long haul. I mean, we look at that deal as very much a part of our long-term value creation. And so again, as Bill said, we certainly knew that was out there when this was in here, but we're certainly in this for the long term.
John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Our last question comes from the line of Erin Lash from Morningstar. Your line is now open.
Erin Lash - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Thank you for taking the question. I just wanted to follow up on an earlier discussion regarding CapEx. I got the impression that the reduction for this year was related to more timing issues and that would potentially flow into next year. So if you could confirm that? Also then, as it relates to the Brakes deal and I realize that the deal has not closed yet. But the extent to which you can provide some of your initial expectations in terms of whether there's going need to be a step-up in CapEx as you bring that business online, that would be very helpful.
Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure, this is Joel. I'll take that. The CapEx commentary, I mean, there's some element of timing in that, but I wouldn't say a lot. So I mean, wouldn't think about this, that there's going be some big spike next year as a result. It is – Bill talked about, we specially see this area around 1% of sales, from CapEx being a very normal and reasonable number for us. Again, we've got a very disciplined process for the way we manage that based on the needs of our business. And so again, there's some element of timing in that, but, again, I wouldn't expect something significant changing going forward on that. And then from a Brakes perspective, the one thing I think we've talked about is that, in general, this company has been well invested in and so certainly as part of the modeling we did for the deal, we factored in some level of CapEx as you'd expect. But, again, I think the level they're anticipating and the level we are, are relatively in line. So I would certainly, again, anticipate – again, we'll give some more clear guidance on that once the deal's done, but just at a high level, I think you're getting in there in a pretty well invested place and look at CapEx in a relatively similar way than we do.
Erin Lash - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Thank you, that's very helpful. And then just following up, at the CAGNY conference earlier this year, you discussed the fact that the challenges facing the oil industry were actually benefiting you in terms of your facing some of the truck driver shortage issues that had added to your costs over the last few years. And I wondered if you could discuss that, whether you're still seeing a benefit in terms of an enhanced pool from which to attract truck drivers or whether maybe some of that benefit has been moderating?
William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Erin, I think we are. I mean I think the markets that we struggled in a year ago, 18 months ago, we certainly have closed the gap there. Now, some of those challenges were self-inflicted and we've gotten better on the talent acquisition side as well over that period of time. So if we were in the business of hiring truck drivers, we'd be in a better place right now. I would have the tradeoff though. I'll take the business and struggle with hiring truck drivers, but to your specific question, that certainly has mitigated or muted over the last several months and it's not a big issue for us right now.
Erin Lash - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to the presenters.

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Bill DeLaney.
William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Neil, and good morning, everyone. This morning Sysco reported a strong second quarter and a solid first half of the year. These results reflect the continuously improving execution of our portfolio of strategic initiatives by all of our associates. Further, our favorable performance over the past several quarters validates that our ongoing focus on improving our customers' experience with Sysco and increasing productivity in all aspects of our business are key to our future success. From an overall economic and industry perspective, calendar year fourth quarter U.S. GDP and consumer confidence data was mixed as favorable unemployment trends and lower gas prices somewhat offset increased concern about near-term business conditions and global uncertainty. Most recently, the precipitous drop in multiple stock market indices bears watching as it relates to potential adverse ramifications for consumers and our customers. As far as the restaurant industry data is concerned, the overall trend remain reasonably positive amid sluggish consumer spending. According to the National Restaurant Association, December marked the 11th consecutive month of foodservice sales growth. This closes out a strong year for the industry where foodservice sales exceeded grocery store sales throughout the year. That said, both NPD and NavTrak have shown some recent modest declines in traffic trends that we are closely monitoring. With respect to product cost deflation, we saw an acceleration during the second quarter, driven by key center-of-the-plate categories such as meat, poultry and pork, as well as dairy. This trend has continued into the third quarter and we currently believe that deflation headwinds will persist for at least the remainder of the fiscal year. Now, moving to our second quarter results. Total Broadline cases grew 3.4% and local cases grew 2.9%. Sales were up 0.6% despite being adversely impacted by both deflation of 1.2% and foreign exchange headwinds of 1.7%. Gross profit dollars grew 3.4% and gross margin increased 50 basis points. Adjusted operating income for the quarter grew $41 million or 10% compared to the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share grew 17%. And importantly, we had solid execution across the business including the U.S. Broadline. Reflecting on the first half of our fiscal 2016 performance, overall, our team executed well and we are making good progress towards the achievement of our key financial objectives by focusing on the following four key levers. Accelerating local case growth, improving gross margin, leveraging supply chain costs, and reducing administrative costs. Specifically, we achieved the following during first half of the year. Total Broadline local cases grew 2.8%. We grew gross profit by $121 million, expanded gross margin by 36 basis points, and grew gross profit modestly faster than expenses. We grew adjusted operating income 4% or $38 million, and we grew adjusted earnings per share of 7.5%. As we enter the second half of our fiscal year, we have strong momentum in the business. We do, however, need to continue to effectively manage the persistent deflationary headwinds that likely will challenge our performance going forward. Further, we are aggressively reviewing all aspects of our business for incremental cost savings opportunities to improve our financial performance. At our Investor Day presentation last September, we laid out three key results that our three year strategic plan is targeting through 2018. Improve our customers' experience with Sysco, enhance associate engagement, and achieve our financial objectives of increasing operating income by at least $400 million, growing earnings per share faster than operating income, and achieving a 15% return on invested capital. I remain confident that we're well positioned to achieve those goals. And now I'll turn the call over to Tom.
Thomas L. Bené - President & Chief Operating Officer: Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I'm glad to be joining the call this morning with all of you. In my new role, I'm excited to bring our business operations, commercial functions and supply chain organizations together to drive improved execution and a seamless approach to serving our customers. This approach will better position Sysco to provide exceptional service and support to our customers, and ultimately improve our returns to our shareholders. I'd like to begin my remarks regarding the second quarter by providing an update on some of the initiatives related to our three-year plan and how they have already begun to have an impact on our business results. As we have mentioned before, our insights-based approach to understanding and meeting our customers' needs continues to guide our efforts. Our improved processes and tools in this area are allowing us to leverage our very robust base of information to design a variety of initiatives to improve the retention and penetration of our current customers as well as to accelerate the addition of new customers. And while we have much work still to do, we are beginning to see positive results. For example, during the second quarter, our U.S. Broadline operations delivered case growth of 3.9%, including local case growth of 3%, gross profit dollar growth of 5.5%, including an improvement margin of 57 basis points, and operating income growth of about 9%, supported by solid operating expense performance. From a geographic perspective, we saw solid year-over-year improvement in both cases and gross margin across the U.S., with specific strength in the Mideast. Southeast, and the Pacific markets. This was somewhat offset by signs of growth slowing in our traditionally-strong Southwest market due to the impact of the downturn in the energy sector. One example of how we're driving increased case growth is in the area of fresh and local products where we're helping to educate our customers that we have significant capability through our Broadline operations and our specialty companies to bring fresh and local produce to the market. As an example of how we differentiate ourselves in this segment, in order to grow cases, our Sysco quality assurance team has partnered with the Produce Marketing Association to deliver good agricultural practices workshops to more than 800 small farmers since 2011, helping prepare our small local growers to meet our food safety standards. As you know, improving gross margin is one of the key drivers of Sysco achieving our three-year targets. And our strong performance this quarter indicates we are making progress towards achieving our long-term objectives. To that point, I am pleased with how well we've managed the current deflationary environment, which has certainly slowed sales dollar growth. Our ability to manage this environment well is due in part to an increased focus on Sysco brand and our category management efforts where we are able to use our purchasing scale along with the more transparent process with our supplier partners to achieve our goals. We continue to see a variety of benefits for our customers, suppliers and Sysco as category management has become a standard part of how we now operate our business. There are other areas that we know are improving our overall customers' experience of doing business with Sysco as well including the way we are improving the service and the support they are experiencing through our technology solutions. Our mobile order entry platform, which has been in pilot with customers for the past few quarters has shown strong adoption rates with both customers and our marketing associates. Now that the pilots have been completed, we are in the process of fully deploying this ordering solution across the enterprise. Additionally, we soon expect to begin pilots for the next phase of our digital eCommerce platform, which will bring additional capability, tools, and information critical to our customers to help them better run their business. Finally, from a supply chain perspective, we have made solid progress toward our goal to improve overall service to our customers while driving higher productivity in our operations through our continuous improvement process. As mentioned earlier, while there's still a lot more work to be done, we're seeing improved operating expense trends and we're targeting a continuation of this performance throughout the balance of the fiscal year. These are just a few of the key priorities that are starting to impact our operational and financial results. And while we have much work to do, I'm confident we are on the right path to achieve our long-term objectives. In summary, our customer and operational strategies are being executed well in the field, and our headquarters teams are doing a terrific job of providing our organization with field ready tools and processes that are enabling our success. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer.
Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. We had a strong second quarter especially in light of the increased deflation and continued currency headwinds. We also continued to make some solid and early progress towards our fiscal 2016 plan and our three-year goals. We grew sales in the second quarter by approximately 1% year-over-year despite going from inflation of 6% in the second quarter of last year to deflation of 1% this year, including deflation of nearly 2% in U.S. Broadline. We saw continued deflation in center-of-the-plate protein categories as supply recovers from various events in 2015. However, as Tom mentioned, we are managing this environment well, including improved processes and programs such as category management that have helped to lessen the impact of deflation. Foreign exchange negatively impacted sales by 1.7% with the U.S. dollar's strength against the Canadian dollar responsible for the vast majority of the impact. On a constant currency basis, sales would have been up 2.2%. Turning to case growth, consistent with our three-year plan to achieve disciplined case growth, we had another quarter of strong performance. Total Broadline case growth for the second quarter was 3.4%, and local was 2.9%. This is the seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year local case growth for the total Broadline. Looking at gross profit and gross margins, we grew our gross profit at a solid 3.4% while also continuing to see expansion in gross margins, which grew by 50 basis points. The key drivers of gross margin improvement included category management, a more beneficial mix of local business, higher Sysco brand penetration in our local business, and deflation. On a constant currency basis, gross profit growth was 5%. Adjusted operating expenses grew 1.8% during the quarter and by 3.5% on a constant currency basis. The increase is mainly driven by the previously-mentioned higher case volumes and planned investments in business technology. This increase in expense was partially offset by various decreases, including reducing indirect spend, reduced fuel costs, and foreign exchange translation. This progress is reflected in our cost per case in U.S. Broadline, which was down $0.01 from the prior year. Also note, while we experienced a relatively minor amount of certain items related to restructuring during the second quarter, we do expect to experience additional restructuring charges related to our three-year plan over the next few quarters. As you know, a key part of our plan is to effectively manage the gap between gross profit dollar growth and expense growth. We achieved that objective during the second quarter, and as a result, grew adjusted operating income by 10.2% compared to the prior year and 11.6% on a constant currency basis. As it relates to taxes, in mid-January at an investor conference, we disclosed a $21 million benefit to income tax expense as a result of the favorable resolution of some international tax contingencies. This had the same impact on both our GAAP and adjusted tax rates, reducing both to around 31%. As a result, and as mentioned during that webcast, we reported a $0.03 benefit to earnings per share during the second quarter. Compared to the prior year, adjusted net earnings grew 12.6% and adjusted earnings per share grew 17.1%, and 19.5% on a constant currency basis due to higher operating income and reduced tax rate. The previously-mentioned tax benefit increased earnings per share by $0.03. The share count decrease of 24.5 million shares related to the accelerated share repurchase program positively impacted earnings per share in the second quarter by approximately $0.02 versus the prior year. At the beginning of the second quarter, we executed the accelerated share repurchase program and therefore received the benefit from that repurchase for the entire quarter. Also note that we resumed our ongoing practice of buying back shares to offset dilution during the last few weeks of December. Cash flow from operations was $469 million for the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2016, up roughly 4% from last year. Working capital was a use of cash during the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2016, as it was during the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2015. The first half of the fiscal year typically requires a seasonal net investment in working capital that is then reduced during the second half of the fiscal year. Year-over-year, the comparison is favorable as we invested $143 million less cash in working capital during first half of fiscal 2016 than we did in the first half of fiscal 2015. Net CapEx for the first 26 weeks was $237 million and free cash flow was $231 million. Both cash flow from operations and free cash flow include the cash impact of certain items of $264 million in fiscal 2016 and $102 million in fiscal 2015. Certain items for 2016 are mostly related to the termination of the proposed merger with U.S. Foods and from 2015 include items related to the proposed merger itself. Excluding the cash impact of certain items from both years, cash flow from operations grew by $179 million and free cash flow grew $237 million. Now, I'd like to close with some commentary on the remainder of the fiscal year. First, we are on track to achieve our fiscal 2016 plan. Second, we expect deflation to persist for at least the remainder of the fiscal year. Third, we had a relatively strong fourth quarter last year, which will make fourth quarter comparisons this year more challenging. Fourth, we now expect CapEx to be near the lower end of the previously-stated $550 million to $600 million range. Finally, we expect a normalized tax rate of 36% to 37% over the remaining 26 weeks. In summary, we had a strong quarter led by continued momentum from the improved underlying business performance. That said, we have more work to do in order to achieve our fiscal 2016 financial objectives and our three-year plan, including effectively managing deflation over the near term and increasing our focus on expenses. We continue to aggressively review every part of the company, looking for ways to reduce costs. Additionally, we have put in place some more rigorous process for managing expenses, including how we prioritize spending and focus investment on areas or projects that improve our ability to serve the customer better. And finally, we took advantage of continued lower fuel prices to increase the amount of fuel we locked in over the next 12 months. I feel good about our ability to achieve the first year target of our three-year plan, and we are working hard to be as aggressive as possible in identifying incremental opportunities to exceed our Investor Day targets. Operator, we're now ready for Q&A.
Operator: We'll pause for a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from the line of Zack Fadem with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Zachary Fadem - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi, good morning. So, question on local cases. With local cases up about 3% in the quarter, I'm hoping you can provide some color here in terms of new customer growth versus higher share of wallet for existing customers? And over time, do you think you can grow local cases in excess of the market rate?
William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Zack, it's Bill. I'll start and let Tom kind of give you some color from his perspective. We've historically been able to take share year-in and year-out and we do that both on the local side of the business as well as the corporate side of the business. So, yeah, I would expect that we would continue to take share. Obviously, what Joel referred to in his comments is we're trying to do that in a more disciplined way as we go forward here, so that we give more of a flow through to the bottom line. The way I would look at the local case growth is I talked about the lever of accelerated local case growth. The context there is we've had, I think, seven quarters in a row of local case growth, and the last few have been right around 2% or more. So that lever is relative to where we were in the last two years or three years or four years as we were going through a lot of our change and some pretty tough macro economics. So that 2% to 3% range, I think, is what we're targeting. I think there's going to be some quarters where we're at the lower end of that range and there will be some we're at the higher end of the range. I think 2% to 3% is very solid growth if you look at what the forecasts are for the industry. But I'll let Tom speak to generally where it's coming from.
Thomas L. Bené - President & Chief Operating Officer: Yeah, thank you, Bill. I would just add we are seeing strong trends in restaurant traffic and restaurant sales, so that's certainly helping. But we're really focused on promotional activity that actually drives new business. And also, if you think about some of the tools that we shared at the Investor Day around how we improve our penetration, we are seeing improved penetration with our local customers, driven primarily by some of those initiatives, whether it's some of the local products I've been talking about, some of the innovation we've launched, or even some of the additional services we're providing those local customers. So we see good performance coming out of them from a variety of areas and believe we'll continue to see that kind of growth.
Zachary Fadem - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Great. And just, you had discussed a more rigorous process towards expense management. Joel, I'm hoping you can elaborate a little bit more on this in terms of potential focus areas and whether this would be above and beyond what you laid out at Investor Day.
Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure. So couple of comments on that. Number one, the way I think about those types of costs, and I think we've talked about this at other places, we think about it from the standpoint of processes, from people, from technologies, from the types of investments that we put into our company, again, in terms of how we think about prioritizing items. So in other words, one of the key things I called out in here is the ability to really prioritize and then focus on those spends that are going to drive the, again, ultimately what's better for our customers. And so I think the – some of those things that we put in place, for example, are different committees to review and focus on technology spend, for example, and the ways to have, again, a very tight process for making sure that we're focusing on those projects that drive, again, the best results primarily and focused on the customer. So, I would say, I mean, again, there's a lot of rigor around that. And in terms of your – second part of your question, again, all I can really say to that I think is that we certainly will continue to focus on driving that, certainly with the deflation we're experiencing and the fact that our gross profit dollars are harder to come by. That increased focus on expenses is important. And so, again, as I mentioned I think in my script, that's certainly an area we're going to continue to focus on and certainly look to drive incremental improvements over and above our targets.
William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I think, if I could just add there, Zack, to Joel's comments maybe a little more of a historical perspective. I mean this company has always managed expenses very well, both operationally and corporate. Now, over the last three years, four years, five years, we've invested a lot, in particular on the corporate side, technology, processes as Joel mentioned, commercial activities beginning to end supply chains, so a lot of those investments have been made over the last several years to create this path to transformation that we feel the company needs to go through in which we're pretty far down the road on. What you're seeing today and what you've seen in the last few quarters is we're beginning to get the benefits of a lot of those investments. So I would expect that the trajectory of that expense, as it's already happened, will flatten out. To Joel's point, we'll continue to get better and better at sequencing and prioritizing spend relative to customer needs and relative to what we need to deliver for our shareholders. I'd say, the one last opportunity we have, particularly in the field, is to be just more consistent in our execution. And we still see plenty of opportunity there. So, again, historically, we've done a good job, but what we're really telling you here is we think there's opportunity, both operationally as well as on the corporate side.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess just a follow-up on, I think there was a comment on deflation making gross profit dollars a little bit harder to come by, but it was also a gross margin benefit from a rate standpoint. Can you just elaborate on how deflation impacted the P&L as the quarter progressed? And if it's going to continue, do you anticipate any change in the way it impacts the business?
William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, deflation impacts the P&L. I don't know that there was a big sequential impact, a lot of variable around the sequential impact as the quarter progressed. What we're saying is we saw a pickup from the first quarter to the second quarter, we're seeing some similar trends here in January. And we kind of felt mathematically that would begin the wrap. We began to see this, if you recall, back in March and then the fourth quarter of last year when the inflation fell off. So we thought just from a wrapping perspective that we would see a little more – little less deflation as we got into the second half of the fiscal year. And I would say what we're telling you today is it's still there and we probably will expect to see it at least through the end of the quarter. It affects you in different ways, obviously. On the positive side, generally when our costs go down, we are able to pass that along to our customers. And that's good for them, especially as they are dealing with some of their labor challenges. Your percentages look better, so certainly it contributed to the gross margin expansion. But the reality is, it's not a great environment because you end up with fewer dollars to pay your expenses with. So to Joel's other point, when you have this level of deflation, it just reinforces the importance of managing our expenses very tightly.
Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. And as an unrelated follow-up, I know there were some comments about eCommerce. Can you remind us where the current perpetration is as it relates to sales and how you think about that as a driver of the business going forward?
Thomas L. Bené - President & Chief Operating Officer: Yeah. So regarding the eCommerce work we have been doing, we've been very focused on our mobility solution. So think about it as an online ordering tool where our customers can use iPad or type device or their phone to order. We've been piloting this across the last couple of quarters. We now are in most of our operating companies with at least some of the customers in some of our districts and so we're going to be expanding it now to the rest of the country and more of a full deployment. We continue to see improved usage of the tool, but I'd say today we're still in the low, probably 9%, 8%, 9% of the orders going through that process. But we're seeing basically double digit improvement each quarter as we roll this. So the feedback has been very positive, both from our own associates who also use the tool, and from our customers. So we believe we are well on our way to significant increases in adoption and ultimately, a lot more of the orders being placed using that tool.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Wolf with BB&T Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets: Hi, good morning and good quarter. Back to the gross profits. So, just sequentially, they grew better even as sales got worse because of accelerated deflation. So I've heard the explanations around mix and so forth, but at least from my view, it looks like the deflation is at least kind of benign. I mean I know it becomes a headwind. But is there some element to sticky pricing where when inflation was increasing the last three years, it's tougher distributors to pass that through all at once. And is there some element where to some degree it doesn't have to come down quite as fast or do you think everybody is just chasing the business and passing it through right away?
William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Andy, and thank you. You covered a lot there. Look, I think – as I said, I believe the deflation, as you look at gross margin, i.e., the percent to sales is clearly helping. However, as we've said very consistently over the years, it's not an ideal environment to be in. If you look at this business historically, our customers generally are able to pass along a couple of points of inflation to their consumers year-in and year-out, and they generally do. So to one of your points, what you're seeing here a little bit is some of the recovery, what we gave up. When we were dealing with 5 points to 6 points of inflation, you can only pass along so much of that so quickly and it's only appropriate to pass along so much of that so quickly. So when you have some deflationary trends, mathematically, it helps you a little bit. Perhaps there's situations where you can bring your prices down a little slower, but ultimately, it's an incredibly competitive environment. So we're out there competing for that business every day and we want to do right by our customers. So I wouldn't put a lot of weight on that. I just think we're doing a very good job managing it. I've seen different cycles of deflation here over the last – you don't know how many years, but a lot of years – and this is by far and away the best we've ever managed it. And I think it goes back to what Tom covered, and I'll let him speak again. We are actively – we've been working on several commercial initiatives here for the last two years, three years, four years, whether it's segmentation, back to basics, revenue management, category management. These are all things that are allowing us to be more laser like in terms of how we work with our customers and bring more consistency to our pricing. There's more to do there, so I would just say I think we're actually managing it quite well.
Thomas L. Bené - President & Chief Operating Officer: Yeah, Bill, the only thing I would add is we've talked about the impact of the category management efforts we've been embarking on over the last few years. That continues to be a significant driver for us. And we've also shared with you all the importance of our Sysco brand growth and we are very focused on that Sysco brand because we know that not only is it a great quality product for our customers, but obviously, there are margin benefits for Sysco as well. And so I think really that's just one additional thing I'd add, if it helps.
William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director: And I wouldn't underestimate this mix. We don't have to grow the local faster than the corporate. I mean, I think corporate still grew a little bit faster than local this quarter, but we bring more value to the street customers. We're able to leverage our Sysco brand offerings in a broader way with our local case growth. And so if you go back to Investor Day and some of our commentary there, that first lever of accelerating local case growth and if we can keep it in that 2% to 3% range, that's a very powerful lever for the throughput or the flow through, if you will, to the bottom line of the company.
Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets: Thank you. Can I just follow up briefly on the category management that seems to be driving profits nicely? I think earlier on it was really focused for you guys on your vendors and some of the things you were doing there to bring down cost. It sounds like it's more focused now on getting it into the sales side of the business and bringing it to the restaurants. Am I hearing that right as well?
Thomas L. Bené - President & Chief Operating Officer: Well, I'd say, yes. The initial wave you go through and you are obviously doing all the hard work and heavy lifting around the categories, selecting the right products and the right partners to do business with. Now that we're deeply into that and we've been through all the categories, the majority of them, now we're very much focused on optimizing what we have. So, you've heard us talk about innovative products. We've had some innovation that has been out over the last couple of quarters now that are starting to drive some incremental benefits for our customers and obviously for us. You are also starting to do much longer range planning with a lot of these supplier partners. So it's become more of the way we operate. And I guess based on that or because of that, we're seeing the kind of consistent year-over-year benefits. While maybe not as great as they were in the early days as we started at, we're still seeing consistent benefits from that work.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Good morning, guys. Congratulations on a nice quarter.
William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Ed.
Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hey, Bill, can I just start with maybe a big picture question? So last quarter, you sort of walked us through how the underlying business was better than the bottom line results, so to show it, right? And that was, I think, more around like corporate costs and stuff. And now this quarter you've got, it's like your strongest EBIT growth quarter in sort of recent memory. Despite deflation, you've got case growth and better profit per case and lower expense per case that are all lining up. Do you feel that you've kind of reached that inflection point that you were hinting at last quarter? I guess what's the big picture takeaway from this quarter, if there is one at this point.
William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Ed, I think it's a little bit like golf. We got a little bit more out of it this quarter than we did in the first quarter. I think when I talked about that first quarter, that's when we really talked more about the U.S. Broadline than we have in the past. I wanted you and the other investors to understand the quality of the underlying quarter. I think part of what we're seeing, we've done some work on this, is the trajectory of the corporate spend coming out of last year, coming out of the proposed merger that ultimately was terminated, we still had some – and we still do – we still had some trajectory of our spend here at corporate, in particular on the technology side, in particular on some of the areas that Tom's speaking to with the digital and mobile platforms. So those comparisons were not quite as tough in the second quarter as they were in the first quarter. So our corporate expense increase is a little bit less acute. We got a little more margin improvement, as you can see on the gross margin side, even though we did see more deflation. And perhaps that helped us a little bit in the short term, but we also managed, I think, a little bit better. And you saw better cost management, I think, operationally as well. We're right around that flat cost per case right now. Fuel helped us a little bit there, but. So I just think everything got a little bit better and I just think this quarter is somewhat more reflective of really the quality of the earnings that we've seen. Now, look at it, what I would encourage you to do is look at the first half I spoke to. And what I see there is I see 4% operating income with improving trends. And that's kind of how we're looking at it. So we think we're in a good place for the first year piece of our three-year goal. Joel can speak to that, but I think we talked about hitting 20% to 30% of our goal here in the first year. And we've got more work to do to hit or exceed the rest of that goal, both as it relates to continuing to address the deflation, in particular, grow those cases locally the way we are and have been. But we've got some more work to do on the expense side as well, and you've heard us allude to that here. So I wouldn't quite call it an inflection point, but I would call it a validation of what I talked about in the first quarter.
Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, and just couple of quick follow-ups. One, just on case growth, do you think weather sort of helped case growth out at all? And then a follow-up on deflation. The last period that we saw more meaningful deflation, profit per case was down. And it doesn't sound – like it sounds like this period, you think you can sort of manage through that without seeing it? And I just want to confirm that that's how you're thinking about things.
William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director: I don't think weather played that large a role. It's always hard for us to talk about good weather. December was relatively mild, so it might have helped a little bit. I would tell you (38:04) as far as this quarter goes, we finally had winter. We had it in the Mid-Atlantic area here a couple of weeks ago. So that's hitting us a little bit our last week of January/first week of February. But so far nothing crazy on the weather side this quarter either. I just think I'll let the other guys chime in here. I think on the gross profit, look, deflation's a very challenging environment to manage in terms of growing your gross profit dollars. And I just think we're doing a better job there for the reasons that Tom's taken you through. But the reality is we grew 3.4%, which is not 4%. To Joel's point, it was better than that when you adjust for currency. So I just think a lot of these commercial initiatives that we've been talking about for the last two years, three years, four years, they're in different stages of development and maturation, and you're beginning to see the benefits of them. But it is definitely a challenging environment, and that's why we're just being a little bit cautious in our wording as it relates to the second half of the year. Joel, you want to add anything?
Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, I think the only thing I would just add to that in terms of the way we think about that is, again, Bill said it. The headwind is there, but the combination of solid volume growth and some of the margin expansion that's caused it coming from some of the initiatives that Tom's talked about, again, the category management, the brand – the brand within our local case growth. So in other words, we're growing our local cases and our brand within that is growing. And so that's all positive. And so, I think at the end of the day, again, certainly obviously we say we'd certainly love to take a little bit of inflation to pass even more of that through, but I think those are kind of the key levers that we think about as we combat inflation. I think we've done a pretty good job of it.
William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, and we've talked a lot about local, and we need to, because, I mean, that really is what's driving a lot of this along with the initiatives. But we also grew the corporate businesses this quarter as well, and we grew it in a profitable manner. So we actually feel good about the overall quality of the case growth.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler with Barclays. Your line is open. Meredith Adler, your line is open. Your next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO capital. Your line is open.
Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Lots of questions on gross margin. But I was just curious, the factors that you called out, category management, local case growth, your private brand, deflation, is that order of magnitude the right way to think about it? I mean, do you kind of go item by item of those four factors and say here's kind of what the impact was? And just wondering if you're willing to share any more detail with us on those.
William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Kelly, just to be clear. Is that the way we think about what?
Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States): The impact of those factors on gross margin. Category management, the local case growth, the private label penetration, and the deflation.
William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, well, again, just for no other reason than to make me feel good, I think about gross margin, but I also think even more about gross profit dollars. So we're trying to address both here. You pay your bills with the dollars. I think on your point on the margin, certainly deflation of this magnitude is meaningful. It's impossible to quantify what that is, but we would be less than genuine if we didn't say that was contributing to some of the margin improvement. But I would quickly go to the other things we talked about here today, which is the importance of local case growth. Again, it doesn't have to be faster than the corporate. It just needs to be significant. The importance of growing the brand, and that's easier to do when you're growing your local cases. And the maturation of the category management work that we're doing, along with some of the work that Tom is continuing to develop here on revenue management. But I'll – you could talk to ten people or 100 people in Sysco and probably get a little bit different answer on that question. so I'll let Tom and Joel jump in here.
Thomas L. Bené - President & Chief Operating Officer: Well, again, I think the question was really more around is the prioritization of that the way we look at it. I think we look at all of them coming together. At the end of the day, this local customer, if we are meeting or exceeding their needs, we're going to get the kind of growth that's required there. And we're focused on a lot of initiatives that, in fact, help them be successful. And I know we said that a few times, but I think what is important for you to take away is that the more they're successful, and therefore the more we're successful with them, that is a big lever on our business, because of the – what we bring to them and the percentage of their business that is, in fact, Sysco brand, and the way that we partner with them. So I think I would say they all come together, and that's what makes the impact that you're seeing. I don't know that it's one necessarily higher than the other. It's really more about making them work together.
William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director: And I think the other point that Joel's made, and I'll let him make it again, is just obvious point: we've had some challenges here in the last few years, but to keep the right spread, if you will, between the gross profit growth and the expense growth.
Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, I think that's the other point I would continue to emphasize. As inflation goes up and down, as our gross profit dollars are driven by the things we've talked about, again to Bill – the point that Bill just made, one of the really strong focuses we have is to drive the gap between gross profit dollar growth and expense growth, which again, certainly this quarter we did a good job of, because, yeah, whether we have more inflation or less inflation one way or the other, that spread is really important to us, which is why we're going to continue to keep driving certainly on the gross profit dollar growth, but focus on the expenses as well.
Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay, that's very helpful. And then, I guess, in terms of expense growth, what was the impact of technology spend this quarter on your expenses.
William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director: I don't think that we historically have really gotten that detail, Kelly. What I would tell you is we still have some expense growth here at the corporate side. It's planned. And virtually all of it's on the technology side.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi there. I don't know if this is something that you'd be prepared to answer, but it would help, just because if and when we do return to an inflationary environment, it's just something to keep in mind in terms of puts and takes on a gross margin. So I guess the question is what percent of your sales are priced at cost plus a percentage markup versus a cost plus fixed penny per case? Because obviously, I mean, in fixed penny per case customer, you're going to be benefiting in a deflationary environment from a gross margin perspective.
William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, Karen, good morning. I would just say that you can presume that when we talk about our corporate customers, those large customers, those are all on some type of a cost contract. Some are markups, some are margin, some lines are done dollar per piece, whatever, dollar per pound. And on the local side, a lot of that is priced by the MA (45:36). Some of it is contractual, but we have and we don't plan on getting into a lot of detail on how we price customers.
Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then I guess just switching gears, two questions. I guess the first is what do you kind of cut back on in terms of CapEx this year in terms of your coming in at the low end of the range? And then the second question I had is just obviously your stock is reacting to your strong results this morning. I'm just curious how you think about the remaining buyback in light of the fact that, obviously, stock was at a better entry point during the quarter than it is now?
Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So I'll take first one and then I'll maybe clarify your question on the second one. The first part of the CapEx, I don't know that I'd really think about it as something we're cutting back on. I think the way I would just say it is we target our CapEx spend. It's not based on some fixed number that we need to achieve or not achieve, but it's really truly driven by the needs of the business. And so I think the way I would just think about that is that as we've kind of talked about before, we have a pretty rigorous process in terms of identifying and prioritizing our capital spending needs. And I would just say it to you this way that the way we look at the required spend this year for what our business is needing just happens to fall near the lower end of that range. So again, I don't necessarily look at our target as something that we have to achieve our some number we have to get to. It's just based on the needs of our business and we have the ability to flex as it relates to that. And then the second – Bill, do you want to add anything?
William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Let me take a shot at the second one. If I don't hit it, Karen, clarify it for us. First of all, it's nice to have a quarter beat. So, it's nice to see the stock reacting. Our experience is it'll take two days or three days for things to kind of level out in terms of how investors see the quarter. We've announced our intention to – we have done the $1.5 billion that needs to be sold, as Joel said. And today it would still be our intention to do the remainder of the program next year. So if things were to change, we will let you know, but right now, that's still our intention. I would just reiterate, though, going back to the first part of your question, we're always looking to invest in our business. And we'll continue to do that in a way that supports the disciplined growth that we talked about. Modestly growing the dividend continues to be very important and we continue to look for good solid strategic acquisitions. So we're looking at all four of those opportunities, but I'm sitting here today two hours into this thing, I think we haven't changed any plans.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wiltamuth with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Mark Gregory Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC: Hi. Good morning. I wonder if you can give us an update on how things are going at SYGMA on improving profitability there? And also, just a little more detail on what you're talking about there for the fourth quarter comparisons, why fourth quarter is going to be a difficult comparison for you?
William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'll speak briefly and certainly let Tom give you a little more color. SYGMA, as we've said, is in somewhat of a turnaround mode and we are continuing to see some better trends there as it relates to the customer mix and the expense management and that kind of thing. I would tell you, there's still plenty of work to go there. But we're encouraged with the beginning some of trends that we're seeing, but we're not there yet. I'll let Tom take the rest of SYGMA and then I'll let Joel talk to you about the fourth quarter
Thomas L. Bené - President & Chief Operating Officer: The only thing I'd add on SYGMA is we're very focused on specific customers and profitability, as well as improving our operational excellence in that business. And so, the combination of those two things is how we're going to improve and get this thing back on track. We've had, certainly over the last year, some challenges regarding drivers and driver retention, which is something that we've come out of and we're in a much better place now than we probably six months ago. But it's really those two areas. Making sure we've got the right customer mix and also that we're operating at the highest levels.
Mark Gregory Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC: Okay.
Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, sure, Mark, it's Joel. The question on the fourth quarter. I think the comment there really relates to the fact that last year in the fourth quarter our adjusted operating income grew nearly 6% and certainly we picked up nearly $30 million of operating income from the prior year. And so I think the comment was really focused around the – again, I often talk about growth on top of growth, and certainly as I mentioned in my part of the script, I said we're certainly feel very good about how we're looking towards achieving our fiscal 2016 planned objectives. But, again, it's really more of a call out of the fact that the fourth quarter last year, we had quite a strong performance, and that's where the comparatives are up against what we're referring to.
Mark Gregory Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the Meredith Adler with Barclays. Your line is open.
Unknown Speaker: Hi, this is Sean (50:50) on for Meredith. How's it going, guys?
William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good.
Unknown Speaker: I have a question on lower commodity costs. And to what extent that's maybe resulting in restaurants, maybe investing some of that into being more promotional versus them using it to offset high labor expense? I think that's been somewhat of a driver of case growth to some extent.
William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director: That would be hard for us to assess and probably not even appropriate. I think Tom sees more customers than I do, but I see a few, and I think this labor cost thing is at the top of mind for them right now. I know it's been the subject of some recent industry meetings. And I think that's where it's helping them. But, Tom, do you have anything to add to that?
Thomas L. Bené - President & Chief Operating Officer: No, not really. I can't say there's a big theme around more promotional activity that I'm seeing. They have lots of concerns out there right now, not the least of which is the labor environment.
Unknown Speaker: Sure. Makes sense. Another question I have too is just on the driver or maybe the drivers of non-Broadline inflation, just because it seems like there was deflation at Broadline at about negative 1.9%, which is approximately 80% of business. So I'm just wondering what's kind of driving the inflation for the remainder of the business?
William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I think what you're saying really is the deflation at the U.S. Broadline's driving the deflation. And some of our other businesses, to Karen's question on cost, SYGMA has more of the cost per piece, that type of fee, type of pricing, so that's not going to be impacted as much. Some of our other guest supply, different type of product line altogether, so Canada not as much. So I think all we're saying is the U.S. Broadline is 80% of our revenue stream, and that's where the bulk of the deflation is.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Sinisi with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, great. Good morning, guys. Thanks very much for taking my question. Just wanted to circle back a second on deflation. Bill, you said earlier, I know that something to the effect of deflation, of course, remaining a headwind. You initially thought it might subside kind of in the back half of the year, but still kind of there. So just to clarify, are you guys thinking for the next quarter or two, that kind of very similar levels to what you are seeing today, which I guess is similar to the quarter that was just reported? Or do you think that it could get a bit more of a headwind before then moderating?
William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Vinnie, I wish I knew. I think all we're signaling is we think it's going to be with us at least a quarter or two longer, at least. And it was almost two points in the U.S. Broadline this past quarter. I don't know that it's going to get a whole lot worse than that. We'll just have to see. But I think the real message, and let me be as clear as I can be, is that I think probably if I'd been talking to you, and I was six months ago, I would have thought by the fourth quarter we would've been back more to neutral, and that's really not our assessment right now. But I'm not necessarily saying it's going to get worse. I'm just saying that it's probably not going to get a whole lot better for another quarter or two.
Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Okay. That's fair enough. And maybe just one quick follow-up. You mentioned about the private brands a couple of times, also some of the newer fresh mix. Just kind of any updates either qualitatively or hopefully quantitatively the current percent of the mix where you may see that going, maybe some new categories that are coming on board?
William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I think as long as we continue to grow the local cases, and continue to, even as we go through the second round now with CatMan with a lot of our suppliers and we work more and more on innovation, that type of thing, that gives us an opportunity to partner with our suppliers with both certainly their brand, but also ours. So, it's hard to move a number, but you'll see in the attachments from the earnings release that we had a nice move this quarter. So I don't – I'm not going to try to predict how much more it could go up, but there's a high correlation between local case growth and brand movement. And Tom can give you some color on that as well.
Thomas L. Bené - President & Chief Operating Officer: Yeah, the specific numbers, that I think were communicated, and for U.S. Broadline, this is total U.S. Broadline, it was about 36.5% of the mix. And for the local business, it was 43.5%. And the local, it was up about 43 basis points. So we continue to see growth there. We believe it is a differentiator for us, and it's something that our customers also see value in, both price value, but I think also from a quality perspective. I think the other thing that Bill just mentioned, we're doing more innovative work. And as we do work with our supplier partners on Sysco brand innovation, that's going to help continue to contribute to these numbers. And I think I mentioned in the first couple of quarters, we had 16 items that we launched, basically, innovative items in the marketplace, and these are all generally Sysco brand items. Not all of them, but a lot of them are. And that'll continue to be a focus for us going forward.
Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. And I would just add that, I mean, this falls into the category of the disciplined, driving disciplined growth and profitable case growth, and certainly across both on the local side and again our multi-unit side. So, again, that disciplined approach on growing profitable cases certainly encapsulates everything that we've discussed here.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ajay Jain with Pivotal Research Group. Your line is open.
Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC: Yeah, hi, thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could talk more specifically about the ongoing benefit from fuel in terms of the net benefit. If you can comment on the actual earnings impact in Q2 year-to-date and also your outlook for fuel, maybe in the back half of the year after you've netted out the hedges that you've got in place and along with the impact of lower spot prices. So any kind of quantification would be appreciated. Thanks.
Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure, I think from a quantity perspective, I mean, we look at that as a couple of pennies per case on the fuel side in terms of the impact on what that is. Obviously, as I talked about in my area, certainly we're taking advantage of the fuel prices where they are today, and buying. We typically have executed forward buys and we continue to do that. And in fact, we continue to increase the percentage of our fuel consumption that has really brought a head on. And so that's certainly something, again, that we see. And I – we're not in this thing in terms of kind of speculating on fuel prices. It's something we certainly take advantage of where we have an opportunity both from a cost certainty perspective and then what we feel is just a good solid fuel prices. So, again, as I mentioned in my script, we're certainly – a fairly sizable portion of the fuel we've bought forward for over the next year. And so certainly we anticipate some continued benefit there.
Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC: Okay. But on a year-to-date basis, how would you say the pennies per case improved and how does that translate into earnings?
Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, again, it's pretty consistent. Again, as I pointed out, we think of it as about a couple pennies per case, that's impacted overall.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Hey, guys. So wanted to touch on private brand and gross. When you think about the ability to use the private brand portfolio to drive share. And I know there's a lot of things that you're offering to your customers, but just maybe isolate that one. How effective can that be at bringing on new customers? And I guess part of that is the inertia that they might have to the brands that they're using today. And do you think you're using those brands as effectively as you could? Are there things that can be done maybe a little bit differently to drive – to use those brands to drive some increased share gains? Any thoughts, particularly from Tom on that?
Thomas L. Bené - President & Chief Operating Officer: So I would maybe reiterate a few comments I made and maybe add a few points. So the Sysco brand, if you think about the Sysco brand, it's a value for a couple of reasons. One, generally, the cost to our customers is a little less than some of the national brands. So there's a natural benefit for them. But more importantly, we're very focused on the quality of these items. And I had mentioned innovation. So we're always looking to ensure that the Sysco brand items are, in fact, not only value added, meaning they bring increased value to the customer, but that they're also driving kind of the base business components that these customers need. So I'd say, we're getting everything we can. I think we feel pretty good about where we're at today. We feel like certainly we're not out of runway. But I think the more we can continue to focus on quality products, bringing innovation to those items, and making sure that we keep them in front of our customers. And we use – I think we talked about it at the Investor Day, the business review process that we use. It's a great way for us to actually do cuttings of our products, allowing them to see Sysco brand and compare that to something else they might be using. And it's how we spend a lot of that time is to help those customers see the value that's there and the opportunity that they have to improve their overall profitability by using the brand.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC: All right. And then maybe for Bill, if you think about some bigger secular trends, right? So local, private brand, CatMan. I mean you would think, and I know this isn't fully built in your plan, but you would think that there may be a good chance here for secular gross margin rate to be up pretty consistently. Obviously, if the top line is healthy, GP dollars could grow at a nice rate, maybe even higher than what you've targeted over the last three. How do you think about that?
William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'm all for it, but it's a little early to make that call, I think, John. So I think your thinking always is logical. We're six months into this three-year plan. I would just reiterate some things we talked about in September. The overall industry, I would say, the overall environment and the outlook for our customers is better today than it was two years or three years ago. Now, it goes up and down by quarter. You can actually see in some of the stuff when the stock market goes down, some of the NRA numbers fall off the next month or next quarter, so. But I think if you look at it secularly and go back two years or three years, we're in a better place. So that's a positive. It's still incredibly an acutely competitive world out there, so we need to be very responsive to that. And I would just echo what I've been trying to articulate here over the last two years or three years, but in particular the last several months post the merger termination, we're extremely well positioned today because of all the work that we've done over the last two years, three years, four years on the commercial side to compete effectively, do the right thing by our customers, but also grow in a disciplined way, as Joel talks about and manage our margins. So, if you look at those four levers, we're talking about improving how we manage it. Ideally, we'll at least hold margin over the next two years or three years. Right now we're up. Hopefully, we will grow it, but I certainly feel we're much better positioned to manage it well than where we were two years, three years, four years ago.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi, thank you. At this point, just a quick one for me. A follow-up on the fuel question. I think you kind of have a cost of fuel that's both embedded in your cost of sales and your operating expenses. So correct me if I'm wrong about that. But my question was, your suppliers that deliver food to you, how much fuel savings maybe was embedded over the past couple of quarters and what you anticipate over the next couple of quarters just that their delivery costs are less to you and therefore your price of product could be lower and that could actually be helping your cost of goods told, if you thought about it in that way.
William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, it's a good question, John. What we're speaking to is really our outbound cost of fuel. It's a little harder and we really don't get into that level of detail in terms of our components of our cost of goods. But let me say it this way, lower fuel is good. Okay? It's generally good for multiple reasons. One, on the margin generally people get some more discretionary income and they'll spend it, historically spend it more going out to eat. Now, I will say this, we really haven't seen a lot of that until perhaps lately and we don't have a lot of hard data on that. So the most powerful thing on the fuel is to the extent it translates to greater discretionary income and the consumer uses it to go out to eat, that's a good thing for us. I haven't seen quite as much of that, but we're hopeful that we'll see more. But, no, you are absolutely right, it helps us on the cost of goods, and to Joel's point, it helps us on the outbound. We kind of weight average the outbound. So it's definitely a modest tailwind and we're taking advantage of it and hopefully it'll stay that way.
John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian. Your line is open.
Gregory Robert Badishkanian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great. Thanks. Yeah, just a quick one. You mentioned that the competitive environment – or the environment is very competitive. And I'm just wondering has that changed any over the last few months? Is it pretty similar? Because obviously you picked up some share, so I'm just wondering if you've noticed any change there or who you think you're taking market share from? Is it broad-based or maybe there's a regional or more national players that you're taking that share from?
William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director: What we've been able to grow is, as I said historically, take share for many years. And certainly we've got the local case growth moving again here the last several quarters. We don't have the data for 2015. My sense is we probably have taken some share. I think a lot of the larger multi-regionals are doing well. And so if I were to conjecture, which is always a dangerous thing on calls like this, my sense is that some of the better operative larger folks are taking share, and it may be coming from some of the smaller players. But the bottom line, I think, in this business is good operators are going to take share. Large, small, good restaurant operators are going to continue to grow and do well, whether they're independent or corporate owned. And so I think our overall point of view would be the competitive environment remains very acute. It remains very similar to what we've seen the last two years or three years. And the best operators, both in terms of the customer base as well as on the distribution side are going to do the best.
Gregory Robert Badishkanian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great. Thank you.
William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day and welcome to the Sysco's first quarter fiscal 2016 conference call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded and we will begin today's call with opening remarks and introductions. I would now like to turn the conference over to Neil Russell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Neil A. Russell - Vice President, Investor Relations, Sysco Corp.: Thanks, Daniel, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Sysco's first quarter fiscal 2016 earnings call. Joining me in Houston today are Bill DeLaney, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, please note that statements made during this presentation that state the company's or management's intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements and actual results could differ in a material manner. Additional information about factors that could cause results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's SEC filings. This includes, but is not limited to risk factors contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 26, 2015, subsequent SEC filings and in the news release issued earlier this morning. A copy of these materials can be found in the Investors section at sysco.com or via Sysco's IR app. Non-GAAP financial measures are included in our comments today and in our presentation slides. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the applicable GAAP measures are included at the end of the presentation slides and can also be found in the Investors section of our website. All comments about earnings per share refer to diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. To ensure that we have sufficient time to answer all questions, we'd like to ask each participant to limit their time today to one question and one follow-up. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill DeLaney.
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Neil. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Sysco's first quarter financial results announced this morning reflect important early progress toward achieving the three-year financial targets we established for operating income and return on invested capital at our September Investor Day. The key leverage for realizing these targets are accelerating local case growth, improving gross margins, leveraging our supply chain costs and reducing administrative costs. The quality of our overall business results for the quarter was very good, driven by strong volume growth with both our locally and corporate-managed customers and sound gross margin management. However, sales growth was minimal and earnings were essentially flat due in large part to the unfavorable impact of both food cost deflation and currency translation. These two factors have somewhat restrained our performance for a good portion of the calendar year and we expect that these headwinds will persist for the next few months. Looking at broader economic and industry trends, we continue to see mixed data points with evidence of both underlying strength and optimism, but also pockets of concern. Consumer confidence recently rebounded to its yearly highs in September, but then fell back in October. Unemployment remains at low levels although non-farm employment levels have decreased steadily since May. NPD data for the three-month period ending in August showed continued positive restaurant spend with traffic growth rebounding from the prior three-month period. The QSR segment continues to be the main driver of positive restaurant traffic while fine dining segment also returned to a positive growth rate. Overall, restaurant traffic appears to be slightly positive. While still favorable on an absolute level, recent NRA data for September showed a decline in restaurant performance and foodservice operator confidence to levels last seen in late 2014. Turning to our first quarter results, I'm especially pleased with performance of our U.S. Broadline business. As you know, this part of our business represents approximately 70% of Sysco's revenues and 90% of our profits. During the first quarter, our U.S. Broadline operations delivered case growth of 3.4% including local case growth of 2%, the sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year local case growth. Gross profit dollar growth of 4.6%, nearly 2% more than our operating expense growth of 2.7%, and operating income growth of 6.4%. This performance was strong, especially after considering the impact of 1% food cost deflation in U.S. Broadline business, and drove Sysco's overall gross profit growth of more than 2% and year-over-year gross margin expansion of approximately 0.25%. Expense management trends continue to improve in much of our business as reflected in the $0.01 per case cost reduction in the U.S. Broadline business compared to the prior year. However, such improvement was offset by planned investment in merger-related carryover technology spend for projects that will provide key support to achieving our financial targets over the next three years. As I stated a moment ago, two of the key levers to achieving our three-year financial plan are: one, accelerating our local case growth; and, two, improving margins. Our results this quarter reflect good progress on doing exactly that. A few examples of the progress we've made in various areas to produce these results include our category management work, which continues to provide incremental benefits to both our customers and Sysco; improve Sysco brand penetration, especially with locally-managed customers; and continued progress with our revenue management development work and early success in our pilot locations. In summary, our underlying business has good momentum and we are in the right path to achieving our long-term financial and strategic objectives. For now, I'll turn it over to Joel for some additional details, and then I'll come back to summarize before we go to the Q&A.
Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, the first quarter results were of good quality, in particular for our core underlying business, the U.S. Broadline. Today, I'm going to discuss the details of the first quarter results on an adjusted basis, which mainly excludes expenses related to the termination of the proposed merger of the US Foods, as well as provide some additional pro forma comparisons on a constant currency basis. Our first quarter sales increased by roughly 1%, despite the deflation and currency headwinds Bill noted. For some additional color on the inflation volatility we've experienced over the past year, we have transitioned from 5% inflation last year to a 0.2% deflation this year. In addition, as Bill mentioned, deflation in the U.S. Broadline was even greater at about 1% for the first quarter. From a category perspective, center-of-the-plate protein and dairy drove the majority of this deflation with disinflation across many other categories. To put the deflation in context, the deflationary environment has developed two times over the past 10 years, lasting three months to nine months in length when it occurred. As for foreign exchange, this quarter we saw continued strength in the U.S. dollar versus the Canadian dollar and the euro. Since Canada represents the majority of our international sales, the Canadian dollar valuation was the main driver for the negative 2% impact to sales in the quarter, which is the largest impact we've experienced in recent history. When we look at our sales on a constant currency basis, they're up 3%. Turning to other sales drivers, we reported solid case growth this quarter, including 3.4% total and 2% local in U.S. Broadline. In addition, local and corporate-managed case growth across our total Broadline operations remained healthy. Despite the headwinds from foreign exchange and deflation, gross profit growth was solid at 2.3% and gross margin expanded by 23 basis points over the prior year. Positive contributors to gross profit growth include solid local case growth, category management and improved Sysco brand penetration. On a constant currency basis, gross profit increased by 4.3%. Turning to expenses, certain items during the first quarter totaled $108 million, the vast majority of which were related to the termination of our merger agreement with US Foods, including $10 million that was adjusted out of operating expenses and $95 million that hit the interest expense line. As previously mentioned, this will be the final quarter to be impacted by certain items pertaining to the US Foods merger termination. In total, our adjusted operating expense in the first quarter increased by $52 million over the prior year, mainly driven by payroll, which was impacted by both volume increases and a $9 million increase in our long-term incentive accruals. The increase in the long-term incentive accrual was related to our total shareholder return metric and was driven by the improvement in our stock price performance relative to the S&P 500. During the first quarter, we also started to see early signs of productivity improvements and cost reductions within our supply chain, as cost per case is down approximately $0.01 in our U.S. Broadline business. On a constant currency basis, operating expenses grew by about 5%. Adjusted operating income was down 0.5% or $3 million. However, on a constant currency basis, adjusted operating income would have been up 1.2%. As for our SYGMA business, we are beginning to see modest signs of improvement. For the first quarter, SYGMA sales were down 6.2%, as segment operating income grew 1.4%. As we previously mentioned, we have transitioned some SYGMA business, which did pressure sales, but did not negatively impact our profitability. That said, we remain focused on improving productivity, efficiency and customer profitability in SYGMA and will continue to closely monitor its progress. Moving to other income, I want to remind you that we consolidate the results of some of the entities we control, but do not have 100% ownership of. These represent investments in joint ventures, including some that are in the early investments or start-up phase. As such, our other income line this quarter reflects a $15 million improvement that is mostly attributable to the elimination of the non-Sysco portion of the results associated with these ventures. Our income tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 36%, both on a GAAP and on an adjusted basis. As a reminder, the adjusted rate is on the low end of our 36% to 37% normalized rate. The GAAP rate benefited from the impact of merger-related items, which offset the strength in our U.S. business. Adjusted net earnings grew about 1% and benefited from both higher other income and a lower tax rate versus last year. Adjusted earnings per share were flat for the quarter. Foreign exchange impacted earnings per share results by $0.01 per share. In addition, share count was up over 7 million shares versus the prior year, negatively impacting earnings per share by $0.01 per share as well. As a reminder, we have historically repurchased shares in the open market to offset dilution from new share issuances, but we have not done so for the past five quarters. We expect to resume these purchases later this year. As you may know, we have commenced an accelerated share repurchase program or ASR, but it had no impact on share count in this quarter. For those of you not familiar with the mechanics of the ASR, here's some details. Our broker borrowed 85%, or approximately 32 million shares, and delivered them to us on September 28, at which time our outstanding share count was reduced by that amount. Over the next several months, our broker will then acquire these shares through various mechanisms, including open market purchases. The balance of the shares covered by the accelerated share repurchase will be trued up during settlement over the next several months. As it pertains to cash flow, cash flow from operations for the first quarter was a negative $261 million, including the cash impact of certain items which reduced cash flow from operations by $260 million. Excluding the impact of certain items, adjusted cash flow from operations was essentially flat. From a working capital perspective, we saw improvements in net working capital this quarter, driven by improvements in both the accounts receivable and inventory areas. This resulted in working capital using approximately $70 million less cash in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 than it did in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. Net CapEx was $120 million for the quarter, generally flat year-over-year, mainly reflecting fleet replenishment and our investments in technology initiatives that we discussed during Investor Day. Free cash flow for the first quarter was a negative $381 million, which includes the $260 million impact of certain items. Please keep in mind that our free cash flow is seasonal, as we use more cash earlier in the fiscal year and then see larger sequential quarterly increases in free cash flow throughout the remainder of the year. Finally, I want to remind you of the expected impact of the accelerated share repurchase on our fiscal 2016 share count and earnings per share. On our last earnings call, we said that we anticipate a benefit of approximately $0.03 to $0.04 of diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2016, driven by a 4% to 5% reduction in average shares outstanding, partially offset by higher interest expense and new debt issuance. Now that we've begun execution of this plan, we still maintain this guidance. I'll now turn it back to Bill for his closing remarks.
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Joel. In summary, I am encouraged by the quality of our first quarter results and in particular with performance of our U.S. Broadline business. We are now experiencing consistent improvement in our local volume growth trends and gross margin management in this all-important part of our business, as a result of improved execution of several commercial initiatives implemented over the past few years. Expense management trends have improved of-late, and we are also making good strides in developing and refining action plans to accelerate additional cost improvement benefits, both in our supply chain and administrative areas of Sysco. We will provide regular updates on an ongoing basis in achieving our targeted results for improving our customers' experience, enhancing associate engagement and meeting our 2018 financial goals for operating income and return on invested capital. And with that, operator, we'll now take questions.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Our first question comes from John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead, sir.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Hey, Bill. So two things: number one, what's the update on the competitive pricing environment? I think it had heated up a little bit going back a couple of months, but yet I would think as we go forward here and things normalize that we would see that calm down quite a bit. And then, secondly, if I look at your U.S. Broadline EBIT up 6.4%, is there any way to kind of parse through what that might be in a more normal inflation environment? Would it be the same but have different components, or would it be different?
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Good morning, John. On that competitive environment, I would say pretty much what we've been saying. The competitive environment remains very acute and comes in all forms of competitors, large, small...
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Yeah.
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: ...local, regional, et cetera, national, that kind of thing. As far as I think what you're getting at, some of our larger competitors, they're on different stages right now in terms of where they are in developing and driving out their strategic plans and that type of thing. So I would say generally, John, the competitive environment remains very competitive, but reasonably rational. And yet at the same time, I would tell you in any given day, in any given market, there's probably some volatility and probably some inconsistencies with what I'm just telling you there. But I don't think a big change from when we would've talked a few months ago. As far as the U.S. Broadline's concerned, it's good question, I would say to you – let me, without the deflation, honestly, I would just tell you it would have been much better, or at least somewhat better without the deflation. We had good gross profit growth, as I said, even with deflation, very good case growth and we managed the margins well. We've got work to do, John. So we still have work to do on the expense side here, in all parts of our business, and we're beginning to make some strides there. But I would say, without the deflation, the U.S. Broadline would have been – probably had somewhat of a stronger performance.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC: And then, just as a follow-up to that, when you think about your long-term targets, I mean, it strikes me that with all you're doing on revenue management and kind of where you've been, gross margin – and I guess this was hit on a little bit during the Analyst Day, but gross could surprise to the upside, the other piece, right, as it holding SG&A growth to 3% seems a little tough if you're seeing some case growth. At the end of the day, do you – I mean, the 1% spread, that's the goal. Do you think it's pretty likely that that spread holds? But it's possible that we see both the gross profit and SG&A growing some – a fair bit faster than that, or that seems unlikely?
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I think it just depends. I mean, right now, deflation is somewhat of a headwind as it relates to the gross profit growth. And there's a lot of things, as you know, John, that impact margin from macro events to mix, and all that type of thing. I think what I'm conveying to you today is a lot of these initiatives that we've taken on over last two years or three years are beginning to bear fruit, whether it's how we manage our sales force, rolling out CatMan, continuing to work on the brand in the right way in conjunction with CatMan, and early days of revenue management which manifests itself in a lot of different ways. So I'm feeling good about our ability to manage margin. I think what you heard us say at the Analyst Day or the Investor Day, there's things we don't control. So right now our GP was up – it was up what it was up overall, was up nicely in the U.S. Broadline. But I would – we're not at that spread right now overall. So I would say to you the plan here is to get back to that spread of at least 1% between gross profit dollar growth and expense growth. And what do we need to do to do that? We need to maintain the momentum we've got on local case growth, we've got to continue to manage those gross margins well, and we do need to get our expense increases to a lower level.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Meredith Adler from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if there were any particular initiatives you were using to drive the locally-managed case growth? And then, I have one other quick question.
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think it's a lot of things, Meredith. If you recall the Investor Day, Tom Bené spoke, he took you through a lot of different strategies and processes that we're doing. I would say under Tom's leadership, there's some basic things, there's a very tight cadence of meetings between him and his market leadership in the field, weekly, monthly, quarterly, that type of thing. So we've got good continuity there. Some of the segmentation work that Tom spoke to, both in terms of customer segmentation, product category opportunities, those are – looking for opportunities within every cell that we operate in, whether it's geographically across customer segments, we talked about Hispanic, we talked about potential more opportunity in the local fresh area, that type of thing. But also just basic things where you sit down, as a management team, whether it's locally or through the CatMan group and look at categories that you may be underpenetrated in. So we've got good alignment around good basic business principles, good connectivity between what we're doing here at corporate into the market and then obviously where it all happens in the field. And I will also tell you, CatMan continues to help. It's going to – as it matures in terms of some of the sourcing aspects of it, it's going to help us, I think, create more momentum on innovation and, over time, optimizing our SKU count as we strike the right balance between reducing SKUs where we have redundancies, but also broadening our SKUs for some of the items that may be new or maybe don't move quite as fast, but they're particularly important to customers. So a lot of it's process and a lot of it's, again, going back to these commercial initiatives that we've been developing and employing here over the last two years or three years.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.: So is it – are these changes, or would you say just getting some things that you've started working on sort of coming to fruition?
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It's both. So if you go back and so the – some of the sales tools and that type of thing we've been using for three years or more, they're beginning to mature; CatMan has been out there for two years or three years. But the revenue management work is really just beginning. And so we're in various stages on all these. I think probably the biggest thing right now, outside of that, Meredith, is I just feel we have really good alignment right now across that whole triangle we took you through between facing up, where it matters most which is at the customer level, supporting that in the market and then continuing to develop good tools here, but field-ready tools and we're getting better at that.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And then just my quick sort of follow-up question is, I noticed again this quarter you had added back some severance costs and I was wondering was there some kind of a severance program or a layoff program somewhere in the company that you hadn't specifically called out?
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We have some ongoing opportunities there. I'll let Joel speak.
Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, Meredith, this is Joel. I'd call that more just on a normal basis. There's nothing significant that happened there.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.: So they're added back for what reason, if they're ongoing?
Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: They're added back because I think as we go through this transformation, Meredith, there's going to be some peaks and valleys on that line and right now we're in a little bit of a valley, which is nice. But it's – again, we're transforming here a $45 billion, $50 billion company that's been in business for 40 years. So we'll continue to optimize our workforce.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I see. Okay, thank you.
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah.
Operator: And next from Jefferies, we have Mark Wiltamuth. Please go ahead.
Mark Gregory Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC: Hi. Good morning. Wanted to just kind of find out where some of the weakness is here, because if your Broadline business is 90% of profits and that was up 6.4%, and SYGMA was actually modestly profitable, where is the big missing link here to get you down to a flat operating income performance? Is there some sizeable international losses, or just non-core businesses that are weaker?
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I would say most of our businesses perform very well. There's a couple that didn't. I wouldn't say those are overly material to your question. As I mentioned in my comments, we've got some planned expense increases at corporate, largely in the business technology area. We talked about this over the last couple calls. We had some projects that we're going down the road in anticipation of US Foods merger on some opportunities here that we think are very compelling, especially in the customer-facing side of the business. And so we've continued on with those and that's created, on a year-over-year basis, a bigger delta on the expense side of corporate. And Joel mentioned, we took a hit on some long-term incentives here because of the stock performance. So it's a little bit of everything, but it's mostly corporate, some of which was planned, some of which was just kind of the mark-to-market, if you will, of the LTI.
Mark Gregory Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC: Okay.
Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: As well as the foreign exchange impact, just as a reminder.
Mark Gregory Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC: Okay. And this – over time, is there going to be some normalization of the corporate expenses now that you're kind of not pursuing US Foods? And maybe can you give us an arc on what that spending looks like?
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I would answer that in the context of all expenses. And so again, as we continue to evolve here as a company, there's certainly a corporate group and there's markets and OpCos, but we look at optimizing the spend throughout. And so if you go back to those four levers I talked about, the last two levers are really about optimizing our expense management and so there's significant opportunity there, we believe, both on the supply chain side as well as on the administrative side and we're working through that now. You saw some of it on supply chain side this quarter. We had a pretty good quarter there. And on the administrative side, those are more thoughtful processes that we need to go through and we'll communicate those to you over the next few months.
Mark Gregory Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Thank you.
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you.
Operator: And following, we have Edward Kelly from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead, sir.
Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi, guys. Good morning. Hey, Bill, just a follow-up on the cost control side. Your expense growth up in the 3% range and, clearly, just looking at the way that you reported U.S. Broadline performance, there were some expenses in here that sound like over time should eventually kind of roll off. How should we think about SG&A growth over the next few quarters? And then, over time, is there an ability to grow SG&A at a slower rate than what it's growing at today? Because the case growth was pretty good, you had 3% SG&A growth, but there's a lot of corporate spend in there. If you could just sort of help us put it all together in terms of how we should be thinking about this?
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Thanks, Ed. The way I would be thinking about both the way we laid out our three-year goals as well as the way this year's plan is targeted is, in that three-year plan we said it wouldn't be linear, this year's not going to be linear, and there's less of a trajectory, if you will, in the operating income in the first year than there is in year-two and year-three. The short answer to your question is, yes. I think as we get into breaking down those costs, especially, I don't really want to call them SG&A, I'm just going to call them administrative costs regardless of what part of the business they're in. Whether they're locally or corporate or in between and whether they're purely admin or just administrative in nature, you should expect to see those numbers – that growth to – that curve to become more shallow as we go forward. What I was saying on the earlier question was we did plan in some meaningful technology spend this year to finish off some projects that we had started with the merger that are very compelling from a customer-facing standpoint, but also have significant costs. And so that's driving a lot of that expense delta here right now. So I was pleased with the overall cost per piece in the business. The corporate department's actually managed their expenses fine. We have the technology spend and then we had this other issue here on the incentive accrual. So short answer to your question is, it will begin to grow at a slower rate, and that's probably going to take us another couple quarters to give you some visibility to that.
Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. But then after that, shouldn't like the true performance of Broadline's, which is really what you're trying to communicate here, should be more evident?
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Correct.
Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. And then just a follow-up for you here. It's been a few months, I guess, at least, since Trian's become more involved with the company and, at the Analyst Day, you had kind of suggested that there hadn't really been too much, I guess, influence yet. I was just curious as to whether you could provide some update in terms of the impact they're having on your business and the way you think about things strategically, if at all, yet?
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, sure. Well, I think at the Analyst Day, they had just come on (30:54) the board, I think, within a week or two that – or two or three weeks at least of that day. So I don't want to speak for them, but they've been doing – continuing to do their work. So they've pulled a lot of data and they're looking at a lot of information, they're visiting facilities, they're meeting with our management team, that type of thing. Their first real board meeting is our board meeting in November. And I'm sure we'll, at that point, between now and then and then after that, get better clarity on their thoughts in more detail and the breadth of their thoughts. And as board members, we'll work through it appropriately.
Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thanks guys.
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you.
Operator: And following, we have Karen Short from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey. Thanks for taking my question. I had just two housekeeping questions and then a bigger picture question. Can you give us the case volume growth including SYGMA? That used to be a metric that you gave us, just wondering if you could give us that again?
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We can get that for you, Karen. The only reason we don't show that anymore is because, obviously, we're going through some transition with SYGMA, so we don't think it's overly reflective of what's going on in the company. But if we can't give it to you in the call, we'll get back to you.
Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And the second housekeeping I just had is, do you have the private label penetration as a percent of sales at the local level? Is it fairly consistent with the Broadline number that you have in your press release, or is it lower, higher?
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We track it that way, but because you have customers that transition back and forth. Generally they go one way into pure Street to local contract to corporate-managed. We think looking at it in total is better. So I would say generally we're seeing a comparable growth with the local business as well.
Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then I guess just a bigger picture question. I guess, obviously, you've told us a lot about how you plan to focus on local customers, and it obviously sounds like the right strategy. But is there anything about Sysco specifically that give you a competitive advantage in capturing and retaining the customer? And I guess I'm asking because it's obviously a higher margin customer, so that strategically makes sense. But I mean, it doesn't make sense that all your competitors are going to be doing the same thing? So what is it about Sysco that makes you more attractive as a supplier or affords you better retention? Any color on that would be great.
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Karen, I didn't understand, can you just restate the first part of your question? What is it about Sysco, is that what you're asking?
Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, it just seems obvious that everyone should be going after the higher margin customer, which is the local customer. So all your competitors are doing the same thing, I would assume. So is there anything specifically about Sysco that would help you retain or capture a customer or have better success at capturing that customer and retaining them versus your competitors?
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Well, I think there's a lot of things. I mean, I think it's not like we just started doing that, okay, we've been doing it for 45 years. Half of that $50 billion we do, roughly half of that is with local or Street, a little bit more if you go to local. So it's the DNA of the company. It's in our – it's woven into the fabric of this company. It's how we've grown to where we are today. I think the point we made at Investor Day is with some of the challenges we've had in the macro environment and the acute – the increased competition that came from 2009, simultaneously with us driving out a heck of a lot of transformational change. We've struggled over the last few years until last year to drive the local case growth. So it's nothing new, it's just something we haven't done as well as we would have liked over the last few years, and there's reasons for that. So in terms of why Sysco? I think it starts with our sales force. We've got 7,000 marketing associates across the country. Our structure that we continue to find ways to optimize, but one of the reasons we've remained very local is because, as I said many times, about two-thirds of our revenue stream comes from customers whose decision makers are domiciled within 100 miles, 150 miles of that operating company. So that creates a need, not just for local sales representation, but for local leadership with our presidents and senior teams there. So I think our geographic footprint, the talent of our operating teams, the experience and the breadth of our sales force, all these new things that we've been talking about earlier on the call on the commercial initiative side, from CatMan to rev man to segmentation, listening to our customers in a much more effective way through over the last three or four years, that have led to increased loyalty. The fact that we had the courage to take on transforming this company at a time – key inflection point in our country and in our industry, we're one of the few people in our industry that has taken on this kind of change. So I think the fact that we're forward-looking and we've got great people and we've got great strategy, I think those are all reasons why we should continue to have a lot of success.
Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.
Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: And, Karen, this is Joel. Just the total Broadline plus SYGMA case growth was 2.4% for the quarter, as a follow-up.
Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Vincent Sinisi from Morgan Stanley.
Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks very much for taking my question. Just wanted to go back to inflation and deflation, what you're seeing on a category basis. I know that the slight deflation you call as center of the plate and dairy primarily, but how was that relative to your internal expectations for this quarter? And then has anything more recently changed? I know that you said kind of for the next few months, just maybe a little bit more color on how you see the inflation/deflation outlook this year?
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, Vinnie, I'll start and then let Joel kind of tighten it up a little bit. I would say what's different is there's just a little more deflation than maybe what we would have expected three months ago when we were on this call in U.S. Broadline, and it appears to be lasting longer. And so I would tell you it's probably going to get a little worse before it gets better. We're seeing that early part of this quarter, and I think it could be with us at least into the third quarter. Joel?
Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. And I guess the other thing I'd just remind you of, again, we certainly think about inflation in our business by category. And so, again, many of the categories we have are relatively flat and then so some of the volatility we're seeing really is in a couple categories. It's a little bit harder to see where that's headed, but again as Bill mentioned, it certainly feels like it's going to get a little bit worse before it gets better as we move throughout the rest of this year.
Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks, guys. And as a quick follow-up, at your Analyst Day you had made a quick mention of you doing some work with Kroger and some of its fresh products, I know that obviously that's probably pretty small at this point. But maybe just any kind of early reads or color on the scope and if that overall initiative is something that you could see expanding going forward?
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Vinnie, I think what we said was, we're just beginning to do that work and it's just been a few weeks. So, so far so good, early days, but we're very excited about the opportunity.
Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: All right. Thanks, Bill.
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you.
Operator: And following, we have Andrew Wolf from BB&T Capital Markets.
Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets: Hi. Good morning. On the 2% local case growth, do you have a feel for how you would split that between what the market's giving you in terms of growth, maybe with independents having positive same-store sales, if they are, versus how much share you might be taking?
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, that'd be difficult, Andy. Certainly, as I said at the Investor Day, the market environment, even today's comments, there's not a lot of consistency to it. But I think when you look at it in the context of where we were five years or six years ago, or even two years or three years ago, we're in a better market environment. So I'm sure that's helping everybody to some degree, but I certainly would think that we're taking share with 2% growth. And we update those numbers about once a year.
Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets: Okay. On the Broadline, the preview to the segment numbers, could you give us a sense of what the sales were up in U.S. Broadline?
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'm not following you. What's the question?
Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets: I'm sorry. You gave us U.S. Broadline operating profit, you gave us all the – sort of the mini P&L except for the sales increase on the U.S. Broadline. And just so we could get a sense of where the leverage was, sort of back of the envelope I got to a little over 3%. Is that about right?
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Let us dig for that and we'll come back to you on that one, too.
Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets: Again, I just wanted to follow up on, when Joel was talking about the other income, because fourth quarter was even a bigger number than this quarter. And to be honest, I didn't quite understand what you meant by the elimination of some non-Sysco portion and what that meant. So first it's – the last two quarters combined, it's added $0.03 to EPS, about $0.01 this and about $0.02 last quarter. So is this something that's going to be a meaningful or smallish meaningful part of earnings going forward? Or do we just get two more quarters of some kind of change in accounting?
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I would just tell you it's line item gymnastics and then I'll let Joel kind of take it from there.
Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. The way I would think about that, again, it's joint ventures that are reported on a consolidation method. So if you look at each one of the lines in sales, gross profit, expenses, operating income, up above the operating income line, they're consolidated and then below the line the portion that's, I'll say, the non-Sysco, the part that we don't own is backed out. So if you net out all of it between the above the line and below the line, it's a relatively small number, but that's the way the accounting works and that's why that part of it shows up in the other income. Hope that helps?
Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets: Okay.
Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. There's a non-majority ownership, in other words, and then so the whole thing's reported up above and then the minority, the part that we don't own, is backed out down below.
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Andy, and the U.S. Broadline sales, looks like it's a little over 2%.
Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets: Little over 2%. Okay, thank you. I'll just talk to you offline about the other income thing. Thanks.
Operator: And our next question is from Ajay Jain from Pivotal Research Group.
Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC: Oh, boy, thanks. I just had a question about some of the cost-cutting opportunities. It seemed like at your investor conference one of the major themes was you've got a very growth-oriented outlook. And I understand that it's very early in your three-year planning process and that it's not a linear runway. But just from a cost-cutting perspective, where do you see the addressable opportunity and what are some of the major pockets, if you can talk about that? And then as a related question, like could you significantly reduce some of the variable costs like payroll costs without hurting your sales? So to what extent is that an issue in relation to your three-year outlook? Thanks.
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, Ajay, I think what we certainly attempted to convey at the Investor Day was we need to continue to grow. We believe we can grow profitably and take share in the right way, but it needs to be more targeted growth than what we've seen over the past. We need a little more balance between the corporate-managed growth and the local growth. And it's not that we don't want corporate-managed growth, we do, we just need to see a little bit more balance there. So I think on the cost cutting, the way I actually look at it in terms of running a business, we'll go to your last question, which is to cut costs, there's no trophies for cutting costs, right? So to cut costs and to do it in a way where you don't anticipate what the downside would be, would be somewhat foolish on our part. And that's why we're taking some time here on the administrative cost side to go through and look at the work, look at the prioritization of the work, look at the sequencing of the work, look at the structure, look at how much we still need to do on the technology side, for example, to continue to be up there in front with our customers and be responsive to their needs. So what we're doing right now is prioritizing all that in a way that we need to put it together in a fiscally responsible way and then we'll bring it back to you and to our customer base and to our associates in the most balanced way that we can and in the least risky way that we can. So certainly, if we were to go out and cut back dramatically on customer-facing technology support or customer-facing associates, that wouldn't be very smart way to proceed here. So we're proceeding – we see opportunity, as I've said multiple times now, in all parts of the business. Where you're seeing us focused primarily right now is on supply chain and the administrative side. And I think over the next couple quarters, we'll be able to give you more visibility to that.
Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC: Great. Thank you.
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take Kelly Bania from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Kelly A. Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I was just curious as you look at your case growth, either local or in total, if you could talk about any of the trends that you're seeing there, either product types or categories that are really working well? And I guess, somewhat related to that, many restaurants and QSRs have recently announced plans to transition their proteins towards antibiotic-free, and I was just curious if you could talk about how you're positioned against that trend with both your customers and suppliers?
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Kelly, it's Bill. I think on the first part of the question, if you go back and look over the last two or three years and look at where our growth has come out, I think we've done a really nice job in building out the center of the plate. So in particular, those protein items that you're talking about, whether it's meat, seafood, poultry, and even the produce and dairy, along the way, so continue to, I think, see good opportunity there. A lot of it's fresh, not all of it though. I think it's still a little early to tell. We certainly acknowledge and are reacting and trying to be as proactive as possible in terms of some of the accelerating trends as it relates to the local and the organic and that type of thing as well as the ethnic opportunities. I would tell you those are real trends and meaningful and very important to our customers. I don't know that I can tell you today that that's really driving substantial dollars, but certainly it's an area where we need to be going forward. I think your second question, I probably need to do a little more work on. I think we've had some good initiatives going on, both on the merchandising side of our business, in particular in conjunction with CatMan, in the sustainability area, and we're putting more resources into those. So let us come back to you on that in terms of how all that winds up going forward.
Kelly A. Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States): That's helpful. And then just on deflation, I think last year when inflation was running quite a bit higher, there was some difficulty in passing all those on. Could you just talk about how deflation impacted your gross margin in the quarter? Was there any lag in passing that along? Was that helpful to the gross margin? Or I guess it depends on the category, but any color you could provide there?
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I get this question a lot and I'm going to stay consistent with what I've always said. The ideal place for us to be would be to have two to three points of inflation across every category. I mean, that's as good as it gets, I've never seen it in 27 years of doing this. But that would be very good. And why is that? That's because history tells you and the data tells you that most of our customers are able to pass that type of increase along in a reasonably manageable way, and in a way that works for their business. So 2% to 3% overall would be fine. When it gets up over that, 4%, 5%, 6%, that's not good for our customers, and that's when it starts to also make it difficult for us to pass that much along on a timely basis. Deflation would be the least attractive of all of those. It probably does – it certainly does help your margin to some extent in terms of the percentage. But as we all understand, you're taking fewer dollars to the bank to pay bills. So it puts a lot of pressure on your expenses along the way. So deflation, we haven't seen a lot of it. We did some work on this. I think over the last decade, we've only had deflation a couple times and I think it's ranged from, in one instance, 0.25% or so, in another instance, maybe up to 0.75%. We think we'll probably be on the longer end of that this time around. But it's a challenging environment. But I will tell you, I think we're doing a good job, striking the right balance in terms of managing that down in a way that works for the customer, but still is working for us, and I think you saw that in the numbers this quarter.
Kelly A. Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Got it. And then just one other question. You talked in the beginning about some of the economic factors being somewhat mixed overall, but then you mentioned, I think, that there was a pretty sharp pullback in confidence among restaurant operators. And I was just curious you had any color on what you think drove that or what maybe you're hearing from your customers about why that would be?
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I think what we said on the restaurant part of it was it went back to kind of where we were about a year ago. So I mean it's still much improved over the last three or four years, both in consumer confidence and in those NRA statistics. We're almost back to where we were in 2009. Again, that's 2009, so need to put that in some context. It's hard to pinpoint. Look, restaurant operators, they're people like all of us. So I think when you see a stock market going up and down with that kind of volatility, it makes people nervous, and that could be part of it. What we're really telling you is there didn't seem to be any discernible medium-term trend. It's up for a quarter or two and then it's down and then back up again. So overall, in the context of looking back two, three, four years, it's much better. It's just hard to see a pattern here.
Kelly A. Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Great. Thank you.
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan.
John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you. Just actually a quick follow-up on your comments on the industry. Could you talk a little bit about, if it's appropriate, October? And I ask this, whether it's casual dining or even some fast casual that there was some apparent slowdown in October relative to previous months. Is that something that you're seeing in terms of your Street and Broadline accounts as well?
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Actually, I haven't seen a lot of October data yet, John. Our trends are pretty similar to what we saw in the first quarter. As I said, deflation has accelerated a little bit more, but we're not seeing any big change. It's tough for us week-to-week. Holidays fall on different weeks or days and that kind of thing, but I would just tell you sitting here, I can't tell you there's been any big shift in demand or anything like that.
John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: And thank you for that. Then secondly, obviously, the restaurant industry gets the opposite of what it was a couple of years ago where there's no labor inflation and there is significant commodity inflation. So as you think about the pricing environment as you can pass on pricing to your restaurant customers as your own labor costs are higher. Do you think we're in an environment that could be modestly better from a pricing environment relative to what we've seen before?
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'm sorry, could it be what?
John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Are we in an environment where you can pass on more pricing to restaurant customers than you could before? I mean, I understand that you are – the pricing of your products coming in through your back door is deflationary, but is this a potentially better pricing environment from Sysco into the restaurant customers as restaurant customers are seeing (51:08)?
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I don't know about that. I think what you're hearing from us is we begin to develop a real revenue management process as there's opportunities for us with analytics in terms of the segmentation we're doing, both across product categories as well as customers. There's opportunities for us to be smarter and more consistent and to be more on the market in terms of what's important to our customers. So I think that's the bigger opportunity. I was with a customer the other day, and you were pointing out labor, it's the biggest thing we hear today from every customer we talk to, and you see it in the press. There's a labor shortage out there. They're having to adjust their cost structure accordingly. And I think that actually does the opposite of your question, it puts a little more pressure on us on pricing because they're always looking for opportunities to manage their costs. But overall, I'd say it's not a bad environment right now from a pricing standpoint, other than the deflation aspect of it.
John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Understood. Thank you.
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay.

William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Neil. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Sysco's financial results announced this morning reflect a year of solid operating performance, an excellent progress in several key initiatives that have begun to provide a strong foundation for value creation. Our favorable operating performance was driven by providing our customers with exceptional service, growing our business with both locally and corporate-managed customers, and stabilizing our gross margins. For the year, we achieved record sales of $49 billion, an increase of 5%. We grew our adjusted operating income and earnings per share by 3% and 5%, respectively. We generated $1 billion in free cash flow. We earned a return on invested capital of 13% on an adjusted basis. We increased our dividend for the 46th time in our history and distributed nearly $700 million in dividends to our shareholders. In addition and subsequent to the end of our fiscal year, we announced a $3 billion, two-year share buyback program that will more effectively leverage our strong balance sheet and return additional capital to shareholders. It is important to note that these accomplishments were achieved with minimal disruption from the U.S. Foods merger planning and litigation processes that continued throughout the entire fiscal year. And I'm extremely appreciative and proud of all of our associates who performed so well on multiple fronts. Moving to our performance in the fourth quarter, we are encouraged by the following; we generated case growth of 3.6% in our Broadline business. Gross profit grew 3% in an environment with no food cost inflation and gross margin expanded by 35 basis points compared to prior-year. Expense management trends improved from earlier in the year, and our cost per case in our North American Broadline operations was essentially flat compared to the prior-year on a constant currency basis. Key drivers of our improved operating performance for both the year and the fourth quarter were following: increasing acceleration of local case growth; effective implementation of our category management process; improved Sysco brand penetration, especially with locally managed customers; significant progress in developing and growing our offerings for the Hispanic customer segment; collaborative and mutually beneficial joint business planning processes with a small, but growing number of corporate-managed accounts. One other meaningful factor that impacted our financial results was the degree of volatility and food cost inflation. We experienced nearly 5% food cost inflation during the first three quarters of 2015 and we managed it very well. However, food cost inflation in the fourth quarter was essentially flat, which unfavorably impacted sales and gross profit growth. Early trends in fiscal 2016 are similar, and we expect this to be a modest sales and gross profit headwind over the next quarter or two. We are committed to mitigate as much of this pressure as possible through ongoing gross margin stabilization efforts and improved expense management. Moving to market and economic trends, as I speak to you today, the data is mixed. Consumer confidence and the outlook of food service operators are at historically high levels, but have slipped somewhat in the summer months. Fuel prices at the pump remain at historically attractive levels, which should support higher consumer spending moving forward. Restaurant spend is up, but traffic is generally flat. Overall, the market environment appears to be modestly improved from a year or two ago, but it is unclear what the go-forward trajectory for the industry growth is over the next several quarters. Whether the overall industry grows over the next few years at 1% real growth, consistent with the past few years or closer to the 2% in Technomic's recently released five-year forecast. We at, Sysco, will continue to differentiate our products and service offerings in a manner that will allow us to both profitably grow our market share and provide an improved return on invested capital for our shareholders. I will offer some additional color in our future opportunities after Chris shares his perspective on our financial results for the year and the fourth quarter.
Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by providing some highlights of our financial performance in 2015. Then, I'll discuss our results for the fourth quarter, and I'll close with some guidance for fiscal 2016 around a few metrics. For the year, sales gross profits and adjusted operating expenses all grew about 5%. Sales and gross profits benefited from high food cost inflation in the first half of the year, but were constrained in the back half as that inflation moderated and eventually disappeared. Expenses were growing too fast early in the year, but were being supported by high gross profit growth. Expense growth moderated in the back half of the year, especially in the fourth quarter. Our adjusted EPS also grew by about 5% this year. One thing to note is that our diluted shares for the year increased 1.1%, because we did not repurchase shares while the merger was pending as we typically would have done. If we had held our diluted shares flat, it would have added approximately $0.02 to our adjusted EPS and 1% to our EPS growth rate. We achieved several of our objectives during the year. We exceeded our final three-year target for annualized business transformation benefits. Our successful implementation of category management helped to enhance gross profits and mitigate gross margin pressure. For the year, gross margin was flat compared to 2014, after declining in each of the last four fiscal years. We continued our prudent management of capital expenditures with net CapEx of $518 million falling well within our guidance range of $500 million to $550 million. We recorded another year of significant growth in free cash flow on an adjusted basis, which grew to $1.3 billion, up 22% over the last year. With regards to cost per case, we achieved our revised goal of limiting the increase to $0.05 to $0.10 for the full year. Actual cost per case increased $0.09 per case for the full-year on a constant currency basis and decreased $0.01 in the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year. It's important to note that our original objective, when we started the year, was to hold cost per case flat for the year. Because we didn't achieve our original goal, we also did not achieve our goal of growing operating expenses slower than gross profit for the year. As the operating expenses were up 4.8% versus a gross profit increase of 4.5%. However, we were able to improve our cost per case performance in the second half of the year and achieved our goal in the fourth quarter, where operating expenses grew by 2.2% compared to gross profit growth of 3%. Let's turn our attention now to our fourth quarter results. Year-over-year sales growth decelerated to 9% as food cost inflation declined significantly from 5.4% in the first half of the year and 3.7% in the third quarter to flat in the fourth quarter. During the quarter, we saw relatively modest inflation in the meat, poultry and frozen categories; but produce, seafood and dairy were deflationary. Changes in foreign exchange rates continue to have a much larger impact than usual in the fourth quarter. The strengthening dollar depressed our foreign sales as we converted them to U.S. dollars, and as a result decreased sales by 1.4%. Acquisitions increased sales by 0.4% in the quarter. Broadline and SYGMA case volume grew 2.2% during the quarter including acquisitions and 1.9% excluding acquisitions. This result includes a decline in SYGMA's case volume as we work to optimize that business. Broadline case growth, which excludes SYGMA, was 3.6% reflecting our solid performance with both locally and corporate-managed accounts. We are especially encouraged that local case growth in our U.S. Broadline business has grown sequentially in each of the last five quarters. Gross profit in the fourth quarter was $2.2 billion, a 3% increase, while gross margin increased 35 basis points to 17.9%. Our U.S. Broadline business was responsible for the majority of this increase, driven by a stronger relative mix of sales for our locally managed business, benefits from category management and a very effective national promotion for our Sysco-branded products. Case growth for our corporate-managed customers remained strong, but competitive pricing in this segment pressured overall gross margin. Expenses for certain items in the fourth quarter totaled roughly $430 million, almost entirely related to the termination of the U.S. Foods merger. This included non-cash accruals for the two breakup fees paid to U.S. Foods and PFG totaling $313 million; $67 million in litigation fees and other integration planning expenses, interest on merger debt of $41 million, and then $11 million write-off on merger integration capital. This was capital we spent on projects that would only be useful if the merger was completed. The vast majority of the merger-related capital we spent will benefit the company as we move forward. We've included a table in our slide presentation to show the expense impact of these items. I will provide more details about the impact to our 2016 financials in a few minutes. Adjusted operating expenses for the fourth quarter increased $36 million or 2%, mainly driven by the impact of higher case volumes, which increased our payroll and more specifically incentive compensation accruals. As I mentioned earlier, we made progress in reducing our cost per case during the quarter. Cost per case was down $0.01 on a constant currency basis and down $0.07 when we include the impact from foreign exchange translation. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $509 million, up 5.8% from the prior year. And adjusted operating margin was 4.1%, up 19 basis points from last year. Turning to other income, there was an $18 million increase from last year, mainly driven by accounting for our JV transactions, where we consolidate 100% of the JV's results above the operating income line and then back out the non-controlling interest in other income/expense. Our tax rate for the quarter was negative, primarily driven by the merger termination fees. Adjusting for these fees and other certain items, our tax rate for the quarter would have been closer to 38%. Adjusted net earnings for the quarter increased 5.7% to $309 million, and adjusted EPS increased 6.1% to $0.52. Cash flow performance for the year was again very strong. Cash flow from operations increased $63 million to $1.6 billion, while free cash flow increased $42 million to $1 billion. Both operating and free cash flow reflect the negative impact of two items. First, the cash impact of certain items was $231 million in fiscal 2015, mainly due to merger-related expenses. Second, as we disclosed earlier this year, we made a $50 million pension contribution this year compared to none in the prior-year period. This difference is simply driven by different timing regarding when we make cash contributions each year. After adjusting for these items, free cash flow was $280 million higher, or $1.3 billion in fiscal year 2015. Capital expenditures for the year net of proceeds from asset sales increased $21 million to $518 million, well within our guidance and internal budgets. During the year we significantly increased our investment in business technology as we were planning for the merger integration. While the vast majority of these additional investments will benefit the company, even without the merger, we wrote off $11 million, as I mentioned previously. We were pleased that our adjusted ROIC grew 70 basis points to 13.1% in fiscal 2015, reflecting the continued prudent and disciplined investments in our business and solid operating performance during the year. Finally, a housekeeping item to point out in our segment reporting; we have reclassified our specialty meat company results out of the Broadline segment and into the Other segment, as these operations are no longer reporting to our Broadline leadership. We've provided a schedule in the earnings release this morning to show the quarterly and full-year impact of this reclassification to both fiscal 2014 and 2015. Looking ahead, I'd like to provide guidance for a few metrics to set expectations for the coming year. First, fiscal year 2016 will be a 53-week fiscal year for us, with the extra week falling in the fourth fiscal quarter. Second, as Bill mentioned, we are starting the year off with little to no food cost inflation, which will create a modest sales and gross profit headwind over the next quarter or two. Third, we will recognize additional merger-related expenses totaling $95 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. These will include: $50 million related to the payment of the 1% call premium on the merger debt, which was redeemed in July; a $29 million write-off of professional fees related to the issuance of the merger debt; an $18 million write-off of the bond discounts on the merger debt; a $10 million gain on the termination of the interest rate swaps we put in place upon issuing the merger debt; and $8 million in interest expense incurred leading up to the July 14, 2015 redemption of the merger-related debt. These amounts will all be classified as certain items in the first quarter. The negative cash impact of certain items during the first quarter of fiscal 2016 will total approximately $350 million, including: $313 million reflecting the payment of the break fees accrued this quarter; $500 million for the bond redemption premium; partially offset by approximately $15 million in proceeds related to the gain on the termination of our interest rate swaps. Fourth, we expect to issue $2 billion in new debt around the end of the first quarter to fund both the accelerated share repurchases announced previously as well as term out a portion of our commercial paper facility. Adjusted interest expense for 2016 will be significantly higher because of this. Additionally, prior to issuing our merger debt in October of 2014, we entered into swaps that locked in a portion of the interest rates. These swaps were settled in fiscal 2015, and we expect to amortize about $10 million of that interest expense in fiscal 2016. The share repurchase program we announced will positively impact EPS in fiscal 2016. Because of the timing of the buyback implementation, we don't expect to realize a full year's benefit from the reduction of shares in fiscal 2016. We anticipate a benefit of approximately $0.03 to $0.04 to diluted EPS in fiscal 2016, driven by a 4% to 5% reduction in average shares outstanding, partially offset by higher interest expense on the new debt issuance. In fiscal 2017, we would expect to capture the full-year impact of this buyback on an annualized basis. Fifth, with regards to taxes, a normalized tax rate for Sysco would typically be in the range of 36% to 37%. And lastly, our forecast for capital expenditures, net of proceeds, for asset sales is $550 million to $600 million for fiscal 2016. Now, I'll turn it back to Bill for closing remarks.
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Chris. While pleased with our progress and accomplishments in fiscal 2015, we recognize that there's still much work to do, if we are to fully realize our vision for Sysco to be our customers' most valued and trusted business partner. The good news is that we have a sound strategy that is predicated on profoundly enriching the experience of doing business with Sysco, enhancing productivity and innovation in all aspects of our business, attracting and developing the best people available and exploring opportunities for growth within and beyond our core business. The better news is that we have begun to realize the benefits of several years of transformative change to our business through a portfolio of strategic business initiatives. And the exciting news is that we are now beginning to embed these initiatives in how we do business each and every day by putting the customer first and working cohesively as one Sysco. Following the termination of the U.S. Foods merger agreement and utilizing the knowledge that we have acquired through our ongoing customer insights work, we have begun to update our three-year strategic business plan. Specifically, we see opportunities to further accelerate our case growth, especially with locally managed customers through more impactful product and service differentiation together with enhanced sales and technology capabilities. We also believe that we can build upon our recent success in stabilizing gross margin through enhanced product innovation, growing our Sysco brand sales and improving our pricing analytics and support. In addition, we see significant potential to improve our productivity and reduce overhead costs throughout our supply chain organization and in the administrative areas of our business. We will continue to invest in our business to fully realize these benefits and improve our return on invested capital over the next three years as well. We'll discuss these plans in more detail including financial impacts at our September 15, Investor Day. Lastly, as most of you know, this is Chris' last conference call with us. I'd like to thank Chris for his numerous contributions to Sysco over the past six years, and all of us at Sysco would like to wish Chris and his family the very best as they move forward. We also look forward to welcoming Joel into his new role in working with him as our CFO. And with that, operator, Chris and I will now take questions.
Operator: Thank you. And we'll go to our first question to Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse.
Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi, good morning, guys.
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, good morning, Ed.
Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Could we start with the cost control side? Your operating expense growth is better this quarter than it's been in a while, actually and congratulations on your flat number per case. Can you provide a little bit more color here on, basically, I guess, what you're doing within the business? And then Bill, not maybe to steal too much thunder from the Analyst Day, but when you talk about significant potential to improve productivity and reduce costs, could you maybe give us a little bit more insight into what you mean there?
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We won't steal too much thunder from Investor Day, so don't worry about that, Ed. I think on the cost side, the way I look at our numbers is, those of you who follow us know, I look at them in terms of what are the key things we look at here? Volume growth, in particular, relative to the market, and within that volume growth it's very important that we see good local case growth, and we've seen that here over the last several quarters. We need the contract business as well, but we need that local business to grow as well to drive profitability. And then I look at operating income growth, operating income is always going to be not just mathematically, but just from a business perspective, it's going to be a by-product of the environment that we're in. And at times, sometimes the gross profit will grow faster and sometimes the expenses will grow a little bit slower. And so, I think, any given quarter there's always things that move around that could impact the numbers. So, I think as you look at the year, I think I would say to you that basically what we said in the prepared comments, we're pleased with what we saw in the fourth quarter on the expense side, in particular, in the supply chain side of the business and really the business itself in the field, where we had flat cost per piece. Now for the year, we didn't. We were up almost a dime, and I would say to you we need to bring that number for the year back down into that flat – up a nickel zone. I'm not saying that we will or we won't, I'm just saying that that's kind of where the numbers ultimately need to get to, to drive the earnings growth. So, our plan to go to your earnings, to your Investor Day, Ed, our plan is to become more consistent in terms of how we do that and to take the quarter we saw here in the field and to begin to put that up quarter-after-quarter. Now with that said, I also said that we're going to continue to invest in the business here in terms of things that will drive some of the commercial initiatives that are really panning out for us now, both on the growth side as well as the merchandising side. So, it's always going to be a mix, I think, of timing of investment relative to what you think the value of it is. And bottom line, I would say, there's some things in the fourth quarter, for example, bad debt. We had an exceptional year of bad debt this year, knock on wood, please. So, that benefited our fourth quarter numbers as well as the year to some extent. So, I would say that somewhere between that 2% growth and the 4.8% is where we need to get to. And I would say to you in terms of Investor Day, I think what you're going to hear us say there Ed, is we're running a business here. It's very important that we accelerate our case growth. We see opportunities to do that, especially on the local side, that needs to turn into leveraging our operating income, which we did here in the fourth quarter, and we were up for the year. So, I look at the fourth quarter as hopefully a proxy for what we can do next year. Quarters are going to have their own unique volatility, and I would think that you'll hear a message from us that says that we have opportunity on all sides including the cost side. But, the big opportunity here is always going to be for a company with our capabilities, with our footprint, with our people and with our technology today to grow faster than the market and to do that profitably and to provide a good return on capital. So certainly, opportunities for cost reduction, they are significant, it'll take some time for that to play out, and we will talk about that more in Investor Day. But I don't want to leave this question without emphasizing how important it is for us to grow the business as we did this quarter. I mean, this is a quality quarter for us both in terms of growth, leverage, and the mix of that growth. And I think that's really what you're going to hear at Investor Day. It takes all facets of our business to be in sync for us to go where we want to go.
Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Thank you. And I'll let some other guys go on.
Operator: We'll go next to Karen Short with Deutsche Bank.
Ryan J. Gilligan - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, good morning. It's actually Ryan Gilligan on for Karen. How would you guys characterize the competitive environment now that the deal is behind us and inflation is moderating?
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I don't think the competitive environment has changed that much at all. I mean, there's still plenty of competitors out there of all types as we've talked about in great detail here over the last year or two. So, I would tell you, I think competition is very, very acute. In the short-term, the way I would look at inflation, we have for years said and truly believe that the optimal range of inflation for our customers, and for us, is probably in the 2% to maybe 3% range. That's a level that typically our customers can pass on and do pass on, and generally that's a level that the consumer will accept. So, when we're in those levels we're able to have the best of both worlds, if you will, in terms of a little bit of a tailwind on inflation at the same time. It doesn't hurt demand to any large extent. We very seldom find ourselves in that zone, and right now, we find ourselves in a zone where there's little to no inflation. As we said, there's some modest inflation and some modest deflation in the categories. So, I think the way I would look at that is, it's a little bit of a better environment right now in terms of our customer being able to manage their business, and when our costs aren't going up that much, obviously we don't have to raise our prices as much. So from that standpoint, it probably does help in terms of case growth, but in terms of the competitive environment, I don't really think it changes that at all.
Ryan J. Gilligan - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: That's helpful. Thanks. And then maybe, could you just talk about your labor cost outlook and if you think maybe there'll be a battle for talent going forward as U.S. Foods rebuilds its sales force?
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. We'll talk more about labor cost, I think on Investor Day. But generally, we've got 50,000 people out there and they generally get raises every year. And our whole goal as I was speaking to in Ed's question is, the closer we can get to improving our productivity every year in sync with the labor increase, the better chance we have of keeping that cost per case in that zone that I discussed earlier. I don't know that I would – look, good people are always in demand in this industry, and we have a lot of good ones. And so, our people are always going to have opportunities. I would tell you our retention has improved here in recent months as we've kind of matured in a lot of our transformation work, and I don't expect that to be a big issue for us in terms of retention. But, we work hard every day to provide our people with good careers, and we work hard every day to make sure that we're retaining our best people.
Operator: We'll go now to Andrew Wolf with BB&T Capital Markets. Mr. Wolf, your line is open. Please check your mute function. Hearing no response, we'll go to our next caller, Vincent Sinisi with Morgan Stanley.
Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. Thanks very much for taking my question, and Chris, best of luck to you.
Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thanks.
Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Wanted to ask, you mentioned about some of the technology investments that were made in preparing for when the merger was a possibility. Can you just give a little bit more color in terms of how that does play in with some of your former initiatives that you've been continuing to execute on and kind of what we can expect going forward?
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think, Vinny, the biggest that you can expect, and we will talk more about this at Investor Day as well, is while there's been tremendous emphasis, and appropriately so, on implementing SAP and where we are in that, we've kind of turned the corner there. So, on the one hand we've stabilized that system. We've improved the processes and we're moving more toward a modular rollout approach as opposed to an OpCo multi-modular rollout. And we're starting to see some good success there. And the most recent example would be in our inventory replenishment system, which internally we refer to as DPR. So, in terms of the base core business, I think we're in a more steady state and mature place there. We're running the business. We're running it well. We'll continue to improve that. But I think where you're going to see us go – and this is not so much a learning, but just a point of emphasis that came out from a lot of the planning work, is that we need to accelerate some of our work on the online mobile platform area. And we've got some things going on there that are very encouraging, and we will talk more about that. So anything we can do here to make it easier for our customers to order and order when they want to order and for our MAs to facilitate those orders would be a very high priority.
Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks, Bill, and just one other quick follow-up, if I may. In the prepared comments, you had mentioned about working specifically on the corporate managed front. Anything just to call out there?
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think the one thing I did call out is this joint business planning approach that we've taken, and it really requires a different approach to doing business because it does require more transparency. It requires a commitment that needs to be a win-win for both organizations and we're at that point. Over the last several years, we've worked very hard with all of our customers. But on the contract side, the large contract side, we're certainly trying to utilize our supply chain network and our footprint to optimize getting product to their facilities and to their restaurants in the most cost-efficient way possible. But there are some limitations to that until you really sit down and open it up a little bit more in terms of what each organization is willing to do. So what I'm getting at there is where it makes sense, and it's not always going to make sense. It depends on the nature of the relationship and the strategies of the respective companies. But we are starting to see some really nice progress with a couple key customers in particular, where by working together, we're able to reduce their costs and also reduce our costs at the same time, and – this is really the most important part – find ways to grow the business together. So more to come, but that is something that we've been working on quite a bit the last year or two years.
Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, very helpful. Thank you.
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You're welcome.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Mark Wiltamuth from Jefferies.
Mark G. Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC: Hi, thank you. I wanted to ask about the SYGMA decline in the quarter. It was down 8% on sales. If you could, maybe talk about how that impacted the gross margins because the mix there has changed and obviously SYGMA is one of your lower margin businesses. How much did it help the gross margin?
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: How much did SYGMA help the gross margin?
Mark G. Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC: No, the fact that that's down, so the mix is lower there for SYGMA.
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay, I'd say for the quarter a very, very modest impact, but probably some. I think to your broader question, SYGMA is in somewhat of a turnaround situation right now. We've got new leadership there at the top, Greg Keller, who knows that business very, very well. And this is a year where we went through some changes with customers. There was some business that we lost that we didn't want to lose. There was some business that we transitioned because it was the right thing for us and the customer. And then there was some business where we had to adjust our pricing, which hurt our margins somewhat. So there's a little bit of everything going on there. We also had some expense challenges there that we're working through. So this was not a great year for SYGMA, and I expect it to improve here as we go forward in the new year and in the following years. I would say overall, we're trying to optimize that customer base in a way that obviously needs to work for the customer as well as us. And I think you'll see some more of that next year, but I also think you'll start to see improvement next year – excuse me, in the current year.
Mark G. Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC: Were there notable losses that we need to carry forward as we model out Sysco in future quarters?
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'm not getting into specifics, but I would look more at the fourth quarter than the first three quarters probably.
Mark G. Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC: Okay, thank you.
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Meredith Adler with Barclays.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you for taking my question. Can you hear me?
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.: A quick question just first. You used to talk about street business, and now you're talking about locally managed. Do you think you could just tell us what the definition is? Is locally managed the same as street business?
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, Meredith, that's a great question. It's one of those questions we get from time to time. So no, it's not the same, but it's very close. What we did – this is about three years ago, Meredith. We changed our terminology internally to, frankly, bring a little bit more clarity and accountability to the ultimate responsibility for these customers. So locally managed business is business where the customer generally – and there are exceptions to every rule in Sysco – but generally the customer, the decision-maker of that customer is proximate; i.e., within the selling radius of that local operating company. So there's a high percentage of street business, but there's also a fair amount of what we call local contract business. And these would be chains. And they could be of different sizes. They could be local chains. They could be somewhat regional. They could even be across regions, and that's why I say there are exceptions. But, in our world, it's street business plus what we call local contract. And then corporate-managed business is your very large regional chains and your national and international customers, for that matter, where the relationships are largely managed from corporate here and generally with the customer. And then obviously, our operating companies are responsible for handling those relationships locally with the units and servicing those accounts. So that's as clear as I can make it, and there is some fuzziness there in the local contract. But the key is really how we look at the business and it's how we sign primary accountability for these customer relationships.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.: That makes sense. I just wonder when you talk about growth in the locally managed business, you could be talking about either small chains or business where it's contracted or business when you actually call on the customer. So the growth you talked about, is that coming from both kinds of locally managed business, or is there more growth in the independents?
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'd say it's coming from both kinds. This happened to be a year where we actually lost a couple of very large local contract customers that were spread across multiple OpCos, so that's in that fuzzy category, which we call them local contract because the history of those relationships is local, but they cross over multiple OpCos. But I would say generally and even currently that growth is coming from both.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, and then I just had one other quick question. I did notice that D&A was much lower this quarter than the recent run rate or lower than last year. Obviously, fourth quarter is a true-up period. Is there anything to comment on? And when you talk about cost per case, do you include D&A in cost per case, or is that just simply a corporate item?
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: D&A, are you saying depreciation and amortization, Meredith?
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes.
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Go ahead, Chris.
Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So depreciation and amortization to the extent that it applies to business technology, we would capture that at the corporate level. To the extent it applies to something that's at the local level, it's captured within cost per case because it's applied at the local level. Generally, I don't think there's anything especially to call out this quarter about the change in that number. As you pointed out, there are some true-ups that occur at the end of every year. We've had probably more than last year than we had this year, so that's going to help your growth rate a little bit. But in general operating costs were much better managed this fourth quarter than last fourth quarter. The number we cited up $36 million happens to be the amount of the increase and incentives for the quarter as well. So, to the extent it went up, it went up for the right reasons. We were selling a lot more cases and rewarding people accordingly.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And so the lower growth in case cost in this quarter wasn't particularly due to D&A?
Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: It was a part of that mix, but there was no significant amount attributable to that, no.
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: To Chris's point, there wouldn't be a lot of amortization in that cost, but there's certainly a lot of depreciation in that number.
Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: There is, to the extent that at the field level, that's exactly right.
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Right.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, thank you very much.
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure.
Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Kelly Bania with BMO Capital.
Kelly A. Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi, good morning. Thanks for answering my question. Just wanted to talk a little bit more about gross margin. You called out some of your initiatives, a little better growth with some of the local accounts. But, if you just step back, how helpful was the flat food cost inflation, and where do you think gross margin has really stabilized at?
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'm not sure I can answer the second one, but let me start with the first one, Kelly. So, look, I think it depends on whether you're talking about gross profit or gross margin. I don't want to be too anal on this thing, but that's the reality of it. We pay our bills with dollars, so gross profit dollar growth is very important here, and we had 3% gross profit dollar growth, which was less than what you saw earlier in the year, but at a time when there's no inflation, that was pretty good and we were able to manage our expenses pretty well. That's why I was saying earlier, those numbers are going to move around from time to time. Obviously, what we need to get back to more consistently is where that gross profit is growing faster than the expenses. I think on gross margin, when you're in an environment where your costs are not going up, there's not as much pressure to obviously raise your prices. And that allows you to manage your margin percent a little bit better. So, there's no doubt that that helped on the percentage part of it; but, again, we need to manage both. And after three years of talking about how important gross profit dollar growth is, I'm not going to sit here today and take a victory lap on gross margin. I think it's good that it went up, but I think it's more impressive that we were able to grow the gross profit at 3% with very little if any inflation and keep our expenses below that. That will be somewhat challenging here, as we said, in the first couple quarters, but we'll continue to work at that. And we'd like to get the gross profit growth back up in that four to five zone over time like we saw, but that will be somewhat driven by inflation. I think the corollary here, Kelly, is, when we have inflation, let's say higher than normal inflation like we saw, particularly in the first half of the year, that's where it's very difficult to – and at times not even appropriate – to raise your prices as fast as your costs are going up. And so, when you have an inflation environment of 5% or 6%, it's highly unlikely that your gross margin is going to keep pace on a year-over-year basis there. So, it's math, but it's more than math. It's the environment that our sales people work in, and it's basically what's the right way to treat the customer. So, bottom line, I think it helped on the margin, but it hurt on the gross profit this quarter. As far as stabilizing, let's take it a year at a time, okay? So, we have a year here where we had essentially flat margins. And I think what I should say or reiterate here, because we've talked about that inflation or lack thereof, I mean we did a lot of good things this quarter and this year. So, category management really matured this year and helped improve our margins. We'll see some more benefit there in the new year. Not as much, but a trajectory the slope will flatten out a little bit. Growing local cases is very, very important in this business. I don't think I can say that enough. So, what we said here is, we now had several quarters in a row where we grew our local business. That's where we provide the most value, that's where we make the most money. And we don't have to grow them at the same rate as the corporate-managed necessarily, but we do need to grow them. And I think that contributed significantly to the margin as well as the gross profit growth. And then this quarter and really the year to some extent, we saw the brand rebound a little bit, and some of that was through some promotion work. Some of it's just the natural by-product of connecting it with our category management work. And anytime we can utilize our private brand to create value, that's also positive. So, I think there's a lot of things that led to it, there's a lot of things we need to keep doing well and we have some good things going. But, look, it is competitive out there, and I think if we can stabilize margins at this level we'll be very happy with that.
Kelly A. Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.
John E. Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Bill, one of the things we've heard is that post the U.S. Foods thing not happening, the promotional environment's got a little bit more intense. Is that fair? Is that what you're seeing? And then how might that tie-in with this disinflation? And does this – so, we've gone from plus four to zero in a very quick period of time. Does that breed more aggressive competition, right? Because everybody's COGS is going down and they can be aggressive without giving up a lot of margin?
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: John, it's been a long time since I practiced accounting. I'm not sure that COGS are going down in the promotion. I think their sales are going down and maybe their marketing expenses are going up depending on how they account for it. So, I don't think that's a COGS issue. Obviously, cat management helped us there. As far as the question on promotion, I see there's been some chatter out there. Yeah, I mean, look, you've got a transition that's going on here. I think in certain markets we are seeing some of that type of activity. I've even read pieces where people are saying that we've stepped up our activity. And the reality is we haven't. I think we're always out there selectively doing what we need to do to retain good quality customers and business and selectively going after potential new business. So, it's not that we don't promote; but I would tell you, I don't think our promotion activities picked up in any meaningful way from a year or two ago. So, it's out there, I think we're going through this transition period, so it may be somewhat accelerated, but I think that's a little overblown right now.
Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: And then, if you look at case progression, so take Broadline, up 3.6% this quarter, what had it been running? Is that an improvement? And then if you look at locally managed on top of that and you said that has improved, so where has that improved from? Where was it a couple of quarters ago? Where is it today?
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I don't know that we give – I'm not going to let you do the work on some of that, John. I don't know that we give guidance at that level. But I can directionally tell you it has improved, okay? So, that 3.6%, that's total Broadline, it's got about a half a point of acquisition and everything. So, you're looking at 3% organic growth, and I would tell you that that's – there's a little bit more there on the corporate side than the local, but the local has moved up nicely over the last, I think it's five quarters to six quarters, and it's continuing to grow. So, I think the important part there is that piece of it is growing and continuing to grow.
John E. Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Okay, thanks.
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Andrew Wolf with BB&T Capital Markets.
Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets: Thanks. Can you hear me this time?
Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: We can.
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We can.
Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets: All right. I don't know what happened there. In the interim, most of my questions were asked, but maybe I could tie it together. I thought the gross profit growth with this inflation was pretty good. So, and you're saying even from U.S. Foods you haven't seen an uptick, if I can be so impolite, your old dance partner there. Have you seen an uptick from them specifically? Or I guess maybe you're saying if so, it's not enough to really change the nature of the market. So, when you sound a little cautious on the first half of the fiscal year, is it more on the expense side? Because if the market environment's not changing, you have some internal initiatives to get the gross profit dollars at least going above sales, is it more of an expense issue? It's just you can't – it's just hard to keep the expenses flattish or to get the leverage that you got this quarter?
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: If I came across as cautious, I guess it's just my nature, Andy. But I'm trying to be balanced here and...
Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets: Yeah. No, I appreciate just being straight, so I'm just talking to you.
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: But I think this is an important exchange here right now. So, I think, I'm really pleased with this quarter. I mean, the quality of this quarter was very good. And we've got some good things going on here on the local case growth side, so we need to sustain that. And I think we still can grow some of the other cases as well. So, I think that's a positive I feel good about that. There's not much we can do about whether there's going to be any inflation or if there's going to be a little deflation, so that's where I'm a little cautious. That does impact our top line and our gross profit dollar line. And then on the expense side, I would say encouraged by the fourth quarter, and I just would look for gradual improvement there. I don't think we can sustain 2% expense growth with 3% case growth. Okay, I don't think that's a sustainable ratio. With that said, I expect our expense growth to – on a relative basis to be better next year than what we saw this year relative to case growth, relative to sales and GP growth. So, I actually feel pretty good about the part that we're managing right now, and then my caution is that if you look at the quarter, I see that as something. We had three good quarters this year. We need to have four next year, and they need to look somewhere around what we saw here in the fourth quarter. But, the lines are going to move around depending what's going on in the marketplace. But, overall, I feel good, but yeah, I'm a little cautious on that top line and GP line for the first quarter, too. Chris.
Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. Hey, Andy, I'm just going to tie it back to some stuff we talked to earlier in the year. We continue to say we'd like to see gross profit dollar growth of 4% or better. That sets us up very, very well. Because of the level of food cost inflation, it's difficult right now. All Bill was really saying is, we're going to have some headwinds on the sales line. We're going to have some headwinds on the gross profit dollar line. Obtaining that 4% is going to be difficult without some sort of reinflation in food cost. The reason the 4% is 4% is because we acknowledge that we're going to drive cases, and that's going to drive costs. So as Bill just said I think very, very well, if we're going to have headwinds on the top line numbers, it means we have to control the cost even more at a time when frankly we're driving cases. So that makes the math a little bit tough. So I'm with Bill. I'm very pleased with the quarter. Neither of us are pessimistic about next year or even the first half of next year. We're just, as Bill said, trying to be able to balance with the current inflationary environment and how hard that's going to be to drive our equation.
Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets: Good. No, no, I saw the quarter that way too. And just lastly, back to U.S. Foods, they are the number two player, potentially at least in some markets if they were to really get aggressive, could squeeze some margins. Are you seeing them being pretty normal, or are you seeing them ramp it up quite a lot?
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Again, Andy, I think in certain markets our people are seeing some of that. They've got new CEO there now who we know and respect a great deal. I think they've got a lot to get through here in the next couple, three months. I expect that they'll do it and do it well, and I expect them to be a rational competitor. But in any given market, any of us could at times be a little bit viewed as being overly aggressive or whatever. So I'm sure there's some of that going out. I'm not that close to it. But if it was overly significant, I think I would know about it. And I don't have a sense that that's a big thing right now.
Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets: Okay, thank you. Congratulations on the quarter, I thought it was pretty good.
Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thanks, Andy.
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Andy.
Operator: We'll go next to Ajay Jain with Pivotal Research Group.
Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC: Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. Bill, in your prepared comments, I think you cited improved expense management and also higher payroll costs, higher incentive compensation. And so with respect to your expense outlook for this year, overall would you say comparisons are starting to ease? And then can you give any additional breakdown on where you're expecting comparisons to improve and where you see continued pressure on earnings? Excluding the merger expenses and interest expense, I'm just still trying or struggling to get a big picture perspective on whether comparisons should improve this year or at least be a little bit more normalized in fiscal 2016.
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Ajay, look, our plan is to grow our gross profit faster than our expenses. And as I said a couple times now, that may look differently in some quarters than others and there will be a little more pressure in the first quarter or two. Our expenses this year were high, as Chris took you through, were higher than we planned. And we can't have 8%, 9%, 10% case growth on a currency-adjusted basis. So we had a good number here in the fourth quarter. I expect this to continue to improve on the expense side in the field. There are going to be some ups and downs there, but I'm confident that we're on the right track there. So I don't know that you can sustain flat every quarter, but certainly low single-digit case increases – cost case increases would be what we're shooting for here. On the corporate side, it depends on the quarter. We talked about some true-ups. I mentioned bad debt. So in any given quarter, there could be some things on the corporate side. I would just say to you that as we continue, we have stood up a lot of capabilities here, from cap-man to a lot of things on sales capabilities. There's more to do there, and so we'll continue to invest in our people and our technology to position this company to grow its business and grow it profitably and compete very well and do great things for our customers. So long story short, we'll talk more about this in Investor Day. But as I said, we expect to grow the cases. I don't think 2% is sustainable with 3% case growth if we're able to continue to do that. At the same time, 4.8% is too high. So I think you can assume from that that somewhere in the middle is what we're shooting for.
Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Ajay, this is Chris. Remember back early in the year when we were reporting very high gross profit dollar growth numbers, we were calling out the fact that we were not pleased with our expense performance even back then. It was being supported by the gross profit, but we weren't happy with our expense management. Since that time, we've actually done better in the fourth quarter. It's certainly the best quarter we had during the year, so I'm going to be repetitive here with Bill that we were not at all pleased with the overall year performance, but we were much more pleased with Q4; again, calling out the fact that it might be a little bit swung to the other side of being hard to repeat. So overall cost per case was higher than it should have been, higher than we wanted it to be. We got it back under control in Q4. And certainly that's the goal as we look into next year, but it's something we have to continue to focus on. But again, we saw real improvement in Q4. We just have to continue to maintain that and make sure that we don't allow the increases that got ahead of us in the first part of this year.
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think if I could maybe just add one other thing to put this in context. I've talked about quarters move around. Years move around. And I think if you look at our cost and our expense management over the last two years, a lot of our initiatives matured last year, and we actually saw a reduction in cost per case last year. And I think it was a low single-digit reduction, but it was up in the fourth quarter I believe last year. So we've cycled some of that now. And I think if you look at the two years together, that's a pretty good proxy of what we're able to do, and we're working really hard and I expect us to improve from this year.
Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: That's actually a good point, Bill. We were down $0.06 per case last year on a reported basis, and I think we're up $0.04 a case this year on a reported basis. So you look at the two years together, and we're almost back to breakeven. And it's not a bad story, but frankly we were expecting better out of ourselves. So, that's where we have to continue to work.
Operator: We'll take our next question from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan.
John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi, great. Thank you. First just a housekeeping question. The Analyst Day is going to be on September 15, I had something else written down, so I just want to make sure I have that right.
Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: We changed it to, I think the original day was September 24. We changed it to September 15, that's correct, in the afternoon.
John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay, thank you. And then secondly, the comments in the press release, we will also continue to evaluate opportunities to optimize our capital structure. That's obviously a very interesting comment, and one's imagination can run wild just seeing a sentence like that, within a press release especially. So as you've talked and had more time to think about this with the board and perhaps even solicited investor feedback, what do you think that optimal capital structure is in terms of rating? And whatever that is, I guess at this point, what are you waiting for to implement that optimized capital structure?
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Actually, John, that's pretty much the same thing we said when we announced the share repurchase. So our view on that is pretty straightforward I think at this point. We kept our powder dry here for quite some time because we've been looking at a lot of different opportunities on the acquisition front, some larger than others, and we ended up pulling the trigger on the U.S. Foods deal, and that required a lot of capital, and as we all know, that ultimately didn't play out. So where we're at today is we just felt it was appropriate to return some capital in the form of share repurchase back to our shareholders here over the next year or two. But we still think we need to keep some powder dry here. We continue to look for acquisitions, as I said in my comments, both within the core and potentially beyond the core, whether it be adjacency or continue to build our international platform here. So I would just say to you, we're going to do what we're saying here, which is from time to time we'll continue to look at our capital structure relative to what our other options are. And for the most part, it starts with investing in the business. I think we've got a pretty good cadence there. We've got pretty good – Chris has done a nice job coming in here and helping us get a little more structure and discipline around our CapEx spending. We've improved modestly, but we've begun to improve in our working capital management, so there are some good things going on there. But I would always like to have the opportunity to do some strategic acquisitions if and when they present themselves. It's just at this point we don't need to keep quite as much capital available to do that.
John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Understood, thank you.
William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You're welcome.
Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you.
Operator: That concludes today's question-and-answer session and also brings us to the end of today's conference. Thank you for your participation, and have a good day.

Operator: Good morning and welcome to Sysco's Third Quarter Fiscal 2015 Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. We will begin today's call with opening remarks and introductions. I'd like to turn the call over to Shannon Mutschler, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Shannon Mutschler - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thank you, Tim. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Sysco's third quarter fiscal 2015 earnings call. Today, you'll hear prepared remarks from Bill DeLaney, our President and CEO; and Chris Kreidler, our CFO. Before we begin, please note that statements made during this presentation that state the company's or management's intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements and actual results could differ materially. Additional information about factors that could cause results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's SEC filings. This includes, but is not limited to, risk factors contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 28, 2014, subsequent SEC filings, and in the news release issued earlier this morning. A copy of these materials can be found in the Investor's section at sysco.com or via Sysco's IR app. Non-GAAP financial measures are included in our comments today and in our presentation slides. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the applicable GAAP measures are included at the end of the presentation, and can also be found in the Investor's section of our website. All comments about earnings per share refer to diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. In addition, all references to case volume include total Broadline and SYGMA combined. To ensure that we have sufficient time to answer all questions, we'd like to ask each participant to limit their time today to one question and one follow-up. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Bill DeLaney.
William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, Sysco reported third quarter fiscal 2015 financial results. Sales increased 4% to $11.7 billion. Adjusted operating income decreased 3% to $377 million, adjusted net earnings increased 7% to $238 million and EPS increased 5% to $0.40 for the quarter. Net earnings and EPS for the quarter were in line with our expectations, as solid volume and gross profit dollar growth along with a favorable tax rate offset the impact of moderating inflation trends on favorable foreign exchange translation and higher than planned operating expenses. Case volume grew 2.5% for the quarter and we were pleased with our growth both with locally managed and corporate managed customers. Overall, weather was not a major factor in our year-over-year comparisons for the quarter as we benefited from favorable comparisons in January and February, but were hampered by severe weather in the Northeast and Mideast in late February and most of March. This last point is important to note, because March provides a disproportionately large portion of our third quarter volume and was a relatively mild weather month last year. We experienced similar trends in April, but expect the year-over-year monthly impact of weather will dissipate as we move into May and June. We continue to roll out and successfully execute our category management initiative and the benefits from this process contributed to our gross profit dollar growth during the quarter. Through category management, we were able to support our customer's growth by lowering our product cost and developing innovative product development ideas. This is vital to mitigating gross margin pressure as we move forward in what remains a fiercely competitive market environment. Regarding expense management, we established appropriately aggressive goals for cost per case management for fiscal 2015, after a very strong expense management performance in the prior year. We experienced modest improvement in sequential trends in the third quarter, but will fall short of our original goals in this area for the year. With that said, our entire leadership team in intently focused on enhancing productivity in a sustainable manner while delivering exceptional service to our customers. I expect our performance trends in this area to improve modestly in the fourth quarter and more so in fiscal 2016. Moving to our multi-year business transformation initiatives, we are pleased with the progress we've made on achieving the steady state cost saving goals we set as we began fiscal 2013. Fiscal 2015 is the third year of that financial roadmap and we have already exceeded our original target of $600 million, which was comprised of approximately $300 million in annual savings in both operating and product costs. While pleased with this progress we've made over the past three years – on these initiatives, it is more clear than ever that transforming Sysco's business will be a perpetual process as we strive to fully realize our vision of being our customer's most valued and trusted business partner. Foundational to our ultimate success is further developing and continually enhancing our technology platform. We have now embedded this work in the overall scope of our Business Technology group under the leadership of Wayne Shurts. We have learned a great deal from the challenges we encountered in deploying SAP and all of the standardized processes it requires. Over the past two years under Wayne's leadership, we have refined our business processes, strengthened our technology support capabilities, stabilized the SAP system and enhanced its efficiency. While there is more work to be done, we are well-positioned to move forward with a cohesive enterprise-wide module centered approach rather than our previous OpCo-by-OpCo multi-module approach. As our deployment process matures and evolves in the future, we expect this change to result in smoother conversions, better execution and an improved experience for our customers. On the acquisition front, we recently completed our previously announced agreement to acquire 50% of Pacific Star Foodservice, a leading food service distributor in Mexico. We have developed a strong relationship over the past several years with the ownership and management team of Pacific Star and we are very excited about the potential opportunities that this partnership will provide to profitably grow our business in Mexico. Regarding our pending merger with US Foods, the hearing related to the FTC's motion for preliminary injunction begins tomorrow, May 5, and will last up to seven business days. If we receive a ruling in our favor, we will proceed to closing unless the decision is appealed. In the event of an unfavorable ruling, we would assess together with US Foods' ownership whether to pursue the case further. We remain resolute in our belief that this transaction is pro-competitive, good for our customers and will accelerate Sysco's business transformation. We announced in April that Joel Grade has been named Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer effective September 1, 2015, following Chris Kreidler's decision to leave the company. Joel is a veteran Sysco leader with nearly 20 years of experience in key finance and commercial roles. He is uniquely suited to step into the CFO position because of his deep knowledge of our local operations and people. We are fortunate to have a leader like Joel ready to take on this key position and I look forward to working closely with him in his new role as we move forward. We appreciate the numerous important contributions Chris has made on Sysco's behalf since joining us five years ago. He has agreed to remain as CFO through August and he will work closely with Joel and Sysco's senior executive team to ensure an orderly transition of his responsibilities, including staying on through the end of December as an advisor. In closing, I am pleased with the consistent case growth we've seen in our locally-managed and corporate managed business, which demonstrates our associates' unwavering focus on providing consistent and excellent service to our customers. In addition, our leadership team is making good progress in driving out initiatives to enhance both gross profit dollar growth and expense management. Our ongoing work to fundamentally reshape our company is challenging but gratifying and we strongly believe that the steps we are taking will reinforce our leadership position in the ever evolving food service industry. Now, I'll turn things over to Chris so that he can provide additional details on our financial results for the third quarter.
Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter, sales were $11.7 billion, an increase of 4.2% compared to the prior year. Our sales growth rate was substantially lower than the 7% rate we saw during the first half of the fiscal year because of the rapid decline in food cost inflation and the impact of foreign exchange translation. Food cost inflation declined significantly from 6% in the second quarter to 3.7% in the third quarter. Our estimate for food cost inflation represents the weighted average change in Sysco's cost of the same products year-over-year. At 3.7%, it would appear we are getting close to what we normally describe as the sweet spot for inflation of 2% to 3%. But the 3.7% is an average across all of our product lines and sometimes averages don't tell the whole story as is the case here. Specifically, the meat category experienced low double-digit inflation in the quarter and poultry inflation was in the high single digits. On a weighted average basis, these two categories accounted for 3.2% of the 3.7% of inflation we experienced across all of our categories. At these levels, passing along all of the inflation can be painful to our customers, putting gross margin under pressure. In addition, rapid declines in food cost also make it challenging to leverage our fixed costs. The impact of changes in foreign exchange rate had a much larger impact than usual this quarter. Similar to many companies with significant operations outside of the U.S., the strengthening dollar depressed our foreign sales as we converted them to U.S. dollars. This quarter's decrease of 1.3% was the highest in the past three years. The impact has typically been in the range of zero to 0.5%. Sales from acquisitions increased sales by 0.6%. Case volume grew 2.5% during the quarter, including acquisitions, and approximately 2.2% excluding acquisitions. Gross profit in the third quarter was $2.1 billion, a 3.1% increase, while gross margin declined 17 basis points to 17.52%. Benefits from category management contributed significantly to our gross profit during the quarter. In addition, case volume growth for our locally managed Broadline business continued to increase slightly on a sequential basis as it is done the last two quarters. Solid local case growth is important to drive gross profit dollar growth. Case growth for our corporate managed customers remains strong, but competitive pricing pressure in this segment contributed to gross margin pressure. Certain items for the third quarter totaled $91 million and related to merger and integration planning expenses and interest on the merger debt. Of this amount, $50 million was recorded in operating expense and $41 million was recorded in interest expense. Merger and integration planning costs that impacted operating expenses were mainly related to work to prepare for the integration of the two companies' technology platforms. These expenses in total were lower in the third quarter compared to levels in the first half of the year, as we scaled back our integration planning work in certain areas where a significant amount of work has already been completed. Merger costs that impacted interest expense relate to the debt that we issued last October that is intended to refinance US Foods' debt upon closing of the transaction. We are treating this interest expense as a certain item until the merger closes. Adjusted operating expenses for the third quarter increased $73 million, or 4.5%, due to a $61 million increase in payroll expense. Payroll expense increased mainly due to higher pay for our sales organization as a result of higher gross profit, investments in new administrative support capabilities, higher incentive accruals and newly acquired operations. These increases were partially offset by lower delivery costs, mainly driven by savings in fuel expense. After excluding incentives, adjusted operating expenses would have increased 3.9%. Our cost per case performance improved modestly from earlier in the year, but, as Bill mentioned, expense management remains a challenge for us. Adjusted cost per case performance for the third quarter in the North American Broadline business, which is the portion of the business we have given guidance on previously, increased only $0.03 in the third quarter. However, excluding the benefit from currency translation, cost per case would have increased by $0.09. We have previously said we expect cost per case to increase between $0.05 and $0.10 this year. We would expect to be in the low end of this range, including the impact of foreign exchange, and on the high end of this range, excluding foreign exchange. We are focused on driving improvement across our operations with multiple initiatives that implement best practices, enhance our operating training programs and improve our ability to measure and analyze our performance. Adjusted operating income from the quarter was $377 million, down 2.7% from the prior year, and adjusted operating margin was 3.2%, down 23 basis points from last year. Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 34%, compared to 39% in the prior year period. This quarter's rate was positively impacted by the favorable resolution of a state tax matter. In the prior year, the rate was elevated due to the non-deductible portion of a $20 million legal settlement that we disclosed at the time. Normalizing for these types of discrete events, our tax rate would be roughly 37%. This is lower than our historical rates due to the increasing amount of business earnings in international jurisdictions that have lower tax rates, as well as reduced state taxes from legal restructurings. Adjusted net earnings increased 7% to $238 million and adjusted EPS increased 5.3% to $0.40. Cash flow performance in the first 39 weeks of the year was relatively strong after taking into account the cash impact of certain items. Cash flow from operations increased $12 million to $860 million versus last year. This increase reflects the negative impact of two items. First, the cash impact of certain items increased $82 million year-over-year, mainly due to merger and integration planning expenses. Second, as we disclosed earlier this year, we made a $50 million pension contribution this year compared to none in the prior year period. This difference is simply driven by different timing regarding when we make cash contributions each year. Cash tax payments were $135 million lower than last year, due to a lower effective tax rate, which I discussed a moment ago, and merger and integration planning expenses that reduced taxable earnings. Free cash flow was $439 million in the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2015, compared to $484 million in the prior year period, or a reduction of $46 million. However, after adjusting for the cash impact of certain items and the increase in pension contribution I mentioned a moment ago, free cash flow was $617 million, an increase of $86 million or 16% from the prior year period. Capital expenditures for the first 39 weeks of the year, net of proceeds from sales of assets, increased $58 million to $422 million. About $53 million of this increase is due to IT-related merger integration planning and the rest was due to timing of investment in our fleet. Our cash flow from operations and free cash flow are always impacted by foreign currency translation, but the impact for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2015 is much greater than the last few years. You will see in the cash flow statement a $77 million impact this year compared to less than $0.5 million last year. This means our cash flows would have been $77 million higher on a constant dollar basis. Turning to an update on recent acquisitions, last month we completed the previously announced transaction to buy 50% of Pacific Star Foodservice, a leading foodservice distributor in Mexico. Pacific Star has operated since 1989 with distribution centers servicing customers in the major metropolitan areas of Mexico City, Guadalajara, Monterrey and Tijuana. It primarily services chain accounts, including fast food and casual dining restaurants, casinos, theme parks, movie theaters and hotels throughout Mexico. This partnership fits our international expansion strategy, allows us to enhance service to our U.S. customers who operate in the region, and provides growth opportunities in an important region of the Americas. In addition, subsequent to the end of the quarter, we announced our agreement to acquire Tannis Trading in Canada. Tannis operates in the Ottawa market, the fourth largest in Canada. This acquisition, which remains subject to regulatory approval, will allow us to better serve our customers and achieve our goal of increasing sales in Canada. Regarding our outlook for the remainder of the year, there are a few additional items I'd like to point out. First, as we discussed last quarter, because of the pending merger during this fiscal year, we have not been in the market buying back shares to offset dilution from incentive-based compensation as we would normally be doing. This has had the effect of increasing our shares outstanding in the first 39 weeks of the fiscal year due to the exercise of employee stock options and the vesting of restricted stock units. As a result, both adjusted and reported diluted EPS were lower by half a penny in the third quarter and a penny and a half over the first 39 weeks. Unless we repurchase shares during the fourth quarter, we estimate that our diluted shares outstanding may be greater than 597 million shares for the fiscal year. This estimate is dependent on the level of stock options exercises and RSU vesting that occurs, and does not include the impact of the shares to be issued in conjunction with the pending US Foods merger. Second, please note that we plan to pay off $300 million in bonds that come due in mid-June. We currently anticipate using cash on hand to fund this payment. Lastly, our forecast for capital expenditures, net of proceeds from asset sales, remains at $500 million to $500 million – sorry, $500 million to $550 million for fiscal 2015. But we now expect to be at the high end of this range for the year. In closing, while our top-line has been negatively impacted by lower levels of inflation and a larger impact from foreign currency translations, we are pleased that the business continues to generate solid case volume growth, in particular, in the locally-managed portion of our business. We have opportunities to improve our operating expense management and have begun to make some progress in this area. But importantly, the business continues to generate strong free cash flow. While we have work ahead of us to transform the business, there are many exciting initiatives underway that will enhance our customer's experience, strengthen our operating performance and increase profitability. With that, operator, we'll now take some questions.
Operator: And we'll take our first question from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.
John Edward Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Hello. Bill, actually a tactical question and then a strategic one. So, Bill, on the tactical side, it would seem that inflation probably moderates a bit further from here. Can you offset that with cost reduction, or is the uncertainty around US Foods and kind of where the business sits today, hamstringing you from doing that? And then I have a strategic one.
William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer: John, we have to. I mean, so yeah, do I think we can? In the past, we've been able to adjust our expenses accordingly and I agree with your premise. I think you can see the inflation come down a little bit more just for the reasons, Chris said, we've got a couple of categories that are pretty high and the others – dairy's very volatile, as you know, so dairy is down a little bit. Seafood is down a little bit but seafood is not a big part of the overall mix. So, I think essentially you're looking at an environment today where you've got two categories, meat and poultry, that are high, which is difficult to pass along in a fast way and the right way, and the others are pretty much neutral, if you put them all together. And yeah, I expect that to continue here at least for the – whatever; a few – couple or three months as far as we can see out. As I said in my comments, we are seeing improvement on the expenses sequentially, we're just not seeing it as fast as we had planned and I think you will see more expense improvement here in the fourth quarter relative to the first part of the year and we're certainly planning to do even more for next year.
John Edward Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC: And then, strategically, I know you don't have a lot to talk about this, but have you done much planning if US Foods doesn't happen? And what would you do differently than you're doing today if that doesn't come to fruition?
William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, first of all, one of the things I feel really good about is we have done a nice job here. We spent some money doing it separating, running the business day-to-day and keeping our people – the vast majority of our people focused on taking care of their customers and running their business and not having them be distracted by the merger. And then we had another group of people and outside support folks who have done a great job under Chris's and Greg Bertrand's leadership driving out a very sound integration plan. So I feel good about what we've done to date. Yes, we have done some contingent planning and it's not fully developed. We have had discussions as a management team and with our board and we will continue to have those discussions and once we have a ruling, then we'll probably take some more time but not a lot of time and go forth from there with some other strategic directions. So yes, we've done some planning, but not in a position today to really talk a whole lot about that.
John Edward Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC: All right, thanks.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Karen Short with Deutsche Bank. And Karen Short, your line is now open. Please check your mute function. And we'll move on to Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse.
Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yeah, hi. Good morning, guys. I just have a follow-up to John's question here. Bill, in the past, you guys have mentioned international M&A as an area of interest. I mean, obviously, the U.S. market is top of mind right now. But if material consolidation is not possible here, where are your heads today on international relative to where they were in the past? Is it still something that you would be interested in?
William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer: Certainly. As you heard, we are pleased with the joint venture that we just finalized with our partners down in Mexico and we have gradually built out some small footprint in Costa Rica and now Mexico, Bahamas, Ireland, Canada was the first one, obviously. So, I think where we are there, Ed, is I think it's just a matter of pace of place. So we definitely, when we talk about the strategy of the company, that fifth point we talk about is always looking for other areas to expand, whether it be through adjacencies or geographics. And I just see it more as something we need to do continually, and over the next three years to five years, I would like to think we'll continue to find good partners in different parts of the world where our customers value our capabilities and find ways to grow there primarily to lay a foundation for the future beyond that. So I see international more as something we need to do. We need to continually build it for the medium to long-term. Short to medium-term, obviously, US Foods is a big, big part of our strategy. It's not our strategy. It's a big part of our strategy. If that were not to work out, we would revisit other strategic opportunities that we looked at in the past and look at our capital structure and all those types of things. I'm just not in a position today to talk a whole lot about it.
Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): And, Bill, when you think about the U.S. business now, there is obviously always puts and takes on what impacts the earnings. I mean, the backdrop doesn't really seem to be too bad right now with what's going on with restaurant sales and lower fuel. But this quarter, you're back to EBITDA actually being down a little bit year-over-year to a couple of quarters of good growth, and I guess the question is, what is it really saying about the outlook for the business, I guess, absent a deal? And you touched on a little bit, but is there a need for some larger strategic refresh or restructuring if the transaction were not to happen, or are you really just – is it more really more about fine-tuning?
William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer: I think both, all right? So we need to manage what we have the ability to control the most, which is our business. And we're pretty at running our business. Obviously, as we've said for a while now, the market environment we are in, it's difficult. It's very competitive and it's not unlike many other industries and we don't expect that to change. So again, to kind of recap how we look at the world, we see modest medium to long-term growth in the industry. We expect to grow faster than that. To do that, we need to differentiate ourselves ongoingly with our customers and we need to take costs out of the system. That's one of the reasons why this merger is so important to us. If the merger doesn't happen, we'll need to find other ways to continue to do that. We may not get there quite as fast, but I'm confident we'll continue to go in the right direction. Specifically to this quarter, you can look at in a lot of different ways. The bottom line is we didn't manage our expenses as well as we would have liked. If we had managed our cost piece maybe just a nickel better, I think you would have seen a different result here and I would have been – I wouldn't have talked as much about planned expenses. So we're going to have quarters where there is inflation and less inflation. And we had good volume growth. As I've said, we managed gross profit reasonably well, given the environment. We just didn't bring our expenses in line as fast as we planned and I expect it will get better with that here over the next two years to three quarters.
Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Thank you and good luck with US Foods.
William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll go next to Karen Short with Deutsche Bank.
Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Sorry about that before. Just guess curious, I mean, I know we've talked a lot about the expense issue and I guess I'm still confused as to why it's been a problem for two quarters in a row. I mean, I know you pointed to some things in terms of comps that affected expenses, but anything else you can kind of put some color on?
William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer: I'll do my best, Karen. I would say this quarter was a little different in that our selling expense was higher than where it was the first half of the year. We were up a couple pennies the first half of the year in selling and that was fine. We had a lot of gross profit dollar growth and that's going to drive selling expense. So, this quarter was up more than that. It's still probably fine but it just can't be sustained. I mean, it's just we just a situation where seasonally it's a low volume quarter. It's also a time that we bring MAs on in terms of training, and we had some operating companies that were behind in their head count and I think that put some pressure on us here as well. So, selling costs is a little higher than what we planned. On the operation side, we're making progress. We're driving out a lot of change there, Karen, and we've been driving out very aggressively over the last year to two years. And that puts a lot of stress on the operating companies at a time when they still need to provide really solid service to our customers. And so there's been some challenges in terms of how fast you can drive that change and how well it's received by our workforce and how well our leadership, including me, are able to drive that out. So, what we're doing here is transforming a company and we're bringing more standardization to our best practices in the field. We're functionalizing that part of our business in terms of the OpCo and our end-to-end supply chain organization now, and it's just taken a little longer to get where we want to go. The good news is we are seeing sequential relative improvement and that's what gives me some confidence here.
Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Hey, Karen, this is Chris. I'll jump in and just elaborate on one point Bill made. Remember, a couple years ago, we talked quite a bit about some of the changes we made in our sales organization, and we saw that disruption. We saw that disruption and slowed growth in terms of case volume on the local side especially and we talked quite a bit about it at the time. We pushed through a lot of change and it took a while for all that change to kind of be accepted and understood and appropriately reacted to in the field. I think what you're seeing now is somewhat similar going on, on the operating expense environment. We are, as Bill said, pushing out a lot of change. It's for the good. It's going to lead to better results in the future, but it's going to take a while for some of that change to actually drive all the way down to the operating company level. And I think that's part of what we're experiencing right now. Not an excuse. We need to manage it better, but I do think we're seeing some of that.
Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then, I mean, to your point on MAs and progress on the top-line, I guess independent sales definitely seemed fairly strong, although SYGMA was weak. But anything to point to on what was driving the strength in independent?
William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I think that's the good news. I mean, when we talk about initiatives, they're not all about cost savings. And I think what you're seeing there is some – several things that we've done over the last two years or three years, starting with the CRM tool, category management. We're getting better executing that; some basic things we're doing in terms of working with our MAs and training and how to segment more effectively our customers and product categories. And just creating more continuity, if you will, between the corporate sales organization and the field sales organization, as well as the OpCos overall. So we're pleased both on the local side and the corporate side. If you go back four quarters or five quarters, we had no growth on the local side. So, I think that's a bright spot and that's certainly something we've emphasized and something we need to continue to emphasize.
Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then, just last question on the expense side. What's driving the merger and integration increase? Because I guess I was under the impression that you had kind of completed all you could from a merger and integration expense perspective until you know more – or until, hopefully, you close the merger, and it still seemed to be-I mean, it's still increasing.
Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, it's actually not increasing on a sequential basis. It's starting to decline. We hit our peak last quarter, Karen, and it's coming down from there. But I'll take your question to where I think you want to go, anyway, why is it not perhaps dropping faster? There are a couple reasons. I mean, the interest portion of that, obviously, is not going to go anywhere, but even on the operating expense portion, there is a lot of work that continues to be done to prepare the two IT systems to be able to merge. We're not touching the US Foods system or vice versa, but we're creating the conduits that will be necessary to allow them to merge. Unfortunately, as this deal has drug out, we were able to stand down certain aspects of what we were doing from a planning perspective because we can stand them back up rather quickly; but a lot of other areas, we need all the time we could possibly get to be prepared for merging and integrating, and we continued some of that work. So it's come down somewhat. I expect it to not increase again, of course, until we complete the transaction; and, of course, we'll give you new guidance.
Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Meredith Adler with Barclays.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to talk a little bit about cash. I spent many years in fixed income land and cash is cash. You can't really define it. And it just looks to me like, in fact, you're not covering your dividend, or didn't for the first nine months of the year. And then – so I'm wondering, you have a $300 million payment you're going to make this year. Could you talk about: are you going to borrow? Do you have a revolving credit facility that you're going to borrow under? And sort of the same thing holds true if the deal does not go through, you probably will have your bonds will be put back to you, the $5 billion, but you're not sitting on that much cash. So what do you think happens? How do you fund that put if it happens?
Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. Let me take the two pieces of that, Meredith. First, the $300 million, as I mentioned, we will pay that out of the cash that we have sitting on the balance sheet, which is just shy of $5 billion. That's what we'll do, initially. If we then repay the bonds, because you correctly point out if the merger agreement terminates there's a process for those to be redeemed, we would pay those back out. Whatever we can't pay out of cash, we would put into our credit facility. We do have a very large commercial paper line backstopped by a credit facility, about a $1.5 billion. So we have got plenty of capacity to put on the balance sheet. We would then look at whether we have enough capacity for just general working capital needs and we'd look at whether we need to term out some of the debt that we've taken on the balance sheet the last couple of years, the acquisitions we've done, et cetera. We would do that after that point in time when things settle out.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then, just have one other question. You said that...
William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer: Meredith, do you mind if I just jump in still? Just on the cash point, I was just going back to the earlier questions we had. First of all, we're going to cover our dividend here. If you adjust for the merger related expenses and things like that, we're going to more than cover our dividend from free cash flow this year. Second of all, the way I look at cash is, strategically, we include debt capacity. So obviously, as you well know, we're very highly rated company from a debt perspective. We have plenty of debt capacity and certainly want to utilize it prudently, but I'm very confident in our ability to fund whatever we need to fund.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I'm not actually worried about liquidity. You're not going to run out of liquidity. My next question, just quickly, is about category management and cycling the improvements you've seen so far. I think that we'll cycle some in this next quarter, but it sounded like you had more coming. How do you think that balances out in terms of the benefit to the gross margin?
William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, you're right. We're finishing up the third year and we said from the beginning category management would be somewhat backend loaded, and we've seen those benefits this year. I think the key that – the way to look at that, Meredith, is just we are now maturing to a point where, well, we speak about category management, it truly is embedded in how we merchandise and we have centralized merchandising here to a large extent. We certainly have standardized all of it. We still do some locally in terms of working with suppliers, but, for the most part, we're working with the suppliers here at corporate and then working closely with our operating companies. So from that standpoint, we've realized a lot of benefits, but we have some more launches here to do later this year and into next year; not a significant part of the overall volume. And then, I think what you'll see us do is we'll get into renewals and we'll continue to perfect what we started here and get better at it, and probably have more time to focus on the innovation side of it, which is critical, obviously, to growing the business as well. So, I look at it as something which we would continue to get better at, which would continue to help us mitigate the overall margin pressure that we face in the business itself, but something that we feel really good about at this point.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much.
William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer: Sure.
Operator: And let's take our next question from Andrew Wolf with BB&T Capital Markets.
Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets: Hi. Good morning. Bill, I wanted to ask you about the sales trend during the quarter into April, and – it was pretty abrupt from quite strong to kind of weak. And I didn't see Sysco's numbers, but for the industry. It sounds like you guys outperformed that, but what do you think is going on with the industry? I mean, you kind of alluded to weather, because last year was easy and this March was tough. What do you think is going on in April? And I mean, do you have some insight into things maybe stabilizing or turning back up here in the later part of April or early May?
William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, Andy, if you notice, I really didn't talk a lot about the industry or the market because it's hard to make that call right now. While I did talk about weather, I didn't whine about weather this year. So I feel good about that. What we saw was this, and what I alluded to in my comments, we had – last year, if you go back and look at the weather, it was pretty harsh in December, January and the first three weeks in February and it was harsh in areas where typically you don't see it: Charlotte, Dallas, Atlanta and other places. And so we had some favorable comparisons in late December, January and February. Unfortunately, January and February are not exactly big months for us. Then, if you recall last year, there was a little bit of a cabin fever impact up north and I think people got out in March just because they needed to get out and then March was reasonably mild and so was April. And so, the camps and the clubs started to open up earlier. So we had good volume in March and April relative to the rest of the year last year and I think we're seeing softer volume this year. What I'm trying to say to you is I think weather is impacting that. I just don't know to what degree and I think I can make a better call on that after we see May and June here because we'll be back to apples-to-apples. In terms of what I read and what I hear, it's probably not a whole lot different than you. The good news here is the consumer sentiment is positive. It's up and down a little bit, but it's still positive. The sentiment of our restaurant operators is positive and it's remained positive. So I think people are generally seeing – at least maintaining – they're seeing good things and they're hopeful that it'll translate into better things. Probably the biggest positive out there right now, I would say, would be the lower fuel prices. They've come back up a little bit, but all-in-all, the consumer is getting a raise, if you will, at the pump. What's not clear there at all is to what degree. It appears that the consumer is paying down debt with some of that, saving some of that and spending some of that. It's not clear how much of that we are getting, perhaps some, but I don't think a lot at this point. With that said, I think to the extent that the fuel prices stay down for an extended period of time, that will be good for our customers and I would expect that that would help us over time. So it's a long way of saying it; it's hard for me to really explain what's going on in the market right now because of kind of the unusual weather comparisons as well as the impact of fuel, but I think we'll have a better read on this as we get into the summer.
Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets: Okay. No, I was looking for more color. But I just want to clarify with following up just on what you're saying. In your preamble, you said you expect things to get better. It sounds like it's more of a macro view of the business rather than something you've seen in the last week or two as a trend that has turned up.
William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I expect the macro to clear up is what I try to say. I wish I could give you more. In terms of our performance, what I alluded to in my comments was March was softer and April softer. But again, I do think some of that is the comparisons. We'll see. So let's summarize here. You've got moderate inflation, you've got some FX, but let's put that to the side. And you've got softer volume in March and April. I would expect it to pick up. I'm still very pleased with what we are doing. We are growing our volume both on the local side and the corporate side. So relative to the market, I'm pleased where we are at there.
Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets: I just wanted to ask Chris a question on the incentive compensation accrual you've called out. It's kind of housekeeping, but it seemed like quite a big number compared to trend and well above what the stock option alone would be. Did I do that math right? And if so, could you give us some explanation of why the accrual was so big?
Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, I'm not so sure. I can't respond to the last part of – compared to what you're thinking, but the accrual itself is just what we anticipate paying out on those incentive accruals versus where we are on our objectives and on a year-over-year basis, we're just in a much better place. So last year at this time, we were not hitting our bonusable objectives and so we had very little accrued this year. We are accruing still at target because we are on pace to hit those objectives. So on a year-over-year basis, that's where you get the increase.
Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets: Okay. So you're saying it's on trend with prior quarters, there was no catch-up Q3, just your on trend with the bonus accrual?
Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Not this year. Yeah, this year, there's been no catch-up from quarter to quarter. No. Last year, it bounced around because every quarter you got to look at where you are versus those objectives and so we went through the first quarter fine. But then we had to start reducing the accruals Q2 and Q3 because we were no longer on track to hit the target.
Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets: Fine. So you were just calling out a tough comparison and we can do the adjustment if we like, and it is what it is. Okay.
Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. That's really all it is. Like say, I normally – I try to put things on an apples-to-apples basis as much as possible and when I look at our performance this year, especially on operating expenses, I don't like to say, well, we have to compare those incentives versus a year where there were no incentives whatsoever. Now, we still have to pay for those incentives and so those are real dollars and they are really going to go out the door, so we don't try to, again, excuse it, so much as just when you are looking at a percentage increase, I like to try to do apples-to-apples. That's why I gave you the number.
Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets.
Kelly A. Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi. Good morning. Thanks taking my question. I was just curious in the quarter how you think about market share or what your market share may have been and I ask because it looks like some of the broader industry sales trends, at least for the restaurants, it seem very, very strong this quarter. So I was just curious what you would think how you performed relative to the industry during the quarter.
William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer: I'll take that one, Kelly. First of all, we don't track market share quarterly. We look at it annually through different industry sources, primarily technomics and we look at the overall market, U.S. and Canada, and then obviously we look at our numbers and generally if you go back and look over the long-term, Sysco has been able to grow its share about half a point a year and I think we are continuing to do that. I can't really speak to this quarter on market share because I don't have the market data. Certainly, there was some strength in our customer base but not throughout the quarter and certainly not with all customers. So again, I was pleased with how we grew the business, but we don't really track the market share quarterly.
Kelly A. Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Got it. And then if I could just follow up with one more. Just in light of McDonald's announcement to shift towards using antibiotic-free chicken on their menus, I was just curious how Sysco is maybe positioned in terms of supply of antibiotic-free chicken. Do you see that as an opportunity? What kind of conversations are you having with suppliers and your customers around these products and what could any sales and margin implications for Sysco be if there is a broader shift from your customers to products like this?
William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. I think if I could broaden the question a little bit and not make it about chicken, but just in general, that's one of the key things that we think category management will help us focus on with a brighter light, which is be working with our suppliers and our customers is to better understand what the customers' needs are and how we can, as we optimize our SKUs and strategize together and do a better job of positioning a product in the way that our customers would want to see it whether it's organic or local or whatever it was important to them. So with us, it always starts the way you posed the question, which is what's important to the customer? What does the customer need? And we are doing a lot of work on the customer side through the marketing department, customer loyalty and issues to understand customer needs and then connecting that to the work that we are doing with our suppliers and category management and the data they provide us to better optimize our SKUs. Now, it's early days and plenty of work to do there, but it's a big opportunity for us going forward. And I would also say to you, we have over the years made some good progress on the sustainability front and I think you'll see us continue to raise the profile of that work within the company and that group will work very closely with our customers, but also with our merchandising and our marketing team. So bottom line is we do everything we can to understand what the needs of our customers are. I think we are better positioned to do that going forward and I think we can speak more specifically about that as time goes on.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Mark Wiltamuth with Jefferies.
Mark G. Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC: Hi, thank you. Could you just give a little more detail on what we could expect from the court action this week? How long will it take before we hear a decision? And if the court rules for you, is it a foregone conclusion that things will just be approved as stated? Or do you still need to negotiate with the FTC? And if there's a ruling against you, how long does it take to get through the administrative hearing with the FTC?
William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer: Great questions, Mark. This was new ground for all of us. I would say, as far as the timing, obviously, that's in the hands of the judge in terms of how long the process takes. The hearing starts tomorrow and the judge has given us up to seven days so we'll go through – it's likely to go through the end of next week. Then there'll be some, as I understand it, some briefs or papers filed by each side with the judge to review. And then, he'll take the time that he needs to come back with a ruling. So we don't know exactly how long that is, but I would think it's closer to weeks than months. But, again, that's his call. As far as what happens, as I said in my comments, if we were to prevail, then we think there's a short period of time where the FTC has an opportunity to decide whether they want to appeal or not. And we would wait on that, and then go from there. If they were to prevail, we'll sit down internally and then sit down with the sponsors, the owners of US Foods and charter a course from there as well. So, to be determined, but that's – those are the different ways it could play out.
Mark G. Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC: Okay. And maybe you could talk about the state of US Foods while we're waiting, because we have seen some margin declines in their business through this year, we've been waiting for this deal to close.
William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer: I really can't comment much on US Foods. I think it goes without saying that this process is taking longer than we would've liked. And it's probably a little bit harder on them than it has been on us. So, early days, certainly they lost some sales people and I think their sales were hurt. I'm not close enough to it nor should I be in terms of what their margins are right now. And obviously, they pulled back here some on the integration planning over the last couple of months. So we'll – I think I'll just leave it at that. I probably shouldn't be commenting on US Foods.
Mark G. Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Thank you very much.
William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: And let's take our next question from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.
John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Thanks. At this point, just one, I think, easy question for you guys. SYGMA, in general, had a very strong year in fiscal 2014 and has been pretty slow year-over-year to this point in fiscal 2015. Can you shed some light in terms of what's happened there, whether some was by choice, maybe some wasn't by choice? How you feel about the overall growth of that segment over time?
William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, John. I'll start. I'll let Chris jump in too. I would say it's been a couple of years since SYGMA has had a strong year, and it's got a lot of attention. We have restructured there somewhat and put Greg Keller over SYGMA full-time. And Greg grew up in the SYGMA business. He's been running our national sales area up until the last several months, so he is very well-versed in the SYGMA business. He's very well connected with our customer base. He's got a lot of passion for that business. So, I believe we're in good hands there for leadership. There's some things that we're working on there both in terms of how do we better position ourselves in terms of the needs of those customers and still run expenses very tight. So, it's a very transaction service oriented business. Not with a lot of touches like the Broadline, but there's very little margin for error in SYGMA. So, we've had to invest some money over the last year or so in terms of facilities and drivers and people like that and things like that to strengthen the business. And that's hurt us on the bottom line. We've also had to just take a look at how well we're running the business overall. So, I'd say, we're in transition with SYGMA. We like the business strategically. It's a very – that customer base or potential customer base is a big part of the overall opportunity. And it's always nice when you're sitting down with customers or prospective customers for – to give them a choice in terms of which model they would prefer, the SYGMA model or the Broadline model. And the reality is sometimes they prefer both, depending on their locations and our positions; so, somewhat in transition there, work to do strategically, still very important to the company.
John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Have you...
Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: John?
John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yes. Hi.
Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. Just add a couple of other points. As Bill said, it's a business where expense control is incredibly important. It's a low margin business. There have been some regulatory changes on the transportation side, drivers and work rules and things like that, that, while we can handle those fairly well in the Broadline, they affect SYGMA disproportionately. And we're having to overcome some of those things. And as Bill said, we just – we've got to look at the model and continue to find ways to offset increases like that; so I would echo the statement. It's in transition. We've got some work to do.
John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Has there been any significant account loss that's maybe been covered up by some account gains? And as you kind of look forward over the next couple of years, do you have any big chain opportunities to add that could be coming up for bid?
William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer: I don't think there's any overly significant account losses. SYGMA is no different than the rest of our business. There's a lot of pricing pressure in that business, and so we've had to deal with that as well along the way as we've looked at expenses. But again, Greg is a very strong leader, very strong sales guy. So I'm quite optimistic that we'll continue to find the right mix of customers and do a good job for them. And – but again, the way we look at SYGMA today is we want to understand what the customer's looking for: what kind of model, what level of support, what economics are they willing to incur. And if that's the SYGMA model, then fine. If it's not, then we'll put them into Broadline. They go back and forth and, as I said, some customers utilize both models. So, I think we're in a good place there in terms of the direction, but from a customer standpoint we look at it across the entire spectrum, which is: what does the customer want in terms of the trade-off of service and price?
John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you.
William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer: Sure.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Vincent Sinisi with Morgan Stanley.
Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks very much for taking my question. Wanted to just go back to the product for a second. And it sounds like, obviously, early stages, but so far if you've been seeing any incremental demand increases from more of your customers wanting natural organic types of products, would you say that so far you've been able to have access to the supplies? Have you been able to meet demands? And that, now as you're continuing to go through category management, is that something that will continue to evolve? Is that fair to say at this point?
William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Vinny. Yeah, that's what I was trying to say. So, yes, we've definitely seen that trend over the last few years. Now, it's a trend. And I have to tell you, in the scheme of what we do, it's not a huge amount of the business, which creates part of the challenge where you need enough volume and you need enough velocity to make it work for the supplier and on the cost side and for the customers. So, I would say it's like a lot of things in Sysco today. There's certainly parts of the country and certain OpCos where we do a very good job on the local side and fresh side, and then there's others not so good. And that's where I see the work in merchandizing, and category management, in particular, with innovation getting us in position to be more consistent; and by doing that, create more volume, which will make it more economical. So, the trends have definitely been there. We're responding to them. We just – we need to continue to get better at it and – it's a catch-22. We need to continue to grow the volume to make it work for everybody.
Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Right. That makes sense. Okay. And then, just a quick follow-up. Inflation, that you could see, moderate over the quarter. Was anything kind of internally surprising to you versus your forecast from a particular category specific standpoint? And then, maybe just any additional color with your thoughts on inflation overall as we get through the rest of this year.
William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah – surprising. I guess probably it fell off faster than I thought it would from that standpoint. It doesn't surprise me that dairy is down, for example. I mean, dairy is a very volatile category, but the fact that several categories are essentially flat, that's probably a little surprising. And I think as far as the rest of the year, I can't – if you're going to give me the fiscal year, I could probably look that far ahead. And I think we talked about this with John, earlier. Yeah, I would expect inflation to moderate somewhat more, but I still expect to see some low level of inflation here this quarter.
Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, Bill, thanks very much. Good luck.
William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Erin Lash with Morningstar.
Erin Lash - Morningstar Research: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I apologize if I missed this earlier, but one of the things that stood out to me in the operating expense line was that delivery costs were lower. And I wondered if you could speak to that, if there was an anomaly this quarter, or whether that's a trend that you expect to continue in light of the fact that we've been hearing that truck driver shortages continue to plague firms across a number of industries?
Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, it was mainly driven – at least in our case, it was mainly driven by lower fuel costs, which we called out. So, is the truck driver shortage abating? I would say that it's not getting any worse. We've kind of learned how to handle it, although it's not exactly easy; but this particular quarter we just started to see some benefit from fuel. And if you recall a quarter or so ago, we talked about we'd start seeing some benefit in the back half of the year, and this is it.
William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Erin, I would only add – I think where we have driver shortages, and where it's not self-inflicted, it's generally in these areas where there has been a lot of drilling and a lot of energy. And so, as that's subsided somewhat, I think that has actually created a little more capacity. So, we're not all the way back there, but I think that pressure is a little less than what it was six months or nine months ago.
Erin Lash - Morningstar Research: Okay. Thanks. That's very, very helpful. And then, just my second question with regards to a lot of the press surrounding the avian bird flu and whether that will – or to what degree you think that that could impact your cost structure going forward.
William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer: Erin, it's really too early for me to make a call on that. I don't think to a large extent, but it's certainly – those types of things are things we monitor regularly, but at this point, I'd say – I wouldn't say that's a big issue from a cost.
Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, it's affecting some of the supply as you're reading and that obviously has some impact out there. It's only if it starts affecting a very large part of the supply, not just here in the U.S. but offshore as well, but it begins to impact our ability to find product and distribute it to our customers. Thus far, that's not the case. But as Bill said, we watch this stuff. We stand up crisis teams when it's important and when it becomes relevant.
Erin Lash - Morningstar Research: Thank you. That's helpful.
Operator: And that does conclude our Q&A session and our conference call for today. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2015 Q2  (2015-02-02 10:00:00) =====

Analysts: Karen Short - Deutsche Bank John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities Fred Wightman - Citi Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets Meredith Adler - Barclays Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse Vinnie Sinisi - Morgan Stanley Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald John Ivankoe - JPMorgan Kelly Bania - BMO Capital Mark Wiltamuth - Jefferies
Operator: Please standby. Good morning. And welcome to Sysco Second Quarter Fiscal 2015 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today’s call is being recorded. We will begin today’s call with opening remarks and introductions. I would like to turn the call over to Shannon Mutschler, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma’am.
Shannon Mutschler: Good morning, everyone. And welcome to Sysco’s second quarter fiscal 2015 earnings call. Today you’ll hear prepared remarks from Bill DeLaney, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Kreidler, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, please note, that statements made during this presentation that state the company’s or management’s intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements and actual results could differ materially. Additional information about factors that could cause results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company’s SEC filings. This includes but is not limited to risk factors contained in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 28, 2014, subsequent SEC filings and in the news release issued earlier this morning. A copy of these materials can be found in the Investors section at sysco.com or via Sysco IR app. Non-GAAP financial measures are included in our comments today and in our presentation slides. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the applicable GAAP measures are included at the end of the presentation and can be also found in the Investors section of our website. All comments about earnings per share refer to diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. In addition, all references to case volume include total Broadline and SYGMA combined. To ensure that we have sufficient time to answer all questions today we’d like to ask each participant to limit their time today to one question and one follow-up. At this time, I’d like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill DeLaney.
Bill DeLaney: Thank you, Shannon, and hello, everyone, and thank you all for joining us today. This morning, Sysco reported second quarter fiscal 2015 financial results. Sales increased nearly 8% to $12.1 billion and adjusted net earnings increased 6% to $245 million. Adjusted EPS increased 5% to $0.41 for the quarter. Our second quarter financial results were generally in line with our expectations, as we delivered another quarter of solid operating performance. Most important, our associates remained highly focused on providing excellent service to our customers in what remains an extremely competitive market environment. We generated nearly 4% case volume growth during the quarter and effectively managed acute inflationary pressures in our meat and dairy categories. Specifically, case growth trends in our locally managed Broadline business were favorable in most of the geographic markets we serve. In addition, we generated solid case growth once again with our corporate managed customers in the restaurant and travel and leisure segments. Our performance during the quarter was due in part to the benefits we realized from our portfolio of business transformation initiatives, especially category management. As our ability to effectively integrate these initiatives in our steady-state operating activities has improved consistently over time. While we are pleased with our overall performance during the quarter, we did fall short of our expense management targets. Expense increases were driven primarily by higher incentive accruals, selling cost and delivery cost. Excluding certain items and the unfavorable impact of incentive accruals, operating expenses increased 4%. As I’ve mentioned previously, Sysco’s single largest opportunity for improvement remains more consistent execution across the organization. We are implementing tools to provide increased visibility to key performance metrics, as well as improved best practices. While we are seeing some level of improvement in this area and believe we are on the right path, we have more work to do. Regarding overall industry trends, current restaurant data shows modest signs of gradual improvement. NPD, which tracks restaurant trends, recently reported positive traffic growth in the mid-scale and casual dining sectors for the first time since 2008. This is encouraging news as the casual dining sector includes a significant number of independent restaurant customers, for whom we provide substantial value-added products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and employment metrics are, for the most part showing improvement. We are hopeful, lower fuel prices will further improve the customers -- the consumer outlook and lead to sustainable increase traffic and spend for our customer base. We remain intently focused on enhancing every aspect of our business. So that we are able to better support our customers, operate more efficiently and compete more effectively. Benefits from our category management initiative continued to gain momentum. We expect that all categories representing approximately $15 billion in annual spend will be launched into the market by the end of this fiscal year and that we will achieve the three-year cost savings target that we established prior to the start of fiscal 2013. In addition, we are working with our suppliers in a more strategic and effective way that we believe provides a meaningful platform for growth and innovation in our respective businesses. Turning to an update in our technology initiatives, we continue our merger integration planning with regards to technology and have begun certain fundamental projects necessary for integration. As we move forward in deploying our ERP platform our approaches continue to evolve. For instance, we have focused on broad implementations at the operating companies for several years, with a plan to convert the hub where our shared business services facility last. However, we have found that this created inefficiencies at SBS that would make further rollouts challenging. Thus, we are now moving forward with the rollout of SAP financial modules for general ledger, accounts payable and accounts receivable, as well as additional elements of the HR module, all of which are intended to make SBS more effectively in the near-term and make future ERP conversions at the operating companies relatively easier. While focusing on operational excellence is a key area for us we also have important work underway to identify new markets with opportunity for profitable growth. As we discussed last quarter, we’ve developed a robust approach to serve the fast-growing Hispanic restaurant sector. We estimate that we have 10% to 15% of this $10 billion foodservice market and believe we have a significant opportunity to better serve these customers and grow our sales. We made additional strides of this effort recently with the launch of our new multi-lingual website dedicated to support customers in this segment. The site includes news, tips, menu ideas and trend data intended to help Hispanic operators drive restaurant traffic, improve their operations and better address their customer's evolving needs. I’m extremely proud of the efforts and accomplishments of our leadership team over the last several months. As we announced last August, Mike Green retired from Sysco at the end of the calendar -- at the end of the calendar year after 24 years of distinguished service. On January 1st, Tom Bene became Executive Vice President and President, Food Service Operations, succeeding Mike. Tom reports to me and has responsibility for all business operations, sales, merchandising, marketing and revenue management. Tom is a proven commercial leader with deep expertise and a strong track record in the food service industry. Since joining Sysco early in 2013, he has helped drive major advances in category management, revenue management, sales capability and customer insights from segmentation. We’re fortunate to have such a capable leader to succeed Mike. In addition and also effective January 1, 2015, Scott Charlton, Senior Vice President, Distribution Services, now reports to me in an expanded role. Scott leads end-to-end supply chain operations, including warehousing, inbound and outbound transportation and replenishment. Scott joined Sysco in 2013 as well and brings great energy and expertise to our senior leadership team. Turning to an update on our proposed merger with the US Foods. Over the past 12 months, we have worked in good faith with the FTC, providing millions of pages of documents and explaining to them our industry and the merits of our proposed merger. We strongly believe that the combination of Sysco and US Foods will promote competition in where it's already a highly competitive industry by positioning us to provide significant value to our customers, including lower cost. Unfortunately, the FTC has taken a different view of the potential competitive impacts of the merger. While we respectfully but vigorously disagree with the FTC’s analysis, we announced today a substantial divestiture package that we believe fully addresses their concerns. At this time, the FTC has not agreed to this solution. So we will now present our position, including this proposed remedy, to the five FTC commissioners and seek to obtain their approval. We remain convinced that the proposed transaction is good for our customers, our associates and our shareholders. In closing, I'm pleased with our operating performance through the first half of our fiscal year. Case growth and sales growth were up 3% and 7% respectively, while adjusted operating income and EPS grew at a rate of 5% and 6% respectively. In addition, many of our strategic business initiatives are gaining traction and contributing to these results. As we move forward into the remainder of our fiscal year, we are committed to improving the consistency of our operational execution, successfully rolling out our portfolio of initiatives and further developing our plans to integrate Sysco and US Foods. This is a critical time in our history and we believe the strategic actions we're taking are vital to both strengthening our customer relationships and providing solid returns to our shareholders over the long term. Now I’ll turn things over to Chris, so he could provide additional details on our financial results for the second quarter as well as the agreement we announced this morning with Performance Food Group.
Chris Kreidler: Thanks Bill and good morning everyone. For the second quarter, sales were $12.1 billion, an increase of 7.6% compared to prior year. Food cost inflation was 6%, driven mainly by double-digit inflation in the meat and dairy categories. Sales from acquisitions increased sales by 0.8% and the impact of changes in foreign exchange rate decreased sales by 0.9%. Case volume grew 3.6% during the quarter including acquisitions and approximately 3.3% excluding acquisitions. Gross profit in the second quarter was $2.1 billion, a 6.1% increase. And gross margin declined 23 basis points to 17.25%. Benefits from category management contributed to our gross profit performance during the quarter. In addition, case volume growth advanced from the prior quarter and this increased demand aiding gross profit performance. In our higher margin locally managed Broadline business, case volume growth remained relatively steady and accelerated with our corporate managed customers. Certain items for the quarter totaled $133 million and primarily related to merger and integration planning expenses. Of this amount, $81 million was recorded in operating expense and $52 million was recorded in interest expense. Merger and integration planning expenses that impacted operating expense were associated with professional fees to assist us in managing integration planning as well as the legal and IT related projects. Work-related integration planning peaked in the second quarter and costs related to these efforts should decline going forward. Merger and integration expenses that impacted interest expense relate to the debt issuance during the quarter that is intended to finance US Foods debt upon closing of the merger. We're trading this interest expense of this certain item until the merger closes. After excluding certain items, adjusted operating expense for the quarter increased $108 million or 6.8% compared to the prior year period. This increase was driven by $115 million increase in payroll expense resulting from several factors. First, during last year second quarter, we reduced certain management incentive accruals based on our performance versus our objectives at that time. And this year’s second quarter, these same incentives are generally accrued at higher amounts, reflecting the impact of our recent performance and causing a year-over-year variance of $41 million. Excluding this year-over-year difference in incentive accruals, adjusted operating expenses would have increased only 4.2%. Second, pay to our sales organization was higher as a result of growth in gross profit dollars. These are costs we would expect to see given our performance for the quarter. Sales cost also increased although to a lesser extent as a result of hiring additional marketing associates over the last year. As we discussed last quarter, some of this increase in MAs is related to normal hiring to replace attrition and support growth. However, certain markets added MAs because they lost more than they planned when we implemented our sales reorganization a couple of years ago. As a reminder, it takes roughly 18 months for an MA to be fully productive. Third, as we’ve discussed in prior quarters, we continue to experience higher delivery costs in our Broadline operations. As Bill mentioned, we have a number of initiatives that are in various stages of implementation that we anticipate will help to reduce these costs and increase productivity to mitigate these increases. And lastly, payroll increased due to the newly acquired operations, including Metropolitan Poultry, the joint venture in Costa Rica we entered into last fiscal year and Iowa Premium Beef. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $396 million, up 3.1% for the prior year and adjusted operating margin was 3.3%, down 14 basis points from last year. Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 33.1% compared to 35.4% in the prior year period. The majority of this change is the result of reduced state taxes from legal restructuring as well as a growing base of business in international jurisdictions that have lower tax rate. Adjusted net earnings increased 5.5% to $245 million and adjusted EPS increased 5.1% to $0.41. Turning to cash flow, cash flow from operations declined $6 million to $452 million for the first half of the fiscal year. Cash flow from operations was negatively impacted by two items. First, the cash impact of certain items increased $96 million year-over-year, mainly due to merger and integration planning expenses. Second, we made a $50 million pension contribution in the first half of this year, compared to none in the prior year period. This difference is simply driven by different timing regarding, when we make cash contribution each year. With respect to working capital, our usage increased year-over-year mainly due to an increase in sales and inventory, driven by increased inflation and case growth. Cash tax payments for the first half of the fiscal year were $179 million, lower than last year due to a lower effective tax rate, which I discussed a moment ago and merger and integration planning expenses that reduced the taxable earnings. Capital expenditures, net of proceeds from sales of assets totaled $296 million for the first half of the fiscal year, compared to $247 million last year. Roughly, half of the $49 million year-over-year increase is due to the timing of investments in our fleet, with remainder coming from IT projects that are related to integration planning. Free cash flow was $157 million in the first half of this fiscal year, compared to $211 million in the prior year period. These results include the $96 million increase in the cash impact of certain items to cash flows from operations and the $50 million increase in pension contributions I mentioned earlier, as well as a $16 million increase in capital spending related to merger integration. After adjusting for these items, free cash flow was $324 million or an increase of $107 million. As we discussed last quarter, in October, we issued $5 billion in debt, the proceeds of the offering are unintended to fund the various elements of US Foods’ transaction. As we closed on the new debt issuance, we simultaneously terminated both the bridge facility and the related free issuance hedges, both of which were put in place as part of the financing strategy for the merger. Following the unwinding of the hedges, we paid $59 million in September to settle that hedge against our 10-year note issuance. In October, we paid a $130 million to settle the hedge against our third-year debt issuance, which is shown as the financing activities in our cash flow statement in the second fiscal quarter. The financial impact of the unwind of the hedges will be amortized into earnings over 10 years and 30 years respectively. Regarding our outlook into the third quarter and the remainder at the year, there were several additional items I’d like to point out. First, as discussed on the last quarter’s call, we continued to implement our category management initiative as planned and are pleased with the progress we’ve made in integrating this approach to our business. A favorable year-over-year impact has been meaningful to our performance over the last three quarters, but we expect it will begin to moderate in the fourth quarter. Second, regarding cost per case in our North American Broadline business, we had communicated in the last quarter that we expect that it would be difficult to meet our objective of keeping cost per case flat year-over-year. For the first half of the year, cost per case increased $0.10. While, we expect year-over-year cost increases to moderate in the second half of the year, we no longer expect cost per case to be flat for the full year. Instead, we now anticipate an increase of approximately $0.05 to $0.10 for the fiscal year. Third, with regard to fuel expense, we have been evaluating the impact on our business of the recent decline in crude prices. While diesel prices have declined more than 20% over the course of the fiscal year, our program of entering into forward fuel purchase contracts smoothes the impact of price changes over time. As a result, we did not have a material change in fuel expense in the second quarter or first half of this fiscal year. However, we do expect a roughly $15 million decline in fuel expense over the second half of the fiscal year. This modest projected benefit will likely be offset to some degree by lower fuel surcharges. Fourth, as a reminder, we continue to expect to report approximately $40 million in incremental merger related interest expense per quarter, which we will exclude from our adjusted numbers until the close of the merger. And finally, I wanted to speak for a moment about our outlook for share repurchases. Our approach to repurchases for the last several years has been to buyback shares throughout the year, with the goal of keeping shares outstanding relatively constant. However, during this fiscal year, we have not been in the market buying shares due to the pending merger. This is half the effect of increasing our shares outstanding in the first half of the fiscal year due to the exercise of employees’ stock options and RSU grants. We are not prepared to comment about if, or when we may resume buying back shares. However, if we bought no shares for the remainder of the year, we estimate that our diluted shares outstanding may be greater than $597 million shares for the fiscal year. This estimate is dependent on the level of stock exercises that occur and does not include the impact of the shares to be issued in conjunction with the proposed US Foods merger. Turning to an update on our proposed merger with US Foods, we believe that the divestiture agreement we announced today fully addresses the FTC’s concerns. Upon closing of the Sysco- US Foods merger, this definitive agreement will include selling 11 US Foods operating locations, representing $4.6 billion in annual sales to Performance Food Group. Sysco would receive $850 million in cash in return from PFG. The divested markets will expand Performance Food Group's geographic footprint in the U.S. and enable it to compete more effectively for both larger and smaller customers. The divested locations are Corona, California; Denver, Colorado; Kansas City, Kansas; Phoenix, Arizona; Salt Lake City, Utah; San Diego, California; San Francisco, California; Seattle, Washington; Cleveland, Ohio; Las Vegas, Nevada and Minneapolis, Minnesota. In addition, Sysco and Performance Food Group have signed a multi-year transition services agreement to ensure a smooth transfer of assets from US Foods to Performance Food Group. As PSA provides various support services and personnel to help Performance Food Group succeed as the new business owner in these locations. Clearly, this development has implications for our synergy expectations. It’s important to remember that integration planning work has been underway over the past year, which has enabled us to refine and enhance our confidence in our synergy estimates. As a direct result of this work, we determine that growth synergies related to the transaction were substantially higher than previous estimates. After reducing our revised synergy estimates to reflect the facilities to be divested, we now expect net annualized operating synergies to be at least $600 million after four years. Our current expectation is that operating synergies will begin to accumulate in year two, following the close of the transaction. In addition to operating synergies, there were substantial financial synergies related to the transaction, including interest savings, totaling approximately $150 million annually and cash tax savings from the realization of acquired NOLs, totaling approximately $150 million. We expect to realize both of these financial synergies in the first year, following the close of the transaction. We have also updated our expectations regarding the cost to integrate the two companies. We continue to expect that incremental merger expenses will total approximately $700 million to $800 million over four years. In addition, we expect the incremental capital spend to require to integrate with total approximately $300 million to $400 million over four years. Now, while the actual gross cost to integrate will be higher than those incremental costs I just mentioned, we expect to fund a portion of these costs from our current operating and capital expense run rates. We now expect the transaction to be accretive in the second year following the close of the transaction, excluding cost to integrate the company and deal-related amortization. And with that, operator, we will now take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Karen Short with Deutsche Bank.
Karen Short: Hi. So just to focus on the transaction a little bit. I mean, maybe can you give some color on where you think the issues are with the FTC in terms of you both not being in agreement? And then maybe follow-up, just some color on the facilities that are being divested, the customer type EBITDA associated with the facilities, things like that?
Bill DeLaney: Good morning, Karen. I will start and I don’t know how far Chris can go with that second part, but I will give a shot at that. One of the things we want to be carefully of this one is that, we don’t want to be in a position where we’re trying to articulate a point of view with the FTC. They will have plenty of opportunity to do that. So what I would say is a good, a very high percentage of the conversation over the last several weeks and really months has been around their concern of -- they believe that there is a national market. They believe that there are customers out there that will only buy from distributors who have a national footprint. We disagree with that. We see and live that every day where customers -- some of these larger customers will buy from multiple distributors, they might buy from regionals or multi-regionals, they may buy from us and/or US or PFG, and they obviously buy from specialty firms. Some may buy from only a few of us. Some may actually put most of their business with one or two of us. But our point of view is that when we compete for that business, we are competing not just with US Food and PFG, but DMA, but with a lot of regionals, who are now multi-regionals. And even in the situation where certain customers will work with a fewer number of distributors that opportunity to work with more is always in the room when you are negotiation our peer new business. So, I think, again, I can’t make their case for them, but I think that’s been where we spent a lot of the time in the conversation of how we address their concerns about how these customers continue to get good service and appropriate pricing. And that is why we ultimately, even though we disagree with the position, we are willing to put forth the divestiture package which we believe from our perspective, based on our knowledge of the business, our knowledge of the competitive landscape should allow PFG to go out and compete very well in the way that the FTC would hope. So that’s my best way of describing it today. As we've said, we will have some more opportunity to speak with the FTC and the five commissioners here over the next week or two and I am sure there will be more information coming out of those meetings.
Karen Short: Okay. And can you provide us with any color on the customer types of those facilities and EBITDA dollars? And I guess just a follow-on on that. In terms of the synergy number, is the $600 million synergy, does that actually include any operating profits associated with the TSA PFG?
Chris Kreidler: So on the first part of your question, Karen, I am not going to get into the detail of facilities or the EBITDA, the package, but I will generally say, because I think it addresses what you’re trying to get out there that it is a representative package, if you will, of US Foods. I don’t think there is a disproportionate amount higher or lower of EBITDA or disproportionate type of customer services out of these facilities than US Food as a whole. That is generally correct, but I am going to leave it there just in terms of describing these package of facilities. I am sorry. Remind me the other part of your question, please?
Karen Short: Well the $600 million, I mean you obviously said during this whole integration process, you’ve identified additional synergies, but you’re very comfortable with the $600 million that you originally put out there? I am just wondering if the $600 million includes operating. I’d assume there is operating profit associated with the TSA, with PFG, does that $600 million include?
Chris Kreidler: No, it doesn’t include any operating profit associated with the TSA. TSAs typically are constructed so that you’re reimbursed for your costs, you don’t technically make any money. If you do, it’s very small amounts of money, but the way these things are constructed, you usually just reimburse for your expenses.
Karen Short: Great. Thanks.
Operator: We will move on to our next question from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.
John Heinbockel: So just a few questions on the -- right on the transaction, the $600 million, that does not include any financial synergies, correct? Number two, when you found incremental synergies right beyond what you’re thinking before, is that more buckets that you hadn’t anticipated or buckets that are just bigger? And if there are buckets that are bigger, what might one or two of those buckets be? And then lastly, I assume all other terms of the purchase on your end remain the same, that none of that has changed, that’s it?
Chris Kreidler: Okay. John, if I can, I will take those in reverse order.
John Heinbockel: Yes, sure.
Chris Kreidler: Yes, nothing changes in the transaction that we had negotiated with US Foods. That remains the same in all aspects. You are correct on the first question you asked. The financial synergies I described which the two biggest ones are interest savings over the two combined pro formas and the use of the NOLs, those are not included in the $600 million. Financial synergies, we expect to achieve in the first year after closing the operational synergies, we expect to start occurring in the second year after closing. And then the middle question there really around where we would find the additional synergies? When we put our first synergy number out on the table I feel like I have to keep reminding ourselves as well as everybody else, it was with essentially publicly available information. We didn’t have a lot of additional information. We had some experience at Sysco dealing with some of these buckets of opportunities. We had done some category management work. We have done route optimization. And so we knew that this is what we’ve been able to do, what can we do if you can buy and then we made some assumptions. And we made prudent assumptions but not overly really aggressive. We are going to be candid about that. As we’ve learned a lot more about this, I would say every bucket probably increase in size, certainly around merchandising and supply chain, it will say inbound and outbound delivery transportation. Those buckets got quite a lot larger. So we’ve found it across the board, but in certain places we found more. And so we rebuilt synergies from the bottom up using more information through our integration planning efforts. There is still a lot of information we are not allowed to have access to and we are abiding by all those rules. So we expect that when we eventually close and we get access to some additional information, we will true this up again. But we’ve made pretty good assumptions and we are still being what I would call prudent. We are not being overly aggressive or overly conservative.
John Heinbockel: All right. And then lastly, you talked about wanting to sort of tighten up expense control, where are the biggest opportunities? And then secondly, is that something that can be done while you are in the early stages of doing the US Food integration, or is that something that has to come later?
Bill DeLaney: John, I will start there as well. I think in terms of the biggest opportunities, they are generally always going to be on the operational side. So some of our G&A costs are up this year, a fair amount of that was planned some of the work we are doing with these initiatives in the technology area. Our selling costs are up a little more than we planned, but our gross profit is higher. So that one doesn’t concern me as much. That takes you to the supply chain operations, and we’ve just got more work to do there in terms of improving our productivity at a rate commensurate with where our costs go up. And we tend to be very good in this area but we’ve got a lot of initiatives going on in this area as well. I’ve mentioned Scott and he has been with us a couple of years. And with our new enterprise structure, his functional group working hand in hand with our operating company leadership to basically strike the right balance between what we need to do support our customers each and every day but also putting better and more consistent best practices, monitor them better, get our compensation schemes in line with our productivity. So a lot of work to be done in that area and more to do but I would say, that’s what the biggest opportunity is.
Bill DeLaney: As far as the merger, I would say, on the merger, Chris talked to this. And I let him address it again. I think we’re seeing opportunities through these synergies to do better. The challenge there will be to do what we’ve done, a nice job so far. I mean, so far, when you hear me speak, we’d be really proud as management team and frankly all of our folks. We’ve done a nice job of being able to separate all the work and all the hours and the pressure is going on with the integration planning and still be able to run our business pretty well. So that’s the biggest challenge I see post close here as to -- continue to run these businesses but drive out at that point of synergies. So I think, when we get to that point, we’ll talk to you more and we’ll have to come up with some ways to speak to how we’re making progress here and still making sure we’re shipping groceries in the right way to our customers.
John Heinbockel: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question will come from Greg Badishkanian from Citi.
Fred Wightman: Hi. Good morning. This is actually Fred Wightman on for Greg. Last quarter you guys mentioned that there were some labor shortages in delivery drivers, has that situation abated? And are you guys seeing any other pockets of labor pressure?
Bill DeLaney: Good morning. We did speak to that. We still have some of those situations. It’s abated some. The source of that is really two-fold, one, over the last few years -- we will see what the next few months bring with the price of oil but over the last few years, several of our markets are very much energy driven or intensive. There is a lot of good jobs out there on the energy side. Some of those jobs are very competitive or more competitive in terms of lifestyle and wages to what we offer. And so in those markets where energy has been strong, we struggled to some extent, too early to tell if that’s going to abate. The other part quite candidly is we’ve had some internal issues in certain markets where as we’ve centralized some of our hiring practices and begun to coordinate that process between the OpCo and our SBS center. Certainly, we went pretty fast and aggressively and there were some markets where we didn't execute as well we should have. So we're also catching up in those areas. So there is still a handful out there too that we have some issues but it has abated and I would expect it to continue to improve.
Fred Wightman: And then you briefly mentioned this in your response to the last question but you mentioned that some geographies were performing better than others? Have you seen that trend become more pronounced especially in some of these oil producing regions?
Bill DeLaney: I’d say, it’s pretty pronounced in Southwest and we’re seeing that for several quarters now. I would also tell you -- interesting right now when we look at the numbers up December, January or early February, if you recall, we had some really severe weather last year when we had -- we’re getting more weather now over the last week or two. As you look at the markets, you can kind of see where the weather impacted last year and whether weather didn’t impact last year. So I would say, the Southwest and the West Coast, in particular, were doing well. It’s hard to tell how much of that is the market and how much of that is our leadership in those markets but those two in particular. And right now looks like quarter is off to a pretty good start in terms of their season.
Operator: Moving on, we’ll take Andrew Wolf with BB&T Capital Markets.
Andrew Wolf: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to check, Chris, on moving the accretion to your two -- what that means for dilution in year one? I don’t know if you saw but I did put on my own estimate around $0.15 if you divested $5 billion of US Foods service assets and I just used value as I think suggested just their average blended operating margin. Just would like to know, if you think that’s at least in the ballpark in terms of reasonableness?
Chris Kreidler: Andrew, I would -- I have to be very careful to comment about your own estimates and your own modeling, so apologies for that. But look, originally, we believe based upon initial modeling that we thought it would be accretive in year one as we have refined all of our estimates, not just the numbers but the timing of the numbers and then overlaid the divestitures, we think its year two that is accretive. Frankly, I’m not prepared to talk about year one dilution or anything yet. We’ve got more work that we need to do to pin that down. So best I can tell you is we’ve shifted some stuff based upon when we think we’re going to be rolling certain initiatives and where -- how we think we’re going to go after some of the synergies and that’s affected our -- when we’re going to achieve accretion.
Andrew Wolf: But I mean, you would as well as the divestures, I mean, clearly your …
Chris Kreidler: Yes.
Andrew Wolf: …selling them below what you’re paying for? Okay.
Chris Kreidler: Yes.
Andrew Wolf: Just wanted to ask a procedural question on the FTC, I think it’s all implied but I just want to make sure I understand it. It sounds -- so you secured agreements from the commissioners to meet with them, the five commissioners and to make your case? And does that been -- have they then agreed to vote what they want to conduct their vote at that point, once you've done in the next few weeks meeting with them or the next couple weeks?
Bill DeLaney: Look Andy, I think there is one thing I think at this point of the FTC we do agree on is that its time to move this process forward. And we have plenty of time to talk and educate and listen and negotiate or whatever. So what we’re at is they basically signal to us that it’s time to meet with the commissioners and so we’re preparing to do that. And of course along the way, since they’ve signaled for quite time their concern. They’ve articulated earlier, we’ve had parallel discussions with PFG. And so we’re able to poll that agreement together here over the weekend. We just fell it would be in everyone's best interest, including our customers and our associates to kind of have better knowledge of what’s really going on. There has been a lot of weeks, so we just fell it made a lot of sense. If we’re going to visit with the commissioners to have this agreement in place so that we can look them in the eye and tell them exactly what we are prepared to do and there is no uncertainty in terms of our ability to do it. So that’s a little color, I guess from my end. Chris, you want to add anything on process?
Chris Kreidler: Actually, I think that covers it well. One thing probably I’m going to speak a lot to is what happened after we meet with the commissioners. There is nothing defined at that point. That is the next step that’s what we’re talking about and it’s hard to talk half that point but that’s what we are. Its time to move this thing forward as Bill said.
Andrew Wolf: And just one other thing on this the deal on talking with the commissioners. Now the PFG deal, is it -- how would you think of your sense of how the commissioners view that deal as it stands? You think it’s ambiguous. Have they signaled that that is not enough that could be enough or is it I guess, that’s what you’re going to discover. How should we think about whether the deal you struck with PFG is going to way with the FTC commissioner?
Bill DeLaney : I think you should look at it from the perspective of what we’re saying, which is we’ve had a lot of time and a lot of opportunity to have discussions with the FTC and as well as address remedies to concerns that they have, which we don’t share but which we certainly want to address because, it’s disruptive type business, it’s disruptive to the business that we are acquiring and it’s disruptive to our customers. So, we are trying to find a remedy here and obviously they haven’t agreed anything at this point. So, I think it will be determined.
Andrew Wolf: Okay. Can I just ask one another, just a number question on the adjustment statement? The $78 million in merger integration costs this quarter was about $40.5 million last quarter and talking about the last quarter was mainly consultants. Chris, you might have talked about this, maybe I didn’t understand it. But what is the majority of that stuff up in the merger spending?
Chris Kreidler: Yeah. It is mainly consultants, yeah. But that’s majority of that $78 million is what we call professional fees for outside consultants that are helping us. Some of the uptick came from legal, from the fact that we have started some foundational IT projects that are going to be necessary for integration, so some of that stuff kicked in to the quarter. As we also said though, our merger integration planning it’s -- I think the word we use and it’s probably the word, a peak. It will be coming down from there and so that’s what we work for the quarter.
Andrew Wolf: Okay. Thank you, and good luck with everything. Thank you.
Bill DeLaney: Thanks, Andy.
Operator: Meredith Adler with Barclays has our next question.
Meredith Adler: Very informative. I’ll actually go back and talk a little bit about operations and just want to understand. You had 6% food inflation and when you do the simple math, you wouldn’t end up with volume growth of 3.3%. But obviously what that means is that you have the inflation, but your sales didn’t go up necessarily by 6% because of inflation. Is that right?
Bill DeLaney: As you’ve stated that’s right. Is this -- is the question why?
Meredith Adler: Well, I may guess that the assumption then would be that you are still having trouble passing a long inflation?
Bill DeLaney: I think there is many of reasons, Meredith. I think some of it is mix, right. So, lot of inflation is in this higher dollar cost, boxes of meat and dairy this last quarter. So it’s partially mix. It’s certainly is partially, as I’ve talked in the past alone to your point. So one of the things we do with customers continually, especially now is to try to listen to them, understand what their needs are, understand where they are going with their menu. And if there is some more cost effective ways for them to buy from us and to still position their menu, advantage is where and that’s what we do. So if they can offer more poultry dishes or other types of ally card items that is the plan maybe what they’ve formally done with cheese or with beef then, there is some of that going on as well. I mean, our case growth still is very good in these inflationary categories I think it’s the mix I think it’s -- trying to find the right price point if you will for our customers. And I think it is hard to imagine inflation, but our point is we’ve been doing a better job of it here over the last year or two. And I think category management speed is beginning to help also and some of our other initiatives in terms of product training, in terms of our sales people being able to sit down have good propel conversations with our customers. So it’s a lot of things, but probably mix would be as big as any.
Meredith Adler: And those comments about mix, is it fair to assume that the category management process has come up with -- I won’t say identical, but similar kinds of things? I mean, you’ve said in the past that it’s not just about reducing SKUs. So category management is about helping the customer buy better items, or more cost effective items?
Bill DeLaney: No, not exactly, what we -- the goal is with category management is to help our customers and ourselves frankly optimize -- in our case optimize their SKUs over time, There is plenty of work still to be down there, help them use those products that we are bringing to them to augment their menu in the right way, maybe changing up a bit makes sense. But for both of us to make commitments for the customer to commit with us and for us to commit with our suppliers to take cost out of the system and to be able to buy these products better, and to realize those savings both on Sysco’s bottom line as well as the bottom line. And I think, we are starting to see nice traction there on that part of it. Longer-term, we as an opportunity to really differentiate ourselves in the marketplace with expanded product lines, maybe broader not as deep, perhaps in some of the SKUs they don’t move as fast where we can have more customize offerings to customers as we better understand their needs and better understand the process. And then also use this platform to bring more innovation to the offering. So in the short-term, I would look at it as an opportunity to partner more strategically with our customers, buy more efficiently, and to pass some of those savings along to the customer base. And for both of us to optimize our SKUs with the long-term goal of being able to really bring more innovation and more differentiation to the product line.
Meredith Adler: That’s very helpful. And then just one quick question, maybe for Chris about fuel surcharges. Can you say how much of the cost -- it’s hard because you’ve been hedged, but if you give up the fuel surcharges, how much does that offset the benefit of lower fuel prices?
Chris Kreidler: Yeah. Let me come at that from this direction. First, I mean, fuel charges are a bit different, when you think about it with our larger customers and our smaller customers. With larger customers, we may have contracts that are pegged to certain fuel price. They may go up, they may go down. They last for periods of time. That’s not something that you just “give up” because they were structured into the cost structure of the contract. Fuel surcharges on the street are different and obviously they can change on a daily, weekly, monthly basis. So the concept of quote, giving them up doesn’t -- it’s harder for me to address. I will say this. We look at fuel, when we look at what’s happening to fuel. We did not raise fuel surcharges, when fuel prices started going up and that was kind of one of the luxuries of our forward buying strategy. It gave us time to asses what was really going on before we needed to react. Now that they are coming down, we are looking at it actively to see what’s appropriate in the market and for our customers and we’ll continue to look at that. But we wanted to flag is, it’s a big story out there. There is a reason why it doesn’t impact our fuel cost because of the way we smooth on an ongoing basis. So it hasn’t in the first half, we are flagging that it will, to the extent at least to $15 million, which is in our overall cost structure is a very small amount. But that’s what we need to look at when we think about the fuel surcharges, how much of that amount might need to be mitigated with adjustments to the surcharge.
Meredith Adler: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We’ll move on to Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse.
Edward Kelly: Yeah. Hi, guys. Good morning.
Chris Kreidler: Good morning, Ed.
Edward Kelly: Two quick questions for you. Chris, just one follow-up on the $600 million in synergies. Since -- ever since the deal was announced, there was lots of talk around potential negative synergies from things that customer overlap. I don't know to what extent you’ve had the ability to take a deeper look at that and maybe some color there would be good and also the $600 million net. Does that basically contemplate any possible negative synergies as well?
Chris Kreidler: Yeah. Look, we continue to look at that. Early on, we obviously needed to make some assumptions just to figure out what we thought an appropriate, what the return would be in, whether it was an appropriate return to the amount of investments. So, we made some assumptions. As we’ve gone toward the integration planning process, we’ve continued to refine our thinking there and one thing I can tell you is there is no good science around predicting that. I can make a guess, you can make a guesses, and we could be wildly different in our guesses. And then secondly, there is no real way to measure it even after the fact. So what we’ve done instead is just try to get into what would cause a customer to want to leave and then what can we do reason by reason to medicate that risk. And so we’ve spent an inordinate amount of time through all of our integration planning teams to go after those issues. Everything that we are working on is based on the principle of we want to make this as at least disruptive to our customers as we possibly can, our customer and US Food’s customers as we possibly can. And so we are not spending a lot of time trying to estimate potential disruption or losses of customers. We are spending all of our time trying to make sure that we know what might cause them to leave and how we’re going to address that right out of the box so they don’t leave. Now to address your question, we are calling these net operational synergies because we do believe it takes into account what we might see in the way of disruption. But it’s our estimate and we frankly hope that we’re going to be wrong and it’s going to be better than that.
Edward Kelly: Okay. Good. Thank you. And then my just one follow-up question here. You’re growing gross profit dollar per case. Again, this is I think the fourth quarter now that we’ve seen it. So it obviously speaks positively about the business, speaks positively about the industry. But I was curious about is how much of it is sort of internal initiatives, things like category management versus just a better industry outlook as well? I was wondering if you could maybe help parse that out for us.
Bill DeLaney: Great question, hard to answer, Ed. I think we’re hopeful on the -- some of this positive consumer sentiment that’s been out there for a while begins to get to our customer base and that will translate into more industry growth. Our quarterly numbers as you track them, you see they have been float around between 2% and 3% here over the last few quarters. We do have a positive growth for the locally managed customers now, which we didn’t have a year ago. So that’s a big part of it which coming back to mix and the different way customer mix. We’ve spent, as you can appreciate, a lot of time and effort over the last 15 months with best practices and how to manage margin better and still effectively deliver customers need in terms of offerings. But clearly the category management is driving a fair amount of it right now. And we’re doing a better job of integrating it as I said in my prepared comments into the everyday business activities. So I would say that’s a large part of it.
Edward Kelly: Great. Thank you.
Bill DeLaney: Thank you.
Operator: Moving on to Vinnie Sinisi with Morgan Stanley.
Vinnie Sinisi: Hey, great. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask you guys about the ERP rollout. It seems like parts of it are going to continue to move forward here. I know on the past you’ve said that with the merger pending that you are kind of taking a bit of a step back on some of those processes. So can you just kind of recap for us all in terms of -- is this now going to really restart here or are some parts of it or which parts of it will still be waiting on the outcome of the merger?
Bill DeLaney: Good morning. I think it’s more of what we talked about over the last couple quarters in terms of, we are not doing new deployments right now until we have a better sense for where the merger is going to play out and when and some of the geographic issues that will come with that. But what we’ve been able to do and we did -- when we talked about in the last earnings call, we’ve been able to go in and put in some significant enhancements into the software that are now being utilized by the 12 OpCos that are on and the core SAP software platforms. And the other thing we are doing more of, which we spoke to here today, is taking some of the other applications, whether they’re financial or HR, maintenance that type of thing, even for the SA -- even for the non-SAP OpCos bring those into SPS, accelerating network to where SPS is now, supporting in certain areas, not just the 12 OpCos that run SAP, but these are the functional support software packages as well. So to summarize, I think it’s a combination that we’re continuing to enhance the support around and the software that the 12 OpCos are using as well as beginning to leverage SPS in a different way and as I said. So, A, we’re providing better services to the 12 OpCos today, but also when we do begin to redeploy again, those future conversions can go more, more smoothly. And then we’re still -- we’re going to defer any further deployments until we understand the timing of the merger a little bit better.
Vinnie Sinisi: Okay. Great. Very helpful. Thank you. And then just as a follow-up. Going back to the 11 facilities that were called out today, any further color that you guys can give in terms of perceived market share or the competitive stands in those areas? And then also just as a matter of process, I just want to make sure that I'm correct here. When dealing with the FTC, so those 11, the proposal of those 11 facilities you kind of have already gone to the first level of discussions. And now it’s in a sense being escalated to the five commissioners. I just want to make sure that that is correct.
Bill DeLaney: Yes. So let me be clear or try to be clear. We’ve had multiple discussions over multiple months with the FTC. And we are trying to the best of our ability to understand not just the nature of their concerns and the depth of their concerns and the breadth of their concerns, but also how we think we can remedy those concerns based upon our knowledge of this industry, based upon our knowledge of how to shift groceries to customers and our knowledge of competitive positioning. So this package is a package that we have developed that we believe addresses their concern. We have received no approval from the FTC at any level in this package.
Vinnie Sinisi: Okay. And then just, I guess maybe you can say so much at this point, but any further color on the specific markets where these 11 are located?
Chris Kreidler: No, we’re really not going to get into the talking about market share and the individual markets.
Vinnie Sinisi: Okay. Now totally understandable. All right. Great. Thanks very much. Good luck going forward.
Bill DeLaney: Thank you.
Chris Kreidler: Thank you.
Operator: We move on to Ajay Jain with Cantor Fitzgerald.
Ajay Jain: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess Bill, based on your prepared comments on the merger and the objections by the FTC staff. I'm just wondering if your announcement with Performance Food could really set the stage for litigation with the FTC. So if the process goes in that direction, do you think you can wrap up any potential litigation and complete the merger process? By the time the agreement is set to expire, I think that deadline is in September if I'm not mistaken. So do you feel like you're potentially running out of time to the extent that's an issue at all?
Bill DeLaney: So I want to make I am answering this right. We think we have ample time if we do end up in some litigation to work through that and still bring that to some type of closure before the expiration of the merger agreement.
Ajay Jain: And just finally on -- as a quick follow-up on the merger-related expenses, can you just quantify little bit better how much you expect that to moderate in the back half of the year?
Chris Kreidler: I would love to be able to have a forecast for merger-related expenses and certain of those line items. I can do that. I can say these consultants were, we don’t need them anymore and these consultants we still do. But a lot of just depends on what we’re doing in the fourth quarter -- in the third quarter and the fourth quarter of the year. So it is rather difficult to estimate those expenses on a go forward basis. So I mean to say they’re moderating, they’re certainly not going to go to zero. There is work that we are going to continue to do to prepare, but we’re certainly looking to stand down any teams that have completed their work. So that we can reduce those expenses and we look at that literally every month to decide how many consultants we need here supporting us. But it’s too hard to call frankly where we’re going to be in the process and what work needs to be done.
Ajay Jain: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Next question will come from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.
John Ivankoe: Hi. Great. Just really quickly from me at this point. The overall trend of inflation kind of going forward, calendar ’15 and if not calendar ’15 at least, back half of your fiscal ’15 and just in terms of, where you see it trending and from a gross profit per case perspective it was potentially kind of getting back into a place where passing out pricing can be easier to the customer in relation to a previous question? Thanks.
Chris Kreidler: I don’t think we are there yet, John. I do think we are beginning to see some subsiding in the trajectory of the inflationary rate. So, hopefully, we have peaked here at the 6%. It’s still early this quarter. The individual categories are moving around. Right now, the bulk of the inflations we see here today is more in the meat side and dairy beginning to level out. So we don’t make predictions or give guidance. But I -- you really asked two questions. I think the inflation overtime, over the next six, nine, 12 months, should subside to some degree. I don’t know where it ends up. But, hopefully, less than the 5% to 6%, because as we always said that’s not good for our customers and that’s why sometimes it’s a -- actually most of time, is how to pass those along as fast as you would like. So I think we are seeing a little early, but too early to call until get into March and April, and we kind of back into the heavier volume months.
John Ivankoe: Thank you.
Bill DeLaney: Welcome.
Operator: We will move on to Kelly Bania with BMO Capital.
Kelly Bania: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, just another one related to the merger. Just based on your discussions with FTC over the last year and what their concerns are? I am just curious how you would characterize what you perceive is the likelihood that the FTC will accept this proposal as a remedy. I mean, does this address all of their concerns in your point of view?
Bill DeLaney: I appreciate the question. I don’t think I am in a position to really address the likelihood. There maybe other people out there that can give you a better handle on that. I would just continue to say that we believe strongly in this merger. We believe it’s pro-competitive in what’s already and incredibly competitive industry. We believe it’s good for our customers. Clearly, there will be some disruption. So I am sure there has been some concerns convey to the FTC and to us from that standpoint. But that’s not unusual mergers. We spend a year and tens of millions of dollars preparing integration plan to mitigate as much disruption as possible and we think over the medium-term to longer term. This is very good for our customer base. This is going to be for our shareholders. We think it will actually raise the bar for competition in our industry, which long-term is good for everybody in our industry. So we believe strongly in our case and that’s probably all I can should and can comment on.
Kelly Bania: Okay. And then, just maybe another follow-up, how were these 11 DC selected, just give us some quick math, I think, you still have about 80 DCs and these look even like they are either larger or more highly productive than the average? Just any comments there would be helpful.
Bill DeLaney: Yeah. I am going to start and Chris can give you probably little more, essentially, I think, you can see as if you put together all the color we are trying to provide today. We try to put together footprint that would address, the Western part of United States in a way that we complement the current footprint FTC has, which is across the country, but it’s a little less dense in the West compared to U.S. So what you are seeing there primarily is an attempt both with large and medium sized facilities to address that.
Kelly Bania: Okay. Thank you very much.
Chris Kreidler: Thank you.
Bill DeLaney: Welcome.
Operator: We will move on to Mark Wiltamuth with Jefferies.
Mark Wiltamuth: Hi. Good morning. So, one of the challenges on the divestitures, is there anyway to guarantee that the customers really follow the facility divestitures? And I wonder if there is anyway you could give us from a big picture standpoint, what the market share on the national accounts look like before and after the divestiture?
Bill DeLaney: Well, there is no way to guarantee. But, again, we have done a lot of work on the integration planning and working through this TSA agreement with PFG to address that and Chris has been leading that work. So I’ll let him take that.
Chris Kreidler: Yeah. I mean, one other things, as I said in our integration planning, one of our primary principals was the least amount of disruption to our customers, US Foods customer. We took the same approach in our discussions with PFG and obviously, they care a lot about that as well and so we’ve structured it in a way that we believe it’s going to be least disruptive to those customers. So if you think about our customer that’s being serviced out of the call it Denver facility for US Foods today, that same sales person or the same trucks, food coming out of that same facility is going to go to that customer ones it is owned by PFG. So we believe that’s the least amount of disruption to the customer and as long as they continue to get good service at fair prices and value, we don’t believe there is a reason for them to want a change. So I’m agree with Bill, there is no guarantee, but I believe we except this stuff in a way that’s the customers will continue to get good service and good value going forward.
Mark Wiltamuth: Are there long-term contracts that transfer and is there a non-compete agreement or anything like that on going after this customers?
Chris Kreidler: Yeah. There is a lot of things that will be contained in the 8-K, which we will file later this week. So I’d encourage you to look into that. There is an enough in there, I think, keep you busy for awhile. But as you might imagine we intend to and FTC, of course, would want us to set PFG up for success here and again, and do it in a way that our customers don’t feel or experience that disruption. So everything that’s necessary to make that happen we put into the TSA or the agreement.
Bill DeLaney: I think just to illustrate that for maybe -- from a layman standpoint. What Chris and Russell and our teams have done is basically, as you look at, don’t just look at this facilities, from a customers perspective, they are going to be position at the same sales persons, same driver, the same customer service team in this TSA agreement, which you can look at, once we get it out in the K -- 8-K. We have taken a lot of measures to position PFG to be successful as they transition that business. So we have done a lot of things to position them for success early days here.
Mark Wiltamuth: Okay. And I know you’ve address this, the $600 million synergy number, but you stand back and look at the deal from a broad perspective, US Foods have lost earnings power, while it’s been waiting for the transaction to close. If you look at where they are today, add in the synergies, where do you think you will be on EPS accretion by year four or five?
Bill DeLaney: We have not given and I’m probably not going to today give any kind of forecast for earnings accretion. We obviously have re-looked at the transaction based upon everything that’s happened over the year and based upon this divestiture package and we still feel this is a very nice return for Sysco and our shareholders. We have got to, obviously, get the deal close and then we have got to work on executing against the synergies and we now also and will be a little more, add a little more complexity, we also need to work on the divestiture package and make sure that that set up alright. As long as we continue to service the customers ours and US Foods, we get a very nice return out of the transaction and that’s where we are focused on.
Mark Wiltamuth: Okay. Thank you very much.
Chris Kreidler: Thank you.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, we have no further questions. At this time that does conclude today’s conference. We do thank you for your participation. Have a good day.

Operator: Good morning everyone and welcome to the Sysco Reports First Quarter Fiscal 2015 Conference Call. As a reminder, today’s call is being recorded. We will begin today’s call with opening remarks and introductions. I would like to turn the conference over to Shannon Mutschler, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma’am.
Shannon Mutschler: Good morning everyone and welcome to Sysco’s first quarter fiscal 2015 earnings call. Today you’ll hear prepared remarks from Bill DeLaney, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Chris Kreidler, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin please note that statements made during this presentation that state the company’s or management’s intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and actual results could differ materially.

To ensure that we have sufficient time to answer all questions today we’d like to ask each participant to limit their time today to one question and one follow-up. At this time I’d like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer Bill DeLaney.
Bill DeLaney: Thank you, Shannon. Hello everyone and thank you for joining us today. This morning, Sysco reported first quarter fiscal 2015 financial results. Sales grew more than 6% to $12.4 billion and adjusted net earnings increased 7.6% to $309 million. Adjusted EPS, excluding certain items, increased approximately 6% to $0.52 for the quarter, our strongest year-over-year growth in quite sometime. We are pleased with the solid operating performance we delivered in our first fiscal quarter in the midst of ongoing challenging market conditions.  While we were challenged with expense management in certain aspects of our business, we generated more than 2% case volume growth and managed acute inflationary pressures very effectively, as evidenced by essentially flat year-over-year gross margin.  Our improved performance during the quarter was due in part to the benefits we realized from our portfolio of business transformation initiatives, especially category management. In addition, case growth trends in our locally managed business were favorable for the second consecutive quarter.  Recent restaurant data reflects ongoing stagnant traffic trends but somewhat improved industry sales trends as food-service establishments increase prices to offset high inflation in meat, dairy and seafood categories. However while we believe that industry trends have gradually improved, that improvement has been more pronounced in certain geographic regions. In addition, while consumer confidence and employment metrics have strengthened somewhat, overall consumer spending remains restrained.  Lastly we’re hopeful that the recent marked declines in fuel prices will help to drive additional traffic to our customers. With that, we remained intently focused on enhancing every aspect of our business so that we were able to better support our customers, operate more efficiently and compete more effectively. As I mentioned, benefits from our category management initiatives continued to gain momentum. We expect that all remaining categories we’ll launch into the market by the end of this fiscal year and that we will achieve our financial savings target.  Turning to an update on our technology initiatives, during the quarter we successfully executed a major software upgrade for the 12 operating companies using SAP. In addition, while we will talk more about the proposed merger in a moment, we continue our merger integration planning and sequencing work with regard to technology. We expect initial post-merger areas of focus will include the rollout of SAP financial modules for general ledger, accounts payable and accounts receivable as well as additional elements of the HR module, all of which will make future SAP conversions at the operating companies relatively easier.  While we're pleased with our accomplishments during the quarter, we did fall short of our expense management goals. Expense increases were broad-based and were primarily driven by increases in sales, delivery and incentive accruals.  On the sales side, we’ve begun to hire MAs in targeted markets and expect these investments to contribute to sales growth over time. In the delivery area, driver turnover and shortages continue to drive higher wages and overtime expense. However our single largest opportunity for improvement was a more consistent execution across the organization. We are developing and implementing tools that will provide increased visibility to keep performance metrics as well as improved best business practices. We believe these enhancements combined with our new functional structure will lead to improved customer service, greater operational efficiency, enhanced cost management and increased profitability.  As we noted on last quarter's earnings call, we also are investing in some promising new sales programs and market-driven initiatives. We have developed several initiatives targeted at improving our customers’ experience. For example, our initiative to grow our share in the underpenetrated Manhattan market has been very successful. In addition, we’ve developed a robust approach to serving the fast-growing Hispanic restaurant segment focused on providing authentic products utilizing a dedicated sales team. Also, our commitment to solicit and listen to feedback from our customers carried out under our customer first program has led to several important enhancements, including developing new technology that will ultimately allow our customer to track their delivery and enhanced customer onboarding program aimed at increasing customer retention and improved sharing of best practices in our business review program.  With regard to our proposed merger with US Foods, we've been in productive discussions with FTC staff on a solution to permit the FTC to conclude its review. Given the amount of work remaining and considering the upcoming holidays we do not currently expect to complete the transaction before the first quarter of 2015.  Our integration planning work is progressing well and we successfully completed a $5 billion debt offering just following the end of the quarter as we prepared to fund the nonequity components of the transaction. Chris will provide more detail about this in a few moments.  In closing, we are pleased with our topline and gross profit performance for the quarter and believe that our investment in business transformation initiatives contributed to this achievement. I would like to thank our 52,000 associates for their dedication and hard work that drove our favorable first quarter results. As we move forward into the remainder of our fiscal year, we're committed to improving the consistency of our operational execution, successfully rolling out our portfolio of initiatives and further developing our plans to integrate Sysco and US Foods. This truly is an exciting time in our history and we believe the actions we are taking are strategically the right priorities to both achieve our vision and enhance profitability over the long-term.  Now I will turn things over to Chris so he can provide additional details on our financial results for the quarter.
Chris Kreidler: Thanks, Bill and good morning everyone. For the first quarter, sales were $12.4 billion or an increase of 6.2% compared to the prior year.  Food cost inflation was 4.9% driven mainly by inflation in the meat, dairy and seafood categories. Sales from acquisitions increased sales by 0.6%. However this was largely offset by the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates which decreased sales by 0.5%.  Case volume grew 2.3% during the quarter, including acquisitions and approximately 2.2%, excluding acquisition. Gross profit in the first quarter increased 6%, nearly at the same rate as sales growth. Gross margin declined 4 basis points to 17.59%, reflecting the positive impact from our category management initiative and improved margin trends over the last few quarters.  Operating expenses increased $136 million or 8.6% in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 compared to the prior year period. Operating expenses increased mainly due to a $67 million increase in payroll expense and a $41 million increase in certain item expenses. The most significant drivers in the increase in payroll expense were higher sales and delivery costs as well as incentive accruals.  Regarding the incentive accruals, during the last year's first quarter we reduced certain incentive accruals based on our performance at that time. In this year’s first quarter, our incentives are generally accrued to higher amounts, reflecting the impact of recent performance and causing a year-over-year variance.  Certain items totaled $43 million during the quarter and mainly related to the merger and integration expenses. The substantial majority of these costs related to consulting fees. Excluding certain items, operating expenses increased 6%.  As Bill mentioned, we believe we had opportunities to better manage our operating expenses over the balance of the year. However the cost increases in the first quarter will pressure our ability to meet our goal of achieving flat cost per case for the year.  Operating income for the quarter was down 2.6% year-over-year. After adjusting for certain items, operating income increased 5.9%. Net earnings for the quarter were $279 million, a decrease of $7 million or 2.4% compared to the prior year.  * Diluted EPS was $0.47, a 2.1% decrease compared to the prior year. Adjusting for certain items, net earnings increased 7.6% to $309 million and diluted EPS increased 6.1% to $0.52.  Capital expenditures, net of proceeds from sales of assets, totaled $190 million for the first quarter this year compared to $125 million last year. Cash flow from operations was $63 million for the quarter as the first quarter is typically a lighter cash flow quarter for us due to seasonal changes in our business. This result was $107 million lower than last year's first quarter which is the result of three major drivers.  First, the cash impact of certain items increased $40 million year-over-year. Second, we made a $50 million pension contribution in the first quarter this year compared to none in the prior year period. This difference is simply driven by different timing regarding when we make cash contribution each year. And lastly, working capital usage increased year-over-year mainly due to an increase in sales and inventory driven in large part by inflation. As a result of these year-over-year changes, free cash flow was negative $55 million for the first quarter.  Turning to the pending US Foods merger, subsequent to the end of the quarter, we issued $5 billion in debt and six series over various periods from 3 to 30 years with an average weighted coupon rate of 3.4%. We decided to go to market prior to closing the transaction in order to be ready to fund the transaction as soon as we were able to do so. The proceeds of the offering are intended to fund the various elements of the US Foods transaction.  In addition, as we closed on the new debt issuance, we simultaneously terminated both the bridge facility and the pre-issuance hedges. As a reminder, after we announced the proposed merger we put in place a $2 billion interest rate hedge as part of our risk management strategy against the portion of the anticipated bond issuance.  Following the unwinding of the hedges we paid $59 million in September 2014 to settle the hedge against our 10-year note issuance which you will note is shown as a financing activity in our cash flow statement in the first fiscal quarter.  In addition, we paid $130 million in early October to settle the hedge against our 30 year debt issuance, which will be shown as a financing activity in our cash flow statement in the second fiscal quarter. The financial impact of the unwind of the hedges will be amortized into earnings over 10 years and 30 years respectively.  Regarding our outlook into the second quarter and the remainder of the year, there are several items I’d like to point out. First, with regard to our category management initiative over the balance of the year, we expect the year-over-year impact of these benefits in each of the first three quarters of the fiscal year to be relatively similar before moderating in the fourth quarter.  Second, as we disclosed on last quarter's call, we continue to expect that corporate expenses will increase compared to the prior fiscal year. Due to the timing of these expenses quarter to quarter we expect a more significant year-over-year impact in the second quarter.  Third, we will recognize a $13 million write-off in the second quarter of unamortized debt costs related to the termination of the bridge facility which occurred as we issued the new debt related to the transaction. This write-off will be recorded in interest expense and will be treated as a certain item when we report our results next quarter.  Fourth, as a result of the issuance of the new debt and the unwind of the pre-issuance hedges, we will recognize approximately $14 million in additional interest expense per month beginning in the second quarter. This expense will also be treated as a certain item when we report our results until the merger closes.  And finally, last year in the second quarter, our tax rate was unusually low mainly due to the favorable resolution of certain matters. This will create a year-over-year timing difference from a tax rate perspective in the second quarter.  In closing, while the business environment in the food-service industry remains challenging, we were encouraged by the progress we've made implementing our business transformation initiatives and believe we’ve many opportunities ahead to continue to enhance our customers’ experience, strengthening our operating performance and increase profitability.  With that operator, we will now take questions. 
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) And we will take our first question from Kelly Bania with BMO Capital.
Kelly Bania - BMO Capital Markets : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just first, on the payroll increase, I'm wondering if you could just go into a little bit more details in terms of the different buckets of the $67 million increase between the sales, the delivery expense, and the incentive accruals? And what sort of year-over-year increase in payroll was that overall for the first quarter? You mentioned it would be kind of difficult to achieve that flat cost per case for the year, so how should we think about payroll for the next couple of quarters? 
Bill DeLaney: I will start Kelly and let Chris kind of help me out here little bit. I would say just on the overall expenses – before I answer the question I guess is your expenses as adjusted are up about 6% and in payroll labor and related is usually 70 - generally 70%, 75% of our structure. So I don't have the exact number in terms of payroll. I don’t know that we disclosed that but I think that should be a pretty good proxy for you looking at there. It comes in different buckets as we took you through on the sales side. For example, and we have begun to grow our MA workforce again modestly, we’re more in certain markets. So we made some significant reductions in territories – unprofitable territories 18 to 24 months ago. So we’ve worked our way through that. We’ve grown our territories.  We had a very nice quarter. We grew our gross profit quite a bit. We grew our locally managed business. The way our commission grids and our bonus grids work, that does translate to a more earnings for our salespeople and for our management team. So that’s probably what you see there. I think the other biggest bucket was in delivery -- especially in certain markets we’re struggling to attract people. It’s a great markets if you’re a driver these days and to retain drivers in certain markets as well. So I’d say most of the payroll impact was in those two areas. 
Chris Kreidler: I don't have a lot to add – just my comments about the incentive accruals are simply that the last year we lowered a longer-term incentive accrual based upon where we are versus those targets in that particular incentive and that this year we are at target. So you’ve got the year over lapping effect there. So that was a portion of it as well. 
Kelly Bania - BMO Capital Markets : Great, that's very helpful. And then I was wondering if I could just follow-up with one kind of bigger picture question. Could you talk about just the trends you're seeing maybe with respect to categories and the types of foods that are seeing strongest growth? The reason I ask is I guess we heard from McDonald's, maybe a week or two ago, that they were thinking about possibly pursuing some organics. I'm just curious with what you're seeing in trends in natural and organics and if your customer base were to increase focus on those types of products, where do you think you and your suppliers stand in terms of being able to cater to that? 
Bill DeLaney: I think we have seen those trends for quite sometime whether it’s organic or local or sustainable, different people look at different ways. So local is probably the bigger trend that I think we tend to see given that we do have some of the locally managed customers who are cozing that type of thing. And so I would say it's the trend that’s growing. I wouldn't describe it as an overly large piece of our business today but I think it's an increasingly important for two reasons. One, it is growing and I think we want to be ahead of that, or at least step with that. And I think two, with the customers where those types of products are important -- even though it might be a relatively small piece of their buy, they feel very strongly about that. So whether it's organic or local or other similar types of items or categories, that being able to supply those types of products is key to continue to develop the relationship with those types of customers.  And I think our suppliers are getting there. It’s – I think as we work through category management, especially the second round once we've been through these initial launches, I think this type of a discussion will be even more bigger part of the discussion as we go forward. So certainly suppliers are very proactive in this space and others we work with together to further our offerings as we go forward. So I think it's a trend that’s been there, it’s growing. The people that want local and organic are very very steadfast in those desires and it’s an important part of those customer relationships. 
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Andrew Wolf with BB&T Capital Markets.
Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets: On the sequential improvement in the MA-served sales growth, could you help us think about where that's coming from? It sounds like, obviously, there's an inflation help and I guess there's more salespeople. Could you give us a little more color on how or what's driving that internally or externally, maybe it's the environment? 
Bill DeLaney: I think it is – I honestly don’t think the environment has changed that much. We went through kind of this weather cycle last year where it was really rough, December through February, and so that certainly impacted everyone. And then cabin effect in April and May where sales came back pretty strongly. We’ve lapped a lot of that now. So I think the market is kind of where it’s been. I think it's almost month-to-month, you see one report – one month where consumer confidence is up, or the restaurant operators’ confidence is up, the next month it’s down a little bit. So I don’t think there is any a distinct change in the pattern there.  I think from our perspective we’re a year or two years now into these initiatives, both in terms of the category management but also some of the segmenting work we've been doing with our sales and marketing teams and we have a program called back to basics that we are out there with – and it allows us to both focus more in certain segments and at the same time use that as an opportunity to enhance training with our sales force. So we’ve seen some positive trends there. As I noted in my comments some of this is more geographic specific. And so I think at least from what we see certainly the South in particular where we are here in Southwest has been strong for a while now. And so in the West, it looks like we’re seeing some improved results there and I don’t know how much that as a macro. We had a foldout out in Southern California last year, we’re through that and we’re starting to see the rewards from that investment that we made at Riverside last year.  And I would say the last thing I guess from my perspective is just the stability of where we are in our initiatives. We’ve been – we’re two plus years into all these initiatives, that first year, year and a half it was very significant impact on our sales force. As I said earlier we reduced a lot of unprofitable territories, that has an impact. It took us a while to kind of hit our stride in category management. So as we’ve matured in rolling out these initiatives I think it's become more business as usual and we’re just executing better. So I think little bit maybe on the macro, little uneven, little geographic there and I just think that a lot of this change that we’re driving out we’re getting better at it and more stability within the sales force. 
Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets: Can you just as a follow-up before I get back in queue, could you annualize what the growth in the MA looks like, even if it's not maybe contributing a lot like right now? 
Bill DeLaney: Andy, I don’t know if that’s something we've done before. I’d just tell you that we are growing in a number of MAs and it is modest. I think let me comment at this way. The way we are evolving, I think in terms of our thoughts on MAs and salespeople and territories in particular is to grow those territories at a level that we anticipate opportunities for sales growth and to try to stay ahead of that. So some markets might be mid-single digits, and other markets, might be flat to low single digits. 
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim. 
John Heinbockel – Guggenheim Securities: So Bill, on gross margin, where do you guys sit now with price investments? Are we at a point, even when the category management benefit subsides, are we finally at a point where gross margin can be managed flat year-over-year and [indiscernible] the downward pressure that you've had in the past? 
Bill DeLaney: The honest short answer is I don't know, certainly that’s our goal and the way we have spoken to it is we expect because of -- the ongoing nature of the market that we’re in, it’s a large market that's the good news, it’s low barriers to entry, there’s a lot of people in it. And there is not a lot of growth there right now. So I think we’re continuing to see a lot of pressure on the street and what you hear us saying, what you hear d me saying in particular for example on the caveman is that those initiatives are beginning to bear fruit and helping us to offset some of the pricing pressures that you're alluding to. And I think when you look at our quarter obviously we had a lot of inflation in certain categories and I think we did a decent job of passing that along in an appropriate way. But I would say most of the margin positives in the quarter were from taking cost out of our cost of goods and in ensuring those savings with our customers.
John Heinbockel – Guggenheim Securities: Do you think -- is that level of price competition, has that been exacerbated right by the whole merger situation in that people may see some business up for grabs while you guys are in limbo or no? 
Bill DeLaney: I think in certain markets I would say that that's probably had more of an impact on US Foods than it has on us. I think they are in a tougher situation there to deal with that. So yeah, there’s definitely, I am sure, some competitors trying to take advantage of that. But I think it's also -- I think early months or weeks that was a bigger deal, I think that’s levelled out to some extent. I don't think it’s been an impact in our people. We’ve kept our people very focused and it’s not to say there is not incidence of that, I am not saying that but in general on a base of whatever 12 billion in sales for the quarter I don't think that was the big part of it. At least not for us.
John Heinbockel – Guggenheim Securities: And then just lastly, back on the growth in MAs, was a lot of that, did that pre-date or the plan for that pre-date US Foods and is most of that in non-overlapping markets or it's both? 
Bill DeLaney: It has nothing to do with US Foods. I mean it was basically in our profit plan for the year. Look, I have spoken to some previous calls, we took approximately thousand unprofitable territories out of our business over what we thought was going to be a 12 month period, it happened in 3 to 6 so that was pretty significant impact and most of our operating companies and markets did a nice job managing that. In certain instances, we didn't do so good job and we went too fast and that had some doubling down negative impact. So that's really us -- a management team whatever 6, 12 months ago saying okay, we’ve done that now, let’s get back to what we normally do which is growing territories in conjunction with what we think the opportunities are. So I wouldn’t try to connect that to US Foods at all.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse.
Lauren Wood - Credit Suisse: It's Lauren Wood on for Ed. Just another question on gross profit. So it looks like the spread between gross profit growth and volume growth improved again this quarter. Can you maybe talk about how much of that could be attributed to internal initiatives like category management, how much of that could be attributed to inflation, and how sustainable do you think this is going forward? 
Bill DeLaney: Well, okay, I think when you look at the growth in gross profit dollars, we've acknowledged that there is a lot of inflation in that and so that is part of the – that 6% growth we’re talking about in sales and GP dollars inflation, piece of that. However inflation also makes it more difficult to keep that spread relatively close. So that’s where I was saying I felt even though the market continues to be very competitive that we did a nice job there and that takes you to the initiatives of which we think category management in particular has now kicked in, in a meaningful way, allowing us to manage our cost of goods more effectively and also to invest in our customers along the way. So I think it's mostly the initiatives as well as the fact that we’ve got 7000 salespeople out there, 70 operating companies and senior management teams and they’re all very focused on executing as well as they can. So I think with at least us growing into a company that’s going to continue to embrace change and have initiatives, I think our people are coming to grips with that, we’re getting better at executing change in the business at the same time. But I think the initiatives themselves as I said earlier are contributing to that. And I think on the inflation front, we just did a nice job there of keeping that spread as close as we did.
Lauren Wood - Credit Suisse: Okay, and just as a follow-up, can you give us any more color on maybe what categories you've addressed more recently and how that process is going? 
Bill DeLaney: Well I tell you, we’re into waves 6, 7, 8 – we’re well into it now. So I don't have all the categories in front of me. I know I think we have done some poultry categories and I know bread and rolls were big one but we’re now into categories where there is double-digit subcategories f you will. So we’re into the core of the entire offering right now.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Karen Short with Deutsche Bank.
Karen Short – Deutsche Bank: Hi. Just a couple of questions on the integration costs. So you're now kind of at $130 million cumulatively and I guess the first question is, are we now kind of at the point where this is about as far as you can go without actually merging? And then the second question was is this included in the original $700 million to $800 million in guidance that you gave on integration expenses or is that in addition to? 
Chris Kreidler: Hi Karen, let me start with the second part of the question. We certainly included in our original guidance 700 million, $800 million some assumption for pre-closing merger integrated expenses. I think it’s fair to say we had exceeded that assumption. We will come out with a new number of what we think the overall costs are going to be. We will share that as well, as what we’ve spent which we’ve been disclosing on a month by month basis. But obviously we’ve spent more than we originally planned.  The first part of your question -- there is continual work that we can do. There's only a certain amount of information we can share between the two companies prior to actually closing the transaction. And so we do as much as we can kind of business stream by business stream and then we do some work in clean rooms but there is some work that we can’t even do outside our clean room or inside of clean room I should say until we actually close. So there’s more work to be done. I think it’s fair to say at this point we’ve done a lot of good work. Teams have put in a tremendous amount of effort. We’ve got a very clear idea about how we would merge the two companies together and the more time we have the more butt left would say our integration execution will be once we’re able to start that process. So there's still more work to be done perhaps not at the same level and same intensity as we’ve been doing it over the last 10 months. 
Karen Short – Deutsche Bank: Okay, that's helpful. And then I guess just to follow on that, I guess within the bucket of this $130 million, can you maybe give a sense of what the dollar amount that would be Sysco employees that have fully dedicated to the integration planning versus the actual just pure consulting fees? 
Chris Kreidler: Yes, the vast majority of it is consulting fees, Karen.
Karen Short – Deutsche Bank: And then just last question was on the update of the business transformation to other OpCo's this coming year, any idea what the plans are? 
Chris Kreidler: Yeah, I'll start here, Bill may want to chime in. As we said in prior last couple of calls, we just did a major upgrade at the SAP software itself which went well and now we’re focused on doing what we will call some functional rollout of SAP. So Bill mentioned in his opening remarks accounts payable, accounts receivable, we will do some I think additional rollout of some HR functionality etc. and that has a double advantage. One, it helps our shared services. That secondly, it also helps us as we begin to do merger integration, once we’re allowed to do that, it helps us achieve synergies faster. So that’s the focus that we have for our SAP rollout now.  Those types of things, once we do them actually make rollouts in the operating companies easier because we’re converting – we’re transitioning less at these operating companies when we actually go back to rolling out at operating companies. And as we go through this process we are obviously looking at the overall integration plan from a technology perspective of how we will roll out operating companies in the merged enterprise. 
Bill DeLaney: I think the only thing I would add there is – in the broader way of looking at business transformation we’ve talked about category management. This is going to be a good year to continue to launch the rest of the categories this year. We’re pretty much through the SG&A work and so you’re not seeing a lot of new benefits coming from that, that was the work that I alluded to earlier that we did the first year and year and a half. There is a lot of work still going on on the operations side, supply chain side of business in terms of optimizing our efficiencies, our processes or our pay plans in the warehouse and delivery and we’re really not seeing those benefits to the degree that we will down the road.  So again in the broader way of looking at business transformation there’s still a lot going on, that our operating companies are dealing with right now.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Meredith Adler with Barclays. 
Meredith Adler – Barclays Capital: I wanted to talk a little bit more about category management. I think you've spoken in the past that it wasn't just a simple SKU rationalization process, but it's clearly having a very nice benefit on the gross margin. Can you talk a little bit about exactly what's happening and how that's leading to the gross margin improvement? 
Bill DeLaney: Sure. I think the key, Meredith from our perspective is we have a very robust process that we’ve developed. We have brought a lot of people into the organization at all different levels who have done category management for and other industries. And so we’ve learned from some of our other stumbles if you will, with initiatives that we needed to not just develop the folks we have of which we've done, but also bring in some other folks that have the experience. I think we’ve had really strong leadership with Tom Bene and Bill Day and Bill’s group. So I think it starts there and we feel good about that.  The nature of the process is sitting down with these suppliers and trying to create some level of partnership as we go forward, obviously it’s not going to be the same with every supplier and the focus on the customer and focus on the opportunity for growth. And as you do that at least two things become quite apparent is by using some of the intelligence that our suppliers have, all the time developing more insights ourselves through our customer work and marketing, we’re able to see where most of our customers want to spend their money in terms of what items, what categories and we’re able to also focus -- necessarily focused on where we have a lot of redundancy in SKUs and items that don’t move a lot. And then as we work closer together with the suppliers and we start to see success which is the key, we’re able to see that working together here we can create savings for the customers and for our supplier and for ourselves and that creates this efficiencies that you’re starting to see on the cost of goods side. So it clearly starts with technology and this is a big change in our company, strengthening our team, it’s coming at this from a customer perspective and ultimately getting the right suppliers to partner up with us in a way that it’s a win-win, win, it’s got to work for the customer, it needs to work for us and obviously it’s got to work for supplier.
Meredith Adler – Barclays Capital: And how do you deal with pushback from a customer who says, oh, I'm madly in love with my particular vendor, don't do anything? Do you just keep that item around or are there financial incentives for them to shift vendors? 
Bill DeLaney: Well I think we’ve gotten better at that, and I think it comes with understanding our customers and listening to them and getting them to actually have that conversation with us. And so from that standpoint I think we’ve made good strides. It’s all the above. I think for the most part you have the conversation, you understand what the x says, as best as you can, and you make it more about choices and/or timeline. So in certain cases depending on the customer and how key an item is, you may not convert them. But in most instances, there is an opportunity to convert them, certainly you will need to share some of the economics with them as well and you will need to – again I think it’s where we’ve gotten better -- you need to have a timeline that works for the customer. And again we’re not looking to – and we’d be nice to do all these and 90 to 180 days but if it takes six months to a year to do it the right way, that's what we’re doing.  So again it just comes down to listening to that customer and getting them -- really trying to understand what -- why they have that angst and maybe what you say, maybe as simple as some type of economic play, but it very well could be they are happy to make the changes we just need to sell on it, and that takes some time to get them to understand the attributes of the alternative product.
Meredith Adler – Barclays Capital: Okay. And then I have a question for Chris. You did mention that cost per case this year might not be down the way you'd hoped it would be or it might not be flat as you'd hoped it would be. Is it the things you talked about in the first quarter, specifically transportation, but MAs and incentive comp that are the reason you don't think you'll make the cost per case goal or is there something else that you're thinking about? 
Chris Kreidler: Yeah, it’s more than that but it’s something we didn’t talk about – I think Bill’s prepared comments I think he described that as pretty broad-based and so we had some increases almost across the board in different areas, some of which we expected, certain pension related costs and things like that, and some of which we didn’t, so delivery expenses continue to be upbeat and they were up pretty significantly last year. We talked about the sales compensation expense, things like that. So as we look here at the end of Q1 what we’re really calling out is our cost per case is up significantly. We had a flat goal for the year. We have a lot of areas to go after and we will go after those but we’re pointing out that there’s going to be some pressure on us achieving that goal.  In no way are we going to give up on the goal but we are calling out the fact that it’s going to be harder because we are starting if you will on the trench, we’ve got to dig our way out it.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Mark Wiltamuth with Jefferies.
Mark Wiltamuth – Jefferies: Hi, thank you. Could you talk a little more about -- you said that certain geographies were performing better than others. Is that a function of what's going on with the consumer health in those markets or is it more Sysco initiatives that are driving that? 
Bill DeLaney: Well I would say what we are extrapolating – at least what I'm extrapolating is when we see some deltas that are somewhat pronounced, you would have to -- one would conclude that some of that is coming from the relative health of the local or regional economy. so when I talk about the Southwest, I think the economy that has been strong dynamic for long time now, we’ve got some very large operating companies in southwest that have been performing very well for multiple years as well. So it's a combination but certainly when you look at the South and the West compared to what we see up in the North and the Northeast to some extent, there are differences. So we’ve got strong people throughout the country and leaders and associates and I think the initiatives are being developed and implemented pretty evenly throughout the country. So I think on the margin it’s more of the economy as well as the execution.  The good news is we’re having success in all of our markets right now. I was just trying to bring some color to everything that you read and we tend to - questions we tend to get on these calls as – is it as competitive – is it more competitive and we think it's just as competitive as it’s been quite some time. We just happen to believe that there is two or three markets that are a little bit more favorable I guess in terms of underlying economics and consumer outlook. 
Mark Wiltamuth – Jefferies: Lastly, in talking about the US Foods merger and the FTC review, you did use the word solution, which implies you're working on addressing a concern. If there's any other color you can give us there or are you considering divestitures or was that always part of the plan? 
Bill DeLaney: Well I think you have to go back to where we were. So I would just say this – we are at a point now where we’re certainly talking to the right people. We’re having the right conversations and it's taking longer than what we originally projected. With that said we really had never been through anything like this before. So it's really hard to get to toward – too concerned about that aspect of it. I will go back to the comments I made when we announced the deal back in December 9. We think the strategic value of this opportunity is significant. We think it's very pro-competitive. We think it’s going to be very good for our customers over time. We certainly think there is complexity to it and we need to get a good return on it. And as we said on previous called since then we have shared a lot of information with the FTC, we've had a lot of meetings with the FTC and I think they are up to speed now in this industry, it’s taken some sometime, it's an industry where as you know there's not a lot of other public players, really other than us currently, so it’s just taking more time and we thought to I think give the information to the FTC, get it digested and begin to having these conversations.  So bottom line, we’re looking for a successful outlook. We are looking for a solution .We just think at this point it’s going to take longer than we originally projected. 
Operator: And we will take our next question from Ajay Jain with Cantor Fitzgerald.
Ajay Jain – Cantor Fitzgerald: I had a variation of some of the questions asked earlier on how you're managing your gross margin so well with this level of inflation. I think if your cost of goods is going up and you're passing along the higher food costs, the gross margin percentage should still decrease, even with higher gross profit dollars, at least that's the way the math is supposed to work. So can you comment if you're getting any unusual support from the vendor community that's helping you out? Is there anything else that might be driving the gross margin trends, such as incremental vendor support, that's on top of the cost savings initiatives that you talked about earlier? 
Chris Kreidler: Yeah, Ajay, I think as we discussed on the last two or three calls I would agree with your first point that when you have significant inflation especially in the categories we called out here, you’re looking at double-digit inflation for at least the last couple quarters, meat, seafood and dairy. You generally cannot pass that along as fast as you’d like and frankly in many instances it's not even appropriate to do that. So I will go back to something we’ve been doing for years and we work with our customers, we work with them on their menus, we look at alternative products that would make their offerings in their item selection and their menus more attractive. And we do that through our product specialists or company chefs and obviously through our marketing associates and our counter executives. So we do all those things.  So it is harder to pass it along and that's why I was referring to earlier I think it remains very competitive from a pricing standpoint on the street. There's nothing special going on with vendor support. What I was speaking to a couple other times, is when we say that we believe the category management is beginning to deliver the results that we projected for it, that does play out on the cost of goods side. When you are able to form some strategic partners with your suppliers and as you get deeper into the category launches and you begin to execute those throughout the enterprise, it takes months to really cycle through all that but that does translate into savings and that I think that's what you're seeing is where we are buying better but nothing other than the fact that the process for category management is beginning to mature.
Ajay Jain – Cantor Fitzgerald: Okay, thank you. And I don't expect you to respond further to potential FTC issues, but I wanted to see if you can comment on one practical aspect of any divestitures you might need to make. So specifically, for some of the national accounts that are currently handled by Sysco or US Foods, if there is a change of control on some Broadline facilities that you might need to divest, how would you deal with the issue of those national accounts and who's going to supply them under a change of control for any regional Broadline facilities? 
Bill DeLaney: As you say we’re not going to comment on that. It’s all part of it. That discussion, Ajay, is all part of the process.
Ajay Jain – Cantor Fitzgerald: Okay, thanks. If I could just ask one final question, you talked about higher corporate and payroll expenses, but can you comment on the level of integration and planning costs we should assume going forward? Does that spending moderate or could it potentially be higher over the balance of the year, based on how you're allocating those costs? – 
Chris Kreidler: Good question. What I said earlier was I don't know that we will be running at the same intensity that we we've done over the last 10 months. I'm not going to sit here and expect them to moderate or diminish significantly but I think we’re probably seeing a peak and we’re probably going to be flat to moderately down. I'm saying that without actually having a forecast in front of me but I don't anticipate any new significant expenditures in the way of merger integration expenses other than some of the ones we called out in terms of interest expense and things like that which will continue to account to the certain item until we close. 
Operator: And we will take our next question from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.
John Ivankoe – JPMorgan: I have two questions please. First you mentioned in your prepared remarks turnover and shortages related to your delivery drivers I assume. Is that fixable with compensation, is there anything else to kind of understand why you are seeing a pickup in turnover there? In other words, is it something that you can reverse or has the market for these individuals gotten that much more competitive? 
Bill DeLaney: John, Bill, I think it's fixable in most markets. I think there’s things that as we brought in some of our talent acquisition to work in the more central locations it’s taken us some time as an organization to adjust just to see how that works between the OpCo and the shared services groups. So we've had some challenges out there and we have addressed those. I would expect from that standpoint things will get better.  With that said, there's a handful of markets just because of the underlying economy and in particular drilling where it’s very difficult to compete for drivers – nationally there is a shortage of drivers. So I think it’s all manageable, it’s just harder to manage today than what it’s ben and I would expect that you'll see an improvement there over the 6 to 12 months.
John Ivankoe – JPMorgan: And secondly, just a question on the restaurant industry. We did see – I am really talking about the casual dining data but I think this is true for QSR in general as well -- a pickup in August, September, even into October especially relative to July and July being I think the highest volume month in the quarter which was actually the lowest month in the quarter on a year-on-year basis. Is that kind of what you're seeing in the broader data as well like in other words July was the low point in the quarter and that’s since picked up or could you comment a little bit more in the industry? 
Bill DeLaney: I actually don't know that I've seen that. My sense at least from for example, some of the feedback we get in surveys from operators is that July and August were stronger and September they weren't as you said about what was going on in the business and maybe their outlook. It's still good. The metrics we're looking at, people are still reasonably optimistic of the operators going forward but my sense is actually it was stronger earlier in the summer than in September. 
Operator: And we will take our next question from Vincent Sinisi with Morgan Stanley.
Andrew Rubin – Morgan Stanley: Hi, this is Andrew Rubin on for Vinnie. You just touched upon it a bit, but I was wondering if you could talk about your sales cadence for the quarter, if there were any trends in that? In terms of, with the hiring increases, if that started to flow through on the sales side or generally, the timing until you see that start to flow through? 
Bill DeLaney: I am sorry, the part of the question?
Andrew Rubin – Morgan Stanley: Just sales cadence through the quarter if there's anything to call out. 
Bill DeLaney: Sales gains?
Andrew Rubin – Morgan Stanley: Cadence. If it was stronger in any one month or accelerating, decelerating?
Bill DeLaney: I think you’re going back to John's question -- again I am trying to make distinctions here where at least the data we see is not that distinguishable. So, no, I would say the cadence obviously was good. It’s hard to pin down week to week but I think the biggest thing as we look at our numbers is just the inflation stayed strong in those categories throughout the quarter. But we saw growth throughout each month and as we said we’re seeing bulk on the locally managed and corporate management side of the business. So I wouldn’t say there's anything overly dramatic or material that would separate one part of the quarter from the quarter.
Chris Kreidler: The second part of your question I think was around – was it a impact from the hiring of MA and I think it’s – Bill obviously will jump in here – it takes a while before newly hired MAs trainees as we call them begin to have an impact on your sales volume. So MAs that we hired 6, 9 months ago will start having an impact but those that we’ve hired in the last quarter or two really aren’t driving that sales volume yet.
Bill DeLaney: I think that’s right. I think what is helping – what I also alluded to earlier is the fact that we’re 9 to 12 months past these territory reductions. So there’s just more stability in sales force right now, we’re getting better at implementing these initiatives. I think our sales force and sales management team are in a better place in terms of just the day to day aspect of the business.
Andrew Rubin – Morgan Stanley: Okay, thank you. That's helpful. And then just to touch on the inflation side, with this coming in a little higher for the quarter, has your outlook changed in terms of what you're potentially seeing for when this may moderate or inflation outlook for the rest of the year? 
Bill DeLaney: I think it’s going to be with us for a while. Dairy is a category that – it’s not quite like – but dairy tends to go up and down a little faster than the others But from what we read here certainly in the meat side of the business, we expect to continue to see inflation there for the next several months probably. So right now I don’t tend to go out too far with my thinking here but I would think over the next six months, could migrate a little bit at some point but I think we’re going to still have a fair amount of inflation. 
Operator: And we would like to thank everyone for their participation on today's conference. That does conclude our call. Please have a great day.

Bill DeLaney: Thank you, Shannon. Good morning everyone, thank you for joining us today. Sysco’s financial results announced this morning reflect a year of significant challenges, tremendous change and solid progress on multiple fronts. While the business environment remained challenging throughout the year and contributed to financial results that fell short of our initial expectations we did have many successes during the year. Sales for the fiscal year grew 5% to $47 billion and adjusted net earnings were $1 billion. Cash flow from operations for the fiscal year was $1.5 billion and free cash flow excluding the impact of certain items was $1.1 billion. We reduced our operating expenses per case by $0.06. We continued to implement transformational change on a broad scale throughout Sysco and remain on track to achieve our targeted three-year business transformation benefits in F2015. We recommenced the rollout of our technology platform with much improved stability and performance. We increased our dividend during this past year, the 45th time since our founding in 1970. In total we distributed nearly $670 million in dividends to shareholders during F2014 and repurchased more than $330 million in stock. And we announced our intention to merge with US Foods which will provide substantial benefits to our customers and help us achieve more scale and efficiency in an evolving and highly competitive marketplace. Turning to our results for the quarter, sales grew 5.9% to $12.3 billion and net earnings were $254 million. Adjusted EPS was $0.50 for the quarter which was flat compared to the prior-year period. While we did experience more expense pressure during the quarter than we had through the first three quarters we are pleased with the 4% increase in gross profit we achieved. Inflation increased significantly at the end of Q3 and was 4.1% for Q4, contributing to our sales and gross profit growth while also pressuring our gross margin. However, a more beneficial mix of our local and corporate managed sales mitigated some of this pressure during the quarter. Our results reflect the impact of the slow and modest economic recovery in a food service industry that as a whole remains under pressure. During the June quarter restaurant industry data indicates that some sequential market improvement occurred but year-over-year industry sales growth continues to be modest and traffic patterns remain stagnant. It’s important to note that while restaurant traffic was essentially flat for our fiscal year Sysco’s case volume grew more than 2% excluding the impact of acquisitions. During the year we made significant progress in achieving our business transformation strategic initiatives that are aimed at implementing an enterprise resource planning or ERP technology platform, lowering product costs, and reducing our operating expense structure.  Regarding our technology initiative in July we implemented our new ERP platform in our Salt Lake City and Albuquerque operating companies. In the past eight months we have successfully deployed seven operating companies under the new platform, bringing the total to twelve. Several of these recent deployments took place at some of our larger and more complex operating companies and many conversions occurred during a particularly busy time of year. We continued to learn and adjust with each go-live and as a result each one has been progressively more successful. As disclosed previously we will focus for the remainder of the calendar year on implementing an SAP software version upgrade and further developing IT-related merger integration and sequencing plans. Our goal with the latter is to prioritize SAP implementation where it will help us achieve targeted synergies as soon as possible with minimal disruption to our customers. We will also continue to work to enhance the scalability of our shared business services processes to prepare for more conversions in the future. Our confidence has grown as we have gained more experience with our ERP conversions and we believe we have a solid foundation from which to move forward. As we continued to implement our category management initiative this year we also focused on enhancing our execution of this effort in several important ways. We developed and implemented new field-ready sales tools, enhanced our customer service in support of this initiative, and improved communication and coordination with the field. Looking ahead we expect to launch the remainder of the categories in scope into the market by the end of F2015. Regarding our operating initiatives during the year we continued to roll out our routing optimization project which is resulting in reduced routes and miles driven while improving on-time deliveries. We completed the conversion of our largest operating companies during the year and expect to complete the remaining by the end of F2015.  Our fleet and equipment optimization initiative will reduce costs and optimize our capital spend as we move forward. During the year we established standard terms and specifications for fleet and warehouse equipment purchases and expect to complete the rationalization of our fleet by the end of this fiscal year.  We also continued to implement our driver and warehouse incentive pay program, increased the application of best practices, and implemented tools to more effectively manage labor costs and expenses. In one of our US broad line markets we successfully piloted a program that increased the amount of recycled material in our operations by 75%. We expect to roll out this program across the country by the end of this calendar year which will also reduce costs. It is appropriate to note at this point that much of the progress we have made in the last few years in driving out key strategic business initiatives has been led by Mike Green, Executive Vice President of Foodservice Operations. Mike recently announced his intention to retire at the end of the calendar year after a very distinguished 24-year career at Sysco. We wish Mike great success as he moves on to the next chapter of his life and we thank him for his service and many contributions to Sysco. Turning to an update on the status of the US Foods merger, last week we announced a future senior leadership team that will report to me following the closing of the merger. This is an important step that will allow us to make further progress in our integration planning efforts, and I look forward to working closely with this team post-close. We also continue to work closely with the FTC as they review the transaction. Our discussions have been productive to date and are progressing as anticipated. We expect the merger to close either late in Q3 or in Q4. In closing I’m very encouraged with our progress during F2014 in strengthening our management team and enhancing our capabilities to serve our customers more effectively and operate our business more efficiently. I’m very grateful to all of our associates for their hard work and dedication throughout F2014. The scope, breadth, and pace of change at Sysco during the year has been remarkable and importantly has provided us a solid foundation to take the next step in our transformational journey as we prepare for our proposed merger with US Foods. Now I’ll turn things over to Chris so he can provide additional details on our financial results for Q4 and the fiscal year.
Chris Kreidler: Thanks, Bill, and good morning everyone. For Q4 sales were $12.3 billion or an increase of 5.9% compared to the prior year. Food costs inflation was 4.1% driven mainly by inflation in the meat, dairy and seafood categories. In addition, sales from acquisitions increased sales by 0.6% and the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates decreased sales by 0.7%. Case volume grew 2.2% during the quarter including acquisitions and approximately 2.1% excluding acquisitions. Gross profit in Q4 increased 4.0% and gross margin declined 31 basis points to 17.55%. During our May earnings call we indicated that inflation jumped substantially at the end of March. That trend continued and we saw a meaningful increase in inflation throughout the quarter. The overall rate was driven by inflation in the meat, seafood and dairy categories which together total more than one-third of our annual sales.  We believe the rapid and marked increase in inflation during the period contributed to the sequential and year-over-year decline in gross margin; however, as Bill mentioned we also experienced a more beneficial mix of our local and corporate managed sales that mitigated some of this pressure during Q4. Operating expenses totaled $1.7 billion in F4Q 2014 including $58.0 million in certain items. Excluding certain items, which mainly related to merger and integration planning expenses, operating expenses increased $78 million or 4.9% driven mainly by increased corporate and delivery costs and incremental expenses from acquired companies. Operating income for the quarter was down 7.7% year-over-year. After adjusting for certain items operating income increased 1.2%. Net earnings for Q4 were $254 million, a decrease of $29 million or 10.2% compared to the prior year. Diluted EPS was $0.43, an 8.5% decrease compared to the prior year. Adjusting for certain items diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.50 which was flat compared to the prior year. Now, turning to the year-over-year comparison, sales increased 4.7% or $2.1 billion. Product costs inflation was 2.1% driven mainly by inflation in the meat, seafood and dairy categories. In addition, sales from acquisitions increased sales by 1.4% and the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates for the fiscal year decreased sales by 0.6%. Case volume grew 3.4% during the fiscal year including acquisitions and approximately 2.2% excluding acquisitions. Gross profit increased 2.3% during the year while gross margin decreased 42 basis points year-over-year to 17.59% due mainly to weak restaurant traffic and competitive pressures. Operating expenses totaled $6.6 billion in F2014 including $150 million in certain items which primarily related to merger and integration planning expenses, a change in Sysco’s self-insurance reserve, and a legal settlement.  Excluding certain items operating expenses increased $201 million or 3.2% primarily due to new costs from acquired companies, higher delivery and corporate expenses, higher payroll costs and higher depreciation and amortization expense partially offset by lower sales organization costs and a decrease in retirement-related expense. Operating costs per case excluding certain items declined year-over-year by $0.06, exceeding one of our key objectives for the year. As we’ve discussed previously it is very difficult simply to hold operating costs per case flat due to typical inflationary pressures. This result reflects the significant impact from business transformation benefits during the year. Operating income was $1.6 billion, declining $71 million or 4.3% for the fiscal year. Excluding certain items operating income declined 0.9%. Net earnings for F2014 were $932 million, decreasing $61 million or 6.1% compared to the prior year. F2014 EPS was $1.58, a decline of 5.4%. Excluding certain items EPS was $1.76 compared to $1.78 in the prior year. Reflecting on our financial results for F2014 our overall results fell short of our expectations. However, if you look at the two halves of the year separately they were vastly different. The first half of the year saw low inflation, weak local sales growth, and weak gross profit growth of 1.2%.  During the second half of the year inflation picked up as did local sales growth. Gross profits grew at a more robust rate of 3.4% in the second half of the year and 4.0% during Q4 in part driven by the increasing impacts from our business transformation initiatives. We are encouraged by the trends we have seen in the second half of the year and we are working hard to maintain and improve upon them for F2015.  Business transformation expenses totaled $277 million in F2014 which was lower by $54 million for the year. Similar to what we discussed last quarter, roughly half of the variance year-to-date relates to a change that we made in how we allocate internal labor costs to the project.  Prior to F2014 we allocated the costs of internal associates based upon the percentage of time they spent on the project. We are now allocating either all or none of an associate’s cost to the project depending on whether they spent the majority of their time on the project. This has had the effect of shifting some expense from business transformation expense to general corporate expense. The remainder of the year-to-date variance in business transformation expense is the result of capitalizing more of the work effort than originally estimated. Had we not experienced these changes total expenses would have been within our original guidance range of $300 million to $350 million. As of the end of F2014 we were ahead of our business transformation benefit goals, achieving significant progress across multiple areas of our business. These efforts allowed us to exceed our cost per case objective and to mitigate the pressure on gross margins. Total capital expenditures net of proceeds from asset sales totaled $497 million for the fiscal year, which was essentially flat compared to last year. This result was just slightly lower than our guidance of $500 million to $550 million. Free cash flow adjusted for the impact of certain items was $1.1 billion for the fiscal year, increasing approximately 3% compared to the prior-year period. Looking ahead I’d like to provide some guidance for key metrics as we typically do at this time of year to set expectations for the coming fiscal year. Please keep in mind that this guidance is for our current business only and does not include any impact from the proposed merger with US Foods. We anticipate providing additional guidance for the combined companies following the close of the transaction. As we’ve stated previously our long-term sales growth expectations are for sales to fall in a range of 4% to 6% annually. We believe this long-term guidance continues to be reasonable. This is nominal sales growth so it includes the impact of inflation which we assume will return to more modest historic levels.  With regards to our three-year business transformation initiatives, we were well ahead of our objectives after years one and two. As we enter the third year of the initiatives we expect to achieve or exceed the high end of the $550 million to $650 million objective that we established two years ago.  As a result, we expect that continued momentum and achieving lower cost of goods from our category management and sourcing initiatives will continue to help mitigate gross margin pressure from the intensely competitive marketplace. In addition we expect our business transformation initiatives will contribute to meet our objective of holding operating costs per case excluding certain items flat year-over-year in our North American broad line business.  We expect corporate expenses will be higher, reflecting investments we are making to provide important new capabilities such as the new revenue management function and the implementation of organizational changes that we believe will drive greater functional support in our broad line operations. In addition we expect to make various investments in certain core technology resources. While the absolute dollar amount of expenses will be higher year-over-year our objective is to grow operating expenses at a slower rate than gross profit growth. Lastly, we expect capital expenditures net of proceeds from asset sales to be in a range of $500 million to $550 million.  Turning to the pending US Foods merger, we continue to make progress in our integration planning efforts which are focused around three areas – day one readiness, value creation, and long-term organizational design. While we continue to work to finalize our synergy targets and the pace at which we will achieve these synergies we remain confident that we will be able to achieve or exceed the level of synergies we’ve previously communicated. Regarding the regulatory process, our dialog with the FTC continues to be productive and is progressing as expected. We continue to believe that this merger will benefit customers and help us become more efficient in an evolving and competitive marketplace and also believe the FTC will agree that our customers have many choices in the fiercely competitive marketplace in which we operate today. As Bill mentioned we expect the merger to close either late in Q3 or in Q4. Finally I’d like to take the opportunity to welcome our new Vice President of Investor Relations, Derrick Vialis, who joined us most recently from BMC Software. Derrick has significant experience in IR and finance and has been publicly recognized by the investment community for his professionalism and financial acumen. We are very pleased to have him join our team. I would also like to take a moment to thank Shannon for stepping up to lead the IR team on an interim basis while we conducted our search for a permanent leader. Because of her leadership and efforts we didn’t miss a beat. Once Shannon helps Derrick get up to speed she’s going to transition into a new role here at Sysco heading up our sustainability efforts. I know you will join me in wishing her success in her new role. In closing, while F2014 included its share of challenges we are excited about the progress in transforming our business and our integration planning efforts related to the US Foods merger. While we continue to have much work ahead of us we strongly believe that we are making the right strategic investments to strengthen our leadership position in the industry. With that, Operator, we’ll now take questions. 
Operator: Thank you. (Operator instructions.) And we’ll go first to Vincent Sinisi with Morgan Stanley.
Vincent Sinisi – Morgan Stanley : Hi, good morning, thanks very much for taking my question. I wanted to ask a little bit about the ERP rollout. I know that you guys made some commentary earlier about how each one is really doing better than the one that was done prior to, so can you just talk a little bit, give us some color around what is new and what are you learning from the previous rollouts that you’re putting into the newer ones?
Bill DeLaney: Sure Vincent, I’ll take a shot at that one. So as we’ve said in the prepared remarks we’ve done about seven during the last eight or nine months – we did five in the fiscal year and just did two more here in July. I would say to you if you go back a year, a year and a half it goes beyond even the deployment, but the system itself is more stable today and then as we do deploy I believe we’re doing a better job working with our people in the field, preparing them, making sure we’re understanding what their challenges are so that not only do we have a good go-live weekend but once the system is live that we’re able to operate the business with fewer glitches, that type of thing. So there’s still challenges. I would say two examples of things that are better is our service levels continue to come up and come back faster than what they did originally. And I would also tell you in some of the early conversions we would have some issues, especially with larger customers, that type of thing that, not to say that we don’t have any today but I think we’re much more coordinated internally with our corporate sales group and with our op cos as well as with the deployment team to plan for those challenges, anticipate them, handle them when they come up. But as we said in the text here learn from each one so that there’s fewer issues as we go forward. So we’ve always done pretty well on the go-live weekends. I would just say post-conversion we’re able to operate the business better; the systems, the performance of the systems is faster, it’s more stable; on the sales side generally much fewer issues today with our sales force and our customers in terms of some of the basics on order entry, that kind of thing.
Vincent Sinisi – Morgan Stanley : Okay, thank you. And one just quick follow-up if I may: with inflation I know you said you were expecting it to return to kind of more modest levels. Have you been seeing some evidence of changes within those three particular categories that you called out this quarter?
Bill DeLaney: We haven’t seen it yet. I think what we’re saying is people that we all follow and just looking at some overview reports on commodities and that type of thing, and just the math of this thing as you get into the last third of next year we would expect it to subside some. But at this point it’s still very comparable to what we’ve seen in the last three or four months.
Vincent Sinisi – Morgan Stanley : Okay, great. Thanks very much, good luck.
Bill DeLaney: Thank you.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse.
Edward Kelly – Credit Suisse : Yeah hi, good morning guys. A quick question for you on expense growth: it was a little bit higher than what we expected this quarter. It seems like, and I might be wrong but it seems like cost per case may have been up this quarter and it was down I guess for the first three quarters of the year. Can you maybe just talk about what is going on with expenses and then how we should sort of think about it from here?
Bill DeLaney: Yeah, why don’t we tag team this one, Ed? So I would say it was up and more than what we would have liked to have seen, and there’s two pieces to it which Chris took you through on the operations side.  Our delivery costs, we’re still having some challenges there. We’re doing some good things on delivery but there’s challenges in the labor market, in certain markets we’ve had some basic issues that we could have managed better I think on comp and that type of thing. So there’s still some transition. Even though we’re putting in some good initiatives on the delivery side it’s still early days; it takes some time for those to get traction. And delivery’s always the hardest expense to manage, but we should do better than what we’re doing there right now and I would expect us to as the new year goes along. The second part of it was more conscious on our part that Chris alluded to, where you know, we’ve got some good things going on here with cat man and revenue management. There are some areas where we need to invest in the technology infrastructure beyond the SAP platform and so we have begun to make those investments. So we did that consciously and those are the right things to be doing for the company, not just in the short-term, in the mid-term. So we could have, probably should have managed the expenses a little bit better. Again, I’m real pleased with the gross profit dollar growth and hopefully you’ll see that get calibrated more effectively here as we go into the new year.
Chris Kreidler: Hi Ed, the only thing I’ll add on the cost per case, your specific question of whether it was up in Q4, it was actually. If you recall a couple of quarters ago when I was commenting about where we are versus our nickel, we were actually pretty far ahead of our nickel per case reduction – I think at the time we were $0.09 or $0.10 down.  And I was telegraphing that while we thought we’d beat the nickel I wasn’t expecting us to maintain the $0.09 or $0.10, and the reason for that is the delivery costs kind of plagued us throughout the year. They continued to be up and we were lapping some of the SG&A benefits that we got from the selling costs and some of the G&A costs as well. So we actually knew that coming into Q4 if we didn’t start to make some headway on the delivery costs that we were probably going ot have a reversal in Q4, which is what happened. So I’ll agree with Bill. I think there are things we can and should be doing and doing better and we continue to work on those, but that’s kind of the color on the cost per case. And the answer on the corporate costs was dead on.
Edward Kelly – Credit Suisse : Okay, and then just to follow up on gross profit per case, you did a nice job this quarter of growing gross profit ahead of case growth again this quarter. Could you just maybe talk about, maybe a little bit more about the drivers? How much is internal, things like category management versus mix versus what’s going on from a competition standpoint and how that’s impacting you? Any color behind the driver there and then the sustainability of this trend would be helpful, thank you.
Bill DeLaney: Well I think, Ed, as we said and I know it’s kind of a recurring theme here but that’s the reality of our business right now – the marketplace continues to be highly competitive. Our customers are under a lot of pressure from the consumer to offer innovative experiences in food and presentations and to do it more and more cost-effectively. So obviously we need to be more responsive and we are responsive to that. So there’s a macro headwind that we continue to fight. In terms of where the mitigation of the improvements are coming from, I think from all the areas you just mentioned. I think certainly since late last fall we’ve done a better job managing our margins I think more effectively internally. I think you are seeing some benefits of cat man begin to become more pronounced. The mix did help a little bit this quarter. It’s more of a balanced mix between locally managed customer growth and sales growth and corporate managed. Inflation helped some too, there.  So we’re kind of at a point where inflation’s probably a little bit higher than what we’d like to see right now certainly in those three categories but it is a little bit of a tailwind as it relates to that, to the margin dollar growth. But at the same time it’s more difficult to pass that price increase along to our customers as fast as we might like, and I think as we said on the last call in most instances we frankly shouldn’t pass along that fast and we have to manage that as best we can. So it’s coming from all areas.
Operator: And we’ll go next to John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. 
John Heinbockel – Guggenheim Securities : So Bill, going back to the gross margin topic, two things – what was the cadence of pass through roughly, because again, it looked at first glance that it was perhaps a little more rapid than I would have guessed but it sounds like it wasn’t. And then secondly, with the mix changes was that more tactical, some course corrections or more strategic that’s been brewing for a while?
Bill DeLaney: Probably I’d plead tactical on the latter. We feel we’re running our locally managed business better. We put this company and in particular our sales force and op cos and customers through a lot with a lot of these initiatives, and many of them either directly, John, or indirectly impacted our salespeople and to some extent our customers. So we’ve cycled a lot of that on the sales side and now we’ve gotten the benefits from it, but I think things are a little more stable on that front.  We’re able to focus more, and like I said we’re giving them better tools to support the cat man rollout, (inaudible) revenue management work is starting to gain some traction. So yeah, I think we’re doing a better job managing the local business. It’s still modest growth but it’s growth. I would be fine with a little bit more growth on the corporate side; it just so happens it’s moderated to some degree so there is no big, strategic initiative there. We are obviously always trying to get better at the profitability and how we manage the profitability of the business.  So I think it’s mostly that we’re managing the locally side better. As far as the first part can you take me through that question again? I’m not really sure I understood it.
John Heinbockel – Guggenheim Securities : Yeah, I was curious how you’re managing the pace of pass through. You had a big step up sequentially, that’s always challenging. Again, it looked at first glance like you probably got a lot of pass through one during the quarter but my guess is that’s not the case, right?
Bill DeLaney: Well I don’t know exactly how you’re interpreting the data. We got 4% GP growth on 2% case growth and 6% sales growth, so I’d say we got our fair share but I don’t know if it’s more or less. I think our people do a really good job responding to the environment that they’re in and trying to make good decisions on how much to pass along, when to pass along, how to work with the customer to find ways to cut their costs so that they don’t have to pass along as much to their customers or to the consumers. So yeah, I think we’re getting better at it, John, but I wouldn’t say we necessarily passed on as much as theoretically we could have.
John Heinbockel – Guggenheim Securities : Alright. And then lastly you talked about ’15 operating expense growth being less than gross profit growth. Is that more expense growth being ratcheted back or just with the prevalence of inflation here GP dollar growth is going to be a bit elevated because of that for the next couple of quarters?
Chris Kreidler: John, that commentary was mainly just to help a little bit with expectations for ’15 and how are we going to look at whether we’re spending too much money on operating expenses or not. We clearly want to grow gross profit dollars as much as we can where as we’ve talked in the last few quarters we’re struggling with a number of things on that front right now and we think we’re seeing some good trends on that front. But in the meantime we’ve always got to control operating expenses. So that’s the governor we’re putting on it – we’re not going to get operating expenses grow faster than gross profit dollars, not in our planning anyway. I think the only other color I’d put on it is as Bill commented, we’ve stood up some capabilities here at corporate and in the field that we think, both new functions and strengthening existing functions, that we think are going to add a lot of value. You take some upfront costs to put those in place and then they’re in your run rate, so the growth rate should diminish over time because those are now built into your run rate.
John Heinbockel – Guggenheim Securities : Alright, thank you.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Karen Short with Deutsche Bank.
Karen Short – Deutsche Bank: Hey there. Just a couple questions on the integration costs. It looks like obviously you’ve given us $90 million for the year-to-date integration, and I guess I was just wondering if you could give us a little more color on what exactly goes into those costs just to get a sense of kind of how far you are along?
Chris Kreidler: Yeah, the vast majority of those costs is what I’d call professional fees, so between our integration consultants, McKinsey and other third parties that are helping us in each of the different functional areas prepare for the integration, do the planning work for that. There’s just a lot of external cost that goes into that. We also throw into that categorization anybody that is fulltime on the integration project, which is not a large number of people but we make sure that we pull those expenses out as well.
Karen Short – Deutsche Bank: Okay, that’s helpful. And then in terms of corporate for next year just remind me, is this Q4 the first time that we’ve had this change in the allocation of the expenses in the corporate, because corporate was quite a bit higher in Q4 than what I would have expected.
Chris Kreidler: Yeah, I’m not sure what you’re referring to about changing the-
Karen Short – Deutsche Bank: In terms of the labor allocation, instead of allocating any labor hours you were either all allocated, it was either all allocated to corporate or not?
Chris Kreidler: Yeah, no, with regards to the ERP project that’s actually a change that we put in place at the beginning of the fiscal year so no, that wasn’t a Q4-only impact.
Karen Short – Deutsche Bank: Okay. So what would have driven the higher corporate specifically this Q4, and then I guess the follow-on is this kind of Q4 run rate the right type of number to use for next year, because obviously if we use that it would be up and would not be consistent with your guidance. I’m just wondering how much higher it could be.
Chris Kreidler: Yeah, I don’t think it’s the right run rate to use for next year. We obviously can’t give you an actual run rate or a percentage number to use. I think you guys have to build something into your models. As I said earlier, we stood up some functionality; we started taking some increased expenses in Q3 and in Q4 for that. You’ll eventually lap that so on a growth basis you won’t see that particular piece of the growth going forward. So that’s part of what occurred in the corporate, and there’s some other stuff that’s in there as well but it’s certainly not a run rate that we expect to continue.
Karen Short – Deutsche Bank: Okay, and then just a last question, in the press release that you issued last week with the new positions, I guess there were two positions that stuck out to me at least as being fairly new to Sysco – the Lead of Sysco’s Domestic and International Operations as well as the Lead on End-to-End Supply Chain both joined in 2013. I’m just wondering those obviously seem like fairly significant roles in terms of the combined company – maybe just some color there given that they both joined fairly recently.
Bill DeLaney: Sure. Let me make sure you’re talking about Tom Bené over in Operations and Scott Charlton over Supply Chain, Karen?
Karen Short – Deutsche Bank: Yep.
Bill DeLaney: Yeah, so these gentlemen are both folks that have joined us here over the last year, year and a half. Tom has twenty plus years with Pepsi and Scott has twenty plus years in multiple areas, retail grocers but big types of supply chain background. So they both have come in. Tom has spent the last 15 months or so building his presence, both working with our merchandising team initially, getting cat man rolled out to the field; and then beyond that has gotten more involved in sales and marketing and some of the inbound aspects of supply chain over the last 9 to 12 months. So two very highly experienced people that have been great additions to the team and have great capabilities, so we’re very excited about it.
Karen Short – Deutsche Bank: Okay, that’s helpful. Thank you.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Meredith Adler with Barclays.
Meredith Adler – Barclays Capital: Thanks for taking my questions. I think, Chris, one of the recent questions you were asked was about these investments and I was just wondering, particularly technology investments, if you can quantify that and give us some sense of the cadence of those costs?
Chris Kreidler: Yeah, I’m just trying to think about what I said that would lead to that specific type of question. So we’ve continued to spend on technology. Most of our expenditures on technology have been around the ERP implementation, so within business transformation; and we kind of called out those expenses, and on a kind of like-for-like methodology they were right in line with our guidance of $300 million to $350 million.  We didn’t spend substantially more on technology if you will during F2014 than we expected to spend, so while there’s an uptick there it’s not a sizable uptick. What we’re calling out for ’15 in terms of guidance is there is a little bit more that we anticipate spending for next year. It’s not going to be huge, huge dollars but there’s going to be a little bit more.  As we roll into the new year we’re going to look at perhaps calling out some additional guidance around technology spend in total, that’s something that we’re talking about internally. It’s a big part of our budget. We understand that; we also think it’s a big part of our competitive advantage so it’s something that we may give more color to as we move forward.
Meredith Adler – Barclays Capital: Okay, I was just hoping to get that color now as I work on my model for next year. I have I think sort of almost a housekeeping question: it sounds like you’ve made great progress in rolling out ERP. Could you talk about how many facilities in total you intend to implement the technology?
Bill DeLaney: Well, we’ve rolled it out to a dozen, Meredith, and we’ve got 70 give or take in the US today. So I would say that 70 would be the target. Obviously that doesn’t include Canada and we’ll deal with that when we get there. The bigger point I think and what we alluded to in my comments was that with the merger on the horizon here we’re going to focus on some updates to the software packages themselves and put together as best we can a cohesive deployment integration plan, factoring in obviously the new facilities and the new businesses that will come in from US. So it’s 70 today and we haven’t determined in totality yet how many operations we’ll have going forward. So it’ll be clearly more than that; it’ll be less than the two together, I can tell you that.
Meredith Adler – Barclays Capital: Okay, that’s helpful. Thank you very much.
Bill DeLaney: You’re welcome.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Mark Wiltamuth with Jefferies.
Mark Wiltamuth – Jefferies : Hi, good morning. Just want to know if you’ve found any other insights in working in that clean room with US Foods – any new insights on synergies or are things tracking as you had originally thought?
Chris Kreidler: Yeah, Mark, they don’t let me in the clean room so I really can’t tell you much.
Bill DeLaney: There’s nobody on this call that can handle clean room insights, Mark. [laughter]
Chris Kreidler: You know, Mark, it’s a good question and let me just take it up to maybe 50,000 feet because I think that’s the essence of your question anyway. What I said in my prepared remarks I’ll obviously stick to. The more we get into this, the more work that we do, the more integration planning that we’re able to do especially around value capture the more confident we get that we will be able to meet or exceed the guidance that we’ve already put on the table. We’ll obviously come out with more information when we’re ready but yeah, we’ve gotten quite a bit of confidence as we’ve been into the details.
Mark Wiltamuth – Jefferies : Okay. And how much timing do you need to really close things from the point that you get a decision out of FTC?
Chris Kreidler: I’ve got to be careful how I answer that because the term “when you get a decision from the FTC,” I think I’ll answer it this way: once we know that we’re allowed to close the transaction we’ll close it as rapidly as possible, so literally within a very, very short period of time so that we can begin the integration process.
Mark Wiltamuth – Jefferies : Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Ajay Jain with Cantor Fitzgerald. 
Ajay Jain – Cantor Fitzgerald : Yeah, hi, good morning. First on business transformation on the rollout, so far it seems like the operating companies that have been converted seem to have a very regional profile. So do you have any plans to convert companies on the East Coast for example? Can you give any plans for the rollout to other regions, and also maybe comment on why you’re focusing on any particular geographies at this time? Thanks.
Bill DeLaney: Yeah, Ajay, we actually consciously went to more of a regional focus in the Southwest and then up into the Mountain states, and the original plan was then to do the Mountain market and come back and finish the Southwest. Those early conversions were a little bumpier, we needed some time to go back there and address some issues, that kind of thing. But again, with the merger on the horizon I can’t really tell you.  So on a steady state basis I think you’d find us finished up in those two regions or markets and then we’d go to a third. It’s just, it’s a better way to do these types of things. You get leadership engagement, both the market leadership level and the op cos tend to work together on a lot of things – it just creates more of a team type of approach. So we’ve actually found that to be quite successful and that’s a change we made about a year, year and a half ago. Again, going forward I’m going to defer I think until we get to where we have clear visibility as to what the whole landscape looks like post-merger.
Ajay Jain – Cantor Fitzgerald : Okay. But there’s no structural impediment to rolling out to other regions.
Bill DeLaney: No. We have RDCs, you know, a big RDC in the Northeast and one in Florida so there was some work that we needed to do to prepare for that, but it’s not an impediment, it just needed a little bit more time. There’s no impediments.
Ajay Jain – Cantor Fitzgerald : Okay. And I think Chris talked about the shift in allocation from business transformation expenses to ordinary operating expenses. And this is a follow-up to Karen’s question earlier – I had a question as to whether the opposite is true in the case of integration and planning costs for US Foods. So first as a comment, I know you talked about consulting fees but it seems like the costs that you’re absorbing are merger expenses, it seems very high especially given that things are still in the review process and it sounds like that review is taking longer than you previously expected.  But in terms of how you’re allocating those costs, is it possible that if the merger was not happening that some of those expense, like certain headcount expenses for example that you’re currently allocating towards integration, that those would otherwise be considered ordinary operating expenses? I’m just trying to confirm if all those integration costs are incremental.
Chris Kreidler: It’s a very good question, Ajay, and I think we could have a robust debate about it. We actually, I believe I’ve been fairly conservative about what goes into those categories. We’re not putting in the cost of a lot of folks that are working a lot on merger integration planning because they also have their fulltime jobs, and so we’re being pretty judicious about what goes in there. Your comment about professional fees, believe me, I wish they were much lower but these types of services and this type of experience comes with a hefty price tag and so we are paying a significant amount of dollars to be prepared.  And while I respect your comment that it doesn’t seem like we’re very far in the process, believe me there’s a regulatory process that occurs in the background and we’re going to continue to say it’s pretty much going as expected. But in the foreground you’re doing a tremendous amount of planning to be ready the day that you close the transaction. And so we’ve had a fairly large group of people allocated into 30 different business functional teams working in each of these areas on how to merge the two companies on day one, how to go after the value capture and synergies, and then how to design their organizations.  There’s been a tremendous amount of work that’s been done and we’ve had external consultancy professionals helping us all along the way. So it’s a tremendous amount of work that’s been done, a lot of hard work by a lot of people that is reflected in these dollars as well as the hours so that when the thing is approved you’re ready to go. Unfortunately you can’t wait for it to be approved and then decide that you’re going to plan for how to integrate the two companies together. It’s something we have to do every day.
Ajay Jain – Cantor Fitzgerald : Okay, and if I can just ask one final question – I wanted to ask about your recent investment in Iowa Premium Beef. That seems like a nontraditional type of venture for Sysco so I’m just wondering if that signifies anything. Are you looking to potentially get more involved in food processing and be more fully integrated in food production?
Bill DeLaney: I think all it signifies, Ajay, great question, is we see an opportunity to partner with some really quality people in that business and to create a premium product, a value-added product which we believe will create more traction with our sales force and with our customers. So I think you could see us do niche type of investments in the future but that’s an opportunity that came our way and we’re moving forward with it, but I wouldn’t read too much into it.
Ajay Jain – Cantor Fitzgerald : Okay, thank you.
Bill DeLaney: Sure.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Andrew Wolf with BB&T Capital Markets.
Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets: Thanks, good morning. Given really how quickly the inflation accelerated right at the beginning of the quarter in meat and stuff, seafood, dairy, I think you guys said you managed it pretty well. What’s your sense of what happened at the restaurant level with customers and passing it through? It looks like the macro numbers you gave for the industry suggested there’s a little strengthening in the industry. So getting at this inflation seems like it’s going to be here for a while at an elevated level in some of these key categories and what’s your guys’ sense of how long it’s going to take to pass it through?
Bill DeLaney: Yeah, let me be clear – I’m not clear on how long it’s going to be here but certainly it’s been with us for five or six months now. And I think from what I’ve been reading which is I’m sure the same material you read in those categories, customers are… Obviously they have to pass them along at some point. These are double-digit increases. So I think they are selectively passing it along where they feel that they can support it in their business; I’m sure they’re also working their menus.  Poultry is a category that at least to date has not experienced much inflation so I’m sure you’re seeing more poultry offerings and that type of thing. So I think they’re managing the portions, I think they’re managing the mix of the menu and they’re passing it along where they can. That’s been my experience in terms of going out to eat.  As we’ve said, medium- to long-term the data we’ve seen over the years is about what gets passed along from the restaurant to the consumer is about 2% year in and year out, so that’ll oscillate a little bit but probably not a lot. So there may be a little bit more being passed along right now but I don’t think a lot. And I think the other thing that validates that is when you look at some of the other numbers from the summer that you know, we’re seeing year-over-year sales growth at the restaurant level but we’re seeing flat to down traffic, so I think that would validate that as well.
Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets: Gotcha. And moving on to the, I think this was the first quarter in a while where your MA served business is up at broad line – it’s up marginally but it’s up. What should we look at? You referenced just lapping when it was down but I’m trying to tie it into some of the investment it sounds like you’ve made internally into sales management, whether it’s the sales (inaudible) you called out or the regional management and coordination. Can you just give a little color on that?
Bill DeLaney: Yeah, I think what I was trying to articulate was not so much lapping as just a fair amount of the stress that we’ve put on the organization in particular in the sales arena, and that we’ve lapped a lot of that. So yeah, I think things are more stable out there today than they were 12 or 18 months ago in terms of people just going to work every morning. They know what their role is, they know what their territory is, they know what their commission plan is, they know how cat man works, they’ve got better tools for that and we’re giving them some other tools to work with in other areas like revenue management.  So I think from that standpoint we’ve made a lot of investments and we’re at a point now where we’re managing that better. So I’m pretty optimistic that we’ll continue to see a good improvement. To your point, it’s modest but you know, everything in this industry right now is modest. As long as it’s positive you know, we’re going to be very pleased.
Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets: Yeah. And just a last thing on, it seems like a pretty good environment for business that’s generating a lot of savings on the cost side, on the cost of goods sold side with all the inflation out there to go after share, maybe really invest that more into the customers than previously planned in sort of a more flat inflation environment. What is your business’ appetite for that kind of strategic sense in the next little while?
Bill DeLaney: I think we’ve been able to grow our share consistently year in and year out, so that’s what we do. We think that’s very important but to do it the right way. So our way of going after share is really to become more efficient in everything that we do, to take costs out of our system. It’s one of the big opportunities. We see this merger as very pro-customer, pro-competition; it allows us to take costs out, that kind of thing.  So the way you grow your share ultimately is to take costs out of the system, develop your people, hire better people where you need to and compete as well as you can in terms of the acute pressures in the marketplace, but to also differentiate yourself over the medium- and long-term as well with your products, your services, your business solutions. So we’re always looking to grow but we need to grow profitably both in the short-term and the medium-term.
Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets: Okay, thank you.
Bill DeLaney: Thank you.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Erin Lash with Morningstar. 
Erin Lash – Morningstar : Thank you for taking the question. Obviously US Foods is getting a lot of the attention but I was just wondering if you could talk about the overall I guess acquisition environment and kind of your appetite for future deals, as well as just kind of the premiums that sellers are potentially looking for in this type of environment.
Chris Kreidler: Yeah, Erin, I’ll take that one. We continue to look at transactions. We’re obviously fairly occupied right now with planning for the merger integration so we don’t have as many resources probably looking at transactions as we would in other quarters, other years. We also, it’s going to be a little difficult to do deals in the US for a little bit of time at least while we get this one approved but we continue to look in our other markets and we continue to look in new markets, and we’re fairly prudent especially if it’s a new market. So they’ll come a little slower. But I’d say we’re still pretty active and still looking for opportunities in other parts of our geographies and new geographies. The second part of your question in terms of expectations, I wouldn’t say that I’ve really seen a marked change in expectations in terms of pricing from call it a year ago. I think there was a time when we talked about it on these calls, where expectations were pretty high given where the macroeconomics were. I think those moderated some. We’ve been able to get a lot of deals done and I think they’ve held in that kind of reasonable range since then.
Erin Lash – Morningstar : Thank you, that’s very helpful. And then just one other question: obviously I get the sense with the US Foods integration that there isn’t a target I guess this year for the ERP rollout. Is that true or are there maybe a certain number of operating companies that you are looking to complete by the end of the fiscal year?
Bill DeLaney: There’s not a specific target, Erin, you’re right. What we want to do is get the merger closed and then get the integration connected to that, and then we’ll put together a rollout schedule that would incorporate both platforms if you will.
Erin Lash – Morningstar : Thanks, that’s helpful. 
Operator: And we’ll go next to John Ivankoe with J.P. Morgan.
Amod Gautam – J.P. Morgan : Hi, it’s actually Amod Gautam. In terms of the acquisition question maybe a little bit more specifically, in your F2015 planning are you budgeting any cash flow for acquisitions? Or I guess asked another way, is the 4% to 6% sales growth, does that include some contribution from acquisition obviously ex the US Foods?
Chris Kreidler: Yeah, we actually plan those differently. So what we typically do is we look at a long-term expectation for sales growth. We’ve said 4% to 6% for a while. We build that up from the standpoint of what do we think real cases are going to grow in the industry, how much more do we think we will grow because we’re typically pretty good at growing faster than the industry; what’s the rate of inflation that should go on top of that; and then does that fall within the 4% to 6% range, yes or no? We still feel good about 4% to 6%, that’s how we build that up. Some of those cases may indeed come from acquisitions when we think about how much more than the industry we can grow so that’s how it gets baked in there. Separately we typically task ourselves with a certain percentage of growth through acquisitions, what we’ll call kind of the smaller, non-US-Food-type-size acquisitions. We’ve traditionally said that we want to grow at least 1% from those types of acquisitions. We haven’t put that guidance out there for next year again because of the pending merger here but we certainly challenge ourselves to hit some internal targets along those lines as well.
Amod Gautam – J.P. Morgan : Okay, and then on the gross margins I guess, Bill, you alluded a little bit to the mix shift being somewhat tactical on the locally managed versus the corporate business. I mean as you think about F2015 gross margin percent has kind of come down over the past few years but it does seem like you have some potential tailwinds here, whether it be that mix shift or inflation coming off or some of the category management initiatives. So just broadly on F2015, is this a year where maybe gross margin percentage can stabilize after several years of decline.
Bill DeLaney: Well, I think you’ve got to start with improving over F2014, so that’s our goal. And as Chris pointed out in his comments we saw that improvement kick in the second half of the year. So we saw 4% here in this quarter so that’s encouraging. There’s some inflation in that like we’ve acknowledged, so I think if we can just show good, steady improvement throughout the year and manage our expenses appropriately we’ll have a successful year.  And as we continue to drive up these initiatives, and these are not just one-time initiatives. These are different ways of doing business. Category management is a different way of selling and marketing and merchandising. Revenue management is a different way of segmenting your customers and trying to approach your customers with the best offerings that we can with the right presentation with the right channel, those types of things. So I would just say to you we’re in the early days of transforming this company in terms of how we need to compete and how we need to support our customers for them to be successful. And that will undergird all of this in terms of our ability to price effectively and manage our costs along the way.
Chris Kreidler: Yeah, I’ll just add a little more to that. I mean I’ll pick up on Bill’s comment of early days. We’ve said before that we’ve got two of the waves, the majority of two waves kind of fully into the market at this point of our category management initiatives and we’ve got a lot more waves to come. Now those two that are out there were a lot of dollars but we’ve got a lot more waves to come. And the point of that being that we still have a lot to roll out.  We still have the opportunity to do better and better and we just have to keep working at it. It required some patience on our part to build the teams, build the processes, get it started. We believe we’re starting to see some of those results in the numbers now and we’re hopeful those numbers continue to shine in the numbers every quarter. And that as we’re saying we believe mitigates whatever competitive pressure is out there.
Amod Gautam – J.P. Morgan : Okay, great. Thanks and good luck.
Bill DeLaney: Thank you.
Operator: And this does conclude the question-and-answer session. We thank you for your participation in today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Sysco's Third Quarter Fiscal 2014 Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. We will begin today's call with opening remarks and introductions. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Shannon Mutschler. Please go ahead ma’am.
Shannon Mutschler: Thanks Anna. Good morning everyone and welcome to Sysco's third quarter fiscal 2014 earnings call. Today you will hear prepared remarks from Bill DeLaney, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Kreidler, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, please note that statements made during this presentation that state the company's or management's intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions subsequent to SEC filings and then the news release issued earlier this morning. A copy of these materials can be found in the Investor section of sysco.com or via the Sysco IR App, which can be downloaded from the iTunes App Store and Google Play. Non-GAAP financial measures are included in our comments today and in our presentation slides. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the applicable GAAP measures are included at the end of the presentation, and can also be found in the Investors section of our website. All comments about earnings per share referred to diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. In addition, all references to case volumes include total Broadline and SYGMA combined. To ensure that we have sufficient time to answer all questions, we would like to ask each participant to limit their time today to one question and one follow-up. Lastly, our previously stated expectations of hosting an Investor Day meeting this summer in Boston, have changed. We have determined that it would be most effective to hold the meeting after the proposed merger with US Foods closes. Accordingly, we’ll update you once the firm date for the event has been chosen. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill DeLaney.
William J. DeLaney: Thanks Shannon. Hello everyone and thank you for joining us today. This morning, Sysco reported third quarter sales of $11.3 billion in net earnings of $181 million. Adjusted earnings per share, excluding certain items was $0.38 for the quarter, compared to $0.40 in the prior year. Market conditions during the first two months of the quarter were dominated by the impact of unusually severe winter weather conditions throughout much of the United States. As a result, we experienced very modest sales growth in January and February and delivery expenses were under significant pressure as well. Conditions improved markedly in March as the adverse weather subsided, which likely contributed to consumers going out more both to shop and eat. We benefited from this turn of events as evidenced by our nearly 6% sales growth in March, almost twice the top-line growth we experienced for the overall quarter. In assessing our operating performance for the quarter and factoring in the challenging market conditions, results were generally inline with our expectations. Sales growth were modest at 3.2% was aided by improved, locally managed sales trends in March. Gross profit grew nearly at the rate of sales growth and at a higher rate than we experienced during the first half of the fiscal year. We also reduced our operating cost for case in our Broadline business. We are encouraged by improved gross profit trends during the quarter and attributed much of our progress in this area to more consistent margin management practices in our operating companies, strengthening local sales trends and the low level of inflation we experienced during much of the quarter. Moving forward, we assume our cost is regarding gross margin trends in the short-term as we begun to see a meaningful increase in product cost inflation in the high cost meat and dairy categories since the end of the quarter. The consistently improved cost per case results, we’re experiencing in the Broadline business have been driven by the benefits realized from several cost reduction initiatives we’ve implemented over the past two years, especially in the SG&A area of the business. As some of these benefits begin to ramp on a year-over-year basis, we expect to realize increased benefits from more of our transformation initiatives on the operation side of the business. Turning to our technology transformation initiatives, this fiscal year between November and March we implemented our new ERP platform at three operating companies and in April converted it to additional locations for a total of 10 companies running on the new ERP technology. The successful conversion of five OPCOs in six months reflects our consistent progress in strengthening and stabilizing our ERP platform. In addition, we work to ensure smoother transitions for each successful convergence, for example improved procedures in attention to data management help to make the go-live at Denver and New Orleans last month a more successful year. Regarding our initiatives to lower product costs, we expect to meet our stated financial objectives for this fiscal year and next as our category management efforts continued to gain momentum. By the end of this fiscal year, the pilot all the wave 1 and majority of wave 2 categories were launched into the market representing $5 billion to $7 billion in annual spend and roughly a third of the total addressable spend. We continue to enhance the program’s effectiveness by showing best practices and improving communication both of the corporate merchandising and operating company level. We also continue to progress on our initiatives to lower operating costs. During the quarter, we advanced our routing optimization project, which is resulting in reduced routes in miles driven while improving on-time deliveries. Our fleet optimization initiative is underway and we have removed hundreds of older pieces of equipment from the system with more to come. In addition, we have now completed an initiative to negotiate standard terms and specifications for fleet purchases. These changes combined with similar actions for warehouse equipment completed earlier this year will help us reduce costs and optimize our capital spend as we move forward. Regarding our proposed merge with US Foods, the integration planning team is making good progress toward bringing our two companies together as Chris will describe in a few minutes. This transaction represents a significant opportunity to enhance our ability to serve our customers, strengthen our supplier partnerships, further engage our employees and enhance profitability through meaningful synergies. We are encouraged by our continuous improvement on multiple fronts throughout the company and believe that this transformational change will help our customers to be more successful through our added efficiency in our business and enhance our financial results. Personally engaging in transformation of this magnitude is both challenging and rewarding for me as well as for all of our 49,000 associates. I very much appreciate their efforts and dedication, as we move forward in this exciting and pivotal time in Sysco’s history. Now I’ll turn the things over to Chris, so he can provide additional details on our financial results for the third quarter.
R. Chris Kreidler: Thanks, Bill and good morning everyone. For the third quarter, sales were $11.3 billion or an increase of 3.2%, compared to the prior year, mainly due to increased Case volume, including the impact of acquisitions. Case volume increased 3% for the quarter and Case volume excluding acquisitions increased 2.3%. Inflation remained quite modest during the quarter, increasing sales by 0.9% and changes in foreign exchange rate decreased sales by 0.9%. As Bill mentioned, January and February sales were negatively impacted by the unusually severe weather throughout most of the country. However, March saw a March rebound with sales growth during the month of 5.5%, which was more in line with the rate of growth in the first half of the year. Gross profit in the third quarter increased 2.7% nearly at the same rate of sales growth. Gross margin declined 9 basis points to 17.69%, which is the smallest decline we’ve seen in 15 quarters. After taking into account changes in customer mix, gross margin actually increased slightly compared to the prior year. Similar to what we saw with sales trends during the quarter, gross profit was substantially stronger in March, compared to January and February, increasing 4.8% during the month as weather and the locally managed sales trends improved. However, as Bill mentioned, since the end of the quarter, we’ve begun to see a meaningful increase in product costs inflation in the meat and dairy categories, which together totaled roughly 30% of our annual sales. We expect this pressure may contribute to added gross margin pressure in the near-term. Operating expenses increased $57 million or 3.5% in the third quarter of fiscal 2014, compared to the prior year period. A year-over-year increase in operating expenses was mainly due to increased Case volume and new cost from acquired companies, increased delivery and warehouse costs somewhat exacerbated by the unusually severe weather, increased corporate expenses, due mainly to timing, partially offset by lower sales organization costs and a decrease in retirement related expense, as a result of the restructuring work we completed last year. Benefits generated from our transformation initiatives more than offset cost pressure in our delivery and warehouse areas, resulting in a $0.03 decline in operating costs per Case in our Broadline operations in the third quarter and a $0.07 decline for the first 39 weeks of the year with both periods excluding the impact of certain items. We remain confident in meeting or exceeding our objective of a $0.05 decline for the full fiscal year as we experienced continued year-over-year benefits from changes in our sales organization and the impact of lower retirement-related expenses. The impact from the restructuring of our retirement plan is actually exceeding our expectations. We now expect that retirement-related expenses for fiscal 2014 will be lower by $65 million to $75 million excluding certain items. This is lower than our previous guidance of down $50 million to $60 million and expenses from our enhanced 401(k) benefits have been lower than anticipated. As some of the benefits from our SG&A initiatives begin to wrap on a year-over-year basis, we expect to realize increased benefits from more of our transformation initiatives on the operation side of the business. Operating expenses including certain items increased $51million or 3.3%, certain items totaled $56 million during the quarter, an increase of $6 million over the same quarter last year. Certain items this quarter consisted primarily of two times; first, merger and integration planning expenses totaled $32 million and mainly related to professional fees. Second, we’ve recorded a $20 million legal contingency accrual related to a previously disclosed investigation in California, a portion of which should not deductible for tax purposes. Certain items in the prior year period totaled $50 million including a $41 million charge withdraw from a multiemployer pension fund. Business transformation expenses were lower in the third quarter compared to last year by $13 million and were lower by $45 million for the first 39 weeks of the year. About half of the variance year-to-date relates to a change we have made in how we allocate internal labor cost to the project. In the past, we allocated the cost of internal associates based upon the percentage of time they spend on the project. We are now allocating either all or none of an associates cost to the project depending on whether they spend the majority of their time on the project. This has had the effect of shifting some expense from business transformation expense to general corporate expense. The remainder of the year-to-date variance in business transformation expense is the result of capitalizing more of the work effort than originally estimated. As a result of the change in labor capitalization methodology and the increased amount of capitalization, we now expect total business transformation expenses for the year to be lower than our previous guidance in the range of $275 million to $300 million. And general corporate expenses to be somewhat higher. Operating income for the quarter was down 1.4% year-over-year after adjusting for certain items operating income increased 0.3%. Net earnings for the third quarter were $181 million, a decrease of $20 million or 10.2% compared to the prior year. Diluted earnings per share was $0.31 and 8.8% decrease compared to the prior year. Adjusting for certain items diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.38, which was down 5%, compared to the prior year. We estimate that the impact of the unusually severe weather in January and February reduced earnings per share by $0.01 to $1.05. Total capital expenditure is totaled to $117 million for the third quarter this year compared to $111 million last year. We continue to expect total capital spending to be in the range of $550 million to $600 million for fiscal 2014. However, after including anticipated proceeds from asset sales net capital spending will be in the range of $500 million to $550 million. Free cash flow was $273 million for the third quarter increasing over the prior year period mainly due to improvements in working capital performance which offset weaker net earnings. For the first 39 weeks of the year, free cash flow increased 22% to $484 million. As we began to wrap our particularly strong cash flow performance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, we expect the level of year-over-year increases in free cash flow to moderate. Turning to the pending US Foods merger, we continue to make progress in our integration planning efforts and have engaged in an extensive process focused on three goals; day one readiness, value creation and long-term organizational design. The teams are working well together and has made a lot of progress in a relatively short period of time. Regarding the regulatory process our dialog with the SEC continues to be productive as we work to fulfill their second request for information about our business and industry. We continue to believe that this merger will benefit customers and help us become more efficient in an evolving and competitive marketplace. And also believe the SEC will agree that our customers have many choices in the fiercely competitive marketplace in which we operate today. As a result we continue to expect the merger to close in the third calendar quarter of this year. In closing, while severe weather in the third quarter present the challenges to the business and our financial results. We’re relatively pleased with our business performance as we exited the quarter. In addition we’re excited about our progress to transform our business and our integration planning efforts related to the US Foods merger. While we continue to have much work ahead of us we strongly believe that we are taking the right steps and making the right strategic investments to position our company for success in the future. With that operator we’ll now take questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) We’ll move first to John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.
John E. Heinbockel – Guggenheim Securities LLC: Hey, Bill. I’m pretty encouraged by right your gross margin management. So, the question is, is there a different philosophy with regard to how you were spending those dollars? How you think about elasticity, and if so what is driving that change in philosophy and how you, practically what things you are doing differently.
William J. DeLaney: Good morning, John. I’d say, I don’t think there is a different philosophy, I think where you saw some improved execution. We’ve been doing this a long time and we’re always trying to strike the right balance between growth and taking profitable share for the medium to long-term with obviously managing our margins appropriately so. From that standpoint what I was trying to convey in my remarks was, clearly we haven’t been performing at the level we’d like and we spend a lot of time – we’ve done a lot of work with our operators so to speak. And I think what you saw here is a small but meaningful step forward in terms of progress and, I use the word consistency, that’s probably our biggest opportunity in Sysco today and I think the benefits you’re seeing in this quarter were more consistent focus and striking the right balance, I guess that between growth, pricing and what’s good for the customer, anyhow just the basic day today stuff, there is nothing really overly proprietary here. When you have commodity prices, continuous attention to how fast they are moving and what direction they are moving in and being responsive in the right ways. So I’d say, it’s more improved execution of that philosophy and hopefully it’s a sign of things to come.
John E. Heinbockel – Guggenheim Securities LLC: Now is that in terms of giving lots on the improved execution. Is that more getting folks in the field to understand what you’re trying to do and elasticity issues or is it more actually putting sort of guard rails on what they can do out in the field?
William J. DeLaney: I would say, our folks in the field understand, I think what it is, is that bringing more focus to the issue with all that they have to deal with on a day-to-day basis and in that process, yes, brining least parameters and overtime a little more governance to that process. So again early days here John, but we certainly are trying to get more consistency in terms of how we approach it. But our folks understand the issue, they are very good operators. It’s more about bringing consistent focus to it.
John E. Heinbockel – Guggenheim Securities LLC: And then lastly, with inflation picking up, how do you think about this pick up in perishables inflation versus those we’ve seen in the last couple of years. We’ve had a couple of these cycles when you look at where the macro is, where you are with US Foods. Are you more or less inclined to pass that through quickly than you might have been in the past?
William J. DeLaney: I don’t think the US Foods merger has anything to do with it. I would say what’s interesting, what we are seeing right now John, and this is really just kind of manifest itself in the last four to six weeks. There is double-digit inflation in meat, seafood and dairy. And the rest of the categories are roughly flat, you’re actually down a little bit in grocery, down a little bit in poultry, in terms of what we saw in April. So what you’re seeing here is that as you know in particular meat, those are high priced boxes. So it’s challenging at times to pass that along as fast as you might like to with customers, sometimes that’s not even a right thing to do, sometimes it’s ups and down with the customer, kind of reworking their menu in terms of, if poultry is flat to down, working more poultry into the menu. So we are just trying to be a little cautious here, I mean the good news here is well, as you know we don’t want to see a lot of inflation over the meaningful long-term. It’s not good for our customers. I mean that inflation is working its way into the top line as well. So we’re basically just common Al, I think gross margin as a percent of sales stand perspective. There is more pressure there right now than what we saw in the third quarter. But I think we’ll manage it reasonably well and as far as going forward, a lot of this has to do with supplies in the beef area and I think some of this will be with us for awhile. It’s really hard to predict what happens past three to six months, Al.
John E. Heinbockel – Guggenheim Securities LLC: All right. Thank you.
William J. DeLaney: Sure.
Operator: We’ll now move to Andrew Wolf with BB&T Capital Markets.
Andrew P. Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets: Good morning. On the March sales improvement, was some of that the inflation you’re talking about or did the cases in the real business also get better?
William J. DeLaney: In March Andy is more – there was not very much inflation. I think we probably saw some in the later couple of weeks of March. But I think March was really more of demand, people got out more and you saw the retail numbers I think, they came out here recently and so it’s just more – we saw more volume and as we alluded to, we also saw more on the locally managed side than what we see in the last two to three quarters which was encouraging as well.
Andrew P. Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets: Did you see that across the board, so the independence, I know in the past you said it’s really hard to track their same-stores sales but just anecdotally or how would you can with the independent business also stronger?
William J. DeLaney: Yes, so independence will make up a significant piece of this locally managed, and yes I would tell you we saw across the board in March. There was very, was really tail two quarters. It was brutally hard out there, I think for everybody the first couple of months and then in March. We saw a turnaround in the top line in pretty much every segment. We saw every restaurant like that.
R. Chris Kreidler: Yes, and Andy, I want to be careful and echo what Bill said a minute ago about this inflation, the reason we are calling it out as frankly it come up upon us pretty quickly. We don’t want it to be a surprise when we talk about it later on. But in the March quarter inflation was no different really than the rest of the quarter. And so, it really wasn’t yet in the March numbers as Bill said, that we started to feel at a little bit in the later two weeks. But it was pretty much inline with the quarter. It came on, it went from basically nothing to something in April and so that’s why we are calling it out and it’s pretty narrow in terms of the categories but they are big dollar categories for us.
William J. DeLaney: I don’t want to get too much in the April because that's something we typically do. I would just say to you, we’ve had two solid months in a row in the top line. They look a little different, April is a month, April is a transition month and so I would say to you a couple of thinks, my sense is spring came little earlier this year than last year. I saw some of the clubs and that type of thing open up and that helped us. Easter was little later and people were still I think looking to get out, so April the weeks were not necessarily consistent but it’s a month, we had another solid month on the top line and in the business. And I would just say the mix was little different between pricing and volume as well.
Andrew P. Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets: To follow-up same vein on sales trends and this improvement. When you look at the geographies that probably add less weather impact like California and Florida, let’s say, we have a lot of operations. Was there a better, do you see the same thing or was it stronger the entire quarter, could you just comment on the non-weather affected sales trends?
William J. DeLaney: I would say the weather, to go back to that was more East of the Mississippi, so that is virtually all of our markets other than California and West Coast. If I was particularly pronounced even though I would say, winner comes every year, it was particularly pronounced in the Northeast and the Mid-East, but we were shutdown at Atlanta for a couple of days. We didn’t deliver that kind of thing. So I would say those first couple of months, the weather impacted the vast majority of our businesses.
,:
Andrew P. Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets: Thank you.
William J. DeLaney: Sure.
Operator: And we’ll now move to Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse.
Edward J. Kelly – Credit Suisse Securities, LLC: Yes, hi good morning guys.
William J. DeLaney: Good morning.
Edward J. Kelly – Credit Suisse Securities, LLC: I wanted to just follow-up on gross margin, gross profit, we tried to look at gross profit dollars per case and obviously, this quarter you did better there in terms of year-over-year growth versus where you’ve been. Now I know inflation going forward picks up. But do you think the business has reached the point where you’ve done a better job in managing where our gross profit for case should at least be stable to better going forward. Or when you talk about the pressure inflation, are you trying to say that you could still be down a little bit there going forward?
William J. DeLaney: Ed, we look at this thing across a lot of different ways. So, I’ll let Chris jumping in here in a minute as well. So, I want to be careful about the gross profit because that’s going to play out in different categories. When I would tell you is the way I look at it, as I look at case growth, I look at the mix of case growth between locally managed, which is largely your street business versus your contract business. And then, I look at gross profit dollar growth, and then I look at cost per case – operating cost per case. So, we can put that together, I don’t want to shift in terms of your question on this call, but I would tell you obviously the first half of the year we had 1.2% gross profit dollar growth and that went to 2.7%. So, I’m encouraged with that. I think we can continue to improve from there. We’ll have to see how fast that develops. So I feel good about that part. I think, we’ll continue to manage the cost per case well. I think, just and put this in some historical contacts, Chris and I were talking before the call. I’ve been around this business 25 years give or take, I would tell you, if you go back and look at Sysco’s history we didn’t always share all this, to mange our operating cost per case to be up a $0.05 a year was usually a pretty good year in normal times. Our medium to longer-term model where we’re trying to find enough initiatives every year to keep that at flat cost per case, in this particular year 2014, we targeted a $0.05 reduction as Chris pointed out. So, I’m really pleased with how we are managing at the operating level, in terms of cost and encourage too much is not a trend make here, but I’m encouraged what we are seeing on the gross profit dollar growth. I don’t know, Chris is going to answer your specific question about what you put historic as well.
R. Chris Kreidler: Yes. I probably won’t get into any specifics, but I want to echo what Bill said, it is one of the metrics we look at, but we look at a lot. And the challenge on that particular one depends upon a lot of different variables one of which, we’ve been talking about here, which is inflation and inflation by certain categories. So, if we get a lot of inflation and it happens to be in high dollar categories at sometimes are fee per pound or fee per case that can play havoc with that particular number. So, it is part of what we look at, but as Bill says, we’re driving the business for gross profit dollar growth. And that’s why we were generally pleased with the way we exited the quarter with the amount of growth that we saw in March.
Edward J. Kelly – Credit Suisse Securities, LLC: Yes. That makes sense. Okay. And then, just last question for you. Category manager, maybe could you provide just a bit more detail on sort of what you’re seeing out there? What you’re hearing from customers, where you’re at? And I guess even more specifically like how our sales doing in a category then how our gross profit dollars doing in the categories?
William J. DeLaney: Sure. We’re a year into this now, and as I mentioned, we’re deep into wave 1 and wave 2. And we think, by the end of the year we will launched about 30% of what we called the influenceable spend, which is about two-thirds of our spend 60% to 70%. We’re getting better executing that, so I would tell you there are certainly opportunity to improve, but we’re assuming getting better in terms of working within our corporate merchandizing team and with our OPCOs in terms of how we communicate these category, and issues as they come out there is a lot of categories out there being launched right now. We’re getting better in terms of working with our OPCOs to work with our customers and their sales force and had the position of the opportunities for the customer as well again plenty of opportunity to improve over the next 12 to 18 months as well. So, I think our execution is getting better, both on the communication side as well on the conversion side. We continue to see very good reductions in the cost of goods, certainly as much it ties better than what we originally plan. The sales line where we had some challenges earlier on there in terms of some of the conversions, I think we are getting better as a company in terms of positioning those conversions with customers and in the subsequent ways the sales trends are somewhat better than what we saw in the prior. So, I would say – I would characterize it that is gradual continuous improvement on the execution – still relatively early days here and it would be a big part of our progress for next fiscal year as well.
Edward J. Kelly – Credit Suisse Securities, LLC: Great, thank you.
William J. DeLaney: Welcome.
Operator: We will now move to Karen Short with Deutsche Bank.
Karen F. Short – Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. It’s just a couple of a questions on MAs. I guess, wondering, you made a comment in the press release Bill about improved weather and locally managed sales strengthened, I guess. So, I guess the first question is, what do you mean by exactly by locally managed sales strengthened? And then the second part of that question is I guess there is definitely rumblings out there, their people might be going after your MAs knowing that there is going to be disruption. So wondering in this kind of environment as you’re leading into the close, how do you – kind of how do you retain your best sales people and how do you please them that their won’t be a much disruption as some people fear?
William J. DeLaney: Yes, so let me take the first one Karen. So locally managed was something I’ve kind of coined here over the last 18 months. We use it more internally, but I don’t really like to speak externally differently, I do internally. So it’s an attempt which is getting traction now within Sysco. It’s to have more clarity for operating in our market precedence. So the certain segment sales which we will call street sales, local contract being another, basically where the customer and that decision maker that relationship is driven with a local OPCO, we’ve just kind of bundled that a little bit more than just talking about street from an accountability standpoint and from an influencing standpoint. So it’s an internal terminology. We still look at street within that number. So we look at both, I would tell you I think you would know this over the last four or six quarters what we’ve seen is our corporate manager largely our national – large regional business has grown at a faster rate than our locally managed. And in fact, the locally managed growth is pretty modest, and it was modest again in January and February. So when I was referring to there, as it did strengthen in March along with the other book of business as well. And that is very encouraging and that is the key part of our growth and that is the key part of our profitability leveraging as well. So it’s a big part of our business and something we put a lot of emphasis on and in the fairness, while these initiatives we’ve been driving out both in terms of the sales organization, cap man that kind of thing. That directly impacts that sales force, our local sales management teams and ultimately the customer, and so there has been a fair amount of distractions out there over the last year. And I think we are starting to see that we are – we are though a lot of that and beginning to manage it better. As far as MA retention or MA numbers, we had situations in some of our companies last year where we as we had some of that distraction and disruption, we allowed our MA workforce to fall well below where our target members where. And we are coming back there, so we are not all the way back, but we had targeted growth numbers for this year and we are beginning to approach those to get to the level we want to get to.
 :
Karen F. Short – Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay that’s very helpful. And then just on Denver, New Orleans you commented that there was most successful conversions yet, maybe can you just talk a little bit more about why and what you did, and then what are your plans you are going to make, if you said that and I missed that out, but fair conversions for the rest of the year.
William J. DeLaney:
, : I would also tell you on the customer side, we were more connected in particular with our larger regional and national customers in terms of how the conversion would impact them. And so as issues did arise, we were much more connective as an organization between the technology group and the sales group and that was a big part as well. So those are the two things I would call. As far as going forward, we are having those discussions right. We’re going to need overly, our view of the integration planning work. Currently that’s going on with the merger and look at that, there is an opportunity to do probably a couple more companies we haven’t made a final decision on that but I think there is a good chance that we probably do two more and then take a step back and look at where we are in the merger.
Karen F. Short – Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Right thanks a lot.
William J. DeLaney: Thank you.
Operator: We’ll now move to Meredith Adler with Barclays Capital, Inc.
Meredith Adler – Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks for taking my question. Can you hear me?
William J. DeLaney: Yes, can hear you?
Meredith Adler – Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes, good thanks. My first question is, you talked about MAs at your own company. Can you talk about at all that what’s happening at US foods?
R. Chris Kreidler:
, :
 :
Meredith Adler – Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, I also have a question, did you talk about the Easter shift at all impacting March, and probably would have been negative, and March was very strong, do you think it would have been stronger, it hadn’t been for the Easter shift?
William J. DeLaney: What is the first part of your question, really what would have been negative?
Meredith Adler – Barclays Capital, Inc.: In the Easter shift…
William J. DeLaney: Yes
Meredith: By March to April?
William J. DeLaney: So your question is, if Easter been earlier, would it been better.
Meredith Adler – Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes.
William J. DeLaney: No there, I think a late Easter helped us. Interesting though, it didn’t really help us that much. I cant’ say this, our performance in Florida, which is where you would see most of the Easter benefit. What’s if that different wasn’t any better than the other regions until the week of Easter, and then we definitely saw the fact that, so we have a still more people in Florida, what you hear in Florida is regardless of the calendar, people tend to stay, a lot of people tend to stay until Easter. So, it helped us, I think what really helped us a lot in March, Meredith was hurt us in January, February people. And good number parts of the country had been locked up in their homes, don’t want to get out and dig it out more. So I would say, a late Easter helped us somewhat, but probably not as much as just the other side of the weather discussion.
Meredith Adler – Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
William J. DeLaney: Thank you.
Operator: We’ll now move to Ajay Jain with Cantor Fitzgerald.
Ajay Kumar Jain :
Cantor Fitzgerald Securities:
 :
R. Chris Kreidler: Yes. It seems like there are several questions there. So, tell me if I don’t get all of them. We’re obviously taking into consideration the integration planning and what may occur post merger, but in terms of how we report our business transformation today and we’re going about our business today really not that much impact. So we’re in planning phase for integration, but we’re not allowing it to impact what we’re doing from a business transformation perspective going after the benefits that the way look at the cost et cetera. What will impact it, and Bill alluded to it here a few minutes ago is, as we think about overlaying the merger into our company and especially from the business technology standpoint, we have to rethink about rollout schedules, we have to rethink how we’re going to put the companies together technologically, that will have an impact and we’re playing through various scenarios on that right now.
Ajay Kumar Jain : Okay. That was helpful and just in terms of the timing of the merger looks like you’re still targeting closing by the end of September and just wondering, does that seem like a realistic timeframe based on how things are going with the FTC process and is that really providing enough time to get the necessary shareholder approval?
Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Okay. That was helpful and just in terms of the timing of the merger looks like you’re still targeting closing by the end of September and just wondering, does that seem like a realistic timeframe based on how things are going with the FTC process and is that really providing enough time to get the necessary shareholder approval?
R. Chris Kreidler: Yes. We don’t need the shareholder approval on their side. They essentially have it whenever they need it, but we still believe it’s realistic timeframe. I think the way we would characterize our interactions with the FTC and the regulatory process that’s pretty much as expected. We don’t have any reason to believe that we will be significantly faster or slower than what we expected from the very beginning. So, we still think Q3 is realistic.
Ajay Kumar Jain : Okay. I just had one final question if I could. Can you just comment any further on inflation so far this quarter, I think Bill you talked about double-digit increases in certain categories, but just at an aggregate level of, how much is your cost of goods inflation right now compared to I guess it was around 1% from last quarter.
Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Okay. I just had one final question if I could. Can you just comment any further on inflation so far this quarter, I think Bill you talked about double-digit increases in certain categories, but just at an aggregate level of, how much is your cost of goods inflation right now compared to I guess it was around 1% from last quarter.
William J. DeLaney: Yes. We wouldn’t necessarily give you anything forward-looking. I know we’ve talked a little bit about April here and just because there is a trend in March we wanted to give you some color about what's going on with that trend? I think the way I characterize it, is we went from almost nothing which is at 1% to something. There are three very specific categories we called out that are kind of double-digit inflationary categories, but is built at the rest are really not an issue. They are either flat or even slightly down. So what average is out to certainly more than 1%, but that’s not all will say and it’s only April we’ve got a couple more months before we build out the quarter.
Ajay Kumar Jain – Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Great. Thank you.
Operator: We’ll now move to Mark Wiltamuth with Jeffries.
Mark G. Wiltamuth –: Hi, good morning. It’s Mark Wiltamuth at Jeffries. Is there any update for us on the net positivity you expect from business transformation? Now that you’ve changed the accounting a little bit on how the costs are going to be done?
Jefferies LLC: Hi, good morning. It’s Mark Wiltamuth at Jeffries. Is there any update for us on the net positivity you expect from business transformation? Now that you’ve changed the accounting a little bit on how the costs are going to be done?
R. Chris Kreidler:
 : What we are really talking about, what I refer to them the cost side. This is a long process and there is a lot going on and we are changing a lot. And as we go through this much change, we’re having to take new looks at how we allocate cost, how we think about expenses et cetera. So we had some restatements, we’ve talked about are not restatements, but adjusting the way we look at things and in this particular case we looked at the way we allocate our labor when we just said it is more precise to do with the new way. So I’ve got two choices, I either have to restate or give you a new look at the guidance, using the new methodology which is what we opted to do or we’ve to somehow go backward and tell you what it would have been in prior quarters, prior years and frankly that would have taken a lot more effort. So we are giving you a new set of guidance, based upon the new methodology. Our variance this year from the old guidance that $300 million to $350 million a year is really about half and half capitalization of labor and methodology change on how we actually account for the labor. So that’s the change frankly, if we did it under the old methodology we’d still be in the old guidance. So we are just changing the guidance, so we can report it differently going forward. It does not impact the benefits.
Mark G. Wiltamuth – Jefferies LLC: Okay, thank you. And on the point of attrition there’s been all this chatter in the marketplace on potential loss of some customers in reaction to the US Foods merger. Any color on what the customers are saying what you’ve been hearing from your side and is there any assurance that you’re still retaining the customers on the US Foods side?
William J. DeLaney: Again, we are not going to comment on the US Foods side. But I would tell you from our perspective, we’ve had an opportunity, very senior levels of management to speak with, virtually all of our top customers and at the local level our Presidents and VPs and salesmen out talking to many of their customers as well. And I think as time is going on people – we have been able to explain the reasons for the merger and the opportunities. And some of the challenges will come with that early days and transition and that kind of things. So I would characterize the visits with the customers out from our perspective is very constructive, largely supported. And there were a lot of questions as you can imagine one of their key questions is to what extent will this disrupt service that type of thing as we go through the transition. And obviously that is a big priority for us to minimize that type of things. So – so far I would say we had very good visits with our customers.
Mark G. Wiltamuth – Jefferies LLC: Okay, and then on the US Foods side, are they on the same ERP system as you. And how do you feel like that will go on transition in your system?
R. Chris Kreidler: Yes, they are not on our old system which was a kind of customized proprietary system for Sysco. They had their own somewhat customized proprietary system. They are not on SAP either. So the way we looked at this, and I think we talked about this a little bit is, each company has its system. We are moving towards SAP as a unifying system. We do believe and we asked it publicly that we think it’s the right system for the combined entities post merger and so we will have to build the bridge, so that both systems can communicate and talk to each other in the near and medium term and then a new road map to eventually get it all to the new ERP platform overtime.
Mark G. Wiltamuth –: Okay, thank you very much.
Jefferies LLC: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) We’ll now move to John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.
Unidentified Analyst: Good morning, thanks it’s (indiscernible) for John. I guess the first question, you touched on a little bit, but would that say, P and I think 10 facilities now, it would seem like it would have a pretty decent sample size to compared to the baseline OPCOs, so I was just hoping maybe you could provide some more texture around where some of the most meaningful differentiation is coming versus the OPCOs that don’t have the systems? Is it on a profitability side? Is it in case volume growth? Are you just generally getting better customer feedback around the execution, just some color around that would be great?
William J. DeLaney: Yes, I would say 10 companies, well we are pleased with that, the scheme of 70 is still early days, and our focus is, as I pointed out in my comments over the last six to 12 months has been more about stabilizing the system and improving the performances. And we see that in those companies, so on the sale side in terms of the speed of the system that type of thing, we made a lot of very good strides there. Our service levels continue to improve and get toward the level of our legacy companies if you will. We saw a lot of opportunities to manage the inventory more efficiently and effectively and we are working on some things there. So we are pleased with the progress that we are making, but I wouldn’t want to get into discussion relative to the legacy companies because it’s still earlier days.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, and then I just changing gears a little bit, we don’t haven’t talked about in a lot recently, but I guess where from your perspective obviously you have many things going on right now. But where is Sysco ventures might fit in terms of your priorities, from a longer-term perspective especially given the fact that with the scale that you have – you probably have a trove of information about what’s working on restaurant customers’ menus from both the sales and profitability standpoint. So it seems like it’d be – something that could be a pretty major differentiation for you versus maybe other competitors in the space?
William J. DeLaney: We think, ventures is a key strategic opportunity for us. We are beginning to gain traction and we put together the platform with the company called Leapset about a year-ago. We’ve rolled out certain solutions in certain markets we are seeing some progress there. We still have a big opportunity here to get it more integrated into the business. We’ve made some progress there and working with several solutions, there are more solutions to come. So I would agree with you that with this merger it give us an even stronger platform in terms of customers to leverage this capability and to build stronger more effective relationships with a greater number of customers. So it’s a key part of our strategy, and I think, as we get deeper into the merger planning work, we’ll be able to speak more specifically in terms of work structure and that type of things in terms of how we are going to drive it out.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay great and just lastly in terms of the CapEx, I guess Chris directionally going forward, obviously you’ve got the merger going on but with some of the fleet optimization initiatives, and maybe with some of the business transformation initiatives being completed. Is CapEx directionally likely to step-down from that $500 million to $550 net of asset sales? Or is it something that kind of like a stable level of investment that’s going to be on going?
R. Chris Kreidler: It is a good question. Our goal has not been on a specific dollar amount of more around the 1% to 1.2% of sales, which we rapidly approaching and so when we get to that level and preferably the lower end of that level we’ll feel like we’ve got the right amount of base capital that should be able to grow every year as we grow the business through volume growth. Now overlay that the merger and yes, we’ve got to take a new look at that we are. We’ve got a lot of people working through what that’s going to mean in terms of, what I’ll call one-time capital to make the networks work well together. Toast with that we’ll have to reevaluate. I got a personal believe that we should be able to get long-term run rate capital down to the low end of our range if not even slightly below that range is based upon scale. But that remains to be proven out in several years off.
Unidentified Analyst: Very helpful, thank you.
Operator: We’ll now move to Erin Lash with Morningstar.
Erin Lash – Morningstar Research: Thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to touch on some of the – has been the two had been doing and your partnership with Robert Irvine over the past couple of years and how effective that has been or maybe hasn’t been?
William J. DeLaney: Hi Erin, look we think it’s been very effective in the year two, right now, with chef Irvine and as we’ve talked about in the past one the reasons, we partnered with him and through Network is roughly 70% of our customers tune into that Network on a regular basis and in particular watch his shows. So he has been a great ambassador for Sysco both through the Network as well as personal appearances and working with our OPCOs and doing some nice work as well in the communities. So we are very pleased with that partnership and we’ve got some new ads that are going to be coming out this year. And I think, you’ll continue to see is a significant positive for us from a marketing standpoint.
R. Chris Kreidler: I also say it’s given our marketing associates a lot to be excited about we get that feedback constantly from our MAs so that positive is well for our system.
Erin Lash – Morningstar Research: Thank you, that’s very helpful. And then I just wanted to ask about, the Sysco brand overall, and I think you are going to make some investments behind this Sysco brand and how to better to help that I think in front of customers and I was wondering what kind of the mixes between the Sysco brand and private label and how those affect our progressing?
William J. DeLaney: You’re talking about the product brand or the corporate brand, Erin?
Erin Lash – Morningstar Research: The product within the product sales?
William J. DeLaney: Yes, I think what you are referring to us over the last year you’re seeing the numbers pick-up a little bit in terms of the street are the local and that’s been good. But I would also quickly say, as we go through and do the category management work and our customer insights work, we are trying to strike the right balance between what customers want and need, and how our brand line is up with that as opposed to just trying to push our brand out there for the second push in the brand. So I’m actually very pleased with the work that’s been done in the merchandised area over the last couple of three years in terms of going through and looking at all the specs in our various categories, as we even we before the category management work started but in conjunction without now as well as combining that with our customer insight work so, we don’t have a particular number in mind necessarily we are just trying to strike the right balance with our customers where we really do have a value-added product, we wanted to make sure that we’re positioning it properly.
Erin Lash – Morningstar Research: Thank you very much.
William J. DeLaney: Thank you Erin.
Operator: It does appear there are no further questions, and at this time, I’d like to thank everyone for their participation. You may now disconnect.

Bill DeLaney III: Thanks Neil. Hello, everyone and thank you for joining us today. This morning Sysco reported second quarter sales of $11.2 billion, the net earnings of $211 million. Adjusted EPS excluding certain items was $0.40 for the quarter, which was flat compared to the prior year. Market conditions continued to be challenging for many of our customers and competitive pressure remains acute. These conditions were amplified in December by a shortened holiday shopping season and severe weather in several areas of the country. The casual dining restaurant segment was especially impacted experiencing flat year-over-year sales during the quarter as high average check amounts could only offset the impact of declining traffic. Notwithstanding the ongoing challenging market conditions, we grew our sales 4% over the prior year in the second quarter through both case volume growth and acquisitions. We continued to drive solid growth through our large national and regional customers, while our business for locally managed customers remained soft. We are seeing reasonably strong growth with locally managed customers in our Southwest market, while underlying market conditions are particularly difficult in our Northeast and Mid-East markets. Operating income fell short of our expectations for the quarter. Expense management was strong once again this quarter is evidenced by cost per case in our Broadline business being significantly lower than the prior year, but sluggish sales growth with our locally managed customers and ongoing gross margin pressure more than offset those gains. We have implemented several short-term actions steps and longer term strategic initiatives to both accelerate our locally managed sales growth and mitigate the ongoing gross margin pressures that we have experienced in recent quarters. These actions are gaining traction within our company and we are targeting gradual improvement in these areas through the balance of calendar year 2014 and beyond. At the same time, we anticipate our expense management performance will remain solid as we make additional progress in our productivity improvements and operations over the next several months. While the year-over-year over benefits of our SG&A cost reduction initiatives begin to plateau. In summary, calendar year 2013 was one of the most difficult years in recent history for our industry and we struggle to leverage our sales growth. While weather conditions have been quite severe thus far this quarter, we believe the market conditions will improve nicely in calendar year 2014 and then Sysco's operating performance results will show steady improvement as well. Turning to our technology transformation, as we discussed last quarter, our teams have invested significant effort to prepare needed updates to the SAP software to improve both stability and scalability. Last October, we implement performance enhancement that meaningfully improve system capacity utilization as well as functional enhancements and improved order management and other processes. Encouraged by the success of these changes, we resumed our deployment rollout at our Boise, Idaho operating company back in November. System performance in Boise was favorable upon Goliath and in a weak sense. And importantly, the recently implemented system enhancements have successfully addressed challenges that have previously impacted our large regional and national contract customers. This success provided us the confidence to convert two additional locations Phoenix and Las Vegas at the end of January. These deployments are an important test to both the stability of our SAP solution and our ability to successfully deploy multiple larger size OPCOs simultaneously. But, we are pleased with our progress over the last year, we are working hard to further optimize our SAP solution in the days ahead. In February, additional updates are scheduled to be implemented that are intended to further improve system stability and scalability. These changes include simplification of the dynamic pricing and purchase order processes. While we continue to monitor progress in the eight facilities now live on the SAP platform as well as performance following the enhancement schedule to take place later this month. Excuse me, let me say it again. While we continue to monitor progress in the eight facilities now live in the SAP platform as well as performance following the enhancement schedule to take place later this month depending upon success of these next important steps, we would expect to launch two additional facilities by the end of the fiscal year. We also continue to move forward with our category management initiative. The majority of wave 1 categories have now been launched and we expect the wave 2 categories to launch during the second half of fiscal 2014. We are applying learnings to the process as we move forward and have seen some improvement in execution and performance recently. We will continue to monitor performance in these categories and remain confident in both the benefits that category management provide our customers and the savings we will revise over the next few years. We also have multiple initiatives underway targeted at lowering operating cost. While we have previously discussed extensively the SG&A cost reduction initiatives, we also have several efforts underway to reduce cost and improved productivity in our warehouse and delivery operations. Broadening optimization initiatives are underway in several of our largest operating companies. We expect to implement in the coming weeks a new warehouse scorecard to drive enhanced performance and accountability and are developing a similar scorecard for delivery operations. Our consolidated parts procurement program has been implemented across the entire United States. We have negotiated a universal contract to procure forklift equipment resulting in significant savings on this category equipment. And we also have undertaken an initiative to right-size our fleet. To-date we have identified 700 pieces of equipment to eliminate and expecting to complete a total elimination of 1500 pieces of equipment. This will reduce our maintenance cost, title on registration expenses, ongoing capital requirements and optimize our overall fleet age. Turning briefly to an update on the proposed merger with the U.S. Foods, last month we announced several key decisions regarding the integration planning leadership structure. We have formed a steering committee, which I will chair and is comprised of a joint team, the senior executives for both Sysco and U.S. Foods. The role of the steering committee will be to oversee the integration planning work and approve key decisions. Chris Kreidler has been appointed to lead the integration planning work. Because of his strong business and financial capabilities, Chris is well-suited to provide the leadership, valuable skills and perspective that will be required to successfully bring both companies together. In addition to his integration planning leadership responsibilities, Chris will continue in his current role as Chief Financial Officer. The integration planning process will consist of four major tracks of order, Greg Bertrand, Senior Vice President of Foodservice Operations has been appointed to lead the sales, merchandising and operations integration planning tracks. And David Schreibman, U.S. Foods Executive Vice President of Strategy will lead the corporate functions integration planning track. We are moving forward quickly along the path of planning for eventual integration and Chris will provide more details on our progress in a few moments. In closing, these are both exciting and challenging times for Sysco. We are beginning to see many of our transformational changes take hold and we now look forward to the U.S. Foods merger as the next step in our transformation. Enhancing our ability to serve our customers, strength and supply our partnerships and further engage our employees. Sysco is unique in its ability to make these types of significant investments which we believe will create a compelling opportunity over time for all stakeholders. We are focused on driving out this change in a manner that contributes to the success of our customers and suppliers and we appreciate the dedication of our Sysco employees. Now, I will turn things over to Chris, so he can provide additional details on our financial results for the second quarter as well as the merger and integration planning work.
Chris Kreidler: Thanks Bill, and good morning, everyone. For the second quarter sales were $11.2 billion or an increase of 4.1% compared to the prior year mainly due to case volume growth about half of which came from acquisitions. Case volume increased 4.3% for the quarter and case volume excluding acquisitions increased 2.7%. Inflation increased sales 0.8% and changes in foreign exchange rates decreased sales by 0.6%. Gross margin in the second quarter increased 0.7% and gross margin declined 60 basis points to 17.48%, due mainly to continued weakness in locally managed sales, the difficult business environment and competitive pressures. In addition, sales to large regional and national customers are growing faster than local business and this mix shift drove about one-quarter of the gross margin decline during the quarter. Operating expenses increased $44 million or 2.8% in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 compared to the prior year period. Approximately $30 million of this year-over-year variance was driven by operating expense from acquired companies. In addition, certain items totaled $33 million during the quarter an increase of $12 million over the same quarter last year. Certain items this quarter included a $24 million increase in the estimate for Sysco's self-insurance reserve of $4 million or $4 million in merger related costs and $5 million in other restructuring cost. If we exclude certain items and the impact of acquisitions, operating expenses were flat year-over-year. Business transformation expenses were lower in the second quarter compared to last year by $18 million and are lowered by $29 million for the first half of the year. However, expenses in the second half of the fiscal year are expected to be similar to the prior year, as a result we continue to expect total business transformation expenses for the year to be inline with our guidance of $300 million to $350 million, albeit at the lower end of that range. Similar to last year, we continued to see business transformation benefits driving down our operating expenses, mainly in the areas of sales, IT and retirement related expenses. And we expect benefits from category management and operation initiatives to build as we move forward. As a result of the benefits generated from our transformation initiatives cost per case performance in our Broadline operation was significantly better than last year's second quarter declining $0.11 compared to the prior year. For the first half of the year cost per case declined $0.10 compared to the prior year. As we discussed last quarter, we don't anticipate maintaining this rate of improvement as we lapped the point at which we began some of these initiatives last year but we remain confident in meeting or exceeding our objective of $0.05 decline for the full fiscal year. In spite of the continued progress on our business transformation initiatives, continued weakness in the underlying business resulted in a decline in operating income of 8.1% year-over-year. Net earnings for the second quarter were $211 million, a decrease of $11 million or 4.8% compared to the prior year. Diluted EPS was $0.36 a 5.3% decrease compared to the prior year. Adjusting for certain items which mainly related to an increase in estimated self insurance reserves diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.40 which was flat compared to the prior year. As we have discussed on previous calls we believe it is important to focus on the performance of our underlying business which excludes certain items as well as business transformation expenses. To summarize the performance of our underlying business, adjusted operating expenses increased 3.4%, adjusted operating income decreased 7.6%, adjusted net earnings declined 4.4% and adjusted EPS declined 4.1% to $0.47. One housekeeping item to mention, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 Sysco changed its classification of certain inter-company purchases related to our FreshPoint and meat companies from the previous classification used in fiscal 2013. This change impacted gross profit and operating expense that had no impact on operating income or net earnings. In our press release this morning you will find a table showing the impact of these reclassifications to prior year results for fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012. Turning to the impact of the business transformation project for a moment, in the second quarter project expenses totaled $63 million and we capitalized $10 million related to the project. We expect to maintain this level of capital spending in the third and fourth quarters due to ongoing work to enhance the stability and scalability of the system. As a result, we expect total capital spending related to business transformation to be $30 million to $40 million for fiscal year 2014, this is an update to our previous guidance. Total capital expenditures were $135 million for the second quarter this year compared to $106 million last year. We continue to expect total capital spending to be in the range of $550 million to $600 million for the fiscal 2014 year. However, after including anticipated proceed from asset sales, net capital spending will be in the range of $500 million to $550 million. Free cash flow was $167 million for the quarter increasing substantially over the prior year period mainly due to improvements in working capital performance. For the first half of the year free cash flow increased 64% to $211 million. Now I'd like to turn for a few minutes to a discussion of our proposed merger with U.S. Foods. In December, we announced our plan to merge with U.S. Foods in a cash and stock deal valued at $8.2 billion. This is an extremely important and exciting combination that we anticipate will generate at least $600 million in synergies over three to four years. As Bill motioned last month we announced the steering committee has been formed comprised of a joint team of senior executives from both Sysco and U.S. Foods and the integration planning leadership had been determined. Our integration planning team is comprised of leaders from both Sysco and U.S. Foods. We are focused on planning how we will operate as one company and better serve our customers. Our integration planning efforts has three primary goals day one readiness, value creation and long-term organizational design. We're off to a good start and we look forward to working with our U.S. Foods' colleagues on the merger integration planning as we determine how to bring together the best of both these two great companies. As we've discussed, we expect a thorough regulatory review to take place over the next six to nine months and we recently learned that the FTC will be the agency leading the regulatory review for the government. As part of the merger consideration Sysco will assume or refinance all of U.S. Foods net debt of approximately $4.7 billion. We have begun to take the steps necessary to secure financing to do that as well as hedge the interest rate risk between now and closing. In December, we secured fully committed bridge financing which will be available upon closing to fund the acquisition and refinance U.S. Food's debt. Shortly thereafter, U.S. Foods obtained consent from holders of their 8.5% notes to waive a provision that would have an effect require Sysco to purchase the notes upon a change of control. This consent allowed us to reduce the bridge facility to $3.4 billion thereby reducing our financing cost. At the end of January, we amended our revolving credit facility to increase the amounts available to us by $500 million to $1.5 billion and last week we entered into agreements to hedge the interest rate risk on $2 billion of the permanent financing. In closing, while the challenging business environment in the food service industry continues to impact our customers and our financial results. We remain encouraged by the progress of our efforts to transform the way we do business. We strongly believe that the investments we are making in our business are vital to our future success and position us extraordinarily well for the future. The proposed merger steps up the momentum for change and provide many additional exciting opportunities for Sysco and the industry. With that operator, we'll now take questions.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And we'll take John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities: Bill, a couple of things, one thing I may missed I may not have heard. You talked about some of the actions you're taking on the cost side, but you also mentioned actions taken to drive street sales or street cases? What specifically are you doing there?
Bill DeLaney III: Yes. John, good morning. Well, as I said we're doing several things. I think what I said was we got a lot going on both on the cost side as you point out as well as addressing what our biggest challenge is right now driving sales on the locally managed business as well as addressing margin and those two as you well know are very unrelated. In the short-term, we've revised our comp plan for MAs about a year ago and that's pretty well fully implemented now in the States and in process in Canada. There is an element of that today that we didn't have before it's not overly significant but it's meaningful which is predicated upon growing cases we just finished up another new account promotion. So we see opportunities to kind of get back in a more regular coordination of business -- new business promotions penetration promotions both with our local marketing people as well as from a national perspective. We got as you can appreciate a lot of pretty comprehensive margin management training going on in the company at various level both locally as well as coming out of our corporate offices in terms of how do we optimize this whole challenge of quality growth with managing margin. Those are initiatives that kicked off in a bigger way here in the fall. So those will be three that I mentioned the short-term that we think we'll pay dividends for us here to some extent, they're already helping, but I think we'll pay bigger dividends for the second half of the fiscal year. Beyond that John I think the others are more along these lines of the strategic initiatives we have been talking to you about which is we're doing a lot more work in marketing in terms of gaining objective custom insights, our CRM tools is further along in terms of implementation. We really do believe CatMan is going to help us a lot once that matures both on the sales side as well as on the margin side, it should be win-win for us and our suppliers and our customers. And we got some other things going that are more pilot stages with revenue management inside sales platform that type of thing and beyond that Sysco ventures are still something out there we continue to grow and we believe long-term will give us opportunity to create traction with our customers. So many of these are more medium term, but as I said, we have heightened up the intensity on some of those short-term initiatives.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities: So this is a follow up to that, you said 25% of the margin pressure was mix. So if you look at the others and this is probably hard to tell precisely but if you look at the other 75%, how much of that do you think is proactive, you're doing something versus reactive when you're responding to somebody else? And then the parts that proactive again how do you get your arms around that these are productive efforts right when you look at gross profit dollar performance?
Bill DeLaney III: Yes. Let me take a shot and if I'm not giving to John, just clear about your question a little bit more so. Look so I'd say over the last year, year and a half we've attributed a third to a quarter of the margin erosion to mix because of the larger customers are growing faster. The rest of it, it is difficult to quantify. Obviously, the way our business model works we can't just look at gross margin we have to look at our expenses as well. So we are definitely going to fight very hard for the cases we have today as well as continue to find ways to grow with our existing customers in our new prospects as well. So I think where we're at right now in this process is I look at even early numbers this quarter is we're beginning to get smarter I think and a little bit more cohesive at the local level and making the right trade offs between volume and margin management. But the reality in this business for us is we need to grow the local business we need to grow the street business and that will contribute significantly to our gross profit dollar growth. We just got to be smart and balanced in how we do it. And so I think we're making strides there, you didn't really see here in the second quarter I think you will see some improvement here in the second half of the year as far as the margin management goes.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities: And just lastly then, do you think giving the industry as a whole is behaving rationally in terms of balancing margin and case volume?
Bill DeLaney III: That's one of those great questions I don't know if I can answer as well as anyone of us would like. I think as I said the competitive environment is very acute as we've talked about a lot in the past in presentations and calls like this. There is some growth we believe -- we believe the market grew somewhat in 2013 we'll fine tune those numbers and hopefully talk more about it. At CAGNY, we don't think there was a lot of growth and we were able to take some share but we invested in that to some extent. I think that's rational from our perspective because in the end I think for our medium and long-term success it's important to continue to grow. There certainly are pockets of activity out there where there is some behavior that probably isn't the smartest as it could be. But overall, given the environment I think it's reasonably rational right now. It's just very competitive.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities: Thanks.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Karen Short with Deutsche Bank.
Karen Short - Deutsche Bank: Hi. Just turning to cost per case expectations for the full year, I guess your full year expectations kind of reflect flat cost per case in the second half. So I know you've discussed this in the past, but I guess I am wondering with a successful kind of wave 1 behind you, wave 2 about to begin and three more OPCO conversions by year-end. Why wouldn't you continue to see improvements in cost per case for the back half?
Chris Kreidler: Hi, Karen. I think we will continue to see improvements in cost per case in the back half. What we're really commenting to is the fact that we're going to be lapping some significant work that was begun last year. So the quarter-over-quarter performance is not going to feel as good as the first half year of the year. We do think we'll be down at least a nickel, I think I admitted this time it will probably exceed a nickel a case as we look at the full year and we're just not necessarily giving a higher exact number to that right now.
Bill DeLaney III: I think Karen, let me just add. When we talk about cost per case, we're talking about operating cost. So we definitely are seeing reduction in cost per case for the CatMan work and we expect that to continue.
Karen Short - Deutsche Bank: Okay. And any color on wave 1 in terms of how your customers are reacting to the initiative? And any color you could give on what they benefit to gross profit or COGS could have been as a result?
Bill DeLaney III: I think it's still reasonably early in the wave 1 cycle, but I would tell you I think our execution, I think, we alluded to this in our comments. I think we are improving our execution there in terms of how we do the conversions, the cadence of the conversions and addressing these opportunities in the most productive way possible with our customers. So I think we've had some challenges with the pilot categories on volume at times. We're starting to see some improvement on wave 1. We continue to see, like I said, significant improvement on our cost of goods which was driving most of the economics on this initiative.
Karen Short - Deutsche Bank: Okay. And then just last question. Obviously inflation came down this quarter which was pretty widely expected but any comments on your outlook for the third quarter and beyond, I mean there is a lot of noise with the drought in California and protein inflation and things like that?
Bill DeLaney III: Yes, I was actually a little surprised with how much it came down. And we hit about one point of inflation which was kind of low. So I'd say sitting here today depending I'm not going to project impact of weather and that kind of thing that's difficult to do. But I would expect it to remain pretty modest somewhere in that 1% to 2% range but we'll have to see.
Chris Kreidler: Most of the external stuff that we read Karen is probably the same as you read expected to kind of go back to a more normal range whether its bills one to two or I guess what the others say out there two to three but we would expect it to be a little higher than where it is today. It's a hard thing to predict as last year or may be 18 months ago remember we had a drought everybody was expecting food cost inflation to go through the roof again and we never saw that materialize.
Karen Short - Deutsche Bank: Right. Okay. Thanks that's helpful.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Mark Wiltamuth of Jefferies.
Mark Wiltamuth - Jefferies: Hi, good morning. On your comment that the sales slowed throughout the end of the quarter, how much of that was really the calendar and the weather? And did you see any snap back as you got into January results?
Bill DeLaney III: I think the calendar was certainly part of it Mark, and we did have some weather, it was last couple of weeks in December. I think that impacted us in certain parts of the country. So I would say it's hard to put a number to it but I would say part of the slowdown was that – we had pretty good growth in the second quarter last year. So when you look at comps – and we are talking about deltas of 2% or 3% case growth here. So if it goes off a point that's 50% of the delta. So I'd say it's a little bit of – comps are little more soft but we definitely saw a fall-off in December and certainly from what we see and what we read. I think you'd have to attribute a fair amount of that to the weather. We knew the calendar but we still saw a little more than what we expected to see. I hate talking about weather especially in winter. We just had our market presence in here couple of weeks ago and really didn't want to hear a lot about weather. But I will tell you weather has been pretty brutal here first four, five weeks that we've had. Four of the five weeks I think have been very difficult last week in particular. You see the weather reports, we had issues throughout the southeast. We didn't ship in New Orleans. You saw the reports in Atlanta. The good news is its January and early February so March is a key part of this quarter and we still have an opportunity to make some of that back. But I'd say weather has impacted us quite a bit so far in January, early February.
Mark Wiltamuth - Jefferies: Okay. And on the gross margin weakness did you have any pressure on the meats categories, red meat was a pressure for at least one of your smaller competitors out there?
Bill DeLaney III: I can't tell you as any more pronounced in that areas and any place because obviously those are high dollar boxes so you kind of get somewhat competitive depending on the size of the customer. But I wouldn't attribute any particular piece of it to meat category.
Mark Wiltamuth - Jefferies: Okay. And for Chris, is there anyway you can give us a rough idea of what kind of interest rate we should be looking at for the big refinancing for the U.S. Foods deal?
Chris Kreidler: No. I wish I knew myself our strategy as I talked a little bit about it to hedge interest rates, but I mean this environment we've chosen to basically hedge about half, which means if they continue to languish or indeed decline, we won't give away all the benefit, if they go up, we're partially hedged. So that's kind of where we're hanging out right now. We'll continue to evaluate the markets as well as the yield curve going forward and look for an opportune time to lock in and obviously we've got to get much further along in the deal process and the regulatory approval process as well, but right now, I can't give you much more guidance.
Mark Wiltamuth - Jefferies: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Andrew Wolf with BB&T Capital Markets.
Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets: Good morning. You sounded kind of optimistic about this year market conditions restaurants are getting may be back to positive traffic. I just wanted to ask you to explain a little about what you're thinking there sort of generally why you might think that? And then secondly, as part of the same question, have you seen you just talked about Atlanta and what's going on there but between the fourth quarter and the recent snow events and cold weather in the east, have you seen a bigger variance in the performance between places that had normal weather out west let's say versus the east you could share with us that might give us a sense if that is the case?
Bill DeLaney III: Andy, I will. So, let me start with the second one. I tried to give you a little color on that in my prepared comments. And so right now yes, I'm looking very hard at the West because we haven't seen that kind of weather out there. So we're seeing, I think, I called out the Southwest and to be fair I'd say the Southwest, if you go back the last two or three years has been probably the strongest part of the market. If you look at some of the more industry-wide survey work that's done on consumers, the Southwest shows up quite strong. And I would say right now we're trending -- it's hard to do this Andy because I have to adjust for that variability you were alluding to, in terms of our individual performances. But I'd say, if I just look at the West right now, things are a little bit better there, which gives me the confidence that some of this actually, clearly is being driven by weather in terms of early days here in this quarter. So with that said, the other thing I called out was, we've seen now for several quarters that the Northeast and what we call our Mid-East markets have seen more pronounced sluggishness and it's not to say we don't have opportunities to execute better in those markets but at the same time when I look at them across that entire geography that seems to be a tougher part of the country in terms of growth right now. As far as why I'm optimistic, I would say it's interesting when you read all these reports that some of you published and that we all read, the state of mind consumers is reasonably good right now. The state of mind of our customers is reasonably good, when you look at forward-looking feelings about the future. So any time people are optimistic, that gives you reason to be optimistic, and that's part of it. I think there's some technical issues that are somewhat clouded by the weather right now with some of the tax hits that the consumer took early last year that I'm hopeful that those will turn into positives here as we get towards spring and into summer. So I think the mindset is better and it's fragile. I'm not going to kid you on that. And when you look at the economic data, it's good at a certain level of macro and not so good in our piece of the industry, but I'm basically going off of, some of the sentiment surveys that we see in terms of the consumer, some technical things that we see in terms of what happened last year, early part of the calendar year. And I would say, even though we're somewhat challenged here in terms of our performance for the quarter, haven't had a chance to talk to a lot of our people, I think we really believe that we are gaining traction on our initiatives and that we will see improvement here as we get deeper into the calendar year. Was that good?
Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets: It's interesting, do have any, and last question but it's a follow on to what you just answered. Do you have a sense of the same store sales for your independence and is that something also you have by geography? And could also shed light on in the context of regional variance?
Bill DeLaney III: I don't have a great sense of that. We will obviously have our sales data where we can look at that at various levels of details in terms of what we call penetration that doesn't tell you what the accounts same-store sales are right? I would tell you it varies. So whether you're talking big change, or whether you're talking about more street oriented type of operators, the stronger operators I think are holding up reasonably well in this kind of market and the people that are more on the margin are struggling more. So we see a fair amount of variability across customers as it relates to penetration. My best judgment and I don't have any data on this Andy is that it's reasonably flat right out in terms of restaurant sales overall, same-store sales. I think if you – some change, we're doing better than others obviously.
Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Ajay Jain with Cantor Fitzgerald.
Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald: Hi, good morning. I had a variation of some of the previous questions, but it's more specific to the outlook for the current quarter. I think at least some of the casual dining names, it looks like traffic was down significantly in December. I think it even turned negative in a few cases. So my guess is that that trend probably continued into January because of some of the cabin fever or weather-related issues that you talked about. And then it looks like you're also getting the benefit of some inflation and you talked about inflation a little earlier. But I think some of the government data suggests some deflation over the last three of four months. So from your prepared comments, it sounds like you are more optimistic about sales trends for calendar 2014. But do you foresee potential for incremental volume weakness in the current quarter from the combination of even potentially deflationary pressure or and also sort of the continuation of some of the weather-related impact? Thanks.
Bill DeLaney III: Yes. Good morning, Ajay. I would – I think I'm on at that thing, well, I tried to get across to my comments. I'm pretty cautious on this quarter right now on the top line just given what we have been dealing with the first four or five weeks. As I said, the March drives this particular quarter. So if we catch up a break with the weather and maybe we've seen the worst of it. In terms of parts of the country where you don't expect to see this kind of weather that's really the issue. So when weather affects us is when you have these freezers and snowstorms in the Southeast and the Southwest that's a problem, okay. When they carry into April that's a problem, when they started early November that's a problem. Winters going to be winter in the Northeast and the Mid-West and we understand that. So I'm somewhat cautious because of the weather and how we started out this quarter. But, there is still a lot of good weeks ahead of us in terms of volume as we get toward later part of February and March. I'm more optimistic on the year just for reasons I discussed earlier there I think the consumer is in a better place and I think with the break here and there that's going to be good for our customers and we are very well-positioned to leverage that terms of our business. Deflation, we're not always seeing deflation. We are seeing categories that are maybe down a little bit, up a little bit. We have got some inflation in meat and seafood I think going right now. So deflation would not be good for us. Again, what we – was more ideal for us would be to have that inflation number get back around 2 maybe even a little bit higher that gives us a little more room to maneuver in terms of our expense management and at the same time work with our customers and the way that they can handle the cost increases. So deflation would not be good but I don't necessarily think we are looking at deflation. I think we are looking at as we said earlier moderate inflation continuing.
Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald: Great. Thank you.
Bill DeLaney III: Thank you.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Meredith Adler with Barclays. And your line is open. Please check your mute button. Again, check your mute button, your line is open. Due to the silence on this line we will take our next question from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.
John Ivankoe - JPMorgan: Hi. Thank you. The question is how your customers might be responding to the merger, or I guess the news of the merger. I mean is it situation, I guess FTC excluded one plus one could equal two or do you sound some nervousness of your – within your customer base or consolidation of power and that's the case what will you do maybe differently in six to nine months to retain some business that some of your competition might otherwise be trying to get?
Bill DeLaney III: Good morning, John. Look, I would say this, from the day one of the announcements through today and going forward to close and then beyond close, certainly one of our big goals here is to have a very active, effective communication program with all of our stakeholders. So it's our customers, our suppliers, our associates, shareholders, government media all that type of things. So we are early days of dealing with that. We are in constant contact with our customers. We have equipped our OPCO presidents and there sales leadership with pieces to communicate with the local chefs associations, restaurant associations. So I would characterize that early days as we got good ongoing discussions with our customers, certainly there is some that have some concerns we work through those. I would say many are excited to understand what the benefits are. And how long it will take to close and when will all that happen. And I would say largely customers are pretty open minded and they are looking for those benefits. So whether it's going to enhance their business from – how they might order product with us or wider assortment of innovative products. The fact that we will take cost out of the system over time how that translates to their opportunity to work with Sysco. Those are all things that we are taking with our customers about. We clearly see this as a very good thing for our customers, frankly I see this as a very good thing for the industry over time and certainly we will see as a good thing for Sysco. So I think generally it's very open-minded and constructive. Obviously, there are some people out there that don't like this, they tend to be more on the competitive side of the ball and they are having those types of conversations and we are addressing that as appropriate.
John Ivankoe - JPMorgan: Thank you.
Bill DeLaney III: Thank you.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Meredith Adler with Barclays.
Meredith Adler - Barclays: Thanks for taking my question. First, I just would like to talk a little bit about how much of that category management are done with -- finished wave 1. I think you made some comments about what the impact was, you think it's recovering. Could you just be more specific about what happens with revenues or customer reaction, with the category management?
Bill DeLaney III: Yes. I will take a shot at that Meredith. So essentially the whole idea of category management is to optimize the assortment of pricing theory in an effort to help our customers optimize and enhance the products that are available to them as well. Along the lines, we certainly see opportunities here to enhance our relationships with our suppliers and prove product development innovation and reduce our SKUs where that make sense. And to take cost out of the system as relates to our cost of good. The challenge as you would expect as you go into something like this is the conversion process. So I would say to you in the pilot wave or pilot categories there was four of them. We did a very good job working with our suppliers; we did a very good job identifying opportunities for cost savings and we are realizing those. What we are learning as we go is to strike the right balance in terms of the cadence and the conversions with our customers and to make sure we are equipping all operating companies' sales management and the MAs with the tools that they need to have the conversations about conversions with the customers in the right place. So where we are making process at this point I think it's on the conversion and we expect to continue make process as we get deeper in wave 1 and wave 2.
Meredith Adler - Barclays: So when you say you are running more about how to do the conversions, does that mean that there was unhappiness initially?
Bill DeLaney III: Meredith, anytime you sit down with a human being and tell them they are – and you got an idea and you are going to ask them to change what they are doing, there is some challenges to that. So I would say yes, as we got into it, even though we have done I think a tremendous job in terms of developing the communication pieces training our people there is always the dynamic that you deal with across the table from a customer. So we ran into some challenges there. We still have them. But, I would say this in a more straightforward way as I can. It's really more about just making sure, since the conversion is relevant to that customer many of them are. We are not converting every item for every customer. But to make sure that we are having good constructive dialog in terms of why it's different for the consumer. And as you play that out over 7,000 territories with 10s of 1000s of customers and something you have done for the first time certainly there are challenges. But, I would tell you again, I'm seeing improvement on that and performance there as we get into wave 1 and expected to continue to improve.
Meredith Adler - Barclays: Okay. Thank you. And then another just sort of food question that confirms something Chris said about the cost per case, I think you set down 5%, I wasn't sure if he was saying down 5% for second half or down 5% for the full year?
Chris Kreidler: Meredith, I actually said down $0.05 per case will be down at least –
Meredith Adler - Barclays: $0.05?
Chris Kreidler: $0.05 per case for the full year.
Meredith Adler - Barclays: Okay. And this, do you include the pension change as part of the cost per case?
Chris Kreidler: Yes. That's an all end case per case.
Operator: And we will take our next question with Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse.
Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse: Yes. Good morning guys.
Bill DeLaney III: Good morning.
Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse: I just have a – I guess a lot of my questions are sort of around modeling and how I think about the back of the year. But, the first one is on mix and I guess the impact of negative mix on sales which seems this quarter to be higher, I only say that because we sort of like try to figure out what your volume growth is based on the data points you give, right. We would come up with a lower number by about 70 basis points. We are not typically that high. So is the negative impact and mix accelerating and then would you expect it to stay at this level or could it even be higher?
Bill DeLaney III: I'm going to start and then let Chris do that. I can't speak to the modeling part of that. I would say it's not accelerating. What I would say is, as we said in our prepared comments, we are still seeing good growth with a larger customers regional and national customers. We are just not seeing enough growth here on the local side. But I wouldn't say that it accelerated at all.
Chris Kreidler: I'm not sure. I can add a lot. Your question was negative mix on sales, correct?
Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse: Correct. You know, Chris, it's just that if I think about your dollar sales and I adjust for acquisitions and I adjust for inflation, right, I'm going to come out with a 2% volume growth number, right? You get 2.7.
Chris Kreidler: Right.
Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse: 70 basis points it's bigger than what its been historically and I'm trying to figure out if that is the number I should be using going forward?
Chris Kreidler: Yes. We had that conversation before. I understand that how folks come up with what I get, they call real growth and that's just not a number that we would ever – put much credence in, which is why we start giving you actual case volumes. So that number is going to move around for a variety of different reasons. And we frankly just don't track it.
Bill DeLaney III: I would say the bigger issue on this quarter rather than some of the sluggishness in December that we have already talked about. If you compare the first quarter to the second quarter your inflation number went from 2 to 1. And that's probably the bigger –
Chris Kreidler: Inflation and actually your ForEx was a little higher as well. When you put both of those in there and your sales number is not a significantly off of where we were.
Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse: Okay. Then the other question relates to a sequential change in the business is, this notion of looking at your volume growth right relative to your gross profit dollar growth. And that spread seems to have widened a bit. So which I guess could be – could be competition market or whatever. But, I guess, how do you think about that. I know you typically don't want it. You would like to grow gross profit sort of closer to volume, right? So going forward should I be using this type of spread, do you think it can improve?
Bill DeLaney III: As I said, we came up with somewhat short of our internal goals here for the quarter and that was on the gross profit dollar line. But, I would the spread was about the same as it was in the first half. We had a top line miss and we will continue to have gross profit pressure and margin pressure on all categories to customers actually so I – what I'm looking at the spread is about the same as in the first quarter.
Chris Kreidler: Obviously, you got to do your own modeling. Our plan certainly don't call for or allow for a 0.7% gross margin growth number. We are clearly higher than that. We clearly have higher expectations for that. And Bill explained that's where we got a tremendous amount of focus and we talked about it for a number of quarters here. So that's not in our short or long-term projections.
Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse: All right. And Chris, you are going to lapse in acceleration and the acquisition benefit in the back half year?
Chris Kreidler: Yes.
Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse: So I guess you would expect that benefit to slowdown, I guess is that, right?
Chris Kreidler: It will. We kind of expressed what we think the full year benefit will be. We -- just the carry over deals themselves would boost us by at least 1% in terms of sales and then new transactions every year are targeted at least 1% say you get about half point impact for the year. So add those up and generally our expectation is about 0.5. So we still have a significant pipeline of transactions. We got this major one that we have to work our way through of course. And so U.S. acquisitions may slow a bit but we still have focus in Canada and focus in other geographies.
Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse: Nice. And then just one last question for you on SAP. Now that it looks like you got through Boise, what's the next big OPCO going to get done, is that – within the next group and are you comfortable now that some of the changes you made get you over the hurdle to get a big OPCOs on just as well now?
Bill DeLaney III: We just as I mentioned we just did Phoenix and Vegas last weekend. Actually so we were work week two there now add so we are early days but we are feeling good about that. I think I also mentioned if things stay on course both with the next round of enhancements as well as what we see in these last three companies, we expect to do a couple of more in latter part of this fiscal year, they would both be very large companies.
Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Bill DeLaney III: Thank you.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Greg Hassler with Bank of America.
Greg Hassler - Bank of America: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. And apologize if I missed this earlier. I think you may have addressed and it was cutting out a little bit. But in terms of the refinancing that you guys intend to do, should we just expect that to be closer to the time of the closing of the transaction? I think you've said, you expected to take or at least the FTC review to take 9 to 12 months, so just trying to think of this from a timing perspective.
Chris Kreidler: It will certainly be closer to the time of the transaction whether we take advantage of market conditions and confidence levels prior to that. It will depend upon a number of factors and terms of when we'll actually pull the trigger to do some of this refinancing.
Greg Hassler - Bank of America: Okay. And then, in terms of the overall size, you've got a pretty big chunk of legacy U.S. Foods that's here to refinance, but then at Sysco, you also have some shorter term borrowings. You've got a 2014 and a 2015 maturity coming up. So we expected, you kind of do that all at once, or could you be coming to market multiple times here over the next couple of years?
Chris Kreidler: Obviously, our goal was not to be -- to come to market a whole bunch of different times. It will -- it tends to cause a little inefficiency in terms of pricing as well as disruption. At the same time, we've got something that comes due and we see an opportunity to refinance a chunk of it, both our side as well as pre-refinancing the U.S. Foods merger consideration we may look for an opportunity to do that.
Greg Hassler - Bank of America: Okay. Thank you very much.
Chris Kreidler: Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's question-and-answer session and today's Sysco second quarter fiscal 2014 conference call. We thank you for your participation and have a good day.

Operator: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Sysco's First Quarter Fiscal 2014 Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I will turn the call over to Mr. Neil Russell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Neil A. Russell: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Sysco's First Quarter Fiscal 2014 Earnings Call. Today, you will hear remarks from Bill DeLaney, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Kreidler, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, please note that statements made during this presentation that state the company's or management's intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ in a material manner. Additional information that could cause results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's SEC filings. This includes, but is not limited to, risk factors contained in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 29, 2013, and in the news release issued earlier this morning, which is posted in the Investors section at sysco.com and can be found on the Sysco IR app, which can be downloaded from the iTunes App Store and Google Play. Non-GAAP financial measures are included in our comments today and in the presentation slides. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the applicable GAAP measures are included at the end of the presentation, which can also be found in the Investors section of our website. All comments about earnings per share refer to diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. In addition, all references to case volumes include total Broadline and SYGMA combined. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill DeLaney.
William J. DeLaney: Thanks, Neil, and hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, Sysco reported record first quarter sales of $11.7 billion, net earnings of $286 million and EPS of $0.48. Adjusting for certain items, such as severance and facility consolidations, adjusted EPS was $0.49, which is flat compared to prior year. Market conditions remained very challenging for our customers throughout the quarter as consumers continue to spend their disposable income in an increasingly disciplined manner, and to some degree, shift their spending to more durable goods. While these trends are not favorable to the foodservice industry, we're hopeful that they will begin to abate as we approach the new calendar year and beyond. Notwithstanding the challenging market conditions, we grew our sales for the quarter by nearly 6% over the prior year, with approximately 2/3 of that growth coming in the form of case volume growth. Earnings were generally in line with our expectations as strong expense management helped to offset the impact of sluggish gross profit dollar gains. We continue to drive solid growth with our large national and regional customer base, while sales growth with our locally managed customers remains soft. We also made good progress in several of our enterprise-wide business transformation cost-reduction initiatives, which contributed to a significant reduction in cost per case in our Broadline operations compared to last year's first quarter. Turning to our technology transformation. During the quarter, we installed a major scheduled update to the system which favorably impacted all 5 of our SAP-enabled operating companies. Following the implementation of these performance and functional enhancements, we generally have experienced improved performance and stability in the technology. Encouraged by this progress, we remain scheduled to resume our deployment rollout next week at our Boise, Idaho, operating company. Assuming the results in Boise are favorable and that we continue to make consistent strides in improving the overall technology platform, our plan is to carry out additional conversions beginning early in the new calendar year. We are also pleased with the progress we have made to-date on our category management initiative. We are moving forward with the process, building our capabilities and focusing on driving a new assortment based upon consumer and customer insights; and the 4 pilot categories, representing approximately $1 billion in total annual spend, went live this past summer; and we've begun to launch additional categories in wave 1, which will encompass approximately $4 billion in aggregate annual spend once it's fully rolled out. While results vary somewhat amongst the categories in between our operating companies, both customer conversion rates and product cost savings opportunities have generally been in line with our expectations. As expected, we have encountered some challenges in marketing the enhanced value of the new product assortment to certain customers. As a result, we are taking steps to improve our conversion processes so as to provide our customers with a more rewarding experience as we work through the assortment changes together. Specifically, we are enhancing our product and supplier selection process on the front end by working with our vendor partners and sharing best practices from our most successful operating companies and adjusting the rollout calendar where execution risk warrants. We remain confident in both the benefits that category management will provide our customers and the savings we will realize over the next few years. Accordingly, wave 2 is in the early stages of implementation and is expected to launch during the second half of our fiscal year. In closing, while the market environment is still very challenging for many of our customers, especially those who operate in the casual dining restaurant segment, we remain focused on the following: Creating greater value for our customers, delivering our annual business plan and driving transformational change within our company. In so doing, we expect to provide improved financial results in fiscal 2014, and we expect that year-over-year improvement will gradually build and be more pronounced in the second half of the current fiscal year. Reflecting on the amount of necessary change we are driving in the midst of a difficult market environment, we are most appreciative of the support and partnership we receive from approximately 425,000 customers and our more than 10,000 suppliers, as well as the tremendous commitment and contributions our 48,000 associates provide each and every day. Now I'll turn things over to Chris so he can provide additional details on our financial results for the first quarter.
Robert C. Kreidler: Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. For the first quarter, sales were $11.7 billion or an increase of 5.7% compared to the prior year, mainly due to acquisitions, which increased sales by 2.3% and food cost inflation, which was 2.1%. Case volume increased 4.1% for the quarter; and case volume, excluding acquisitions, increased 1.8%. Changes in foreign exchange rates decreased sales by 0.5%. Gross profit in the first quarter increased 1.8%, and gross margin declined 68 basis points to 17.63%, due mainly to continued weakness in locally managed sales, the difficult business environment and competitive pressure. In addition, sales to large regional and national customers are growing faster than local business, and this mix shift drove about 15% to 20% of the gross margin decline during the quarter. Operating expenses increased $36 million or 2.3% in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 compared to the prior year period. Excluding the impact of operating expenses from acquired companies, adjusted operating expenses were flat compared to the prior year. This was achieved as a result of benefits from our business transformation initiatives, as well as lower business transformation expenses. Business transformation expenses were lower in the first quarter by $11 million, due mainly to lower spending on third-party contractor expenses. As deployment begins to ramp back up in the second quarter and throughout the remainder of the fiscal year, expenses are expected to be similar to the prior year. As a result, we continue to expect total business transformation expenses for the year to be in the $300 million to $350 million range. Similar to last year, we continue to see business transformation benefits driving down operating expenses. As a result, payroll in our sales and IT departments are once again lower than the prior year, down more than $20 million combined, as are retirement-related expenses. I'd like to provide some additional insight on our projected retirement-related expense trends for the remainder of the year. We recorded a net $9 million decline in retirement-related expense for the quarter. This was the result of a $32 million decline in pension expense, partially offset by a $23 million increase in 401(k) expense. As a reminder, retirement-related expenses in the first quarter and for the remainder of the fiscal year are being impacted by the timing of changes in our retirement plan benefits implemented mid-year last year, as well as by the timing of certain related restructuring items that were recognized last year. We've provided a chart in our slide presentation showing our projections of the year-over-year impact of each of these items. As you will see, we continue to expect adjusted retirement-related expense for the year to be lower by $50 million to $60 million, with the majority of that decline occurring in the second half of the year. As a result of the benefits generated from our transformation initiatives, cost per case performance in our Broadline operations was significantly better than last year for the first quarter, declining $0.09 per case compared to the prior year. We don't anticipate maintaining this rate of improvement as we lap the point at which we began some of these initiatives last year, but we remain confident in meeting our objective of a $0.05 decline for the full fiscal year. So in spite of relatively weak gross profit growth, the progress we continue to make towards our cost-reduction initiatives resulted in operating income being essentially flat year-over-year. Net earnings for the first quarter were $286 million, a decrease of $1 million or 0.4% compared to the prior year. Diluted EPS was $0.48, a $0.02 decrease compared to the prior year. Adjusting for certain items, which mainly related to restructuring items, diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.49. As we have discussed on previous calls, we believe it is important to focus on the performance of our underlying business, which excludes certain items, as well as business transformation expenses. To summarize the performance of our underlying business, adjusted operating expenses increased 3.5%, adjusted operating income decreased 2.7% and adjusted net earnings declined 3.1%, and adjusted EPS declined 3.4% to $0.56. Turning to the impact of the Business Transformation Project for a moment. In the first quarter, project expenses totaled $67 million, and we capitalized $4 million related to the project. In the prior year quarter, project expenses totaled $78 million, and we capitalized $8 million related to the project. Free cash flow was $44 million for the first quarter, slightly lower than the prior year, mainly due to working capital performance. The first half of the year and the first quarter, in particular, are our weakest cash flow quarters and a year-over-year decline is not surprising. Capital expenditures totaled $136 million for the first quarter of this year compared to $156 million last year. In closing, while the challenging business environment in the foodservice industry continues to impact our customers and our business, we are focused on those areas of our business that we can control and are encouraged by our progress in growing our business, controlling expenses and achieving our business transformation goals. With that, operator, we'll now take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go first today to Karen Short with Deutsche Bank.
Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Just looking at case volume in general, it sounds like case volume in street accounts is very limited or low or potentially even negative. So I guess, maybe, can you talk a little bit about what you think that's a function of? Is it maybe a function of headcount reduction and MAs or just base-level attrition at the street level with your customers or maybe some response to your waves of SKU reductions? Any color there?
William J. DeLaney: Karen, I think you answered most of your question right there. But yes, I'll take a shot at it. I think, clearly, this macro environment continues to be difficult for our customers, and we mentioned the casual dining segment, so that's a big part of our street business, more so than maybe on the big contract side. So I think there is a macro aspect to that. Certainly, we are driving a lot of change as we've referenced here for several quarters. And any time you drive change, you do have to drive it through your sales organization, and our folks have had to deal with a lot of that over the last 12 to 15 months. Now we're getting the benefit of it on the cost side, but it has somewhat probably hurt us a little bit on the top line. It's hard for me to tell -- really, the SKU thing, you get different pieces of feedback on that. I don't think it's as much the SKU issue as it is just the amount of change, and to some extent, as we've eliminated some territories, customers are dealing with different MAs and that type of thing. So from -- I think there's a little bit on the macro, somewhat on the inside, internal, if you will, I would say, largely to be expected. We just need to work through it as fast and as well as we can. And I would just tell you, the competitive environment, in particular on the street business, remains very acute. And we need to fight to keep the cases that we have and to grow those cases. And so there's a never-ending balance here across the different markets and the different operating companies and that trade-off between retaining and growing business and pricing. And we continue to try to do that as well as we can. Obviously, it's a challenge right now.
Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. That's helpful. And just a question on categories in terms of wave 1 and 2. How many categories is it going to address? I know you gave dollar amounts, but how many categories and if you could give any color on what categories will be included?
William J. DeLaney: Yes, I don't think we have any finite number of categories. We continue to look, for example, at the rollout calendar. It was pretty aggressive in the front end. We've made some modest adjustments. So that could ultimately end up with maybe a couple more waves, if you will, than what we initially intended. But I think to put it in perspective, we buy about a little over $30 billion worth of product. And the pilot, we said, was about $1 billion and wave 1 is $4 billion, but wave 2 would be less than that. So I think we're getting to where it's a significant piece. By the end of the year, it will be a significant piece of our overall purchasing.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Mark Wiltamuth with Jefferies.
Mark Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: I wanted to dig in a little bit more on the gross margin decline of 68 basis points. You talked a little bit about mix, but maybe you could give us some other factors that played into that decline because we've now had a couple of quarters here in the mid-60s or 60s or higher on a basis points decline.
William J. DeLaney: Yes, Mark. So mix is a part of it, I think Chris mentioned it's about 25% of that reduction. The rest of it is pretty much what I was discussing there with Karen. We've got a very competitive environment out there, and we do a lot of business, it's a volume-driven business. We're the leader by far. And the most profitable business we have is the business that we're already transacting. So we're fighting very hard to hold on to those cases, and we're doing a reasonable job of that, as I said, in a challenging environment. With that said, there's things that we can do and execute better. There is some variability, as we've called out over the last 2 or 3 calls, between operating companies and how well we're executing, and we're trying to provide the right level of support to give more consistency in our performance there. So there's opportunities for us in the short to medium term to manage the margin better and still grow the business and take care of our customers, and that's what we intend to do.
Mark Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: What do you mean by locally managed business was under more pressure on margin? Was that -- does that mean more street account margin pressure than the rest of the business?
William J. DeLaney: Yes, so let me address the terminologies. So over the years, it's still relative when we talk about contract and street. But as we evolve here and as our organization structure evolves, we're trying to be a little more clear on where the large amount of the accountability goes in terms of growth. And so our operating companies pretty much control 60% to 70% of the revenue stream on average. And the bulk of that is street business, but there's also contract business locally. So when I speak of locally managed business, it's what's largely managed at the operating company level, the majority being street, but there's a good percentage of local contract as well. The rest of it, we refer to as corporate managed, and that's our big national and large regional multiunit customers.
Mark Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: And it sounds like that segment is where you've been getting more of your wins lately, the corporate managed business. Is that right?
William J. DeLaney: Yes. I mean, there's pressure in that segment as well, but we've done a nice job leveraging our scale there, and those customers see that as a big competitive advantage for them. So we've had some good success there actually over the last 2, 2.5 years.
Mark Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: And the locally managed pressure, is that just reaction to the difficult operating environment or is it kind of planned attacks to kind of gain share in some places?
William J. DeLaney: I think it's a combination of all of that. I don't think there's a lot of growth right now on the street. We'll update that data here as we get into the end of the calendar year. And so I think that results in more of the same that we've seen in the last 2, 3 years. When there's not a lot of growth, that creates a lot of acute pressure on the street and that type of business, and there's a lot more people trying to do what we're trying to do, which is hold their business and grow it.
Operator: We'll go next to John Heinbockel with Guggenheim.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: So a couple of things. Bill, you said in the 5 SAP-enabled companies, performance has significantly improved. So with respect to that, what has improved? And then, is it just operating performance or actually, is there a financial performance at those 5 companies that has meaningfully improved?
William J. DeLaney: John, when I speak to the favorable results that we're seeing there and the improvement we're seeing, it's more about the platform itself. We see more stability where we're utilizing the hardware better. Some of the issues we've had with replenishment, service levels, those have begun to improve as well. It's not as consistent in terms of the trend lines as we'd like to see, but it's definitely better than where we were. So it's more on the operating side and on the hardware utilization itself. And it's encouraging.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: Now is that -- should that directly translate to financial performance, or is there a fair bit of a lag between when that will happen?
William J. DeLaney: There's still more of a lag than what we'd like to see, which is why we took this pause here to go in and basically dedicate all of our resources to enhancing the underlying system itself. So yes, it should to and obviously needs to. And we just need that dip to be less -- more shallow and last not as long. So we're not there yet, but we are feeling more confident in terms of the strides we've made, and that's why you hear us talking about beginning deployments again with our company in Idaho this month then hopefully more than that as we get into new year.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: Now let me ask on gross margin, if you take mix out, maybe you're down 50 bps, give or take. How do you guys analytically look at the ROIC of that and the elasticity of that? And then, I guess, if you had spent less than the 50 bps, would case volume be significantly worse or it's a balance, but how do you analytically think about the balance whether you're getting a decent return for the 50?
William J. DeLaney: Yes, I think, John, you've been very consistent on that question. Actually, I'm getting a little more perspective on the elasticity as we go through this over the last year, 1.5 years. But I would say, certainly, we're conscious of ROIC, but we tend to look at that more at the operating unit level and obviously the enterprise level. We look at the profitability of the accounts. We look at growth. I mean, ours is a business that's driven on growth. We invest in the business, we utilize our scale. We see that as a very big competitive advantage, both on the operations side and on the sales and marketing side, both with our big contract customers and locally. So our fundamental belief is that we need to grow this business. Now we need to grow it profitably. But our customers are all profitable. It's a matter of are they as profitable as they were a year ago, and we look at that. And I would tell you, 1 year, 1.5 years into trying to get better answers to your question on elasticity, I'd say it's -- I don't think I can tell you that we would have had more GP dollars if we had higher margins, let's say. And as you look at it by market or OpCo, it's a function of our leadership and our execution. It's a function of the support we're able to give them here from corporate with all the initiative work that we're doing. And it's a little bit of a function geographically on how healthy those markets are. For example, the Southwest in Texas, we're able to grow the business here a little better because the underlying market's somewhat better, middle part of the country more difficult.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: And then, lastly, the acquisition pipeline, do you think based on what you see today that you'll be -- again, we're going to lap some of the acquisitions you did last year so -- but if you sort of think about what you might bring on online new over the next 9 to 12 months, you think that will likely be in the 1% to 2% range contribution to sales or do you think it's less than that?
Robert C. Kreidler: John, this is Chris, with a bit of weak voice today, I apologize. What we said is we plan to grow at least 1% every year. We've got a lot of carryover from the deals we did last year, the annualization of what we did last year, which is going to give us 1% just on carryover. So if we do our normal 1%, of which we'll get about 0.5 point benefit this year, plus 1 point carryover, we'll be in that 1.5% range. That's kind of our target for this year. And then going forward, we still plan to do at least 1% a year. We've still got a very robust pipeline. The first quarter always seems to be a little bit weak, but we're pretty pleased with the progress we continue to make on the acquisition front.
Operator: We'll go next to Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse.
Edward J. Kelly - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Bill, just not to beat a dead horse here, but I want to start with a follow-up on the gross profit, and let's think about gross profit per case, I guess. How much of the pressure that you're seeing right now is from new business pricing or is it just -- or is it renewals of existing contracts?
William J. DeLaney: Are you just asking about the contract business or are you asking about all customers?
Edward J. Kelly - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Your whole business. How much of it is pressure on existing customers versus going out and trying to win new customers?
William J. DeLaney: I'd say it's more on the existing customers. They're all looking to find ways to save money and run their businesses better. And as we've alluded to here and spoken to, the environment for many of our customers, especially on the restaurant casual dining side, remains very challenging. So we're always in conversations, whether it's street business or larger-chain business, trying to find ways to share savings and to provide them more value. So given the math, it's definitely more on the existing business. We could be doing better on the new business, I'll tell you that. So I think that's in a left-handed way kind of a testimony to the fact that we're not just chasing business to get a top line. So I'd like to see our new business numbers be a little bit higher right now, and I expect that they will pick up here as things start to stabilize with the sales force. But I would have to say it's mostly on the existing business.
Edward J. Kelly - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And then just on gross profit per case, generally. Obviously, it's a little weak right now. It sounds like you expect it to get better as the year progresses. So first, I guess, is that true? And do you think you can get back to the point at some time this year where you have flat-ish to maybe modestly positive gross profit dollars per case?
William J. DeLaney: Well, we tend to speak about gross profit more in terms of percentages, so I'm going to leave it there. I will say this, we need to improve, I think that's clear. I mean, if you look at the quarter, the way I would characterize the quarter is the top line number was good. We would've liked to seen a better number on the locally managed street business than what we saw, and that drives some of the margin as well. So we need to do better there. I don't know that we can get all the way back to flat by the end of the year, but certainly, we can -- I feel like we can make some improvements and we need to. The good news here is that the cost per case, we are seeing the benefits of a lot of the initiatives we've undertaken here over the last 12 to 15 months, and there's more to come there. And they do go together at some point, especially on your big contract business. Your -- as that business grows somewhat faster than your street, you need to see lower cost per case than your expenses because that's part of the economics on how you go after that business. So our target is to obviously improve the gross margin performance. I'm probably not prepared today to tell you we're going to get back to flat.
Edward J. Kelly - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: All right. And then just last question for you. Category management, can you just maybe provide a little bit of color on what your clients actually are saying at this point, specific pushback, how you're adjusting to that? And then as you think about what you've rolled out so far, what's been the sales and the gross profit dollar impact so far on those categories?
William J. DeLaney: I would say, generally, 2 things, one is that the customers have been incredibly supportive. They're looking at this with an open mind. Our sales force is -- they've got a lot coming at them. They've done a nice job in our sales management. We've done, I think, a very good job bulking up and strengthening our merchandising team throughout the company, but especially here at corporate. We put a lot of planning, a lot of thought into this. So we've learned a lot over the last few years from big initiatives that there's things we need to do in terms of bringing folks in and better preparation, better communication. With all of that said, we can still communicate better between here and our operating companies. There's probably some process improvements in terms of how we manage the conversions at the operating company level that we need to get better consistency on amongst the different companies, and that's an opportunity obviously for us to work better with them. The suppliers give us good feedback as we get into some of the individual categories and which ones will be more complicated than others, that type of thing. So right now, I would just say to you that from a process standpoint, we're about where we thought we would be. We're doing fine on the conversions. But the reality is, it somewhat depends on the category and it depends on the customer and it depends how good a job we did in terms of comping the specs on the individual items. And so it's a one-on-one conversation with each and every customer. And we're just trying to strike the right balance between moving forward and doing the right thing for the customer but also the right thing for our economics. And at times, we probably have moved a little too fast there and we just need to be a little bit more patient at times and give our people a little more support to do that. But all in all, I'm pleased with where we're at. That's a big initiative. And as I said in the prepared remarks, we still feel very good about it going forward.
Operator: We'll go next to Michael Kelter with Goldman Sachs.
Ivan Holman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: This is Ivan Holman sitting in for Michael. I was hoping to dig into the guidance a little bit. You mentioned that you expected trends to improve and profitability to build as 2014 continues. And since there are a lot of moving pieces, I was wondering, is that predicated on an improvement in the macro? And excluding an improvement in the macro, do you still think that you can continue to build there through the initiatives that you're rolling out?
William J. DeLaney: Well, yes, it's predicated on some improvement in the macro. If you recall, if you look at our year last year, on a relative basis, the first half of the year was much stronger than the second half of the year. And so there is some presumption there that the macro will gradually improve. But we're not waiting on that. So it's hard for me to kind of gauge how much improvement we'll make with or without the macro. But we certainly expect to grow the business. If the macro improves, we'll grow it a little bit more. We expect that we'll continue to make strides on margin and cost management. I think the components of the improvement on cost control will change over the course of the year, and Chris can take you through that a little bit. But we -- the bottom line is here we expect to improve, but certainly, an improving macro would give us more confidence.
Ivan Holman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Great. And just a quick follow-up. With regards to acquisitions, can you just help us understand from a process perspective, given the erosion in gross margins from the mix shift towards the locally managed business, can you help us understand when you're looking at acquisitions, if there are any constraints around that in terms of decisions to grow the top line but perhaps at the expense of gross margin, and how you view the evolution of the business as you look at acquisitions on a go-forward basis?
William J. DeLaney: Well, let me say this. The way we look at acquisitions is we're looking for opportunities to bring businesses in this company that will help us grow. That may be geographic, it may be a product category, it may be -- it may not be necessarily a top line opportunity, could be a consolidation play. So it just depends on the specific opportunity we're looking at it. If you look at our acquisitions over the last 1.5 years or 2 years, we've done all of that. We bought a company up in Western Minnesota, which, believe it or not, gave us some green space up there even though we're in Minnesota, we're in North Dakota. We've bought some specialty product companies, European Imports comes to mind. And we've entered into some new geographies in Québec and the Bahamas and Ireland. So we look at everything there. And we're certainly -- as you look forward, it's certainly a meaningful part of how we expect to grow the top line. But in the end, it needs to be profitable as well. Chris, you want to add anything to that?
Robert C. Kreidler: Yes, I'm not sure we fully understood the premise of your question, but I think Bill's explanation is good. We do all sorts of different types of acquisition. Generally, the margins that we see in the company before we acquire it are lower than our own margins. And so it might be a bit dilutive when we first merge it in with our existing business. But then that yields the opportunities that we have with these acquisitions to put them into our buying programs to enhance their performance, especially if it's a fold-in and get cost savings out of it. So we might see a bit of a dilution initially, but then we see synergies, if you will, as we operate it for a period of time and bring it into the fold. So we believe these -- especially the smaller acquisitions that we've been doing, and they're not all tiny, but small-, medium-size acquisitions are very beneficial to us both in growing the top line but also in continuing to enhance our profitability over time.
Operator: We'll go next to Meredith Adler with Barclays.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I'd like to kind of connect 2 things you've been talking about and we'll see if there is a connection. You were talking about category management and maybe you got some pushback from some customers. Do you think there's any relationship with pricing? You did say pricing to existing customers had come down. Is there any relationship between that and your category management efforts or is it separate?
William J. DeLaney: Meredith, I think what I acknowledged is that we can do better on gross margins, and we're working hard on that. I would say, on CatMan in particular, the type of conversations we're having with customers would be generally expected when you're sitting there, talking to them about, in certain instances, changing out an item. I wouldn't call it so much as pushback as it's just people want to know why it's good for them and that type of thing. So I would say, overall, in terms of the profitability on the CatMan, it's been as good or better than we expect. So that really hasn't been the issue there. It's just we need to do it in the right way to sustain the growth that comes from that. And the way we're approaching category management, it's -- clearly, we need to realize the gross savings and invest in that in the right way and create the net savings we've spoken about. But our whole goal here is to do this in a way, and we're doing it in a very well thought-out way, to sustain growth over the next 2 or 3 years as well and hopefully accelerate growth. So it's more of a growth issue than it is a profitability issue, I would say.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then I have a question about marketing associates. I think you mentioned that there had been some declines. And could you just spell out -- I know you had done some layoffs or allowed attrition to happen. Have you also had some defections? And would you say that whatever impact that has on sales is behind you or will there be some over -- future spillover effect?
William J. DeLaney: Yes. If you go back, let's go back 15 months. And so as we started rolling out a lot of these initiatives, on the sales side, we had several key initiatives. We implemented a CRM tool across the company. We looked at creating more consistent pay plan across the company, different variables but more consistency in terms on how the commission grid works. We flattened the sales organization. Where it made sense, we tried to take layers out or at least make sure that our best and most talented sales associates and sales management are as close to the customer as possible, and we looked at nonprofitable territories. So yes, we're down in terms of territories year-over-year. That rate of decline has plateaued out to some extent. And I would say this, it's -- part of it was very conscious, part of it, we've lost a handful or 2 of people in management probably that we wouldn't wanted to have lost, and I'm sure we've lost some MAs that we wouldn't have wanted to lost. And when we didn't execute well in a few companies, we lost more people than I would've liked to seen us do. But all in all, for something of that magnitude, I think we've executed reasonably well. And to your last question, yes, things have begun to stabilize. The change that Sysco is going through today, becoming much more customer-centric and we're having to accept the fact that change is perpetual. So it's not like the sales force isn't going to have change going forward. It's not like the customers are not going to see some change. The degree of change, I think, has stabilized and I think we will see some improvement there as people get more confident in the new organization structure and what their roles are and that type of thing. So absolutely in a better place from that standpoint than we were a year ago.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division: And I'd just like to throw in one more question. This quarter, you did buy back stock and it looked like you were a net borrower to buy back stock. I was just wondering if this -- I kind of went back and looked and I think that the share count went down a bit more than it has recently. Is there anything in that? Is that a part of a plan or it just worked out that way?
Robert C. Kreidler: Meredith, this is Chris. It's no change in our strategy, just to be candid and upfront about it. We typically -- periodically, every quarter, we look at what's the expected dilution from options, issuance options, exercises, et cetera. We try to look as far ahead as possible, and then we try to put in place a plan to offset that with stock repurchases. We got a bit ahead in the first quarter due to pricing and due to some modeling that we did. And so that's what you see is a pretty strong first quarter. Depending on where the stock goes and what happens with option exercises, we'll determine whether we continue to buy at a similar clip or a much less clip. But it is not a change in strategy.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Andrew Wolf with BB&T Capital Markets.
Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: Chris, you mentioned -- I just want to make sure, you said the cost per case was $0.09 lower this quarter but you expect $0.05 for the year. And could you just kind of give me more information about that? It seems like a really strong number this quarter. And is that all having to do with hiring in the warehouse or in other parts of the company?
Robert C. Kreidler: No. As we've talked about over the last couple of quarters, and I think we're starting to give a little more insight into the amounts and the magnitudes, it's really a continuation of the initiatives that we began last year. So we saw significant declines in our sales cost per case, offset by some increases on the warehouse and driver side. And so what we're really saying is as a first -- well, first, we put out guidance for the year that we expect to be down $0.05 a case. The first quarter, we're down pretty heavily but we're going to wrap that as we get into the latter half of the year because we started some of those initiatives in the latter half of last year. So as we wrap it, we won't see as much of a decline. We're very confident we'll see our $0.05 a case for the year, and I hope we'll do better than that and then we've got to continue with additional initiatives to continue to drive down that cost per case as much as we can. And first, to offset any increases that are somewhat natural year-to-year; and secondly, hopefully, actually drive down the absolute number.
Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: And is any of the overhead cost reduction part of that, like the lower pension expense, or is it all sort of variable costs?
Robert C. Kreidler: Yes, it is, Andy, and the reason I don't call it out is that it hits multiple line items when we talk about the retirement-related expenses. On a cost per case basis, they hit the sales line, they hit the operations line. They hit multiple lines because it's a labor expense. But yes, that is part of the decline in multiple areas.
Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: Just wanted to understand it because the variance, it's big numbers. Second, on the table in the release that has the MA-served sales as a percent of Broadline, the year-ago figure is about almost 90 bps or so lower than what's in the press release a year ago. Is that a number that gets routinely adjusted, or is that in any way related to the re-class?
Robert C. Kreidler: Yes, Andy, to be honest, I didn't look at it. I don't think it would be related to the re-class. We'll take a look at that and come back to you with an answer. I don't know the answer off the top of my head.
Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: Okay, I appreciate it. The reason I asked that is if it is adjusted the way -- if I were to carry through the same 90 bps change, it would actually look like your MA-served business as a mix -- on a mix basis, actually, kind of improved from the fourth quarter. But that doesn't sound like what you're all saying around...
Robert C. Kreidler: No, that should not be the implication [indiscernible]. So let us check.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go next to John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.
John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: It seems like with the gross margin decline, it almost feels like there's a war of attrition that's kind of out there in the overall marketplace, with everyone having to take gross margin down because the next person is and what have you. So I mean, could you kind of comment, I mean, if that's something that's happening, if you might be losing share to on the street account basis? And I know it's a very hard question to answer, but how long it could continue? How long can your competition continue to invest in price if they don't have the cash flow and the balance sheet and the margins that you have to start with?
William J. DeLaney: Well, those are great questions, John. I'll take a shot at it. I would say it's -- I don't know if it's a war of attrition. It's just a very acute competitive environment. And I know I'm repeating myself at this point, where I don't believe that there actually is a lot of overall growth on the street right now. And if you're Sysco, first of all, let me be clear, we need to do better managing margin. And we've got some things we're working on and continue to work on in the short term. And over the medium term, there will be some other opportunities, I think, for us to mitigate some of this pressure. But from our standpoint, it does come back to scale, it does come back to looking at that in the context of expense improvements as well. And we're just not going to give up cases unless we're doing something really ridiculous. And in that case, we will transition the business. So it's not an environment where we want to give up cases. As far as what the other guys are doing, we've acknowledged over the last couple of years that the nature of the competition continues to evolve so we continue to have a lot of traditional competitors, large, medium and small. I think the nature of this business is, if you don't -- if you're not looking to grow and expand, you can generate cash and stay in business for a while. I think there's a fair amount of people leaving and you see that, I think, in our acquisition pipeline picking up somewhat. At the same time, the barriers to entry are relatively low, so there continues to be a lot of small players out there. And then we have the nontraditional folks that I think are doing well in this type of environment, the cash and carries and the club stores and that type of thing. So those are all part of the environment that we're in right now. And on a day-to-day basis, we're marketing. It is our ability to sit and work with customers and help them plan their menus better, help their -- work with their waitstaff, manage their costs better. As they get larger in scale, manage their freight better, anything we can do to help them run their business more effectively. So at any given point in time, that's going to resonate at different levels with different customers. So we think we have a clear advantage there, and we certainly think that our approach strategically is the right approach. I think we're very customer-centric model, very much about working closely with our customers, our suppliers, gaining better insights, operational excellence, acquisitions to grow the top line, developing our people. But at the same time, we have room for improvement and that's, I think, I'll acknowledge as well that we do need to continue to find ways to strike a better balance between growth and margin, and we will.
John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And a little bit separately, if I may. We don't talk a lot about SYGMA on these conference calls. But is there like some really big opportunity that's out there on the chain account side that maybe we haven't seen you convert in the last couple of years?
William J. DeLaney: We had a pretty good run with SYGMA for about 2 years, and we did pick up some business over the last few months. And I think you saw that on the top line this quarter. When you do pick up business, it can create some expense issues and transitions, so we had some earnings pressure there as well. So we've got a nice stable of customers in SYGMA, and we're working very hard to continue to do good by them and then to solidify those relationships and grow within those relationships. But certainly, we have some key prospects out there as well. And SYGMA, it's a $6 billion business. We make about 1%. But it represents a big part of the opportunity in our market, and it's just important that we balance the growth there.
John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And the final question for me, it's a quick one. What's kind of the inflation/deflation outlook as you see it maybe over the next 6 to 12 months?
William J. DeLaney: I would say, again, a very slight category. Certainly, your commodities are going to be up and down and that type of thing. But right now, the best information we have is probably more of the same. It's hung in there in the relatively low 2s. And as I sit here this morning, I don't really have anything to tell you that would cause that to go up appreciably over the next 6, 9 months.
Robert C. Kreidler: Yes, the only thing that we get, which I'm sure you guys get the same report, is there are certain categories be, for example, where we continue to see some inflation. But Bill's right, overall food prices just don't seem to be going up and the forecast is not for them to go up.
John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And that was actually kind of the point of the question is whether the rate of inflation could actually drop to the point where there'd be almost no inflation in the model.
Robert C. Kreidler: We're not reading that in any of the expert reports. We see that it might be a tad lower than last year on a whole, but we're not seeing anybody writing about deflation.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's conference call. Have a great rest of your day.

William J. DeLaney: Thank you, Neil, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Sysco's financial results, announced this morning, reflect a year that has both produced several significant successes and provided us with many challenges. While we have seen a slow and steady economic recovery, it is clear that the foodservice industry, as a whole, has not fully participated in that recovery. At the same time, we are driving on a much-needed transformational change throughout Sysco. This change has broadened scope, will permit us to enhance the products and services we provide our customers and will allow us to build upon our industry-leading position for years to come. Successfully implementing change of this large scale requires strong leadership, substantial effort by our associates, and more often than we would like, patience from our various stakeholders. Starting with the market, it is clear that certain elements of the overall economy appear to be recovering. Consumer confidence is near its highest level since 2008, housing sales and prices have consistently improved this year and unemployment levels are declining. However, a deeper look at the data reveals that consumer confidence remains well off its historic highs, unemployment levels do not fully reflect the number of individuals who would like to work but have given up, and personal income is stagnant. As a result, we believe many consumers have become much more disciplined in their spending habits, and this has directly impacted our business, particularly our street business with independent foodservice operators. Today's consumers are more actively allocating their disposable income, and eating out has been deprioritized from some consumers' personal budgets. We believe this trend is more cyclical than structural in nature, but acknowledge that greater consumer confidence will be required to reverse it. Reflecting these factors, this morning, Sysco reported its sales for the fourth quarter increased 5% to $11.6 billion, and net earnings were $283 million. EPS declined 11% to $0.47, in part due to increased costs from business transformation and restructuring items. Excluding these costs, adjusted EPS, representing our underlying business, was $0.59, declining 6% compared to the prior year. Sales for the fiscal year were $44 billion, a record for Sysco, and net earnings were nearly $1 billion. EPS declined 12% to $1.67, which was mainly due to increased costs from business transformation, multi-employer pension plan withdrawals and restructuring. Adjusting for these costs, adjusted EPS, representing our underlying business, was $0.01 lower compared to the prior year at $2.14. Cash flow from operations grew by 8%, and free cash flow increased significantly to $1 billion. Our sales growth for the year was driven by case volume growth of 3% and product cost inflation of 2%. Earnings growth did not meet our expectations, as pricing pressures and lighter street sales growth resulted in only modest gross profit dollar gains. Helping to mitigate these pressures, we did achieve our overall targeted business transformation benefits for the year, with reduced selling and administrative costs providing the most benefit. We expect to achieve our overall targeted benefits in the new fiscal year as well. As we close this fiscal year, it's an appropriate time to reflect on our successes, as well as those areas where we need to improve. We should start with the fact that our industry is being impacted by many developing trends and realities. Growth in foodservice is projected to remain modest, about 1% to 2% real growth per annum, and our customers are increasingly value-focused. As a result, we expect pricing pressures will likely continue, and in addition, nontraditional competitors have become more of a factor. And lastly, consumer spending trends in our space are gradually shifting more to fresh, natural and sustainably produced products. We continue to focus on ways to respond to and capitalize on those trends in our own business, as well as in partnership with our customers and suppliers. One of our most significant challenges continues to be gross margin compression. Several of the trends I know that are contributing to this challenge, in addition, are shifting customer mix in recent quarters has adversely impacted gross margin, as our more value-added local and street customer business has not kept pace with our larger but lower-margin multiunit customer business. This area has management's full attention, and we expect to improve our gross margin trends as fiscal 2014 progresses by effectively implementing our category management initiative and gradually improving our street growth performance. Another significant challenge during the year was the unanticipated delay in deploying our SAP technology platform. However, we are now making progress in developing required system enhancements. This work primarily focuses on simplifying certain processes to improve response times and to reduce system loads, which will lead to improved system stability and will also lead to improved ability to scale the system as we go forward. We expect to restart convergence of the broad SAP rollout around the end of this calendar year at our Boise, Idaho company. And as our system enhancements in our 5 SAP operating companies take hold and the products' successful deployment in Boise, we would anticipate deploying additional operating company locations beginning early in calendar 2014. Notwithstanding all these challenges, I'm encouraged by several of the key successes we experienced during the past year. We grew sales at our corporate managed customers by 6% for the year, with the Broadline portion of this business up 9%. We completed acquisitions during the year of 14 companies, representing annualized sales of over $1 billion. These deals contributed significantly to our sales growth during the year and enhanced our international market presence and product capabilities. We exceeded our targeted business transformation benefits for the year. The majority of the benefits achieved were driven by changes in our retirement programs and sales and IT organizational changes. We're making significant progress in our category management initiative. Our pilot waves include 4 categories: french fries, dressings, shrimp, and tissues, towels and napkins. 3 of the 4 categories were launched in the market in June, with the fourth, shrimp, planned to launch in the fall. Customer acceptance of the new assortments in the pilots has been encouraging. Conversion rates are running ahead of where we expected to be at this point in the process, and our customers appreciate the increased variety and value offered by our new optimized assortment. Our supplier partners are highly engaged in all phases of the process and also appreciate our approach to this initiative, in particular, our focus on building strategic partnerships, which we believe deliver benefits for all parties. We and our suppliers are sharing customer insights to enhance product innovation and improve our response to customer trends. And our ability to commit volumes to our supplier partners allows them to more efficiently service the business. As is true in all pilots, we've learned along the way, and we appreciate our customers' and suppliers' engagement as we move through the process. We have a very aggressive implementation plan, and we'll continually improve our processes as we move forward with each successive wave. Cost per case in our Broadline business declined year-over-year, demonstrating our continuing efforts to reduce our operating cost structure. We reduced our cost, in particular, in our selling and administrative areas. Specifically, we aggressively drove cost-reduction initiatives in selling by implementing a customer relationship management platform, or CRM; flattening our sales management organization structure; modifying compensation plans for our marketing associates, or MAs, to incentivize growth; and reducing the number of unprofitable sales territories. Some of our operating companies executed these initiatives better than others. And while we realized significant cost savings, we no doubt experienced some sales loss in certain markets as well. We believe the impact of all of these changes has now been largely absorbed, and that our local sales organizations are well positioned to accelerate growth as fiscal 2014 progresses. We generated free cash flow during the year of $1 billion, exceeding our expectations. This was a direct result in improvements in working capital trends, as well as renewed focus on better prioritization of our capital expenditure opportunities. We will continue our work to improve our working capital metrics, as we believe there's ample opportunity to do so. We've also made significant progress on many other individual elements of our business transformation initiatives. Specifically, this year, we completed the rollout of our CRM module to all U.S. and Canadian Broadline operating companies. We completed the rollout of the SAP maintenance module to all U.S. Broadline locations. We expect to complete the rollout of the SAP human resource module to all U.S. Broadline locations by the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2014, and we expect to complete the centralization of our general ledger accounting functions for all U.S. Broadline locations by the end of the calendar year. And we have begun implementing enhancements to our routing technology and processes to further improve delivery efficiencies and expect this initiative to be completed in fiscal 2015. Pilot locations have completed the enhancements of experienced reductions in mileage of approximately 5%. We increased our dividend during this past year to 44x since we went public in 1970. In total, we distributed nearly $650 million of dividends to our shareholders during fiscal 2013. We recognize that our dividend represents a significant component of Sysco's shareholder return, especially as we navigate through our transformational changes. Lastly, we have strengthened our management team this year in several strategic areas throughout the company. In addition to other key initiatives -- in addition to other key additions I've mentioned in previous calls, we recently welcomed Scott Charlton to lead our Distribution Services team and fill the vacancy left by the retirement of Fred Lankford. Scott brings significant supply chain experience from the retail grocery industry, which will greatly benefit our company over time. As we look forward, we'll be managing our business by aligning around several core metrics: case growth and mix, gross profit dollar growth and cost per case. But we expect a modest level of continuing gross margin compression in the year ahead. We also expect to grow both our corporate and locally managed customer business and to once again reduce our overall cost per case. Considering these improvements and additional benefits from our business transformation initiatives, we would expect our earnings performance trends in fiscal 2014 to gradually improve. In closing, I would like to leave you with a few thoughts. With the support of our customers and suppliers and through the talents and efforts of generations of committed associates, Sysco has grown into a company that last year produced $44 billion in sales, as well as approximately $1 billion in both net earnings and free cash flow. We are proud to be the leader in the $235 billion foodservice industry that we participate in and take our leadership role very seriously. We recognized a few years ago that our industry's growth rate would begin to plateau, that the industry would undergo significant changes over time, and that we would need to change our business model if we were going to continue to expand our leadership position. We are currently in the midst of a multiyear business transformation that has touched nearly every part of our business, sales, marketing, merchandising, operations, technology, finance and business development, in order to continue the success we have enjoyed historically. We're making good progress on this journey, but that progress has not been as consistent as we would like, and there had been setbacks along the way. Driving change at this scope and magnitude is challenging. While a great deal of work lies ahead, I believe our strategy is sound, our execution will improve and that we are extremely well-positioned to solidify our foundation for delivering best-in-class customer service and profitable growth in the years to come. I want to thank all of our associates for their efforts this past year in supporting our customers. Their contributions are critical to fully realizing Sysco's vision to become our customers' most valued and trusted business partner. Now I'll turn things over to Chris so he could provide additional details on our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year.
Robert C. Kreidler: Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. For the fourth quarter, sales were $11.6 billion, or an increase of 5% compared to the prior year, mainly due to acquisitions, which increased sales by 2.1% and food cost inflation, which was 2%. Case volume increased 3% for the quarter; and case volume, excluding acquisitions, increased 0.8%. Changes in foreign exchange rates decreased sales by 0.1%. Gross profit in the fourth quarter increased 1.2%, and gross margin declined 66 basis points. Roughly 1/4 of the gross margin decline was due to the shift in customer mix as a result of faster growth in sales to large, regional and national customers. The remainder of the decline was driven by the difficult sales environment during the quarter and continued competitive pressure. Operating expenses increased $80 million, or 5.4%, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 compared to the prior year period. This increase was driven by an $18 million increase in retirement-related expense mainly due to higher 401(k) expenses and an $18 million increase in business transformation expenses. As a result of all of these factors, operating income decreased $56 million, or 10.8%. Net earnings for the fourth quarter were $283 million, a decrease of $26 million, or 8.5%, compared to the prior year. Diluted EPS was $0.47, an 11.3% decrease compared to the prior year. Adjusting for certain items, diluted EPS was $0.50 for the quarter. As we have discussed on previous calls, we believe it is important to focus on the performance of our underlying business, which excludes certain items, as well as business transformation expenses. To summarize the performance of our underlying business, adjusted operating expenses increased 4.9%, with the increase in retirement-related expense accounting for roughly 1 percentage point of the increase. Adjusted operating income decreased 7.3%. Adjusted net earnings declined 4.2%, and adjusted EPS declined 6.3% to $0.59. Turning to the year-over-year comparison. Sales increased 4.8%, or $2 billion, due mainly to inflation of 2.2% and acquisitions of 1.5%. Case volume increased 2.6%; and excluding acquisitions, case volume grew 1.3% for the year. Changes in foreign exchange rates did not have a meaningful impact. Gross profit increased 2.5% during the year, while gross margin decreased 39 basis points year-over-year to 17.7%. Approximately 1/3 of the decline was due to the shift in customer mix mentioned earlier. The remainder of decline in gross margin was due to weak restaurant traffic and competitive pressures. Operating expenses increased $423 million, or 7.3%, in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012. The increase in operating expenses was driven by several factors: first, business transformation expenses increased $137 million; second, certain items increased $58 million, mainly due to MEPP withdrawals and restructuring items; third, payroll costs, excluding retirement-related expenses, increased $48 million, driven by acquisitions, increased volume and higher delivery costs, partially offset by lower IT and sales costs as a result of our business transformation initiatives; fourth, depreciation and amortization expense, excluding business transformation expenses, increased $36 million due mainly to facilities and fleet put into service, as well as amortization on acquired intangible assets; fifth, fuel expense increased $19 million; and lastly, retirement plan expenses increased $10 million due to higher 401(k) expense, partially offset by lower pension expense following changes on our retirement programs that became effective this year. With regards to the last point on retirement-related expenses, it's important to recall that we had previously estimated that the pension expense would've been more than $100 million higher this year. However, due to our retirement plan restructuring, actual pension expense was more than $30 million lower year-over-year. While expenses from our enhanced 401(k) plan offset this benefit somewhat, overall retirement-related expenses, which includes both pension and 401(k), increased only $10 million this year. Our operational focus on expense management resulted in good cost per case performance for the year. After adjusting for certain items, cost per case in our Broadline organization declined year-over-year by more than $0.03, which is very difficult to do. Operating income declined $232 million, or 12%, for the fiscal year. Excluding certain items, operating income declined 9%. Net earnings for fiscal 2013 decreased $129 million, or 11.5%, compared to the prior year. Fiscal 2013 EPS was $1.67, a decline of 12%. Excluding certain items, EPS was $1.78. To summarize the performance of our underlying business, adjusted operating expenses increased 4.1%, adjusted operating income decreased 1.7%, adjusted net earnings grew 0.1% and adjusted EPS declined 0.5% to $2.14. Fiscal year 2013 has been a very active year for us in the acquisition arena, and as a result, we surpassed our stated goal of increasing sales from acquisitions by 0.5% to 1%. We completed 14 acquisitions during the year that, in the aggregate, totaled more than $1 billion in annualized sales. These acquisitions will enable us to better serve our customers, further expand our product offerings and service footprint and profitably grow our business. Each transaction has expanded our footprint in both current and new geographies, with 6 acquisitions in the U.S., 5 in Canada, 2 in Ireland and 1 in the Bahamas. They also spanned a number of different service capabilities, with 6 Broadline companies being acquired, 5 seafood specialty companies, 2 produce specialty companies and 1 systems distributor. Turning to the impact of the Business Transformation Project for a moment. For the fiscal year, project expenses totaled $331 million, including $77 million in depreciation and amortization expense. We capitalized $20 million related to the project. The cash outlay on the project was $274 million, or $48 million lower than prior year. All 3 of these metrics, expense, capital and cash, were in line with the guidance we gave for the year. As Bill mentioned, although we continue to accelerate specific functional initiatives to advance our business transformation efforts, we plan to implement enhancements to the broader SAP platform before continuing our enterprise-wide rollout schedule. We expect our next conversion to occur around the end of the calendar year. Our rollouts scheduled beyond that time will be determined once we are able to assess the success of the additional changes and enhancements we are making to the system. The transformation benefits achieved this year include significantly lower pension expenses, which we expect to decline even further in fiscal 2014. After restructuring our sales and IT organization, SG&A expenses are significantly lower than the prior year. We also enhanced compliance across the organization, with existing sourcing programs. In addition, as Bill mentioned, we made substantial progress on our category management initiative and expect to see specific benefits from these efforts in fiscal '14. Finally, we made progress on some of our operations initiatives, including completing implementation of the SAP maintenance module, beginning the realignment of incentive plans for our driver and warehouse personnel and beginning the implementation of enhanced routing processes to reduce miles traveled. As you'll recall, we had stated that we would achieve approximately 25% of the total targeted benefits of $550 million to $650 million in the first year fiscal 2013. We actually exceeded our targeted business transformation benefits for the year. Unfortunately, this progress has been masked by the current difficult business environment and general operating performance of the underlying business that did not meet our expectations. As a result, we no longer expect to achieve our previous EPS guidance of $2.50 to $2.75 by fiscal '15. Turning to our cash flow performance. Total capital expenditures were $512 million for fiscal 2013, in line with our guidance. We made good progress on our objective to better prioritize our capital expenditures this year, enabling us to reduce our spending by $273 million compared to last year. We've seen a decline in capital spending related to the Business Transformation Project, mainly driven by the fact that we began implementation of the new technology earlier this year and stopped capitalizing much of the expense. In the underlying business, we've seen lower capital spending because of a reduction in the number of major facilities projects this year compared to last, and a more disciplined capital allocation and approval process. In addition, a few construction projects moved from fiscal '13 to fiscal '14. As a result of the reduction in capital spending and increase in operating cash flow, free cash flow increased more than 60% year-over-year to $1 billion. Cash flow from operations was $1.5 billion for fiscal '13 compared to $1.4 billion in the prior year. Now turning to fiscal 2014 guidance for a moment. Regarding our acquisition activity, we expect acquisitions to add at least 1% to our sales growth each year going forward. Due to the amount and timing of acquisitions during fiscal '13, we will exceed this goal during fiscal '14. We expect just a carryover effect of deals done during fiscal '13 to add approximately 1% to fiscal '14's sales growth. And of course, we also expect to complete new transactions in fiscal '14, which will add additional sales growth during the year. We believe retirement-related expenses will decrease $75 million to $85 million overall in fiscal '14 versus fiscal '13 and $50 million to $60 million net of certain items which we recognized in fiscal '13. As a reminder, the change in retirement-related expense includes the impact of our defined benefit pension plan and our defined contribution, or 401(k), plan. As you'll see in the chart provided in our slide presentation, the majority of the reduction in the adjusted portion of these expenses, or the portion of the expenses excluding certain items, will occur in the second half of fiscal 2014. We expect fuel expense for the year to increase in the range of $10 million to $20 million. We currently have about 2/3 of our anticipated fuel needs locked in at prices lower than fiscal '13. We also expect to continue our trend of strong expense management in fiscal '14, with cost per case in our Broadline companies expected to decline by $0.05, aided by the reduction in retirement-related expense. We expect our capital expenditures in fiscal '14 will be $550 million to $600 million, including business transformation CapEx. This is somewhat higher than our actual spend this year and the guidance we've provided earlier this year because a few projects were reprioritized and shifted from fiscal '13 to fiscal '14. We currently expect business transformation expenses in fiscal '14 to be in the range of $300 million to $350 million, capital spend to be in a range of $5 million to $20 million and cash outlay to be in a range of $225 million to $275 million. All 3 of these ranges are consistent with our prior long-term business transformation guidance. Lastly, we continue to expect the approximately $550 million to $650 million in annual business transformation benefits to be achieved in fiscal 2015. As mentioned earlier, we exceeded our goal of realizing approximately 25% of the total benefit during fiscal '13. This increases our confidence in achieving our long-term guidance, which is to deliver a cumulative benefit of approximately 50% to 70% of the total targeted benefits in fiscal '14 and 100% of those benefits in fiscal '15. In closing, while we have seen recent positive developments in the overall economy, the recovery continues to be modest. We believe that, as a result, consumers had not yet fully recovered from the economic downturn. The foodservice industry is continuing to feel these effects, seen in generally low growth and strange traffic patterns. While our financial results reflect these challenges, we are working to improve on those elements of our business that we can control, including enhancing our product and service offering, improving our execution on the gross margin line, managing our costs, increasing our free cash flow, achieving our targeted business transformation benefits and addressing the requirements of our technology transformation in a prudent manner. The work we are doing will position us to take advantage of market trends, enhance our ability to grow our market share over the long term and expand our leadership position in the industry. With that, operator, we'll now take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse.
Edward J. Kelly - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: A couple of things for you. I was just hoping maybe we could start with the guidance and the 2015 guidance not being valid. You haven't really changed much. I don't -- from a business transformation standpoint, from a cost saving standpoint, so it sounds like it's, I guess, more sort of industry-related. When you gave the guidance, things weren't great, right? So I'm just trying to figure out what the moving pieces are on the difference today. Maybe you could just sort of help us frame that.
William J. DeLaney: Thanks, Ed. I'll start. I'll let Chris kind of get into it in a little more specific way. Obviously, we've given that a lot of thought as well. So if you go back to the way we've presented it, we had 3 buckets, we said A plus B equals C, and with A being a view of what we felt we could continue to grow the underlying business at a steady state. And that the implied guidance there was 4% or 5% growth. And then we had the $550 million to $650 million in cost savings, both on the operations side as well as product, with the goal being to get back to what Sysco's historically been, has been a company that's been able to produce consistent earnings growth. I would say this to you, obviously, the market's been difficult, but we've had some execution challenges, as we've acknowledged here today. I think the biggest thing I would say to you is the market and just the environment itself, I think, has just proven to be a lot tougher than what we thought it was going to be. We had baked in, like I said, 4% to 5% expectation that we would be able to continue to grow the business x the transformational cost savings, and that's not the case. So sure, there's been a lot of distractions and a lot of change going on. But on the one hand, it's disappointing to pull the guidance back. On the other hand, I think it reinforces the direction we're going in, which is we have to change this business model because if we hadn't gone down this road with business transformation in the broadest sense, we'd probably be looking at flat to very modest single-digit earnings growth. So I don't want to put it all on the consumer or the economy, but clearly, this market is tougher than what we anticipated at the time we put the guidance out. I'll let Chris give you his insights.
Robert C. Kreidler: Yes, the only thing I'll add is unfortunately, just math, which is, as Bill said, A plus B has to equal or should equal to C. We didn't expect A to be stagnant or go backwards. And so when you lose a year on a 3-year guidance, it just means your growth rates have to be that much higher. And when I just do the math with everything we've got going on, we expect to do good things. We expect there to be improvement, but I don't expect to see enough improvement to overcome that first year. So, as I said, we don't expect to achieve it in fiscal '15.
Edward J. Kelly - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And when you say sort of lose a year, is that kind of how we should think about setting our expectations? And from a -- I know you're not giving a number, but is it more or less kind of like a year delayed, is that how to think about it?
Robert C. Kreidler: Ed, I'm going to go with the comment you made. We're not giving a number at this point. Look, we're -- we've been at it, doing long-term projections. There's still a tremendous amount of uncertainty in what's going on out there right now, so we're not prepared at this moment to put a new set of guidance on the table. Look, what we said a number of years ago, I think, is still true today. We're trying to set this company up for long-term sustainable growth of a certain level. We've never really said what that level is because we've got to get at least some way through this business transformation to know what we're capable of achieving. But the whole goal is to set us up for long-term sustainable growth, not to hit a particular number, but to be able to grow a certain percentage or a certain amount every single year, regardless of what goes on in the market and what we're doing. And that's where we're trying to get to. So we're reassessing what we can achieve and by when, and we'll certainly come out and talk about that probably at the next Investor Day.
William J. DeLaney: Ed, I would echo that. The only thing I would add to it is, we've talked about '13 being a year of transition. And as I think about it, I think you need to look at '14 as the year that we begin to turn this thing, all right? So while we are not giving you specific guidance, I think we're signaling to you that we expect to see better trends on the top line and the bottom line. We've got our challenges, certainly, on the gross margin line. We've got a lot of good things going on, we think, in expense initiatives. So we feel good about the direction, we think we'll begin to turn it here this year. But to Chris' point, we need a little more time deeper into the year to see how we start the year out, get further along on the technology deployment and the CatMan working. We hope to come back with you with a little better perspective here later in the year.
Edward J. Kelly - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And then if I could just had one follow-up on that, Bill, thinking about gross profit per case, which I know is a metric you guys care a lot about, I mean, the best way we have to look at this, right, is to just look at volume growth versus gross profit dollar growth. And this quarter, we haven't seen it at this level really kind of since we saw deflation. So I was hoping you could just maybe talk about -- you mentioned competitive pressure in the marketplace, talk a little bit more about that. What's going on from a pricing standpoint on your end of the new business that you're bringing in, and just how you get this to improve next year.
William J. DeLaney: Sure. So if it's okay, I'm going to really combine the last 2 quarters, I think. So if you look at the third and fourth quarter, they were more similar than they were different. Things kind of bottomed out in February, I think, in terms of the market, from our perspective, in the third quarter; it began to trend up a little bit in terms of March and April; and we saw a fair amount of softness in June in terms of restaurant numbers and that kind of thing. So again, we're talking about a very choppy market here, but the reality is we only grew our gross profit dollars 2%. So while gross profit per case is an important metric, I would say again, what I look at the most is volume and the mix of that volume, locally managed within that street and then corporate managed, and then look at gross profit dollar growth. And the reality is the first half of the year, we grew it over 3%; in the second half of the year, only 2%, or maybe even a tad less; and then cost per case. So all those go together, but those are 3 high-level metrics I would continue to look at. And as you saw, we gave you a little more color on some of those this particular earnings release. I would say, as we start out the new year, there's tremendous emphasis within the company on that top line. I mean, you can grow your gross profit dollars in a lot of ways. So right now, we're very focused on the top line. We're focused on reenergizing our local and street sales growth, while still maintaining very strong corporate managed -- some of those high-volume chain business. So we need to keep the top line going in order to leverage the business. We need to drive our category management very effectively. We're off to a good start and it's early. We've got some other things that we're working on that we think over time, not so much this year, but in subsequent years, can help us mitigate some of the margin pressure. And we need to continue to look at the cost structure of the company. So again, I think you'll see gradual improvement this year. And to Chris' point and my point, I think we'll create the foundation for that to become more consistent in the years to come.
Operator: And we'll go next to John Heinbockel with Guggenheim.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: Bill, a couple of things with regard to pricing. So it looks like things got a bit worse this quarter. Was that -- do you find your investments, are they more proactive or reactive? And then maybe talk a little bit about analytics and ROI, because I always hit you guys on price elasticity. Did not look like a good ROI this quarter, how can you manage that better and maybe not make some price investments that are not productive? So that's kind of the big question.
William J. DeLaney: So, John, when you say ROI, you're talking about the ROI as it relates to pricing? Is that what you're getting at?
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: Yes, so when I think about it, you gave up 66 bps, and what you got back for it, it doesn't look like you got back what you'd like for it.
William J. DeLaney: No, we didn't. I mean, that's very fair, we didn't. And again, I would just repeat what I said a moment ago that, that has not escaped us. And we thought we were beginning to make some progress, but as the quarter unfolded, June in particular, we fell back there. So the way we're structured today, John, there's 2 ways to go at it. One is to continue to standardize and centralize more and more of what we're doing in terms of how we source the product, how we work through category management, how we create [ph] transfer pricing within the company to give our operating companies and our sales people as true a cost as we can and as competitive a cost as we can to price off of over time. Driving out these initial waves in category management will help us a great deal. And as I just alluded to, there are some other things we just need to do over time, very early days, very early exploratory work, where we need to bring more consistency to how we price. Not take pricing -- so think about it this way. A little under half of our revenue stream is priced by our marketing associates, so they have a fair amount of latitude there. And we want that because they're dealing with different customers at different points in time with different priorities, so we don't want to overly limit their latitude. At the same time, if you could see what we see, which I'm not going to let you see totally, there's a fair amount of volatility in those -- in that pricing that doesn't need to be there. And so I think not so much this year but over the next 2 to 3 years, we have an opportunity to standardize that with some things like scientific pricing, I will use that term for today, but there's other things as well. And so the idea would be to take some of the volatility out of the pricing, have more consistency, but still position that marketing associate to adapt to the needs of the customer locally. We don't want to move away from that because that is our bread and butter, and that really is part of how we think we differentiate ourselves. But no doubt about it, tough quarter, tough couple of quarters, and we're just going to have to dig ourselves out of it. And as I mentioned in my script, I think that gradually, you'll see the trends improve. And look, the bottom line here, John, is we need to do all that and continue to grow the top line and take cost out of the business.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: Do you think the MA pricing volatility, is that more then being reactionary or proactive? And how good a visibility do you think they have into their competitors' pricing?
William J. DeLaney: I don't know that much about the latter. Certainly, most of the accounts they call on are probably -- use probably 2 or 3 other competitors, so I certainly -- they certainly have some sense of it depending on the Items, obviously, the more competitive items. I don't know that it's proactive or reactive. What I'm getting at is not so much the volatility with a given MA, although there's some of that. What I'm talking about is the volatility -- or the variability, maybe is a better word, between MAs, between OpCos and similar items, and that just comes from having 7,000 different people pricing. So we need to strike a better balance between that variability but still being responsive to the needs of the individual customer. And we will, but it's going to take some time.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: And then lastly, on category management, do you think -- is one of the thrusts here going to be fewer SKUs, you buying -- giving more volume to certain vendors plus your costs going down and your ability to take pricing down along with that. Is that a key thrust to you or is that secondary?
William J. DeLaney: I wouldn't say it's secondary. I'd say it's in tandem with a broader goal. There's different ways to go at this and different people call category management or define category management in different ways. We've taken a more deliberate, what we think very thorough approach, which starts with gaining insights from our customers, from our suppliers in terms of what the needs are in the market, what the trends are in the market, and using that as an opportunity to not just eliminate SKUs but to create new SKUs as well. So certainly, there will be a SKU reduction aspect to it but that should be more of a benefit as opposed to a targeted goal as we position our inventory to be more in sync with what the marketplace demands. And then as you go through that, that should allow us to grow more effectively with our customers, bring more innovation to the work itself, address some of these trends more effectively, that I mentioned in my prepared remarks. And certainly, along the way, when you're able to identify those supplier partners who want to make the commitment to go down that road with you, you're able to identify shared savings that are good for both us, the supplier and the customer. So it's all of the above, John. To do this just to save money for 1 year or 2 is not enough. We need to do it, don't get me wrong. It's part of our cost savings initiative, but we need to do it in a way that we can grow the business over time as well.
Operator: And we'll go next to Meredith Adler with Barclays.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I would like to chat about cash flow. You did increase your free cash flow this year, but you also increased your spending on acquisitions, which was clearly a driver of revenues. So I'm just wondering about one of the benefits in the fourth quarter was working capital. How long do you think that lasts? What kind of -- what were the drivers of the better working capital? And is it a concern at all that if you take out of free cash flow, the dividend and the acquisition costs, you really were almost flat here, actually slightly negative, I think. So first, working capital and then the overall thoughts about cash flow.
Robert C. Kreidler: Yes, I'll start in your order. So on working capital, we did see some improvement in the fourth quarter. On a full year basis, just looking at it year-over-year, it was actually pretty close to flat for the same type of discussion we've had before. Our trends prior to the end of the year, we're going the wrong direction. Said another way, accounts receivable and inventory, we're going the wrong direction. We were making up for some but not all of that with accounts payable efforts. At the -- by the time we got to the end of the fourth quarter, we had balanced it out. And I believe working capital was a positive of only about $10 million at the end of the year. So working capital wasn't a significant driver on a year-over-year basis. And Meredith, I don't spend a tremendous amount of time looking at the quarters because there's seasonality in those numbers for working capital from one quarter to the next. But year-over-year, it was basically flat. Your -- second part of your question, do I have concerns about free cash flow being able to support dividend and acquisitions? I look at it differently. Acquisitions, we're actually adding EBITDA. As we bring those acquisitions then and we integrate them with the company early in the standalones whatever they are, they generate additional cash flow, which supports additional debt if we want to maintain the same debt to equity and debt ratios, if you will. Said another way, unless we're planning to continually reduce debt over time, we actually have the ability to leverage against acquisitions. So I look at acquisitions as being something we can buy with cash, we can borrow money, that's more of a financing discussion. That's why free cash flow doesn't take a deduction for acquisitions because you're actually buying new cash flows into the future.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division: That's fair. Maybe you just talk a little bit then about buybacks. It doesn't look like you did much this year. And you do -- not only are you buying additional EBITDA, but you're not a very leveraged company. Is there any thought about leveraging up a bit to buy back stock?
Robert C. Kreidler: Yes, we have and we'll continue to look at, our capital structure to make sure that it's appropriate for where we are and our strategies, et cetera. As I've said, and Bill has said, as we've talked on these calls and at conferences, we expect to generate additional free cash flow. You've seen it this year. We'll see it as we continue into the future. And we're constantly evaluating how we're going to put that new cash flow to work. Our goal would be to find strategic opportunities for that cash to put it to work for future growth. Barring that, we've got to look at other options.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And I just had one sort of housekeeping question. You had an unusually large amount of other income, I believe, this quarter. Was there anything in there that was unusual? Or should we expect a higher run rate of other income going forward?
Robert C. Kreidler: Now the only thing in there that was different, if you will, is we had an equity investment in a small company, HotSchedules, which we divested, and that was a gain -- there was a gain on that sale of, I want to say, $6 million, $6.5 million. Other than that, it wasn't significantly different than the run rate.
Operator: And next we'll go to Andrew Wolf with BB&T.
Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: I think, Bill, you mentioned that the conversion rate in the category management area was ahead of what you expected. What's driving that? Could you talk a little bit about that? Is it a price offer? Or is it sort of take it or leave it because you're taking out SKUs. Could you just give a little color around that?
William J. DeLaney: Yes, it's not take it or leave it. And again, the SKU thing is important, but the SKU is more -- the SKU reduction is more of a byproduct of the overall process, which, again, is to find ways to grow better, share savings with our suppliers and our customers. Look, Andy, we've had some big initiatives over the years, so I think we're getting a little bit better at being more realistic early days on what our expectations should be, so we didn't assume 100% conversion here. So what we're saying to you is early days. We're pleased with the response we're seeing with our sales force and with customers. And no, it's not take it or leave it, because customers always have options. So I think all I'm saying there to you is that we're pleased, and I think it's really attributed to there's a year of work that went into this in terms of preparation, work with the suppliers, work with the customers, and, in particular, with our sales force and operating companies. So we're moving fast, as I said, and there's a lot to get done. But I think our team at SMS has done a great job preparing our people to drive this out and that showed up in our results so far.
Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: I didn't mean to sound so much that way, but because to me, the conversion being above plan is actually a positive. Is it fair to say -- there's a lot of 1 column quite dead SKUs but very low productivity SKUs certainly for Sysco, and that some of the challenges to maybe tell the customer why that might be also a low productivity SKU for the customer?
William J. DeLaney: That's absolutely right. That's exactly what the deal is, Andy, and so that's kind of the opportunity that we have with each customer, whether they're street or, say, a big contract customers to sit there and go through their assortment, look at their movement, look at ours, look at these trends and these insights that we've been talking about and then jointly, make good business decisions on how they should move forward with their assortment. And as you do that, you're doing a fairly methodical or scientific way, you identify a lot of slow moving SKUs. You also identify, believe it or not, SKUs that we don't have or that the customer doesn't stock that they should be stocking in terms of where the marketplace is. So it is a double-edged opportunity, so to speak.
Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: And just one follow-up. I think it's more for Chris because -- Chris, I think I heard you say there's going to be -- your plan is to have 50% to 70% of the cumulative savings you identified, the middle -- the midrange. It seems like a pretty large variance. And what kind of unknowns are around that variance? Is it more of the execution side at Sysco or with SAP? Or is it more what the dynamics of the marketplace and maybe pricing and things like that?
Robert C. Kreidler: I'll start with the sector or the first point you made. It's not SAP, because, again, these initiatives do not rely upon the additional rollouts of the ERP system. We've tried to make that pretty clear. Yes, there are some uncertainties. So first and foremost, we're expecting a lot out of our category management initiatives. So as you'll recall, we have benefited in all 3 years from lower product cost. The first year was mainly higher compliance of sourcing. But during the first year, which we just completed, we had to ramp up all of the work that was necessary to start delivering real dollars on category management. Now we're right into the middle of that. So we're expecting a lot out of category management. We have a lot of assumptions and the models that support and justify what we think we're going to achieve. Now, we're out executing against those. So as Bill said, early weeks look good but we've got a long way to go on that one. We have additional operating initiatives, additional benefits that we expect to derive throughout the operational part of the organization. That's a lot of execution work. And so those are going to be the main headwinds, if you will. It's just a lot of execution work throughout the organization to get these things done and accomplished. The first year, I don't want to say it was easy. Nothing we did the first year was easy, especially when you're starting to play around with retirement costs and things of that nature. But there were things that were vastly within our control and we could execute on them fairly quickly. Now it's the harder stuff. It's into the trenches and doing all the down-and-dirty work to get the rest of the stuff done. So that's why we still have a fairly big range on that. I will say we gained a lot of confidence in the fact that we exceeded the first-year goals, so that certainly sets us up going in with some surplus. So we feel better about hitting that range.
Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: Very helpful. And I just wanted to double-check my takeaway on that. I didn't hear the -- you didn't talk about pricing. It was all sort of internal and execution. So it's not like Sysco could execute fairly flawlessly, head towards the higher end of that range, and yet the market got even more competitive or stayed as competitive as it is, and some of that, let's say in category management in particular, or all of it, the whole bucket, I should say, could go into the marketplace. I'm just thinking in terms of how you're thinking about things. I know obviously, anything could happen. But just how you're thinking of that variance?
Robert C. Kreidler: Yes, Andy, look, I'm going to back to our A plus B equals C. I mean, the way we account for the initiatives, as you kind of have to have a starting point and you've got to challenge the teams to realize their product cost savings, or operating cost savings versus that starting point, where we thought things were going to go based upon kind of trends, et cetera. And that's how we measure them. If something goes on in the underlying business, if something goes on in the marketplace that's definitely going to impact A, and so the overall numbers, the C part of that equation, are definitely going to be impacted as well. But the way we measure the benefits has to be off of a base case, if you will. Otherwise, it's a constant moving target and I have no way to talk about those, our success in that area or our progress in that area. So, again, I'm not avoiding your question at all, but B has to be measured off of the base case. The impacts you're talking about, pricing, competitiveness in the market, et cetera are definitely going to impact A.
William J. DeLaney: Yes, I think, Andy, I'll just add, and I don't want to get this thing too complicated. There are really 2 different things, as Chris points out. So we're out there, it's not just that we track it separately, we're creating the opportunity to grow and to create these product cost savings separately, we ultimately distribute those savings, the ones that -- so we share some of those with the suppliers and customers and then we keep some. And so the shared savings that we keep go out to our operating companies, but they also have a profit plan for the year as well. So they're not just going to unilaterally -- I know you're not suggesting that but I just want to be clear -- they're not just going to let that stuff leak in other than, to your and Chris' point, competitive conditions are going to be what they're going to be. So there's the pressure of the marketplace, which we need to continue to address in multiple ways, including enhancing our differentiation and everything else we've talked about earlier this morning, and then there's the savings themselves. So the way I would look at is I would look at these initiatives as being significant. I think that they can go on beyond the 2015. I think that's a big opportunity for Sysco. And they certainly mitigate the pressure that we see in the marketplace.
Operator: And next we'll go to John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.
John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I think they're related questions, and maybe, Bill, they -- you touched on them in your prepared remarks. Firstly, could you -- you mentioned nontraditional is more of a factor than it has been. I mean, I don't know if that's being referred to like warehouse club or an Amazon or something like that. So just kind of flesh out that statement that you made and what Sysco can do to respond to that, and then I'll have the follow-up as well.
William J. DeLaney: Sure, John. I think why I was doing that part of the prepared remarks was just trying to set an overall trend line over the last few years. So certainly, we're seeing group purchasing organizations have a bigger role over time. We work with a lot of them in contract business. To some extent, they are more involved in some larger street businesses today, which requires us to have a much more competitive bundle of goods and services. Certainly, the club stores and the cash and carry have made an impact, in particular, in this type of economy over the last 3 or 4 years. Amazon or Amazon-like business, we're certainly appropriately respectful of that channel and attempting to find ways that we might be able to participate in it. So that has not been that big of an impact to date, but it's all around us. We see it. We recognize it. And we're watching it very closely and, as I said, trying to identify areas where we may be able to participate. Certainly, one of the challenges with that channel was how do you do it profitably. And with our model, that's clearly very important. So those are 3 examples that we'll be talking about. And so it all comes back to us continuing to enhance our business model, perhaps over time finding the right type of acquisition opportunities that supplement our current capabilities.
John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And are most of your contract businesses that have franchise organizations on co-ops to date? Or is that something that you see as a risk of increasing in overall volumes?
William J. DeLaney: No, a lot of the big contract -- not a lot, but a few of the big contract folks we work with have their own purchasing or good purchasing organizations. And we're partnering with some of them in the large contracts. You see a lot of that in health care. We're not talking about is when it goes beyond that into some of your larger independent-type of business operators. So that's a trend that's been gradually moving over the last few years. And we combat it, but the best way to combat it, as I mentioned, is to continue to work on a very complete bundle of goods, services, pricing, all the things we're talking about. It's really -- it's somewhat disruptive but it's just another form of competition that's different than what we would've seen, say, 8 or 10 years ago. But in the end, you end up at the same place, which is this trade-off of value and price and that type of thing.
John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And I'll try to ask this question delicately. Sometimes, recently in the marketplace, you hear a certain marketing associate or a group of marketing associates didn't like some of the changes at Sysco made maybe to one of your competitors did something else and took some of the customers with them. So I mean, the question is with the changes how stable has your marketing associate organization been? Is it more stable now than it was, for example, 6 months ago? And I'm happy if you'd want to publicly correct me, I mean, to what extent has this really been kind of an issue that's been happening within the organization?
William J. DeLaney: Yes. So let me give you some context. I think in a normal year, we would have about 15% turnover of marketing associates, and that's considered good and that's what you want. I somewhat, delicately in my prepared remarks, talked about reducing unprofitable territories. So we are down significantly more marketing associates right now year-over-year. And that's been a trend over the last 12 months. We haven't talked a lot about it publicly because it's been gradual, and from a competitive standpoint, it didn't really make a lot of sense to talk about that stuff publicly. But I would acknowledge what you said. Certainly, when you lose people, any associates, but particularly salespeople, sales managers, and if they were to go to the competition, that does create some challenges for whatever, 3, 6, 9 months. Not all of them go to the competitions, some of them leave the industry as well. So yes, what we are trying to signal there -- and I appreciate the question, is that we initiated that change in an effort to optimize our sales force and to improve productivity. And there's a downside to that on the top line. And that's lingering here a little bit, but I think to answer your question, what I also said is we're through most of that right now. Certain operating companies dealt with it better than others. And so I think as '14 unfolds, the sales force, sales management structure, all that's beginning to stabilize and we're in a much better place than where we were 6 or 9 months ago to go forward.
Operator: And we'll go next to Ajay Jain with Cantor Fitzgerald.
Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: Bill, I think you indicated in the past that with all of the industry headwinds and even some of the more company-specific challenges that you're dealing with, that all of those issues further justify the investment in business transformation. So I just want to ask maybe a variation -- maybe Andy's question earlier, about your confidence level on getting the projected cost savings in fiscal '14 that are supposed to offset the continued spending. I mean, clearly, pension and retirement-related expenses should be a tailwind for you. But I think the guidance you provided calls for about $200 million of incremental cost savings. So it sounds like, in response to Andy's question, that you're fairly confident about the cost reduction goal. But could you maybe discuss the different components of the incremental cost saves and how much of that you expect to get from procurement benefits specifically?
William J. DeLaney: I might let Chris take or dodge the second part of that. But just in general, I would agree with your initial caveat in terms of the assessment. I would say this to you: If you look at it, we call this out pretty much in our remarks in the last couple of calls. We've made very good strides on the SG&A side for all the reasons you just cited. So pension, some of the things we've done in IT, and there's been some pain along the way with that. Our folks have done a good job rolling that out, but we've had some challenges and our customers, at times, had to experience some of the downsides when you move quickly in some of those areas. Where we didn't do a particularly good job in the expense side this year was on the operations side. Right from the get-go, transportation got away from us and we actually backed up during our cost per case in operations. I think that came out on one of the slides that Neil and Shannon presented here this morning. So I think as the year goes along, the SG&A cost savings will begin to plateau out. I think you'll still see some in the early part of the year, they'll begin to plateau. And I think you'll see -- with one exception, which is the pension that Chris talked about. So if you just look at basic SG&A x pension, you'll see some in the early part of the year, I think, that will plateau out a little bit, cost per piece. I think you'll see operating cost per piece begin to improve. In fact, I think it already has begun to improve from a trend standpoint. But we're still up versus a year ago. So I think that will improve as the year goes along. And then, yes, we are looking for significantly more on the product cost savings to the category management as the year goes along as well, particularly in the, I'd say, the second 2/3 of the year.
Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: Okay. And I think you guys indicated that you came in ahead of your expectations for fiscal '13 on the cost savings. Would it be possible to just confirm the actual number?
Robert C. Kreidler: No, we're probably not going to give out the number. Here's -- let me try to handle it this way. I'm not going to completely dodge your question, Ajay, but there is a slide in the presentation. I don't know if you've actually seen it yet. I encourage you to pull it up afterwards. It's already posted, it's Slide 14. But it's an update to what we showed you at CAGNY. And what you'll see on there is we kind of put buckets for '13, '14 and '15 on the savings we expected from each. And the '13 bucket is full, and you'll actually see that we started filling in the '14 bucket a little ways. And that represents kind of the overage. So if you want to take out your slide rule, maybe you can interpolate, I'm not encouraging you to do that, but we did deliver more than we expected in '13, and that's what we're trying to represent there. And that's why we have confidence that we'll get to our range midpoint, high-end, wherever. We'll get within the range of our goals for '14 as well. We never have broken down exactly how much the benefit is going to come in each of the areas each of the years. What we did say early on is that the $600 million, half of it roughly would be in lowering cost of goods and the other half would be in lowering cost of operations. We've also said that we got ahead in our SG&A initiatives. Our operating cost initiatives were slower to come. We were roughly on track with our category management, frankly fell behind a little bit at the end of '13, mainly because the way I track those is I assume that the benefits are going to cover the direct costs of doing that, and we had some additional consulting costs that, frankly, we didn't cover. And so we don't believe that we actually hit all of that number in '13, which was primarily sourcing, as I said a few minutes ago, not category management. So we'd cast them to make up some ground in '14 and I understand that. So as Bill said, the big things for '14, category management is going to deliver a lot and we're counting on that. But we also have a lot of operating initiatives that we're counting on similar to deliver benefit. So we talked early -- or at least I talked in my opening remarks about a $0.05 cost per case reduction, which is our expectation for the year, and that's inclusive of initiatives and everything else. That's hard to do, and the way you accomplish that is, first, offsetting the natural cost increases that come every year, which -- so we got to cover those, and then also find ways to drive that cost down. So retirement, restructuring helps doing that -- helps us do that, and then some of the stuff that we still have left to do this year in terms of routing efficiencies, warehouse, things of that nature, that's got to continue to drive those costs down. So I know that's not a lot of specifics for you, Ajay, but I want to keep it in context with the guidance that we provided you in the past.
Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: Okay. That was actually very helpful. I just had one final question around issues related to customer mix. I think you had mentioned that one aspect of the mix issue is your sort of end market exposure to independents. But in terms of what's mostly behind the gross margin performance, it sounded like -- Chris, like based on your prepared comments, roughly 1/4 of that decline was purely mix related, and then the rest was impacted by underlying demand from your street account customers and based on market condition. So I just wanted to ask how much of the gross margin weakness do you think is market-share driven, loss of share to other Broadline distributors? And to the extent that you're dealing with competitive headwinds to other food service distributors, I also wanted to ask if you expect any relief on competitive pressures heading into fiscal '14?
William J. DeLaney: Ajay, you hit a nerve there, so I'm going to start and I'll let Chris dive in. Look, I don't think we're losing any market share to other Broadline competitors, okay? We don't really know where the industry is at right now, but there's no reason to believe that this industry is growing the first 6 months of the year. So there may be some other people, some of the nontraditional ones, that are taking share from the Broadliners as a group. But on an overall basis, I would say to you we believe we're continuing to take share. I would acknowledge on the local and independent operator side, there's some markets where we're getting beat a little bit right now. But overall, I don't think we're getting beat. And I just wanted to kind of get that out there before Chris cleans this up.
Robert C. Kreidler: I don't know that I'm going to touch that one now. Look, Ajay, good question. There are a lot of ways that we can cut up, chop up gross margin changes year-over-year. And some of that makes sense and some, frankly, that I don't believe do make sense. All we're really trying to pull out now, because we're not trying to put a bunch of excuses out there, is mix. Because we continue to say mix is somewhat, frankly, it's not one we're going to apologize for, because as long as we continue to grow our business in all quadrants, we have the potential for mix reduction. It's not that we're disappointed that we're growing in our corporate managed sales, it's that we're not growing fast enough in our locally managed sales. So we're not really apologizing for the mix, we're just kind of cutting it out so that you all know what the impact is. I mean, similarly, the acquisitions that we've done, the vast majority of them were done right around the calendar year end. Those things typically come in at lower margins, right? And it takes a while for us to get them to our margins. So that's part of the impact. I'm not calling it out because I'm not asking to present it as an excuse. I don't have the analytics around it. But there are things like that, that impact that margin, in addition to a dozen other things we've talked about, in addition to competitive pressure, et cetera, et cetera. All we're really saying is, what we were trying to, I don't know, 8 quarters ago, delineate all the different things that are impacting gross margins, frankly, they're all in the same set of competitive pressures that we've got to continue to fight and overcome. And we're just going to call out the ones -- the one that we talked about, which is mix, which is kind of very real and that we should be able to give you more insight in as we go forward.
Operator: And we'll go next to Karen Short with Deutsche Bank.
Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank AG: Just a couple of questions. In terms of your comments on fiscal '14, I think the term or the wording was fiscal '14 is kind of a year where things start to turn around. Is that assuming no change in the economic environment or a slight improvement? Can you just give us a little color there?
William J. DeLaney: Well, we would hope for slight improvement. That always helps. But no, that would assume pretty much the same environment, Karen. Maybe little bit of improvement, but what it's really geared at is just we feel we have locked in some of these cost savings that Chris referenced. We recognize that we need to continue to work on the gross margin. But we just think we're better positioned going forward today than we have been in some time. I think the cash flow performance from last year could serve as a leading indicator of the type of progress, hopefully, we can make. We'll see. But bottom line is -- I know it's hard to see sometimes when you're looking at the numbers being reported. But in this type of business, you feel things getting better before you see it, and then you see it and then it shows up in the numbers. And what we've tried to signal today's comments and Q&A, is we think we can grow the top line, we've got a lot of good things going on in acquisitions. We think we're on top of our cost structure, we'll continue to make strides there, and we need to manage the margin better. And we've got good initiatives going on there to do that.
Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank AG: Okay. And then the next question is given that you are kind of starting to get, I guess, out of the woods in terms of this SAP implementation, wondering what your appetite might be for a larger acquisition? I mean, you've obviously demonstrated an appetite for smaller ones. But as you can kind of shift gears and maybe focus your attention on something else, do you have an appetite for larger acquisitions, if it were available?
William J. DeLaney: We have an appetite for larger acquisitions, the right kind of acquisitions. I would break it down into 2 different times. I mean, if there was an opportunity to do some things, say it was more adjacent or maybe different geographic markets of size, those would probably be easier for us to absorb at this point in time. If it was in our core space, I'd like to see us get further down the road on both the technology deployment and the category management. But assuming that those initiatives go well here over the next 6 to 9 months, I think we'd be in a better position operationally to absorb something like that.
Operator: . And we'll take our last question from Mark Wiltamuth with Jefferies.
Mark Wiltamuth: Question, you had mentioned in the transcript there that you've seen more attention from customers asking for fresh and natural products. And how do you really address that since you seem to be more focused on packaged and canned and products of that nature? And are you losing any share to some of the more specialty purveyors on perishables?
William J. DeLaney: Okay, Mark, it's Bill. Look, this is a trend that we've seen coming for quite a while. We're doing -- just as an aside, I mean, we're doing a lot of really nice things in our sustainability work, which -- I'll let you review that report, it's out there online. But in terms of the business itself, I would just remind everybody, we're a full Broadline distributor and we have several specialty companies; meat, produce, imports, et cetera, et cetera. So there's really very little product out there that we can't distribute. We work very closely both with local suppliers and farmers as we do with regional and national suppliers. So the challenge there, really in all honesty, is to identify where the demand is and the volume, and create enough volume to justify bringing the SKU in and the cost of distributing those SKUs. So it just comes down to essentially locking in on the right opportunity for the right customer, and there's no reason why we can't participate there. I will acknowledge that, that's an area that we maybe historically have not been as strong at, but I think you'll see us continue to grow there, both through our core business, as we said, and potentially, through more acquisitions, as we've made in the past.
Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Is the challenge there that it's really a diffuse set of expectations from the customers, you can't really hone in on a set of SKUs that works across the board?
William J. DeLaney: It's multiple challenges. One is that, yes. And I think -- but I think to me, frankly, the bigger challenge is just breaking down what do the words mean. So fresh is one thing, natural is another and local's a third. And so, is local better? Is it fresh? That kind of thing. So it essentially just comes down to really understanding the needs of the customer, why they are looking for that product and making sure we're all clear on what the advantages are. So some of these words tend to get co-mingled but they're all very different in terms of what they mean. So we're just trying to create as much clarity as we can with the customer, and then we can work with all types of suppliers, as I've mentioned, to be responsive there.
Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: And on the SAP issue, what is really tied to that in terms of the cost savings? Is it accounting duplication that you'll be getting rid of? Or what things are gated there? Because you are hitting your marks and exceeding them on the cost savings to date, but there must be some things tied to the SAP that you're aiming at for the next couple of years for cost saves?
Robert C. Kreidler: Yes. Once we get the full SAP platform rolled out, there will be some additional savings. Now some of it, at least some of the savings that we originally identified, we accelerated. The maintenance module is already out and installed, so we are accelerating that. The HR module will come out. We will accelerate that. What's left is going to be a few areas, one, yes, finance will be one of them. There'll be some additional labor savings out in the field as we consolidate more work into our shared services center and a few other functions. There will be some ancillary savings from having that fully rolled out and being able to fully ramp up our shared services center and get the labor arbitrage that usually comes with doing that.
Operator: And this does conclude today's conference. We appreciate your participation.

Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Sysco's Third Quarter Fiscal 2013 Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. We will begin today's call with opening remarks and introductions. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Neil Russell, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Neil A. Russell: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today, you will hear from Bill DeLaney, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Kreidler, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, please note that statements made during this presentation that state the company's or management's intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ in a material manner. Additional information that could cause results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's SEC filings. This includes, but is not limited to, risk factors contained in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2012, and in the press release issued earlier this morning, which is posted in the Investors section at sysco.com. Non-GAAP financial measures are included in our comments today and in the presentation slides. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the applicable GAAP measures are included at the end of the presentation, which can also be found in the Investors section of our website. All comments about earnings per share refer to diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. In addition, all references to case volume growth include total Broadline and SYGMA combined. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill DeLaney.
William J. DeLaney: Thank you, Neil, and good morning, everyone. This morning, Sysco reported sales of $10.9 billion for the third quarter and net earnings of $201 million. Earnings per share was $0.34, and adjusted EPS, representing our underlying business performance, was $0.49 a share, a 2% decrease from the prior year. As reflected in these results, the third quarter proved to be very difficult operationally for many of our customers and, as a result, for the vast majority of our operating companies. A number of factors impacted consumers' willingness to spend on food away from home, including higher tax rates, tax refund delays, stubbornly high unemployment, high gas prices and, in some parts of the geographies we service, unfavorable weather conditions. Consumers appear to have become increasingly judicious with their disposable income, and it's clear from the decline in restaurant traffic in January and February that going out to eat has not been a high priority of late. While an extended winter has continued to challenge us in certain markets through April, we view most of these trends as cyclical in nature and expect overall market conditions to gradually improve as we move into the remainder of the calendar year. In assessing our financial performance for the quarter, let me be clear on one very important point. Although external headwinds created significant pressure on our operations, we did not execute our business plan across the organization as consistently as we should have. We must memorize the unevenness of our operating performance within Sysco, and we will. Sales grew 4% for the quarter. While that growth was primarily driven by the impact of acquisitions and pricing, we did experience solid growth with several of our large regional and national customers, especially on the institutional side of the business, by leveraging our broad supply chain capabilities and geographic coverage. However, many of our restaurant customers struggled to grow during the quarter for reasons I mentioned earlier. Specifically, sales dollar growth with our street customers, who are largely independent restaurant operators, was soft for the quarter. This group of customers comprises a significant portion of our overall volume and an even greater percentage of our profitability because of the high level of value-added services we typically provide them. Thus, even though we did a fairly good job of managing gross margins at the customer segment level, the impact of customer mix changes contributed to our growing gross profit dollars by only 2% over the prior year. Notwithstanding what we believe to be cyclical industry headwinds, we remain confident in our ability to profitably grow our market share over the long term. The key to our future success will be driving our strategic initiatives in conjunction with Sysco's overall business transformation efforts. Turning to our multiyear business transformation initiatives. To date, we have completed the rollout of the full SAP system to 5 operating companies. All 5 locations are running their business reasonably well, and we have seen improved system performance in recent weeks. As we have further evaluated system performance following our 2 deployments in Dallas and West Texas, we focused our thinking on 2 potential paths forward. We could either, one, proceed with our previously communicated rollout schedule and continue to work on enhancements at the same time; or two, continue to accelerate specific functional initiatives, such as human resources and general ledger accounting, while allowing the team to focus all of their time and effort on implementing enhancements to the broader SAP platform. We believe the latter option is the better approach for the following reasons: one, it allows us to continue to make substantial transformation progress while making future deployments easier and less complicated; and two, it also allows us to more effectively balance benefits, cost, risk and speed. It is important to note that the vast majority of the system functionality is performing as designed. However, as we have previously communicated, we do have issues that need to be addressed, such as pricing complexity and the inventory management functionality, before moving forward with a revised rollout schedule. We have isolated and understand the cause of these issues and are executing against a solid plan to remedy them. In the meantime, we're continuing our efforts to standardize, centralize and technology-enable many of our business processes. As we announced previously, we recently completed the rollout to all U.S. Broadline operating companies of both our CRM and SAP maintenance modules. Other similar efforts have been progressing rapidly. We have completed the rollout of the HR SAP module to 26 locations, with 4 going live every 2 weeks, and expect to complete the transition of our general ledger accounting functions to SBS in 42 locations by fiscal year end. We expect to complete the rollout of both of these initiatives to all U.S. Broadline locations by the end of the calendar year. We've also begun setting up master data files across the enterprise and are bringing locations on to this module in anticipation of the broader SAP rollout. This prepares us for a more rapid deployment in the future. To that end, we have restarted our operating company deployment preparation process and anticipate the enterprise-wide rollout to pick back up again around the end of the calendar year, and we will provide updates accordingly. Importantly, I should note that the revision of the rollout schedule will not impact the timing of the approximately $600 million in annual benefits from operating product costs targeted for fiscal 2015. Those benefits do not rely on the ERP system. We believe we are generally on track to achieve those savings within the time line we previously communicated. Leading our technology transformation effort is Wayne Shurts, who joined us this past October as Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer. He has extensive experience in leading IT organizations, including large SAP deployments, and I'm confident in his ability to lead us through this period of vital change. Wayne recently began to move forward on a major reorganization, which is designed to streamline and more effectively integrate our IT department and technology deployment teams. In so doing, he has and will continue to recruit individuals that are highly experienced in SAP and large systems implementations. We also continue to make solid progress on several of our other strategic initiatives. We recently completed the acquisition of Bahamas Food Service, which adds another attractive geographic market to our portfolio and provides a solid foundation for future growth. We are excited about welcoming Ben Frisch and his team to the Sysco family, and Chris will provide additional details on all of our acquisition activities in a few minutes. Our customer insight work continues to identify opportunities to provide enhanced value to our customers and more effectively establish Sysco's corporate brand. We continue to roll out and train our sales management and marketing associates on our new CRM tool so as to create a more efficient and effective sales process in this critical channel. We have added to and strengthened our merchandising team at all levels of management in preparation for rolling out our category management process to our customers in the coming weeks. Four categories comprise the pilot wave and represent nearly $1 billion in annual spend. A key step in building out our capabilities in this all-important area of our business was the hiring of Tom Bene as Executive Vice President and Chief Merchandising Officer. Tom joined us in mid-April and will oversee our merchandising and supply chain activities as well as work closely with our sales, marketing and operations teams. As I conclude my prepared remarks, I would like to leave you with a few thoughts. Sysco is the clear leader in the $235 billion foodservice marketplace. While our industry has recently experienced some pronounced short-term pressures and has not consistently participated in the modest economic recovery to date, we expect this industry to achieve 1% to 2% annualized real growth over the long term. We have consistently grown our market share since our inception more than 40 years ago, and we are committed to continuing to do so in a profitable manner. Our industry has and will continue to experience significant change. We have proactively developed a solid strategy to expand our leadership position over the long term by renewing our focus on enhancing our customers' experience with Sysco so as to create ongoing profitable growth and strong free cash flow for our shareholders. We are driving our transformational change throughout Sysco. We must do so in order to realize our full potential as an enterprise. But such change is difficult and may result in uneven performance on our part in the short term. Through the exceptional talents and dedicated efforts of our 47,000 associates, we remain highly committed to, and focused on, providing outstanding value to our customers and shareholders as we move forward. Now I'll turn things over to Chris so he can provide additional details on our financial results for the third quarter.
Robert C. Kreidler: Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter, sales were $10.9 billion or an increase of 4.0% compared to the prior year, driven by case volume growth of 1.7% and food cost inflation of 2.4%. Acquisitions within the last 12 months increased sales by 1.8%. Changes in foreign exchange rates decreased sales by 0.1%. Gross profit in the third quarter increased 2.1%. Gross margin in the third quarter declined 34 basis points, and roughly half of this decline was due to the shift in customer mix as a result of faster growth in large regional and national customers. The remainder of the decline in gross margin was driven by the difficult sales environment during the quarter and continued competitive pressure. While we experienced good case growth in our large national and regional customers, our street case volume was particularly soft during the quarter. Overall, our case growth, excluding acquisitions, declined 0.2%. Operating expenses increased $140 million, or 9.8%, in the third quarter of fiscal 2013 compared to the prior year period. Operating expenses for the quarter include $50 million in certain items, including a $41 million charge to withdraw from an underfunded multiemployer pension plan and $9 million in restructuring items mainly related to the freeze of our executive retirement plans. We provided guidance on both of these charges in an 8-K filed in January as well as during our last earnings call. Compared to the prior year period, certain items drove $46 million of the increase in operating expenses. Increased Business Transformation costs accounted for an additional $34 million of the operating expense increase. Lastly, salaries and related costs increased operating expenses by $22 million due mainly to increased 401(k) expense, acquisitions and higher delivery costs, partially offset by transformation benefits related to sales organization changes and our IT restructuring. As a result of all these items, operating income decreased $102 million or 23%. Net earnings for the third quarter were $201 million, a decrease of $58 million, or 22%, compared to the prior year. Diluted EPS was $0.34 per share, a 23% decrease compared to the prior year. Adjusting for certain items, such as the changes related to the MEPP withdrawal and restructuring retirement plans, diluted EPS was $0.40 per share for the quarter. As we have discussed on previous calls, we believe it's important to focus on the performance of our underlying business, which not only excludes the $50 million in certain items but also excludes Business Transformation expenses. To summarize the performance of our underlying business as we go through our Business Transformation, adjusted operating expenses increased 4.4%, adjusted operating income decreased 4.4%, adjusted net earnings declined 1.4% and adjusted EPS declined 2% to $0.49 per share. We continue to be very active in the acquisition arena and have surpassed our stated goal of increasing sales from acquisitions by 0.5% to 1%. As Bill mentioned, in April, we completed the acquisition of Bahamas Food Service, a Broadline distributor based in the Bahamas. BFS has annualized sales of approximately $200 million. This acquisition further expands Sysco's international footprint and provides an even greater breadth and depth of products and services for our BFS customers. BFS is the leader in the Bahamian market, which has meaningful growth potential. We also believe that there are some synergies to be achieved between BFS and IFG, our international division that ships products throughout the Caribbean. Including this acquisition, to date in fiscal 2013, we have completed 11 transactions that, in the aggregate, approach nearly $1 billion in annualized sales. Turning to the impact of the Business Transformation Project for a moment. In the third quarter, project expenses totaled $83 million, and we capitalized $4 million related to the project. In the prior year quarter, project expenses totaled $49 million, and we capitalized $44 million related to the project. As Bill mentioned, although we continue to accelerate specific functional initiatives, we are going to implement enhancements to the broader SAP platform before continuing our enterprise-wide rollout schedule. As a result, we will not convert any additional operating companies this fiscal year. Our rollout schedule in fiscal '14 will be determined once we are able to assess the success and timing of the additional changes and enhancements we are making to this system. Our prior guidance for the run rate of project costs was $300 million to $350 million annually, and we still expect to be in that range for fiscal 2013. We'll be reassessing the ongoing costs over the next several months as we make these additional changes and enhancements. I want to reiterate that the changes to the timing of the deployment of the broader ERP platform have no impact on the approximately $600 million of annual benefits targeted for fiscal 2015. And as Bill mentioned, we believe we are generally on track to achieve these benefits. Examples of our progress so far include: expenses related to our retirement plans are significantly lower than they would have been had we not frozen all of our old plans, and we expect them to decline further next year; after restructuring our sales organization, expenses are significantly lower than the prior year; after restructuring our IT department, expenses are lower year-over-year. We're also making progress on our category management initiatives as we begin to roll out pilot categories to our customers, and the ongoing work of additional waves continues at a good pace. In addition, we are enhancing compliance across the organization with existing sourcing programs. Finally, we are making progress on some of the operations initiatives, including implementing our maintenance module and realigning our incentive plans for our driver and warehouse personnel. Unfortunately, this progress has been masked by the current difficult business environment and general operating performance of the underlying business that did not meet our expectations. Turning to our cash flow performance. At our Investor Day and recently again at CAGNY this year, we discussed our plans to gradually reduce capital expenditures back to historic rates. We've made good progress on this objective with capital expenditures declining $260 million in the first 39 weeks of this year compared to last year. We've seen a decline in capital spending related to the Business Transformation Project mainly driven by the fact that we began implementation of the new technology earlier this year. In the underlying business, we've seen lower capital spending because of a reduction in the number of major facilities projects this year compared to last and a more disciplined capital allocation and approval process. As a result of the reduction in capital spending, free cash flow increased 40% year-over-year to $386 million. We expect the impact of continued lower capital spending this year will contribute to an improvement in free cash flow in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012. Cash flow from operations was flat year-over-year for the quarter and decreased $149 million for the first 39 weeks, primarily driven by the decline in net income. Turning to a couple of guidance items for a moment. We now believe our capital expenditures for the year will be $550 million to $575 million. This is lower than our previous guidance of $600 million to $650 million, partially due to the timing of certain construction projects, which will increase fiscal 2014 as compared to prior guidance. We continue to expect fuel expense for the year to increase in a range of $10 million to $20 million. Right now, it looks likely that we will come in at the high end of that range, although fuel prices have been recently trending down. In closing, the current economic recovery continues to be modest and marked by inconsistent consumer trends and unforeseen headwinds. The foodservice industry environment and our financial results reflect these challenges. However, we are working to improve on those elements of our business that we can control, including enhancing our product and service offering, managing our costs, increasing our free cash flow, achieving our targeted Business Transformation benefits and addressing the requirements of our technology transformation in a prudent manner. We also continue to ramp up our acquisition pipeline. The work we are doing will position us to take advantage of market trends as the health of the consumer recovers, enhance our ability to grow our market share over the long term and expand upon our leadership position in the industry. With that, operator, we'll now take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Karen Short with BMO Capital Markets.
Ryan Gilligan: This is actually Ryan Gilligan on for Karen. Can you guys talk about the competitive environment maybe by customer type? Is the weakness with the independent customers due entirely to the environment? Or are you losing some share there?
William J. DeLaney: That's -- I would say the competitive environment overall is about the same as it's been the last 2 or 3 years. It certainly feels a little more acute right now just because of, I think, the pressure on a lot of our customers, but I don't know that it's any worse. It's hard for me to really measure that. I would say to you I think the competitive environment may be a little more acute or a little tougher with the smaller restaurant operators, that type of thing, where they're particularly under pressure, but that's more conjecture on my part than anything else. We don't have great data on that.
Ryan Gilligan: Okay. And switching to the category management initiative. Can you guys talk about how your customers and marketing associates are reacting to it, at least in the pilot categories?
William J. DeLaney: Yes. We've spent several weeks, and now months, working internally with our merchandising folks here and our operating companies. We've had meetings at all levels, including the presidents and VPs of sales and merchandising. We've run this out through our sales meetings, and that's still going on. So we haven't launched yet, but we would hope to launch these categories here over the next few weeks, as we said. Now it's being very well received. Obviously, people are very interested to see where the pricing is going to come in and that type of thing, but we've done a nice job, I think, in communicating internally. We're working well with our suppliers. And again, this is a different approach than what we've taken in the past with sourcing, whereas we're focusing on the assortment being broader and less redundant. We're looking to partner with our suppliers and customers to grow the business and take cost out at the same time. So we're optimistic. The one caution I guess would be this is something that we've never done before and really no one in this industry has done the way we're approaching it. So we expect that there'll be some challenges as we go forward, but at this point our people are very excited about it.
Operator: And we'll now take our next question from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: So a couple of things. So first, Bill, do you think -- when you look at the macro environment, what, if anything, can you guys do to stimulate demand with your customers and be comfortable that the price elasticity, if that's what drives it, is acceptable?
William J. DeLaney: Yes, I think, John, what we have to do is focus on the micro environment. So the macro -- we've talked for a while now, you're very familiar with us and this industry. What I tried to lay out in my prepared comments is that we still think this industry is going to grow at modest levels, 1%, 1.5%, 2% maybe, but there's going to be some peaks and valleys and we're in a little bit of a trough right now, especially on the restaurant side. Last year, we saw more growth. First half of this year, we saw more growth. So I think the key is these strategic initiatives that we've been discussing, and this is where we're going places where we haven't been before. So it starts with the customer, John. We have excellent service levels out there in terms of how our MAs provide support to their customers, our on-time deliveries, we're in stock, all that type of thing. We perform at a very high level. Now from the customer's perspective, probably the other guys have gotten better over time, so that gap isn't as big. But in reality, we're compared to how we did last week. So we need to continue to do well operationally from a basic service standpoint, but we need to also differentiate ourselves more and more. So it starts with better understanding what's important to the customer. And we've got some good work going on there with Bill Goetz and his marketing team. I think that will take us to some segment work, where, when you look at that 1% to 2% growth, probably most of that is going to come in ethnic segments, and we're going to have to continue to strengthen our ability to focus in on those groups, focus in on certain geographies where we have a lot more upside from a market share standpoint, that type of thing. We believe category management over the long term will be very good for our customers and for Sysco. And again, we're approaching that in a very balanced way, both from a growth and from a cost savings standpoint. And Sysco Ventures, while it's still very much in its development stage, we're hoping to have a platform in place there soon, where we can augment our product offerings with several services and technology-based business solutions that should create greater traction with our customers as well. So when -- again, when I talk about we've got a proactive strategy for a new world, a new environment, those are 3 or 4 of the things that I'm trying to focus on.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: What do you think you get most out of category management? Is that more a benefit in terms of purchasing? Is it more getting the assortment right geographically? What do you think are the one or 2 big wins there?
William J. DeLaney: I think in the short term, there are certainly savings on the gross product cost savings side. But I think over the medium term, it will help us work with our customers and focus more on creating an assortment that is more relevant to their marketplace and will allow them to grow their business more effectively rather than have a lot of redundant SKUs, and not just in our warehouses but, to some extent, in their pantry as well. So I think it starts certainly with the cost savings, but it will only be successful, fully successful, if we're able to grow our business and support our customers' growth at the same time.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: Then lastly, the $500 million you talked about, that's a gross benefit, correct?
William J. DeLaney: I'm not sure the -- what $500 million are you talking about?
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: Well, because what I'm thinking about -- as you push out the implementation of ERP, do the -- that -- you would -- that pushes out the cost of the program or no?
Robert C. Kreidler: The actual implementation cost, yes, of course.
William J. DeLaney: Yes. Yes, sure. But where we're focused on right now -- I'll let Chris jump in here. But, I mean, what we're focused on right now, John, is getting a really good handle on what's the most effective way to go forward here over the next 2 or 3 years in terms of deployment, and we'll be assessing the annual cost as we do that. So we've got to look at pace, and we've got to look at annual cost at the same time.
Robert C. Kreidler: John, was your question about the approximately $600 million of annualized benefits we've referred to?
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: Yes, yes.
Robert C. Kreidler: Okay.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: What about these...
Robert C. Kreidler: Yes. So first and foremost, both Bill and I have said that those are not impacted by the timing of our ERP rollout. Secondly, we would -- we actually don't characterize those as gross costs. To the extent that we have costs associated with implementation, we're actually -- we have to cover those. But we expect that $600 million to be net.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: Over and above implementation cost?
Robert C. Kreidler: That is correct, yes.
William J. DeLaney: And John, I'm not trying to confuse this, but...
Robert C. Kreidler: Well, hang on, John, let me -- I can go -- I'm going to cut you off. They're separate categories. $300 million to $350 million is an actual operating -- or implementation expense, operating expense around ERP, we're going to have that, and we'll continue to give you annual guidance on that. The $600 million is a gross benefit, yes. We don't net the 2 together. If you want to do that, feel free to do that.
William J. DeLaney: Right.
Robert C. Kreidler: But the benefit that we look at is that $600 million, which we would hope to be even more than that as we get further out, we've only given 3 years of guidance, that will be with us forever and ever. The implementation cost will eventually go away.
William J. DeLaney: That's what I was going to say, but Chris said it better. Thanks.
Operator: And we'll now move to Andrew Wolf with BB&T Capital Markets.
Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: A follow-up on the $600 million savings. I'm looking at the Investor Day presentation, where a little over half was SG&A and the rest from COGS. Is that still roughly how you're thinking of it? Second, Chris, you mentioned restructuring, sales, your retirement plans, other things. Could you give us sort of the run rate of what you have achieved in dollars and I guess build a bridge using the cost of goods sold and category management to get to the $600 million?
Robert C. Kreidler: Yes, well, I probably won't go so far as to build a bridge for you, but let me start with the top of your question and work my way to the bottom. So we did say $550 million to $650 million. We're just saying approximately $600 million midpoint. We said about 25% of that would be in the first year. So roughly, call it the midpoint, $150 million-ish worth of benefits for the first year. We do believe we're on track in the first year. We laid out kind of how we were going to get there, and you obviously have looked at the slides in terms of there'll be a component that's SG&A, there'll be a component that's lower cost of goods. We've kind of said in different calls we're getting to our number. We're not getting there exactly the way we thought we would get there. So some of the front-end stuff, restructuring our pension plans, et cetera, very painful, very difficult stuff to do, but you can do it rather quickly. So we got to that fairly fast. The SG&A component and specifically the S part of that, the sales component, that's work that's been done. And frankly, we thought it would take longer to get to that, and it happened a little sooner than we thought. And then some of the, what I'll call operating expense reductions and initiatives out in the field, given the environment, those are coming along slower than we thought. They're a little harder. We haven't tried to give you a bridge on the retirement planning stuff. That's a little bit difficult. We did, I think, telegraph what the overall savings are this year compared to what they would have been, which I believe is about $85 million better than what they would have been with the discount rates and the other factors that go into that calculation. On a year-over-year basis, they're $15 million to $20 million worse than last year. So we've given you that. And then the only other thing, I think, we've tried to telegraph to you without numbers is the expenses will be frankly higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year on that increase. So $15 million to $20 million year-over-year higher, but you actually get a little benefit in the first part of the year and detriment in the last part of the year just because of the way the accounting works. Next year, we expect those costs will go down further as the run rate kicks in.
Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: Okay. And just on the bridge idea, I can appreciate you not wanting to update that or spend the whole call on that. But is it fair to say the cost of goods sold component is the majority or the largest part of what's to come?
Robert C. Kreidler: I would say actually no. The way we worked out the $600 million, it almost equally balanced between the lower cost of goods and then lower operating costs. The timing of those is different. The category management initiatives are back-end loaded because there's a much longer ramp-up period, there's a testing period, there's a pilot period and then you start delivering wave after wave. So we've talked a lot about the 4 pilot categories. We're now to the point where they actually get rolled out, and then you have waves that come after them. So year 1 is pretty light in terms of lower cost of goods. A lot of what we're getting in year 1 we've said would be from additional sourcing initiatives, specifically better compliance around sourcing. We are seeing that. Category management has ramped up really well, and now we've got to see benefits from category management in year 2 and even more in year 3. So the timing is not equal, but the overall benefit from each of those 2 major components is about equal in the $600 million figure.
William J. DeLaney: Yes. Andy, I think the other thing I would add to that is on the SG&A, Chris is on point we've -- we're off to a fast start there. I think you'll see more of that in year 2 on the admin side as some of the pension benefits kick in again next year. So we're doing a little better there than we planned on the SG&A side. Not quite as well on the operating cost savings. That's turned out to be a little more complex than what we thought. But we are -- we have turned the corner there, and we're expecting to see good improvement. We managed our expenses actually pretty well in the third quarter given the environment at the operating company level, and I think we'll see good results there over the balance of this year and next year. And then the COGS, Chris nailed that as well. We -- the first year, what was implied in those savings was pretty modest, more about sourcing. So year 2 becomes the first big year on the category management. Now look, we haven't even launched it yet, so we'll talk more about it as we get into it and see what's working and what some of the challenges are. A little color on that. It's a massive undertaking. We've strengthened the team quite a bit, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. And we feel good about the savings. But it may take a little longer to roll this out than what we originally thought, but we also expect the benefits to continue beyond the third year here as well. So we're excited about that, but, again, we've got a lot of work to do here over the next few months.
Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: And just lastly on the same subject, now how do you think about sharing the savings with customers to drive market share or just help their business so they can increase their same-store sales through lower menu prices? And -- or it's sort of being presented, at least the way that I'm hearing it, as if it's sort of all slated to go to shareholders and earnings power directly. But could it go more indirectly through supporting your customers?
William J. DeLaney: You must be talking to our competitors, I guess. That's not the way we're presenting it. Look, what we've tried to do here over the last few years, Andy, we are sourcing work as we've further developed our supply chain work and some of our internal transfer pricing. The whole key here is for us to continue to get better at providing our operating companies with what we call market-relevant pricing. And that's easier -- that's an easier figure to quantify and determine in some categories than it is in others. So what we will do is we will lock in some pretty meaningful gross savings. And as appropriate, we would expect to pass along some of those savings to our customers to make sure that our sales people are properly positioned on the street with good, solid pricing. And I think you'll probably see us, early days, invest some money in promotions, too, just to help grease the skids, here. Because this is change, and we think it's good change, but any change is difficult these days. So I think you'll see us invest in price to some extent, to the extent that we think that's appropriate, and also some promotional activity.
Robert C. Kreidler: And Andy, as we calculated the potential benefits from category management, we made the assumption we would have to, need to, want to pass through some of the cost savings down to the customer level. As Bill said, some just to get the market-relevant pricing and some just more temporary promotional-type spending. So those numbers are built into our estimates. We've already learned in the pilot categories in some places we were a little conservative, in some places we were too aggressive. We expect we'll get that in every wave, but we've made an estimate and it's in those numbers already.
Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: Okay. So you're saying the $250 million to $300 million is net of what we're talking about?
Robert C. Kreidler: It is net of our estimate of what we believe we will need to pass down to make this work all the way through to the customer level, that's correct. Now again, as Bill said, we're at the point where we're going to the customer. So we're about to see how good our estimates are.
Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: Last quick question. Has volume picked up any in March and in April?
William J. DeLaney: I'd say the trends are a little bit better, but the problem is February was just ugly. And so we just saw a significant falloff as you see in some of the restaurant publications in February. So I'd say it's still been somewhat soft here in March and April, but the trends are better than what we saw in February.
Operator: We'll now move to Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse.
Edward J. Kelly - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Bill, you talked about volume getting better throughout the year. Is that just based on what you said about sort of March, April? Or are you expecting volume to get better incrementally on top of that?
William J. DeLaney: I think what I'm trying to say, Ed, is we got hit with a lot of things, our customers got hit with a lot of things in this past quarter, and I think some of that will cycle out. So, I mean, if you guys go back and listen, I've probably done 25 calls since I've been back here 6 years. I hate talking about weather. But -- I don't think you'd find that I've talked about it hardly at all. But we have had weather issues going back to last year where it was a very favorable winter. This year, some strange weather in some different places. And even in April, we've seen an extended winter and all that type of thing. So I think some of that will run its course and that, that should help us a little bit. I'm not going to say it's dramatic, but it's a piece of it. I think some things I've touched on the -- however you want to quantify the impact of the FICA taxes and that type of thing, I think that did impact the consumer. So the key for us is the mindset of the consumer. That's what will drive them back into our customers in a bigger way and a more regular way than what we've seen. I'm not really talking about Friday night and Saturday night. I'm talking about family specials on Wednesday and business trade maybe a little bit more during the week. So I just think some of these things we've run into are somewhat more short term or cyclical in nature, and I would expect them to ease over the balance of the calendar year.
Edward J. Kelly - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And just -- I wanted to clarify a couple of things on the cost savings program and ERP. Are you -- I think are you telling us you're still expecting 50% to 70% of the cost savings in 2014. Is that right?
Robert C. Kreidler: Yes, we've not changed our guidance over the 3-year period. Obviously, we're building our plans right now for fiscal '14, so we're going to be taking a much closer look at where we think we'll be. But our 3-year guidance, the $600 million over the 3 years, we're good with that. The pace and sequence of that, as Bill and I have both said, we're ahead in some areas, behind in others. We've got to take a look at '14 specifically. We typically provide you guidance. To the extent we provide guidance, we provide it in our fourth quarter call so you can expect some more information from us then if we're going to change anything. But right now, like I say I -- we're making good progress in a lot of areas. As I've said in my prepared comments, it's being masked by a lot of the other stuff that's going on, unfortunately.
Edward J. Kelly - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And to that as well, the costs associated with the program, it sounds like possibly could be higher in '14 than the $300 million, $350 million? Is that a fair way to think about it?
Robert C. Kreidler: I'm not sure what we might have said that led you to that conclusion. We're -- we-- obviously, we've got to take a look at that as we make the changes and enhancements that Bill and I both referred to in the system and start to relaunch. Look, if anything, I'm kind of looking at those costs like this. We took up a lot of pain to get to the place we're at now, which is we're at a run rate of somewhere in the $300 million to $350 million range annually. So that's now built into our expenses, as painful as it was to get here. We're going to be very, very cautious about allowing that number to go any higher, and we're going to work very, very diligently to try to figure out a way to actually implement this thing at a lower annual run rate. That's work that we're doing right now. Wayne and his team are working very hard to figure out ways to do it less expensively. I'm not sure we're going to accomplish it, but that's our goal.
Edward J. Kelly - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And then when you gave 2015 guidance, a lot has kind of transpired between now and then. Should we as investors assume that, that 2015 guidance is good until you were to actively address it?
Robert C. Kreidler: Yes, that's kind of a normal -- the normal rule is unless we change the guidance, we still believe in it. Look, we're not trying to sugarcoat anything. It's been tough here. When you give 3 years of guidance and your first year comes out of the box weak, it makes it hard to still see a path to your third year. But we're one year into it. So we're going to be relooking at all of that and see whether we still have a path to achieve it. Again, I've talked about the underlying business has to continue to perform. We've got to hit on all cylinders on the initiatives and the benefits we're going to achieve there to get to that guidance. We feel pretty good about the initiatives. The underlying business, unfortunately with the headwinds, we're struggling with a little bit. So we've got to hit on all cylinders to be able to get certainly to the top end of that guidance. Whether we're in the middle or at the low end of that guidance still is something we'll work through as we update our planning.
Edward J. Kelly - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. Just one last question for you on sort of balance sheet, cash flows. Your working capital to, I guess, if you look sort of year-to-date, it's been a little bit of headwind. I was hoping you could just talk specifically about working capital management, especially as sort of inventory up about 8% year-over-year and I think receivables are up 10%, something like that. So just what your thoughts are there.
Robert C. Kreidler: Yes, it's -- the story has really not changed since my comments last quarter. We continue to make progress on accounts payable, and we actually made maybe another $100 million of ground on accounts payable in this last quarter on a year-over-year basis. But we lost about $200 million combined between inventory and accounts receivable. Part of that is we are continuing to grow with our large regional and national customers, and they typically have longer receivable cycles. And so that -- I'll call that a mix issue, but it's certainly something that's affecting the number. We had some preestablished contractual changes that allowed for days to go out a little further on a couple of customers. So that's in there as well. Inventory is a tricky issue because while we realize it's going the wrong direction or certainly it's going a way we'd rather it not, for working capital purposes, you can't just try to shut it down too quickly because it does affect service levels. So we're being very prudent and careful in how we look at moderating or slowing down the growth in inventory, and we're putting in place or at least working on plans that we can put in place to start to bring that back down. It is going to be slower progress than I had hoped it would be, so we're doing what we can, which is on accounts payable. We're trying to make sure we manage accounts receivable and not let it extend further. And then inventory is something that's going to take a little longer to bring back into control.
Operator: Our next question will be from Meredith Adler with Barclays.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I'd like to start just with what you said at the very beginning about the change in how you're going to roll out the ERP system. It might be helpful if you could divide up the functions or the tasks that it will do and tell us what's delayed, which I'm assuming is the warehouse management part of it, and what parts of it are still being rolled out, which I think is HR and general ledger. Am I understanding that right?
William J. DeLaney: Okay. Let me start here, Meredith, and I'll let Chris help me out. So let's go back to the beginning. Warehouse and delivery are not part of the ERP rollout. We have excellent systems, and from day one, we never included those in the deployments. So those systems are the best-in-breed and operating fine. Obviously, they need to be interfaced with SAP, and we're -- so there's no issue there. The hub of the system, the operating system itself, is more on the sales inventory replenishment, purchasing side of the business as well as, over time, the financial reporting, all right? So what we're saying -- I'm going to go the end first and come back. So what we're saying is we're making good progress with some things we can do without fully rolling out the entire integrated SAP system with the general ledger system moving into SBS. With our, what we call our human resource module, with our maintenance module that we're using in our shops. And separately from that, with our CRM module, which we've integrated with -- from Salesforce.com. So those things are all moving along well, and we expect a couple of them are fully deployed already, as we mentioned, in the U.S. and the other 2 will be fully deployed, we expect, by the end of the calendar year. Where the delay is or where we're doing more work is on the sales purchasing inventory replenishment side, pricing side of the business. Again, I would say to you the vast majority of the system is highly functional. It's just not -- there's pieces of it that are not as functional as it needs to be for us to run this business at the level that we run it at. And we've made the decision to step back and allow our deployment teams to focus 100% of their time on addressing those issues across-the-board on the SAP platform, while the other teams can continue to drive up these other modules. And we just felt that, that's a more prudent way to go, to get better depth and better focus in terms of what the issues are and remedy these things somewhat more cohesively. Rather than try to continue to -- we could have rolled out a few more companies but to continue to do that and work on these other issues with the system just dilutes people's attention and creates resource needs, and we felt that, that was not the way to go at this stage of the game.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division: And the category management effort, you don't need to have the SAP system in terms of pricing, inventory management, inventory replenishment, purchasing. You don't need that to do category management?
William J. DeLaney: At some point it would have facilitated a great deal, but we don't need it to roll out category management.
Robert C. Kreidler: Yes, we have systems that we've operated with for, well, much longer than I've been here, for at least a decade, that can certainly handle everything that we're trying to accomplish with category management. It will be easier, more efficient and faster when we have the new system in place.
William J. DeLaney: So, I mean, at some point, the reason we're going forward here, at some point we do need an end-to-end system to run this business and have visibility to what's gone into a very complex business. But to begin to roll it out, we do not need it.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then I have a question, sort of follow to Ed's question about working capital. You had a very big sale of treasury stock in the latest quarter, bigger -- even if you look at the purchase of treasury stock, it was substantially higher. Could you just talk about what prompted you to do that? And it does seem to me that it helped fund the dividend. Is that an alternative to borrowing?
Robert C. Kreidler: Yes, it's not something we did. It was the exercise of options. And so the stock got to a high place it hadn't been in a while, and we have a lot of employees that have been sitting on options, a number of which were expiring this year. And so we saw quite a bit of option exercise during the quarter to the tune of, I want to say, about $500 million, or I -- actually, I think that's the year-to-date number, about $500 million, a lot of which came in the third quarter. So it's not something we did to finance anything. It's something, frankly, the employees have the right to do whenever they want to exercise as long as they follow the guidelines.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division: But my -- the second part of my question is if you hadn't gotten that option exercising, how would -- would you have had an issue funding the dividend?
Robert C. Kreidler: No, we...
William J. DeLaney: We have no issue funding the dividend. We have a very strong credit rating, and we have a tremendous amount of debt capacity.
Robert C. Kreidler: Yes, I mean...
Robert C. Kreidler: We have fewer shares outstanding.
Robert C. Kreidler: And Meredith, we -- I mean, I know you understand our cash flow statements very, very well. We start with just the amount of cash we produce from the business. And then frankly, everything after that becomes a discretionary item and you just determine your priorities. The dividend is a priority for us. So a lot of what we're doing in terms of becoming more efficient with our capital expenditure is to drive more cash to the bottom line in terms of free cash flow. That is just more cash available to do whatever we think the shareholders would like us to do, one of which we know is the dividend. So we have plenty of available cash from operations as well as borrowing capacity.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Yes, no doubt about the borrowing capacity. And then I had a question about Mother's Day. I know you've been kind enough to update us on April. Mother's Day, I believe, is one of the very biggest holidays that impact the restaurant industry. Can you -- and we're less than a week away. I'm a mother, I can say that. Any comment on how that's shaping up? Or do you think it makes a continuation of the weakness that we've seen so far?
William J. DeLaney: Well, first of all, Happy Mother's Day. Yes, it's -- today's day one of Mother's Day Week for us, Meredith. So a little early to tell. Neil won't let me give daily guidance on sales. So typically, the way these shape up is we generally have this week and there's a week right around when the schools go back in session maybe the week before Labor Day, which typically are our 2 biggest weeks of the year. So we would expect to have a big week. But the reality is the toughest comparisons are the big weeks against big weeks. So I'm not sure to what extent there'll be an increase or how big of an increase. But the one thing you can pretty much count on is almost everybody goes out for some type of meal on Mother's Day weekend, and we would certainly expect to benefit from that.
Operator: Our next question will be from Ajay Jain with Cantor Fitzgerald.
Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: I wanted to just get your feedback on the softness that's -- specifically in your street account business that, Bill, I think you talked about in your prepared comments. I guess, as it relates to the street accounts, that has both sales and margin implications. So is there anything specific you can point to in terms of the underlying volume trends in terms of what was behind the decline sequentially in Q3? And can you also comment on whether you're seeing any pickup in the sales environment in the current quarter? I guess that's another variation of some of the questions that were asked earlier, but I just -- I'm asking in the context of your higher margin, your independent restaurant operators.
William J. DeLaney: Yes, Ajay, well, I can just try to give a little color here. And if I'm nailing it, just follow up. But I think the biggest thing we're trying to bring out -- so if you look at the quarter, it's a -- I think it's largely a sales story. We manage margins reasonably well at the segment level. We actually did a decent job managing our cost per case in the oPCos. That's hard to see with all the back and forth in some of the expense numbers, but I'll share that with you. But the restaurant segment in particular, we saw across-the-board a lot of pressure on most of our restaurant customers, whether they were independent or whether they were contract customers. The difference is that restaurants make up a larger piece, a very large piece, of our "street business." So I think the big story here is right, it was a tough order for restaurants. That's a big piece of our street business, and our street business is a -- has a disproportionately higher profitability in particular on the gross margin line, so -- because of the value-added services that we provide. So if you just do the math, I mean, if you look at the first half of the year, our gross profit dollars were up about 3.5%, I think it was 3.4%. And they're up about 2%, 2.1% this quarter. So I'm not laying all of that on the street side, but I think it's a big piece of it. And so when your street business doesn't grow at the same rate and that, in fact, has very modest growth, that puts pressure on your gross profit dollars, and that's what we saw on both of those lines, both the top line and the gross profit line. As far as trends, I think I addressed that earlier. Technically, I can tell you the trends are better, but that's more function of February was just very difficult. It's still somewhat soft in our business right now. I still think some of that is cyclical. And to Meredith's question, I think May and June will be a much better barometer in our business.
Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: Okay. And then just shifting gears. On ERP, I think when you gave your preliminary outlook for fiscal '13, it was -- I think it was clear that a lot of the anticipated cost savings were not necessarily related to Business Transformation. I think you confirmed that today from a longer-term perspective through fiscal '15. But with 3 quarters in now, can you just quantify how much of the intended cost savings you've been able to achieve? And I know you're also confirming that you're on track for $600 million of cost savings by fiscal '15, but can you give some frame of reference for again, on where you are year-to-date and if $150 million of cost benefits are -- is that still the right number for this year?
Robert C. Kreidler: Yes, Ajay, as I think I said earlier, we're on track for the 25% of the $600-ish million in year 1. We're on track to achieve that for year 1. We're not going to get into the quarter-by-quarter assessment of where we are. And frankly, that's always going to be something hard and difficult to pull out of our numbers, but we feel pretty good about where we are for this year. And as we said, we feel good about the 3-year run rate as well. That's pretty much the extent that we're going to go.
William J. DeLaney: Yes, I think Chris said this earlier, Ajay. Look, when you look at the 3 big pieces of what we've laid out here in the road map, there's an assumption of an underlying growth rate of the business. We've talked about 4% to 6%. So if you'd use the midpoint of 5%, then there's the $600 million, which is, as we've discussed now at length, half of that, give or take, is operating cost, half of it is cost of goods, okay? And then there's the investment we're making annually in the deployment of the technology platform. So I think we're generally on track on those last 2. We not as far along as we'd like to be on the deployments, but in terms of expense and benefits, we're generally on track. Clearly, for this year, we're not seeing the 5% growth in the business that's in that road map. So we either need to make it up in benefits, which we're not putting that on the table today, and hopefully we'll get a better market environment here and better execution on our part over the next couple of years.
Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: Okay. And just one final question. Now I know you don't want to get into quarterly projections. But on the project expenses, you indicated that $300 million to $350 million is still the right range for this year. But that still leaves a lot of variability for Q4. So is there any way you can give some more specificity on the expenses for Q4?
Robert C. Kreidler: Not on Q4. I'll tell you for the year, based on my current forecast, so I got 3 years of -- or 3 quarters of actual and forecast for 1 quarter. I mean, we're in that -- we're in the top part of that range, but we're -- right now, we're not really at risk of going over that range.
Operator: We'll now take our next question from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.
Amod Gautam - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: It's Amod Gautam filling in for John. The first question was on the ERP and Business Transformation in terms of how it's affecting -- whether or not you're getting a better view on individual account profitability. In other words, could your number of accounts and/or market share potentially drop, but would more efficient pricing and logistics allow increased profitability?
William J. DeLaney: I don't think we're far enough along to really give you a great answer to that question. I think what we will have and certainly one of the benefits of an end-to-end system is we're going to have a better view on what we call or what some people call activity-based costing. So I think we will have a better view of profitability. And I'm sure -- well, we've done a lot of customer stratification here over the last 5 or 6 years, so I'm sure that we will have some earnings there. I think generally, we have a pretty good handle on how we make money. And so I don't know that there'll be significant falloff there in terms of customers. There might be an opportunity to sit down and have a more balanced discussion on our costs versus their costs and how we make the whole thing work together. That's typically how we try to work. I think the key for us really is as we get better visibility to our costs and what our customers' needs are to continue down that differentiation path and explore different channels, that may be more cost effective for our customers. So we're, as you know, a very traditional Broadline distributor, and there may be opportunities, whether it's inside sales or other vehicles for people to purchase food in ways that we typically don't provide to them, and perhaps there'll be an opportunity for us to get into those adjacencies. And that's certainly one of the things that we talked about in terms of how we can grow the potential for the business over time.
Amod Gautam - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then in terms of the acquisitional environment, I know you've talked -- you've got -- both of you have commented for some time that it's been somewhat a favorable acquisition environment that's driving growth above the long-term 50 to 100 basis points that you've talked to. Is that something we should continue to expect? Or are changes to the ERP rollout and potentially some pushout of the -- some CapEx, is that going to affect your acquisitional strategy in any way?
Robert C. Kreidler: It should not affect it. The types of deals that we discuss and that we've been talking a lot about this year are kind of our pipeline deals. They're small enough to where they can be fairly easily integrated into the system. We're not really concerned about an ERP rollout with those types of transactions. And then as far as CapEx, we actually -- when we talk about CapEx, that's kind of a separate line item. It does not include acquisitions themselves. So we still intend to -- I'm sure next year, we'll probably be giving guidance that at least 1% is our goal and our target. As we go forward, we'll update you to make sure that's -- what our guidance is going to be. But I think we've built a robust enough pipeline to feel good about maintaining that kind of 1%-plus range for the foreseeable future.
Operator: And we'll now move to an Erin Lash with Morningstar.
Erin Swanson Lash - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: Most of my questions have been asked and answered. So I was wondering if you could talk about the marketing relationship that you've had with Chef Robert Irvine and the Food Network in general, and maybe any additional thoughts as to the traction that you're seeing from those efforts or any additional opportunities you see from leveraging that relationship.
William J. DeLaney: Yes, thanks, Erin. So we just completed our first season with the Food Network and with Chef Irvine. As those of you came to CAGNY, he's a very compelling speaker and very enthusiastic supporter of Sysco. We've had very good response. The goal here going in was to create greater brand identity in terms of the corporate brand. Our research told us that 70% -- a little over 70% of our customers actually watch the Food Network in search of ideas to help them run their business better. He has this show, Restaurant: Impossible, that goes out and frankly does what we try to do it in a different way, which is to help our customers be more successful in their business. So that whole partnership is off to a very good start. It's created some goodwill, I guess for lack of a better term, with our sales force and at a time when we're throwing a lot of change at our sales force. And we've talked a lot about the market this morning, so it's been a difficult out there on the street. So very well received there. He has done some in-person functions in different locales that we're located in, and it's just created tremendous enthusiasm and tremendous goodwill, and we do believe that it's resonating with our customer base. So it's still early, but we're very excited about the relationship and hope to continue to grow it.
Operator: And with that, if there are no further questions, I'd like to conclude the conference today and thank you, everyone, for your participation.

William J. DeLaney: Thank you, Neil. Good morning, everyone. This morning, Sysco reported sales of $10.8 billion for the second quarter and net earnings of $221 million. Earnings per share was $0.38 and adjusted EPS, representing our underlying business performance, was $0.49 or 4.3% increase year-over-year. During the quarter, solid case volume growth contributed the highest second quarter sales level in our history. This growth was driven by both acquisition and organic growth as we were particularly successful in growing with our large regional and national customers. Adjusted operating income grew nearly 5% for the quarter. Gross margin trends improved for the third consecutive quarter but were lower than the prior year due in part to the change in customer mix I just noted. We were especially pleased with our expense control performance in the selling and administrative areas of our business, as we benefited from successful implementation of several strategic initiatives. However, managing our expenses on the operating side of the business was challenging, as fuel and payroll costs grew at a faster rate than our productivity improvements. To date, in fiscal year 2013, we have completed 10 acquisitions representing approximately $775 million in annualized revenue and expanding our presence in the United States, Canada and Ireland. The acquisition environment remains favorable, and we continue to have a number of additional opportunities in the pipeline. Our core market potential approximates $235 billion and grew by about 1% in real terms in calendar year 2012. Based on preliminary industry data, we believe we grew our market share this past year at a rate consistent with our strong historical performance. However, consumer sentiment and restaurant traffic trends have softened of late due to ongoing economic pressures, reinforcing the need for Sysco to aggressively transform our business so that we remain well positioned to provide greater value to our customers and reduce our overall cost pressure. Two critical components to deepening our customer relationships are more effectively marketing the Sysco brand and gaining greater insight into our customer's value and how we can most effectively address those needs. We are making good progress in both of these areas under the leadership of Bill Goetz, Senior Vice President of Marketing, who joined Sysco about a year ago. One development that we are very excited about is our recently announced marketing relationship with the Food Network, its highly rated show Restaurant: Impossible and its chef, Robert Irvine. This is a first for Sysco, and we believe it will enhance our brand, strengthen our relationships with existing customers and extend our reach to new customers. This multi-platform relationship will include TV commercials and show product integration, digital integration and personal appearances by Chef Irvine. Turning to the technology appointment portion of our multi-year business transformation efforts, we are making progress at our operating companies in North Texas and West Texas, where we deployed our new ERP system in November. Particularly encouraging has been the improved functionality of the order entry system compared to earlier rollouts. In addition, our shared business service center, SBS, continues to ramp up to support a broader array of administrative functions in a centralized manner. We have encountered some challenges, however, in the recent rollouts and are in the process of proceeding to make additional changes to further enhance the functionality of the system. We are confident that we will be able to resolve these matters as we move forward, and we'll refine our deployment rollout schedule accordingly. At the same time, we continue to move forward with other aspects of transforming our business. In closing, I would like to thank all of our customers for their support as we move through our business transformation journey. I would also like to recognize all of our associates for their ongoing dedication and commitment to Sysco's success, especially those that put forth tremendous effort to service our customers in the midst of Hurricane Sandy and its aftermath. The transformational change that we are currently navigating throughout Sysco is both extraordinary and foundational to our profitable growth in the years to come. Now I'll turn things over to Chris so he can provide additional details on our financial results for the second quarter.
Robert C. Kreidler: Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. For the second quarter, sales were $10.8 billion or an increase of 5.4% compared to the prior year, driven by a case volume growth of 2.8% and food cost inflation of 2.5%. In addition, acquisitions within the last 12 months increased sales by 1.1%. Changes in foreign exchange rates increased sales by 0.3%. Gross profit in the second quarter increased 3.9%. Gross margin in the second quarter declined 26 basis points. Roughly 1/2 of this decline was caused by a slight shift in customer mix as a result of growth in large regional and national customers. The remainder of the decline can be attributed to continued competitive pressure and a difficult sales environment that softened further during the quarter. Operating expenses increased $116 million or 8.2% in the second quarter of fiscal 2013 compared to the prior-year period, driven mainly by a $45 million increase in business transformation expenses and a $17 million increase in salaries and related costs. In addition, during the second quarter, we recognized $22 million in charges from certain items related mainly to severance from the restructuring of our IT function, which we discussed last quarter and the restructuring of our executive retirement plan, which we discussed in the 8-K we filed on January 16. As a result of all of these items, operating income decreased $44 million or 10.4%. Net earnings for the second quarter were $221 million, a decrease of $29 million or 11.5% compared to the prior year. Diluted EPS was $0.38, an 11.6% decrease compared to the prior year. As you know, Hurricane Sandy had a devastating impact on a large part of the country during the second quarter. We have been deeply saddened by the tremendous personal and professional toll it has taken on our customers and the communities we serve. Our operations and crisis management team did a tremendous job protecting our assets before the storm and in helping our customers recover afterwards. In addition, as in many natural disaster events, Sysco played a key role in ensuring first responders can serve the community. While we avoided substantial asset losses, we estimate that the storm and its aftermath cost us about $0.01 a share during the quarter. As we have discussed on previous calls, we believe it is important to focus on the performance of our underlying business, which not only excludes the $22 million in certain items I just mentioned, but also excludes business transformation expenses. To summarize the performance of our underlying business as we go through our business transformation: adjusted operating expenses increased 3.7%, slightly lower than the growth in gross profit dollars; adjusted operating income increased 4.6%; adjusted net earnings grew 4.7%; and adjusted EPS grew 4.3% to $0.49 per share. As Bill mentioned, the acquisition environment is currently quite favorable, and we have been very active in this area. To date, in fiscal 2013, we have completed 10 acquisitions with annualized revenues totaling approximately $775 million. As a result, we have already exceeded our goal of adding 0.5% to 1% in sales from acquisitions this fiscal year, and we still have a number of additional potential transactions in the pipeline that we are working to complete over the next several quarters. Turning to the impact of the Business Transformation Project for a moment, in the second quarter, project expenses totaled $81 million, and we capitalized $3 million related to the project. In the prior year quarter, project expenses totaled $36 million, and we capitalized $33 million related to the project. We continue to make progress on our other key business transformation initiatives. With regard to our initiatives to reduce our operating costs, we have completed the implementation of the SAP maintenance module throughout our U.S. Broadline Companies, and we have also created specific action plans for every OpCo to implement best practices in warehousing and delivery. On our initiatives to reduce our SG&A cost, we have completed the rollout of our sales productivity initiatives, including the deployment of our new CRM tools throughout our U.S. Broadline operating companies; we've implemented substantial changes on our IT function, outsourcing our managed services work; we have begun to implement the SAP Human Resources module throughout our operating companies; we restructured the retirement benefit plans for associates and executives; and we have begun the process of centralizing some of our field finance work to our shared services center. And finally, with regard for initiatives to reduce our product costs, we have progressed our 4 pilot categories through the category management process to the point where we are now awarding new contracts to suppliers. Even though there is a lot of hard work left ahead of us, we are pleased with our overall progress today on our key transformation initiatives. Turning to our cash flow performance, at our Investor Day last year, we discussed our plans to reduce capital expenditures in both our underlying business, as well as for the Business Transformation Project. We've made good progress on that objective, with CapEx declining $172 million in the first half of this year compared to last year. We've seen a decline in capital spending related to the Business Transformation Project, mainly driven by the fact that we began implementation of the new technology earlier this year. In the underlying business, we've seen lower capital spending because of a reduction in the number of major facilities project this year compared to last, and a more disciplined capital allocation and approval process. As a result of the reduction in capital spending, free cash flow increased 20% year-over-year to $125 million. We expect the effect of continued lower capital spending this year, combined with the completion of the IRS payment last year, will result in an improvement in free cash flow in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012. The other component of the free cash flow equation, cash flow from operations declined year-over-year in the first half by $152 million or 28%. Increased inventory levels drove about 1/2 of this decline. We also had an increase in certain current period tax payments mainly due to timing. Before I close, I want to remind you of guidance we have provided previously on a few significant items that will impact the second half of the fiscal year, 2 of which we discussed in more detail in our 8-K filed in January. We believe our transformation initiatives will provide meaningful long-term benefits to Sysco. However, as we discussed at our Investor Day, some of the initiatives will result in onetime charges. I discussed a few minutes ago a $12 million charge we incurred in the second quarter related to the restructuring of our executive retirement plans. The total charges are estimated to be $24 million, and we expect to incur the remaining $12 million in charges related to this action in the second half of the year. This restructuring more closely aligns the executive retirement plan with the employee retirement plan. And we believe over the long term, will reduce the volatility retirement-related expenses, as well as the total cost of retirement-related expenses. On our fiscal 2012 year-end call last August, we discussed the more than $100 million potential increase in pension expense we were facing as we were developing our fiscal 2013 plan. In response to this potential significant increase in expense, we restructured our employee retirement plans to freeze our defined benefit pension plan and subsequently enhance our defined contribution or 401(k) plan. As I mentioned a few moments ago, during the second quarter, we recently completed the restructuring of our retirement plans by also restructuring our executive retirement plans. The net effect of all these changes is that we now expect pension expense to be lower in fiscal 2013 by $21 million, with $15 million of this decrease occurring in the second half of fiscal 2013. The additional expense in fiscal 2013 related to the increase in 401(k) and other retirement plan changes will be in the range of $55 million to $65 million, all of which will impact the second half of this fiscal year. These 2 components together will result in a net increase in retirement-related expenses for the full year of between $35 million and $45 million. This includes amount that we categorize as certain items. Finally, in the third quarter, we expect to incur a $40 million charge related to the withdrawal from an underfunded multi-employer pension plan. This withdrawal will help us mitigate our exposure to multi-employer pension plans and underfunded status. In closing, fiscal year 2013 is a critical year for us as we work towards significant milestones in our business transformation plan and begin to realize benefits from several areas of our company. The work we are doing will favorably position us to take advantage of opportunities to continue to grow our market share and expand upon our leadership position in the industry. With that operator, we'll now take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: A couple of things. Is there any update on either the rollout schedule, where you expect to be by fiscal year end in terms of OpCos or the benefit because I think it's 25% of the ultimate benefit would be seen this year. Is there any update on either one of those?
William J. DeLaney: John, no, I don't have an update for you this morning. What we're telling you, I think, in our prepared comments is we're in somewhat of a delay here from what we originally anticipated in terms of rollouts, and we're going to take the next few weeks to continue to assess the things we need to improve in terms of the functionality of the system. I think over the next month or 2, we should have an update on the rollout time line. As far as the 25% of the benefits, I want to just keep reminding everybody, and I'll let Chris speak to this because he's the one that's really managing this pretty well, that is off of a overall targeted savings of $600 million give or take over a 3-year period, which incorporates, not just the technology side of it, but some big initiatives we have going on, which Chris referenced in detail here today on the SG&A side of the business as well as the product cost side of the business. So I think we're in a good -- pretty good place there. And I'll let Chris provide some color for you.
Robert C. Kreidler: Yes, John, with regard to both parts of your question on the rollout plan, I won't add any color to what Bill said other than the guidance that we have out there right now is 5 to 15 operating companies being converted this year. I think it's fair to say we're going to be at the lower end of that range, but as Bill said, we're working through whatever revisions we might need to make to our plans right now. But that's the current guidance. On the savings, again as Bill said, it's across all of our business transformation initiatives. I kind of walked you through where we made progress on many of the others and frankly, we feel pretty good about where we are on our overall cost saving initiatives for this year, as well as going forward.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: So just as a follow-up on, I guess, ERP, 2 key things, the functionality challenges are coming primarily where? And then as you've rolled out the CRM component, have you seen yet much of a benefit to how the salespeople are doing their day-to-day job, whether it's calling on more customers or anything like that or is that too early yet?
William J. DeLaney: I think we're beginning to see benefits, John, on the CRM. But it is pretty early. I mean, we've -- it's a huge rollout for us in multiple companies. But for us to be able to successfully implement some of the other initiatives in the SG&A side that we've undertaken, we're going to need to see effective implementations of CRM. So I think we're in a good place there. But that's like a lot of things. It probably takes a good year to get it out and get people to use the system and to trust it and then to hold each other accountable for results. So I'd say still early, but we're very encouraged and very pleased with the system itself that we're using. As far as the functionality, let me do this. I went back and I looked at some things we've said to you all in recent calls and I'd like to put it in context. And I think the first point I want to leave with you is we're very confident in the direction we're going in here. We're very confident that we are going to be able to resolve some of the challenges that we have right now. We're just not as confident in terms of the specifics of the near-term time line. With that said, what we've talked about in the past is concerns, issues with speed, performance, in particular with the order entry system. We had some issues with reports early on, and we spoke a little bit in the past about inventory management service levels, those types of things. I would say to you where we are today with these recent rollouts, we're pleased with the progress we've made on the order entry and the speed and the performance of that system. So we've done well there. We're very pleased with, as I said earlier, with the ramp up of SBS, and that group beginning to take on a broader array of support services, even without the technology being as further -- as far along as it will be at some point. So we're not waiting on the technology to begin to centralize the things that we believe that can be centralized effectively. Our challenges today, we've had some hardware blips, to be honest with you, around Thanksgiving time. We ran into some issues there and it took us a while to resolve that. We've had an event or 2 here of late as well. So we still got some things to work through on the hardware side, highly confident that we will be able to do that. And then on the, well, I'll call it again, the inventory management service level issues, still not clicking here at the level that we need to be. We came out of the chute pretty well after the deployments themselves, but the service levels aren't where they need to be. We've ran into some issues with connectivity and our system to our large customer systems. And those are things that we're working through today. Now I'll remind you that this deployment, we did back in early November, was very important for a couple of reasons: one, it's the first time we deployed 2 companies; but second, North Texas or -- essentially Dallas is by far and away the largest OpCo we put on the system, and it's one of our largest Opcos overall. So these challenges we're going into right now, well, some were frustrating at times, not unexpected, and we're working through them with our customers and with our people and again, really appreciate the patience of the customers and very, very appreciative of the efforts our people are putting forth.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: And then just one last thing, it looks like the level of price investments have moderated from where they were 9 months ago, a year ago. Is that likely to continue, or does that go the other way, given the macro and maybe a resurgence in inflation? Do you think the pace of price investments gets more intense on your end the next remainder of this year or do you continue -- think we continue to moderate?
William J. DeLaney: John, those are your words. I don't think I've used those words exactly. I will say about 1.5 years, 2 years ago, we did talk a lot about strategic pricing initiatives and there were some things we are doing there, a category or 2, that we have pretty much cycled through, and we're pleased with what we've seen there in terms of growth. I think the relative improvement you're seeing on the margin trends is a combination of 2 things. I mean we are working very hard at it, trying to strike the right balance in terms of growth and being responsive to our customers. And secondly, is because the inflation has subsided that takes a little pressure off the percentage change issue there. So we're continuing to try to grow the business aggressively but be smart about it, and we need to continue to improve on the margin side.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Edward Kelly with Crédit Suisse.
Edward J. Kelly - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: So if we could go back to -- just a quick follow-up on the ERP implementation. Is there any impact on the cost that you expected to incur this year, the $300 million, $350 million, as well as on capital because I know you talked about some hardware issues.
Robert C. Kreidler: The second one first. At this point, we don't really anticipate an increase in the cost of capital. And if it is, frankly, it's going to be minor. Hardware really doesn't cost that much in the grand scheme of a project like this. The capitalization of labor, which typically occurs when you're developing a system, not when you're implementing it. So I don't anticipate a significant increase in the capitalization. In terms of the overall cost, to the extent that there's a delay here, just like what we talked about the last time when we talked about the more significant delay, it's not really in the current year, it's just that additional time down the road. So while there may be some additional costs, I don't currently anticipate those being significant. But anytime you have a delay, of course, you're adding more time to the end of the deployment cycle, and you'll pick up additional cost for a longer period of time.
Edward J. Kelly - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And then I'm just trying to frame sort of like the net cost of business transformation, as well as the cost savings that you talked about this year. And, I guess, the way we think about it, if there's $300 million to $350 million in business transformation, and let's call it, roughly $150 million in cost saves, you're sort of at this $175 million level net for the full year, which is lower year-over-year than last year, right, because you gross cost in those savings. Are we thinking about that the correct way?
Robert C. Kreidler: You're generally correct. We gave you a lot of guidance at our Investor Day, which I'd encourage you to pull back up, there are a couple of charts there that are pretty good. That, frankly, if you listen to our calls we try to talk in the same language as those charts every time so you can keep up. But that's how we outlined it. We just had gross business transformation cost. We netted against that, some benefits from our shared services center to get to a net business transformation cost and then we also broke it down into cash cost, and cash is where we expected to pick up some benefit this year as we slowed down the implementation and started depreciation -- sorry, slowed down development and started depreciation.
Edward J. Kelly - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Now on the cost savings side, I know in the first quarter you were reluctant to, really, kind of give any color on where you stood. I don't know if you could help us understand how much you've achieved today in the first half or how much of that is back half weighted, just as kind of how we think about the model here.
Robert C. Kreidler: Yes, we're pretty -- we're going to be very cautious about giving quarter-by-quarter guidance because there's going to be a lot of timing elements to this, to be real candid with you. But look, I'm not going to dodge the fact that this whole thing was a build up from one quarter to the next all the way through 3 years. So we told you 25% in the first year, 50-ish range, around 50-ish in the second year and all of it by the third. So you can see the ramp-up. Throughout the year, they ramped up as well. So if the 25% -- yes, more than 1/2 of it is going to be the latter half of the year.
Edward J. Kelly - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, great. And then, Bill, could you maybe talk about just general consumer and industry trends? Maybe start with sort of volume growth, what was the cadence to that volume growth throughout the quarter? And then it sounds like things have weakened up so far in the current quarter, volume standpoint. I don't want to put words in your mouth, so if you could just help us understand what you were sort of referring to there.
William J. DeLaney: Yes, sure. I would say to you that the volume trends have softened, I think, as we went through the second quarter, in particular on the street. We're doing a really nice job with the large regional national chains that -- Kent Humphries and his group have brought in some great accounts there. We've been able to grow with some big existing customers so that's been a real positive for us. I would say on the street, we have seen some softness. And then when Hurricane Sandy came, that just exacerbated it. And things picked up after that, but not to the level that we were at before. I'm not really putting that on the hurricane, though. I just think as you read all the things that come out in terms of economics confidence and you look at some things coming out of our industry in terms of the operators and just looking at a lot of the things that you guys publish in terms of restaurant trends, I think you can say that things have softened out there and we're dealing with it. And bottom line is we're continuing to find ways to stay close to our customers, work even harder on retaining the business that we do have and going after new prospects that are good fit for Sysco. So I think it's going to be soft here for a while from everything I read and that just means that we need to work a little bit harder and continue to, as I mentioned in my comments, continue to aggressively go forward on some of the transformation initiatives and continue to develop that acquisition pipeline.
Edward J. Kelly - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And i just want to ask you one last question on gross profit dollar growth. Your gross profit dollar growth exceeded your case growth this quarter for the first time in a while. Just probably an encouraging sign. Could you maybe talk about what the drivers of that were? It might be something [indiscernible] at SYGMA, but SYGMA didn't grow much. And then how sustainable that is in the back half?
William J. DeLaney: Well, to be candid, that's not exactly a high bar. But it's -- we need to at least get to that and we -- fortunately, we did. So it is encouraging. And again, I would attribute that to some modest improvement on our part in terms of managing growth and profitability, and we need to continue to improve it or to be totally candid. So it's encouraging but a lot of room to go.
Edward J. Kelly - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Can you keep that up in the back half, though, do you think?
William J. DeLaney: We're planning to.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Kelter with Goldman Sachs.
Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Just first off, a quick one on the recent delays on the ERP rollouts. Do you expect the delay to be measured in months or quarters?
William J. DeLaney: Right now I'm dealing with the weeks, Michael. All right, so basically we're -- as I said, we're taking a look at some of the challenges we have, and we've got some very capable people internally and externally working with us on that and we're staying close to our customers. So I think over the next several weeks, we'll have a better update for you on that.
Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay, and then on the business trends commentary that you've given, anything you can help us with on the trends you're seeing over, let's say, the last 4 or 5 weeks in the current quarter? Are they stable or is there any evidence of an impact from the recent payroll tax increase?
Robert C. Kreidler: I -- first of all, January's hard for me to make any great commentary on, just there's a lot of volatility from 1 year to the next on weather and that kind of thing. And I don't talk a lot about weather. But keep in mind, this quarter for us, March is disproportionately large because of the seasonal changes where you'll continue to, hopefully, have good business where people go on vacations, as well as people up north getting out a little bit more. So it's hard to draw any conclusions, but generally soft. I will re-announce that. I don't know that I can attribute any of that to the payroll tax. What I would attribute it to is confidence just what the countries going through on the economic side and, I guess, the payroll tax will be a piece of that. And just everybody is, I think, continue to be pretty careful with their dollars as they start the year. But I think our operators I just saw some numbers this morning and these go up and down. And the outlook from our customer base is a little bit better, even though we're not seeing it in the numbers yet. We said this 2 or 3 years ago, and I think, unfortunately, we were right. This recovery is slow and it's uneven. And going back to your earlier question, it seems almost to be quarter-by-quarter at times. So hard to predict, but I think comparisons will be a little tough this quarter again. And I say, one more thing on weather, and I've seen in it -- some of you guys' reports we did have a very mild winter last year and that did help us, in particular, in the northern states. So a little cautious here early in the quarter and certainly hopeful that things will pick up as we get into March.
Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And then on the SYGMA business, I know it's not the biggest chunk of your business, but it was up less than 1% in the quarter despite the 2.5% pricing, which implies that division at least temporarily is actually in decline on a real basis. Is there anything we should be aware of in terms of lost customers or anything like that, or is it just some temporary time shift of some sort of orders, anything like that?
William J. DeLaney: It's more the latter. I mean SYGMA's going to have a little bit more volatility on the pipeline because when you bring in a new account or you pick up a significant more business with an existing account that will jump your numbers for a period of time, but we've essentially wrapped some of the new business pickup there and there's been some wins within existing customers and some modest losses, that type of thing. But basically it's a function of we've wrapped some of the new business from a year ago and what you're seeing there is a pretty good reflection of the overall growth of the customer mix.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Wiltamuth with Morgan Stanley.
Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Can you give us a little comment on what was going on with inflation during the call -- during the quarter, and also your prospective outlook for inflation here for the rest of the year?
William J. DeLaney: Yes, the way we measure it, Mark, I think we said we have about 2.5 points of inflation on our cost. It's pretty stable with most of the categories. Meat was up, I think poultry is up quite a bit, we had some deflation in seafood and the rest of the categories were not overly significant, although some were certainly larger categories than others. So pretty stable from that standpoint. I would expect certainly to see a modest increase over the second half of the year, but I don't know that we've seen enough yet to be projecting more than that. It's just -- we watch it closely, but I guess my best judgment is a modest increase.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Karen Short with BMO Capital.
Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: A couple of questions just on the OpCos we rolled out -- you've already rolled to. Can you maybe talk to what's happening with volumes, in general, their attention with the customers or anything you can point to that's encouraging?
William J. DeLaney: You're talking about the last 2 rollouts, Karen?
Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Yes.
William J. DeLaney: Yes, I think it's a little early for that, but as I said really on, we did a great job. We had a record sales week in one of the companies at a rollout, and our leadership team and our sales people and our support people here in the 2012 team and SBS have done a great job supporting our sales people and our customers. As you would expect, I mean, as you do run into some of these issues, that will spring some relationships and we've had some good discussions with customers that are experiencing some of the same challenges we are. So they've been very supportive to date, and we are working very hard to get the service levels to the level that we have had historically and that they would expect. So I would say so far, good partnership with the customers but as we've noted, there are some challenges out there.
Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay. And then in terms of the categories where you've looked at rationalizing SKUs, what about the impact on customers in those categories or on volumes overall in those categories, any color there?
William J. DeLaney: I don't think that's had a big impact on customers. It's had an impact internally, but most of the SKUs that we rationalized were, as you would expect, pretty low velocity type SKUs. So anytime you reduce SKUs, it creates some angst and tension in the organization. But Mike Green and his team have done a great job there, and we're down about 10% in our SKUs. So I think the real test there will be as we go further on the category management work, I think Chris mentioned that we're in pilot stage right now. Part of that whole package is to put together a more optimal assortment that's broader but less redundant. And that will create some SKU pressure as well but in the right way. And so our challenge there will be to work through that with our sales force and our customers from a value added perspective. So all in all, I think we've done a good job there and there hadn't been a lot of pushback.
Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay. And then just last question, looking at your cash flow on the acquisition side of it, the multiple -- if that dollar amount is actually your total payment for the acquisitions that you made, it seems like a pretty attractive multiple of sales. Is there -- are there any deferred payments or anything that will be part of the acquisition price or is that the actual multiple that you paid for those acquisitions?
Robert C. Kreidler: Typically when we do acquisitions, we will have an earnout agreement, which will last 2 or 3 years, which generally just says that the former management team owners will stay around and help integrate the company and retain as many customers as we possibly can. And for that, if they're able to accomplish that, there's a portion of the purchase price that gets paid out over time. It's not a huge number. So what you're looking at in terms of multiples is fairly reflective of what we're actually paying for these things. We don't typically look at it on a multiple of sales. I know sometimes people do that. There are a lot of different types of businesses that we look at. They have a lot of different operating margins. So that sometimes will cause a pretty broad range if you look at it on a percentage of sales basis.
Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Right. Unfortunately, that's all I can look at but...
Robert C. Kreidler: I understand.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Meredith Adler with Barclays.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I wanted to talk a little bit about what you're doing in terms of retirement expenses. You talked about a pretty big increase in 401(k) expense. Is that because it's a new program, is that kind of an initial expense or will there be continuing -- will that expense continue or will there be incremental higher expenses in the coming years?
Robert C. Kreidler: Yes. First, Meredith, we -- I've got to back up and I always have to start with where we would have been this year. We would have been $107 million more in terms of retirement plan expenses, which was obviously not something that we were looking forward to and our shareholders wouldn't have enjoyed either. For that and many other reasons, we look at restructuring our pension plans. That was something we were always looking at as part of business transformation. So we think of it in terms of that was the bogey. We had to do better than that. Now on a year-over-year basis, it is going to be higher, so the direct answer to your question is, yes, within the charges that I've read out earlier, there are some what we call certain items, which are onetime charges that will affect us this year. We talked about $24 million in terms of that, that will hit us this year and then we'll get more to a run rate. We're going to give you more color as to what that run rate is. If not, next quarter certainly in our fourth quarter reports that you can model for next year. We're trying to just give you the visibility for this year. The reason why we all set ranges around it is 401(k) expenses depend upon participation, of course, and that's somewhat hard to predict, especially with employees' paychecks going down because of tax changes. So we've got a fairly wide range in those numbers because we're not sure what the 401(k) benefits are going to look like.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. I think it's great that you froze the defined benefit. It needed it to be done, I'm afraid. I was wondering if you -- I was just wondering if you could talk about the 10 acquisitions you did and whether there is any commonality or anything in particular you're looking for? Are these filling in geographical holes or line of business, or just great opportunities?
Robert C. Kreidler: It varies depending on the acquisition. So I'm going to say they're across the board. I'll give you a little color. In Ireland, while we have a very strong business over there and it covers much of the country, we were able to find 2 other companies that together with ours now cover kind of all of the whitespace on the map. We can reach all the way up into Northern Ireland without doing long haul, et cetera. And so that gives us, we believe, coverage over most of the country, not to say we won't look for additional transactions there, but those are great transactions for filling out the map. Canada, we still have a little bit of whitespace left, and predominantly in some of the larger cities, Québec, Ontario area, there we were underpenetrated and so that gave us the opportunity to increase our penetration or market share in an area where we thought we had plenty of opportunity. Here in the U.S., most of what we're doing now are fill-ins and there are companies that's -- and families that we find that we believe have built a great business and a great name, and we like the way they operate and we enfold them into our companies.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Great. And then maybe just my final question would be obviously inflation is pretty modest right now. I think there was a time when inflation was a lot higher than when it was just challenging to pass it all along to your customers. Is there any reason to believe that, that's still an issue? I mean 2.5% is kind of on top of big numbers last year, or would you say that this is just -- you're not having any issues passing it along?
William J. DeLaney: Meredith, it's Bill. I would say this is as good as it gets, all right? We're in that 2% to 3% zone. That's what we've historically have always signaled is best for our customers and for us. I'm not going to tell you it's easy to pass along, but I think we're doing a little better job of it. It really comes down to the pressure that the foodservice operators are feeling and their outlook. So I think we're doing a decent job right now. If inflation were to pick up materially, that would put pressure on our customers, which ultimately puts pressure on us. So we'd love for it to stay right around here and maybe tick up a little bit.
Robert C. Kreidler: Yes, the thing we have to keep reminding ourselves, though, and helping you all with is at the other end of this equation, we still have the problem of consumer demand, the ultimate restaurant patron. They're just not as -- they're not out there as much as they used to be out there. And that's the part that's never really recovered from the Great Recession, if you will. So as long as we have kind of a weak consumer demand and restauranteurs are trying to get as many customers into the restaurants as possible, you're going to have this competitive pressure in the industry. So it's inflation, yes, but it's also just weak demand on the other side.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Great. And then just one final question about the things you're doing in your shared services facility, it sounds like you've moved a lot of new activities to that facility. Is there anything that you're doing there that perhaps you hadn't originally contemplated and you've now seen an opportunity to use that facility more effectively?
William J. DeLaney: I don't know if there's anything we hadn't contemplated. There are things we're accelerating because we're not to the point where we thought we would have been originally on the technology side. So Chris mentioned several of them, HR, finance, we're doing some things in marketing out there. I'll let Chris add to that, but it's more about acceleration, I think.
Robert C. Kreidler: Absolutely right, Meredith. As we've said and tried to explain a number of times, rather than wait to get the full technology rolled out one OpCo at a time or 6 OpCos at a time or whatever the original plan was and then bring all of those companies into SBS, we've been doing it, frankly, function by function. And we talked about maintenance, that one's done. We're starting to prepare ourselves to receive benefit from that. HR is now being rolled out, finance is underway already. We're just bringing them in function by function, everywhere that we do not need to rely upon the big system going into place. And indeed I think I mentioned and several of these, we're using the SAP modules. We're just turning them on without the overall system being in place. They work just fine coupled in with our existing systems. So it's really about accelerating everywhere we can so that we can get the benefit that we originally described.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ajay Jain with Cantor Fitzgerald.
Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: Yes, actually most of my questions were already asked, but I just had a question on the payroll increase in Q2 and maybe a lot of this was already covered in the prepared comments from Chris. So I think, Chris, you mentioned that there is going to be an additional $12 million of payroll increase in the back half of the year, but I'm trying to understand the net payroll impact, like, what's been cumulative effect on payroll net of the severance charges year-to-date, and can you give any similar commentary on the outlook for the back half of the year?
Robert C. Kreidler: I believe we talked about payroll being up $17 million, if I recall correctly, quarter-over-quarter. Let's see if I've got any detail on that, that I can talk about. Yes, $17 million up for the quarter. I don't believe actually that number has any of the onetime charges in it. So what you've got going on in there is we've talked about cost being up on the labor side in our delivery area and costs being down on the SG&A side of the equation. You've got those 2 things kind of playing together and the rest, frankly, are just normal increases in payroll expenses as we move forward.
Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: Okay, yes. I was just trying to understand the net impact of payroll expense year-to-date and what's your outlook for the balance of the year. But maybe I can follow up off-line.
Robert C. Kreidler: Yes, look, we can talk about that. I think Bill said in previous comments that we haven't been all that pleased with some of the increases on the delivery side of the equation. We had some overtime issues, some shortage of driver issues, things of that nature. Those costs have been higher than we anticipated. On the other hand, some of our initiatives are kicking in on the SG&A side and specifically the sales side, and those costs are lower. So you get a bit of an offset there. So you're going to have, hopefully, the latter continuing, the initiatives continuing to hold, and we actually start to gain said benefit or, frankly, just get some control over the delivery side of the equation. So in terms of what we would like the outlook to be, that's it. If this is where we -- we just have to operate really well.
Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: Okay. And just as a follow-up, my understanding was that a lot of the cost savings that offset ERP spending, those -- whatever was targeted, I think $150 million for this year, that was supposed to be heavily headcount-related. So if that -- if my assumption is correct, I mean would it be reasonable to infer the payroll expense goes down even open in the back half if you look at the year-over-year comparisons?
Robert C. Kreidler: Yes, let me take that in 2 parts. Is it reasonable to expect that payroll expense will go down? It will certainly -- it should not go up as much, let me put it to you that way without giving you specific numbers. I want to be careful, though, I don't believe we ever said that the vast majority of the $150 million was going to be headcount-related. You may be confusing that with statements we've always said most of the hard dollar benefits from business transformation or the ERP systems would be headcount-related, which is a different concept. The $150 million fell into various buckets we've described, including product cost reductions, SG&A reductions and lower operating cost reductions. So it's across the board. There's a lot of payroll in it, I'm not trying to dodge that. And so we would expect it, like I said, to at least not continue to increase and hopefully go down a bit. But there are other cost savings in there as well.
William J. DeLaney: Yes, I think the only thing I'll add, Ajay, is I mean payroll doesn't have to go down for us to leverage our productivity improvement. And so I would say, yes, I would echo what Chris said, we're not quite where we want to be at this point. There's different things going on in different parts of the business. And we have a very aggressive plan for expenses this year. So if -- I'm not sure you have -- I mean, when you look at the expense growth, it's not bad. I mean if you go back and look at it historically, it's just we have a very aggressive goal, given some of the impact of the initiatives, so I don't know that it has to go down. And I think it needs -- the delta, the increase of the delta, it needs to continue to come off, and that's what we're managing, very much focused on cost per case.
Operator: We'll take our next question from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.
John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Chris, I heard some of your prepared remarks regarding CapEx control in general and just some increased discipline in general, about how the money is being spent. I mean, have you been able to update kind of fiscal '14, fiscal '15 CapEx guidance? I mean, is it still the intention that those numbers continue to come down as ERP gets finished up?
Robert C. Kreidler: We typically update our 5-year capital plan as we go into the end of the year. So we haven't updated future-looking years. I will say this, alleviate maybe one of your concerns, we're not pushing off CapEx this year into next year so that we get a -- gain some benefit this year. I know sometimes you can play with the numbers that way, but we honestly don't feel like we're pushing off just to be making the numbers look better. We're just hitting a little bit, as I said, a little smarter about where we spend our money.
William J. DeLaney: I think if you look at last year and this year and pull out the technology and divide it by 2, I think that's a more representative view.
Robert C. Kreidler: Yes, so we're down $177 million on the capital line. In fact, if you double it, we're going to be well under our guidance. I don't anticipate being well under our guidance, but we're certainly running at the lower end of our guidance right now in terms of our forecast for the year. I just don't have a good view of '14 right now.
John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then secondly, regarding acquisitions, I mean it seems like kind of your acquisition are being made almost kind of independent of what's going on the ERP side, especially with some of the modest delays that are happening. I mean is that the case or are you just kind of -- are you conscious of the size and the amount of acquisitions that you can make until your legacy system can be running exactly the way that you want it to be?
Robert C. Kreidler: No, so we've talked about $775 million annualized sales across 10 transactions. So just do an average of $75 million sales per transaction. They're not extremely large deals that we would worry about disrupting us. Now that being said, I don't think we would be doing a deal in the middle of Dallas right now and trying to integrate it in Dallas. There's no reason to complicate our lives when we don't need to. So it's a little of both. They're smaller transactions in general, which we feel comfortable taking on regardless of where we are with the ERP. At the same time I think we're thoughtful about where we're going to be trying to integrate deals with our ERP rollout schedule.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Wolf of BB&T Capital Markets.
Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: Chris, I want to just ask you about Hurricane Sandy, the $0.01 impact you called out, is that all from forgone sales or was there some inventory involved?
Robert C. Kreidler: It's a little bit of everything, so we had a little bit of asset loss. We moved as much of our equipment out of the area as we possibly could and literally ran out of storage area for some so we had a little bit of asset loss, some inventory, damage to facilities and then sales loss. In general, what happens is you lose the sales, but you don't necessarily lose the expenses. So you're effectively losing the gross profit on all of that for a period of time. So we measured it as best we can. These are more art than science for the quarter. Some of this impact will last for a while and we're probably going to feel some of the impact when the summer months roll around and some of the businesses that generally will open and thrive during the summer aren't there anymore. But we're starting to see some recovery in the area.
William J. DeLaney: But, Andy, I will tell you -- I mean, if you looked at our sales that week, and I don't think I need to tell you in this call the impact of that hurricane, but from the mid-Atlantic right up into Maine and even into the Mideast a little bit, it was dramatic and in particular in metropolitan New York, New Jersey. So that week was obviously devastating to people and our people and customers, but financially, it was a very significant event for that week.
Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: Sure. No, just as we're trying to carve out potential sales impact. That's helpful. Appreciate that. And moving onto M&A, where you helped by the change in the tax code or do you think this -- the M&A environment still remains equally favorable as it was in the quarter?
Robert C. Kreidler: No. I mean, look, we -- towards the -- we had a very busy December. The teams put in a lot of hours trying to close transactions that needed to be closed by the end of the tax year. So yes, that was the case. At the same time though, I don't think that the pipeline has continued to be rather robust. It's just the number of the deals were desperate to close by the end of the tax year.
Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: Okay. And is this environment wearing on potential sellers in terms of valuation expectations -- from what you think, is that -- if we were to take out the tax part of it, what you think of that?
Robert C. Kreidler: I would say -- I'd characterize where we are currently as more normal, which means you've got sellers that are at least somewhat reasonable. Now, look, in any normal environment, you got some sellers that are being irrational with expectations and some, frankly, that aren't asking enough for their businesses. So you've got to range. But the range is more, what I would call, traditional and normal than it was, say, 24 months ago. That's what we've been seeing. And that helps us in terms of getting to a "yes", with -- on a deal that both sides win at.
William J. DeLaney: The biggest thing though, Andy, year in, year out it's still going to be the mindset of that owner, that family or whoever the decision-maker is in terms of how they see their business over the medium term of 3, 5 years, and are they prepared to invest in that is this for the other part of the environment, which is remains pretty tough market out there. So as we've said, I think we're still confident we'll see some activity here going forward.
Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: And if I could, just a follow-up. I know you've been asked about the SAP a lot, but I just want to check my understanding. Is it the hardware issue you're now having, is that tied directly to the service level issues, or is the service level also go back to the code to the software side of thing?
William J. DeLaney: The service level is a result. And what I was trying to say is we have had some hardware issues. And again, we're confident, we're working through them and that we're confident we'll resolve those. But that will create slowdowns in the system, that will create late trucks and that type of things. So we've had some of that. But on top of that, we continue to have challenges as it relates to the functionality of the inventory management system. And that's a separate issue that needs to be addressed separately and -- but they've both result in service level variances from our typical levels.
Robert C. Kreidler: And the biggest issue in hardware is, as you might imagine, is just stability. Now if you've got hardware issues, you've got an unstable system, and that's the part that you've got to resolve before you can gain confidence in the system and then as Bill said, everything else kind of drives from that.
William J. DeLaney: So what -- I need to be careful here. Let me be clear. We're shipping groceries. The service levels are not at the level that they historically have been at, which is a very, very high level, all right? So the levels are not quite up to our norm. The challenges that we have had, in particular hardware is -- we might have a day or 2 where we have issues with slowness of the system and we have a hard time getting trucks out on time and that creates its kind of issue. The other issue is more of, if you will, steady-state issue that we're working on as well. So we're delivering groceries, it's functioning. We just have very high standards and so do our customers. And that's what we need to continue to perfect here.
Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: Yes. And the other thing, just to take your temperature on this, if I can say it that way, let's say 9 months ago when you had what's, not a similar, but you also had a delay and some challenges. How do you rank this compared to that in terms of your confidence of resolution on getting back on track on a reasonable period of time? How do you felt then? Back then it sounded like it was -- to me, it sounded more serious. I'm just trying to take your temperature on that.
William J. DeLaney: I'm actually much more confident than I was 9 months ago in terms of getting back on track and in terms of taking this system to the level it needs to be to scale it and to provide, not just the service to our customers, but the efficiencies that we need and some of these are doing business that our salespeople need. What I'm not as confident on in the short term is the time line. But that's -- those are 2 different questions. So I feel better today. We've got our -- I'm very proud of our people, not only are they working hard, we're making progress, we've brought in some good people internally and externally to help us and each day and each week, even good weeks are challenging weeks. You learn more about it. So I feel very good about where we're heading. I wish we could give you a little more definitive update on the time line, but I certainly hope we can here over the next several weeks.
Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: Just lastly on sales again because -- I understand the weather is -- are you trying to say for a January status, it's kind of too light? Too light a month to really say there's a change on trend based on to say that the payroll rate or the payroll tax going up or -- is that what you're trying to say or did you, in fact, say maybe things have softened? I'm just trying to get some clarifications.
William J. DeLaney: I think I'm trying to say 2 things, Andy. I'll help you work on it. One is -- the business has slowed, especially on the street, over the last couple of 3 months and that includes January. Two, whether we have a great January or poor January, it's not as material to the quarter as what you see in the second half of the quarter, in particular in March.
Operator: That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Thank you for your participation on today's call, and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Sysco's First Quarter Fiscal 2013 Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. We will begin today's call with opening remarks and introductions. I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Neil Russell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Neil A. Russell: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for Sysco's First Quarter 2013 Conference Call. On today's call, you will hear from Bill DeLaney, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Kreidler, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, please note that statements made in the course of this presentation that state the company's or management's intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results could differ in a material manner.

All comments about earnings per share refer to diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. In addition, all references to case volume growth include total Broadline and SYGMA combined. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill DeLaney.
William J. DeLaney: Thank you, Neil, and good morning, everyone. This morning, Sysco reported record sales of $11.1 billion for the first quarter and net earnings of $287 million. Earnings per share was $0.49 and adjusted earnings per share, representing our underlying business performance, was $0.58 or a 3.6% increase year-over-year. Sales grew 4.7% for the quarter, driven mainly by case volume growth of 2.9%, which contributed to the highest quarterly sales level in our history. While we believe restaurant spending trends may have softened somewhat as the quarter progressed, we are pleased with our overall volume growth during the quarter. Acquisitions contributed 0.5% to sales growth during the first quarter, and we have completed or announced, thus far this fiscal year, the acquisition of companies with annual revenues totaling approximately $560 million, several of which expand our presence in geographic markets that we currently serve outside the United States. The acquisition environment is currently favorable, and we have a number of potential opportunities in the pipeline. Product cost inflation moderated to 2.2% for the quarter, which is beneficial for both Sysco and our customers. While our growth in adjusted operating income was modest, we are encouraged by our expense management performance in most areas of the business. Specifically, we experienced lower cost per case in our selling and administrative areas as a result of enhanced business practices and effective leveraging of this quarter's volume growth. Conversely, higher fuel prices, labor shortages in some markets that we operate in and execution issues on our part led to higher year-over-year delivery cost per case. We are fully committed to both servicing our customers at a high level and improving productivity in all parts of our business as we move forward. Turning to our business transformation efforts. We continue to make progress on deploying our new and enhanced technology platform. Just prior to last quarter's call, we converted our East Texas operating company to our new ERP system, our third location to go live. That conversion went very well, and we moved forward with our planned conversions at our operating companies in North Texas and West Texas last week. The early results in both locations are generally favorable, and we will continue to assess the performance of these 2 companies closely over the next several weeks. These 2 deployments represent a critical step in our technology implementation timeline for 2 reasons: One, it is the first incidence of multiple operating companies converting simultaneously; and two, the North Texas location is one of our largest operating companies and services a significant number of our corporate multi-unit customers. We are pursuing a market-based approach for our rollout schedule. As a result, we expect to move forward with our next planned conversions in Texas and Louisiana in the coming quarters. As we prepare for these conversions, we are also evaluating the possibility of potentially accelerating our pace of deployment in fiscal 2014 and beyond. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the many associates that are engaged in this project, including those at the operating companies that have or are preparing to convert to the new technology platform, as well as those at SBS, IT and across the company. The very real progress we are making in transforming our business would not be possible without their hard work and dedication to the success of this project. I also want to acknowledge a new member of the team. We welcomed Wayne Shurts in October as Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer. Wayne brings extensive experience in both the food business, as well as the deployment of large technology projects. His capabilities complement our team as we work to increasingly leverage the opportunities technology can bring to our business. Beyond the technology deployment portion of our business transformation journey, we are rapidly rolling out several other key initiatives. For example, we are building the foundation for enhanced customer insights through direct feedback from our customers, prospects and associates. We have also recently rolled out our first-ever customer relationship management or CRM platform, which will permit our sales managers and marketing associates to service their customers more effectively, operate more efficiently and accelerate our sales growth over time. In addition, we're exploring multiple ways to reduce our operating cost structure and have recently identified significant potential savings in our IT support function. Regarding Hurricane Sandy. While it is difficult for us to accurately estimate the full impact to our customers, I do want to provide you with some relevant updates: First, our employees are safe; second, we know that many of our customers were impacted more severely than us, and we're doing everything we can to help them; third, there was no substantial damage to any of our facilities. While we did have some intermittent power outages, our backup generators operated effectively, and as such, our inventory is secure; fourth, due to on-site fueling capabilities, we have adequate fuel supplies to make deliveries; and finally, obviously, there were initially some road closures and power outages that limited some deliveries. However, our operations have recovered relatively well, and we are ready to serve our customers as they are able to get back to business as usual. In closing, it seems appropriate and timely to remind all of us that Sysco is in the midst of a great deal of change. Not only is this change necessary at this point in our 40-plus year history as a public company, but it will result in a much stronger Sysco for years to come. We will build upon our industry leadership position by becoming a much leaner, more agile and easier company for our customers and suppliers to do business with. We are most fortunate to have 47,000 highly committed and capable associates to lead us through this exciting period in Sysco's history. Now I'll turn things over to Chris so he can provide additional details on our financial results for the first quarter.
Robert C. Kreidler: Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. For the first quarter, sales were $11.1 billion or an increase of 4.7% compared to the prior year, driven by case volume growth of 2.9% and food cost inflation of 2.2%. In addition, acquisitions within the last 12 months increased sales by 0.5%, and changes in foreign exchange rates decreased sales by 0.3%. Gross profit in the first quarter increased 2.9%. While gross margin in the first quarter declined 33 basis points to 18.1%, it's important to note that this performance significantly improved as the quarter progressed. Operating expenses increased $87 million or 6% in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 compared to the prior-year period, driven mainly by a $41 million increase in business transformation expenses and a $30 million increase in salaries and related costs. As a result, operating income decreased $31 million or 6%. Net earnings for the first quarter were $287 million, a decrease of $16 million or 5.3% compared to the prior year. Diluted EPS was $0.49, a 3.9% decrease compared to the prior year. As we have discussed on previous calls, we believe it's important to focus on the performance of our underlying business, which not only excludes $6 million in certain items such as severance but also excludes business transformation expenses. To summarize the performance of our underlying business, adjusted operating expenses increased 3.2%, adjusted operating income increased 2%, adjusted net earnings grew 3.2%; and adjusted EPS grew 3.6% to $0.58 per share. As Bill mentioned, the acquisition environment is currently quite favorable, and we have been very active in this area. To date in fiscal 2013, we have completed or announced 6 acquisitions of annual revenues totaling approximately $560 million, including 2 transactions which occurred subsequent to the end of the first quarter. As a result, we expect to exceed our goal of adding 0.5% to 1% in sales from acquisitions this fiscal year, and we still have a number of additional potential transactions in the pipeline that we are working to complete over the next few quarters. Building on our successful 2009 acquisition of Pallas Foods, we've recently added 2 new distributors to our family of companies in Ireland. We acquired Crossgar Foodservice, a Broadline distributor, during the quarter, and in early October completed the acquisition of the foodservice distribution division of Keelings, a specialty produce company. Both of these companies have great people, and we are excited to add them to our Sysco family. We believe that building a market leadership presence in Ireland similar to our efforts in the U.S. and Canada provides us strategic advantages and offers our existing and potential customers a broader choice of products and services. In addition to Ireland, we continue to expand in Canada. Over the last year, we have been strategically building our presence in the province of Québec. This is a well-populated area of Canada, home to roughly 8 million people, and we believe we have significant opportunities to increase our market share here. As a result, we have completed several acquisitions in Montréal, including a company specializing in Italian imports; a meat processor and distributor; and a seafood company. In addition, in late October, we announced our agreement to acquire Distagro, the foodservice division of a Montreal-based grocery retailer. This is our largest acquisition so far this year and is designed to complement our growing presence in this highly competitive market. The Distagro transaction is subject to Canadian regulatory approval, and we expect to complete that acquisition by the end of the calendar year. Turning to the impact of the Business Transformation Project for a moment. In the first quarter, project expenses totaled $78 million, and we capitalized $3 million related to the project. In the prior-year quarter, project expenses totaled $37 million, and we capitalized $45 million related to the project. As Bill mentioned, considering the successful implementation of our third operating company, and dependent upon how the next few weeks go for North Texas and West Texas, we have begun to explore what is necessary to potentially accelerate the deployment schedule beginning next year. We continue to make progress on our other key business transformation initiatives as well. In the first quarter, we announced our decision to outsource a portion of our IT resources to a third party. The changes in the organization will result in significant financial benefit over time and is included in the total business transformation benefits that we expect to achieve. Due to our progress on this and other initiatives, we believe we are on track with the business transformation financial objectives we provided at Investor Day last year. Turning to our cash flow performance. Cash flow from operations for the first quarter was $213 million, a decline of $42 million, driven mainly by increased tax payments and lower earnings, partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization. The IRS settlement payments we paid last year will begin to impact the year-over-year operating cash flow comparison beginning in the second quarter. As a reminder, during fiscal 2012, we paid a total of $212 million in settlement payments, none of which was paid in the first quarter, $106 million that was paid in the second quarter and $53 million that was paid in each of the last 2 quarters. Capital expenditures totaled $156 million for the first quarter this year compared to $227 million last year. The $71 million decline in capital spending is driven in part by a reduction in business transformation capital spend and in part by a reduction in the number of major facilities -- facility projects this year compared to last. As a result of the reduction in capital spending, free cash flow doubled year-over-year to $58 million. We expect the effect of lower capital spending this year, combined with the completion of the IRS payment last year, will result in an improvement in free cash flow in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012. Before we close, I wanted to update you on our fuel guidance for the year. Our process each quarter is to project the impact of fuel prices using, among other inputs, forward fuel prices. While we are hearing continued discussion in the market about a potential decline in fuel prices, there has been little impact yet in the forward prices. As a result, our current and projected rates for fuel had increased since our last forecast, which result in an estimated increase in fuel expense for the year of $10 million to $20 million. In closing, while fiscal year 2013 is a critical year for us as we begin -- as we work towards significant milestones in our ERP deployments and begin to realize benefits from several areas of our business transformation plan, we are beginning to see a consistent uptick in momentum underlying our efforts. This is evident in the increased confidence throughout the organization, in particular as it relates to the deployment of our new technology platform. I believe this favorably positions us to take advantage of opportunities to grow our market share and expand upon our leadership position in the industry. With that, operator, we'll take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Karen Short, BMO Capital Markets.
Ryan Gilligan: This is actually Ryan Gilligan on for Karen. We wanted to ask you about the inventory opportunity in terms of reducing SKU counts in your categories and the progress you've made so far, specifically in the categories that you've approached already. What has been the response from customers and what has been the impact on cost of goods?
William J. DeLaney: This is Bill. I'd say on the SKU opportunities, we have kind of a 2-pronged approach right now. We, from an operational standpoint, have a lot of activity going on in our operating companies where, basically, it's what I would characterize as good old-fashioned inventory management where we see opportunities to reduce SKUs that are not critical to customers and which are slow-moving, then we do have -- brought a lot of focus to that particular an issue. So we've actually made good progress on that side of things. And generally, that's being handled well with customers. And any time you have a situation where you're reducing a SKU that -- or taking away a SKU that sells, often there will be some type of discussion with the salesperson or the customer. But we're working through those and I feel pretty good about that. As part of our lower costing products initiative, we've talked about exploring category management. And that will bring a much more integrated and smoother approach to how do we optimize our assortments throughout the enterprise and manage SKUs more effectively at the same time. So that work has not yet begun in terms of being live, but we're doing a lot of development work on that front as well.
Ryan Gilligan: Great. And can you talk about the cadence of sales trends throughout the quarter and into the second?
William J. DeLaney: I would characterize sales trends pretty much what I said in my prepared comments. We certainly read a lot from you folks in terms of softening in the restaurant industry, and we think we've seen some of that as the quarter's gone along, and that's continued here somewhat in the early part of the second quarter. So the good news for us, and this is just something we always try to remind everybody, restaurants are obviously a big part of that $225 billion market, but we have a lot of other business beyond the restaurant business with colleges, universities, health care, hotels, basically any establishment where food is prepared and eaten away from home. So we’ve made some good strides with some of those customers, and that's serving us well right now.
Ryan Gilligan: Great. And, sorry, last question, just to go back to the opportunity with reducing cost of goods. The estimate that you outlined at the Analyst Day, could that possibly be conservative, or how are you guys thinking about that right now?
William J. DeLaney: It's not conservative until we beat it, so I think at this point, that's our best guidance for you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: So Bill, a couple of things. One of the reasons gross margin had declined over the last 1, 1.5 years, had been some proactive price investments you guys had made. Where do you stand on that? And assuming that, that's moderating, is there a possibility here that gross margin turns positive some time in '13?
William J. DeLaney: I certainly hope so, John. We're pleased that the trends have improved, but obviously, they're still below last year. And I think in this type of market where the inflation has moderated, as we called out, we would expect to continue to see improvement in those trends. So we're highly focused on that is about all I can tell you. We've done a lot of work internally, John, outside of the big initiatives in terms of providing what we call more market-relevant costing to our operating companies through our purchasing organization here. And I think as we continue to provide better and more market-oriented, market-relevant transfer costing, and that gives the OpCos a better cost base to price off of. So there's a lot of different things going on there. So I'm going to answer it similar to your earlier question. We need to improve, continue to improve in that area. And as we get closer to year-over-year being flat, then I'll be more optimistic about improving year-over-year.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: You also talked about the acquisition environment being very favorable. Now is that -- I guess it's a combination of these 2 things, but in terms of quality of companies available versus the price that you're having to pay, is 1 of those 2 much more favorable than the other?
William J. DeLaney: That's an interesting question. I'll start and let our acquisition guy here probably clean it up here a little bit. I would say there's a couple of things going on right now. I think the environment is good. There's a little bit, I think, of a year-end phenomenon going on, with concerns about tax code and that kind of thing, so I think that has helped at least in this country. But I would also tell you that this interest rate phenomena, I think, works both ways. So for us, it helps the deals look more attractive, obviously, since our borrowing costs will be a lot less. But the sellers know that as well. So I think for good value in terms of quality companies, you're going to pay an appropriate multiple today, and we're willing to do that because we can see the benefits financially and otherwise. So hopefully, that's a response. So I think that's a better environment, but we're not stealing any companies right now. We're talking about good companies and pay reasonable value.
Robert C. Kreidler: I don't really have anything to add, Bill. Bill kind of couched it. The only thing I'll amplify is we have seen substantial increase in inbound phone calls because of the potential for tax rate increases in the beginning of next year. So you’ve got a little bit of that rush to get it done phenomena. But we're fortunate; we're seeing a lot of good companies that haven't been interested in talking before coming forward and wanting to have discussions, and some of those will result in transactions soon and some may result in transactions later. But we're happy to talk to everybody.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: All right. Then last on ERP. So Chris, you said none of the financial objectives have changed. I assume the costs and benefits you'd outlined for '13, none of those have changed?
Robert C. Kreidler: That is correct.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then accelerating it in '14. How many of OpCos do you think you have done by the end of fiscal '13? And then what's the capacity, if you look at it per week, per month, however you want to look at it, the capacity the organization has to do those? And if you do accelerate it, what do you do to enable you to accelerate it?
Robert C. Kreidler: Well, John, first, I mean, our guidance for the year was 5 to 15 companies, and we're certainly comfortable with that guidance. If I were going to shade it, I mean on the pace that we're at, as long as things continue to go well, I think we'll be towards the higher end of that guidance. But we're very comfortable with that. As Bill said, and I repeated, we are looking at now what it would take to accelerate that based upon us starting to feel better about our deployment capabilities. I think it's premature to give you more guidance as to how fast we could go or how many we could do at a time until we finish that work.
Operator: And up next is Edward Kelly of Credit Suisse.
Edward J. Kelly - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Could we maybe go back to ERP? And I was hoping you could maybe give us a little bit more color around the decision that you're potentially making, I guess, to accelerate the rollout. So what are you seeing today in the most recent rollouts versus what you've seen over the first couple that gives you a little bit more confidence? And then the second part of this question is if you did accelerate it, and I know, obviously, there's a lot of variability around the details, but what would that mean to the 2015 guidance that you gave at the Analyst Day?
William J. DeLaney: I'll tell you what, I'm going to try to do a better job than Chris, and then I'll let him go back and do this all over again. We -- I think the biggest thing we're seeing is confidence, I mean, to be somewhat qualitative. We -- I mean I think our people are -- we've done a few of these now, right? So we've done 5 now. And each time we do it, both the teams on the deployment side, as well as the local operating teams, the SBS teams, everyone, it's familiar, and it's things we’ve -- we get better each time and so I think confidence coming from improved performance in terms of the deployment aspect of it. In terms of what we need to see, we need to ramp up some resources to be prepared to move at a more accelerated rate. And we need to see really good transition into the operationalizing of the ERP platform as well. So those are all things, as I said and that Chris has alluded to, that we're assessing for over the next several weeks following these last 2 deployments.
Robert C. Kreidler: Yes, I want to go back. I mean, at Investor Day, we actually talked about the potential to accelerate once we proved a few things and built up our own confidence. We just said we'd be looking for that opportunity. And I think all we’re really pointing out right now is we are now starting to look more seriously at the opportunity to accelerate based upon some early confidence. The impact of that, I obviously can't quote you numbers, but conceptually, the impact of that is we will accelerate expense, obviously, inside of the range that we had previously disclosed, and that would also ultimately accelerate some of the benefits that were post-2015. So if you recall when we talked about the benefits from business transformation, we said there would be additional benefits beyond the 3-year guidance that we were putting up on the slide and on the screen during Investor Day. So this would allow some of that to come into that 3-year period, but we'd also accelerate the expense to get it done.
Edward J. Kelly - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, that makes sense. And then you did mention the $10 million to $20 million increase in the fuel charges. Is that a gross or net basis because you do have surcharges, I think down on a lot...
Robert C. Kreidler: Yes, that's the fuel expense, not the surcharge. I don't really anticipate the surcharge increasing very dramatically, so that's the fuel expense. But ultimately, if the surcharge isn't going to grow, that's going to end up being a net expense as well.
Edward J. Kelly - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, great. And another question is on inventory. Inventory was up about 11% this quarter. Inflation's lower; you're doing some SKU actualization although I don't know how much of that's in the numbers. But could you maybe just help us understand why inventories is up that much?
Robert C. Kreidler: Yes, first -- I mean, we are moving more cases or still a significant amount of new cases. We were up 2.9%. Secondly, those acquisitions that we bring online also bring on additional inventory as well. You still have a little bit of inflation in there; it's not nearly as much as before. But every quarter, we – well, actually every month, we will analyze how much of our increase in inventory was due to sales versus DSOs. And I will tell you, we're still not hitting on all cylinders on the DSOs. We have opportunities for improvement there. But most of our inventory increase was driven by sales growth.
Edward J. Kelly - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And then my last question for you is a little bit more bigger picture related to CapEx. Your CapEx guidance for this year is certainly down relative to last year because there's less spending, I guess, on business transformation. But if you look back over time, you've had years where you were $400 million to $500 million in CapEx. You're still, I think, in the range, if I remember, $600 million, $650 million. Could you maybe just help us understand what the difference is even where you are now versus what that used to be? And is there an opportunity to get CapEx lower in the not-too-distant future?
Robert C. Kreidler: Yes, it's a topic we've spent quite a bit of time talking about around here. I think the answer is yes, we can bring CapEx down lower. We've taken the first step of that, which is to look historically at some metrics for capital versus sales, for example. We talked about that at Investor Day and what's the right percentage, and I think we outlined 1% to 1.2% of sales. It's not perfect, but it's a good guideline. Step one is to get us back comfortably into that range, and then we'll see where we can go from there. But the answer to the first part of your question is we're a bigger company than we were 4 or 5 years ago. We've got more facilities. We had to -- during the crisis, we didn't spend a lot of capital, so we did some make-up spending afterwards because, frankly, we had built up some pent-up demand, and we needed additional space. So there was some catch-up there. Now we've got those facilities to maintain, we've got additional fleet from all of the case growth that we've realized over the last 4 or 5 years. So we're going to spend more capital to maintain that fixed asset base. But all of us believe that we've got more opportunities for efficiency.
William J. DeLaney: Yes, the only thing I would add is Chris has done a really good job over the last few months of helping us make cash flow and asset optimization, asset management optimization in one of our key areas of strategic focus. We had 3 big facilities that came on board this past year. We have one big facility that's going to come on board in the current year in Southern California. Fleet replacement, those trucks and power units cost more today; significantly more than they did 2 or 3 and even certainly 5 years ago. So there's a fair amount of inflation on the construction side and on the fleet side if you go back and compare what we're doing today versus just a few years ago.
Edward J. Kelly - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And just one quick follow-up, and I'm done here. The cost savings that you guided to for the year, I think, was in this like $150 million range. How much of that did you get in this quarter?
Robert C. Kreidler: So your guidance is approximately correct. We said total run rate benefit at the end of 3 years $550 million to $650 million, and we'd realize about 25% of that in the first year so your math certainly holds up. We believe we're on track for that. We're not really going to give quarterly guidance as to what we received. We certainly have internal forecast by category of initiative, and we're tracking those very carefully. We're ahead in some areas; we're behind in some areas; we're on track in other areas. But all in, we're feeling pretty good about the number for this year, and that's why we've not changed our forecast for that.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Greg Badishkanian of Citi.
Alvin C. Concepcion - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: This is Alvin Concepcion in for Greg. I just wanted to ask a little bit more about the slowdown in the restaurant industry trends throughout the quarter and early part of the second quarter. Is there a major difference you're seeing out there between casual dining chain customers and independents? And also, is there any color that you're hearing from your customers on the sales environment? Are they increasingly more concerned and are they making some adjustments to pricing as a result?
William J. DeLaney: Let me take the first one and if I forget get the second one, let's come back to that. I'll tell you what; can you just give me the first one again? I want to make sure I answer it right.
Alvin C. Concepcion - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Sure. Are you seeing any major differences out there between casual dining chain customers and the independents?
William J. DeLaney: Well, first of all, I guess the way we look at it, there's a lot of independents that are casual dining restaurants. Relative to chains, I'd say actually the data we're seeing right now is that there's been some growth with independents, modest. It's comparable to the chain growth right now after a couple of years of where independents have been flat to down and chains have been flat to up. So from that standpoint, that might be a promising sign. We're seeing the same data you all see. Sometimes, we're reading your data. I think overall, there is still very, very modest growth there, but the trends have softened, and it's not what it was a few months ago. Most of the growth seems to be on the quick-serve side and the casuals are holding their own. Upscale is up a little bit, but I still think that might be off of a relatively easy comparison. The only other color is I think traffic has softened some, but the price of the check, so to speak, is -- continues to grow modestly. So we still think there's some very modest growth there; it's not just at the rate of what we saw here just a few months ago. And again, we're splitting hairs here. It's not like it was robust growth a few months ago. So I just want to reiterate our point. We feel like we're doing a good job being responsive and proactive in those areas. We cover all segments of the restaurant industry. But again, we also have a strong presence in the nonrestaurant side of the foodservice industry, and we're doing a really nice job there as well.
Alvin C. Concepcion - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: That's great color. And I apologize if I missed this, but in regards to the sequential improvement in the gross margin, I'm assuming moderating inflation was a contributor to that. Did you also see improvements in the competitive pressures in the quarter relative to last quarter?
William J. DeLaney: I think, clearly, the moderating of inflation was a big part of that. And we saw a little bit of that in the fourth quarter. I think inflation came down into the 3s, and then this quarter in the 2s. So there's -- as I've explained before, I don't want to sound too esoteric or too passive here. There's certain amount of math in the relationship between inflation and gross margin. So yes, we've benefited from that. But our margins were still down 0.3 of a point, and so a little bit of that, I think, was customer mix, where our contract customers have grown a little faster than our street customers right now. We did see our brand grow, which is encouraging; that's a good thing on margins. So, yes, the competitive pricing environment remains very acute. But at this point, this is really on us to find ways to continue to strike the right balance between growing our business with our customers and still driving out the right type of gross profit dollar growth.
Alvin C. Concepcion - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And did you see any changes in the environment into October?
William J. DeLaney: Yes, I would say it softened further in October.
Alvin C. Concepcion - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: With competitive pressures, I'm talking about.
William J. DeLaney: That's almost impossible to gauge on a monthly basis.
Operator: And our next question comes from Mark Wiltamuth of Morgan Stanley.
Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Bill, if you can give us what your buyers are saying about inflation right now and how are you feeling about the center-of-the plate proteins in particular given the drought we had this year?
William J. DeLaney: I think it's mixed. I believe we saw a fair amount of inflation in poultry this quarter, and meat's a big category for us, Mark, so I think that was 5% or 6%. So it's hard to get a great handle on where that goes from here, but I would expect that to stay up. Seafood, not as much. Dairy, on the other hand, we saw a meaningful deflation there in dairy and dairy, and a little bit in produce as well deflation. So actually, dairy and produce are probably 2 of your most volatile categories, and so they'll go back and forth. So right now, I would say it hasn't changed a lot from what we're showing here for the quarter. And I wouldn't expect it to change dramatically in the next few weeks or month or 2. But also, we're watching it really close because, obviously, there's other fundamentals out there in terms of the drought that we experienced throughout summer and what that may mean second half of the year in terms of both products and livestock and all that type of thing. So bottom line is it's in a good place for us and our customers right now. I do think there are some pressures building that over the second part of the year we could see a pickup again.
Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Just to follow up a little bit on your last comments there on the gross margins getting a little better here as the quarter progressed. Is that because your efforts to manage inflation were a little better, or that you backed off of some of your planned discounting? Where do you think the improvement came from?
William J. DeLaney: Well, I think we managed it somewhat better, but we're still not managing as well as we need to. I'm just being straight with you there. But I also think, like I said, just the math of inflation, when your costs are only going up 2%, it's not as difficult to manage the pricing off of that than when they're going up 7% or 8% in some categories.
Operator: And up next is John Ivankoe of JPMorgan.
John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Just a couple of quick ones, I think. You mentioned, Bill, in your prepared remarks something that Sysco was doing that was driving up the cost of delivery in the quarter, maybe -- I don't know if it was a mistake that you made, or maybe there were some initiatives. I mean -- I guess what were those? And are those now solved for the current quarter?
William J. DeLaney: Well, let me balance this a little bit, John. What I said is I felt we did a really good job on the SG&A side. And unfortunately -- and we lowered our cost per case there, which is a key metric for us. And to just have flat cost per case in this business is pretty hard to do, so we were pleased with what we did there. We gave a lot of it back on the delivery side. Some of that was fuel; some of it was some labor shortages in markets that are particularly robust right now, and where some of the oil is being drilled and energy and that type of thing. So I'm sure we saw the benefit of that on the sales and gross profit line. And there's just some things we didn't execute as well as could have in several markets, and I’ll leave that in-house, if you're okay with that. And look, we're running a business here, and I wish on a given day or a given quarter, we could execute with perfection, and we did a lot of things well here, I would say, to characterize this quarter. I would've liked to see us perform a little better on the gross profit line and manage our delivery expenses a little more consistently across the company, and we're working on both of those.
John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay, understood. And then secondly, I mean, obviously, you're outperforming the broad foodservice distribution industry as would be evidenced by restaurant sales that -- and especially in casual dining is actually seeing shrinking traffic. So -- I mean, what is your sense that -- where is your share coming from at this point? I mean, is it coming from some of the larger competitors, or is it the very fragmented industry that you see out there that may finally see some forced consolidation as traffic remains weak and fuel costs goes up for operators that already have extremely low margins?
William J. DeLaney: Great question; hard to answer since we don't see the other guys' numbers. But my best judgment is that more of it is coming from the smaller, more fragmented part of the competitive landscape and that the larger players are probably holding their own or maybe picking up a little share.
John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I mean, obviously, we've been talking a lot about acquisitions, but I mean are you beginning to see at the local level some consolidation of the smaller operators? Is there kind of some supply that's quietly coming out that we wouldn’t necessarily see here?
William J. DeLaney: Yes, I think we are, and that's what we alluded to in comments on the acquisition environment being somewhat better. The challenge for you guys it's there's thousands of them, so it's hard for you to see it in terms of how our numbers roll up or the industry numbers. But the acquisition pipeline we're talking about is more in that middle to lower end of the competitive food chain, so to speak.
Operator: And our next question comes from Ajay Jain of Cantor Fitzgerald.
Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: My main questions were already asked earlier, but I wanted to just get some clarification on whether the severance costs this latest quarter are related to the cost reduction activities that were already contemplated for the year so even to the extent that your anticipated cost savings are at least somewhat headcount-driven, I'm just wondering if the severance represents some upfront investment in terms of the cost reduction goals or if it's totally outside the scope of the planned cost reduction activities that you talked about at your Analyst Day?
Robert C. Kreidler: Ajay, this is Chris, and you nailed it. It is related to the initiatives, primarily related to the IT initiative that I talked about so there was a fairly large chunk of it this quarter. We'll probably have some more of it in Q2. But it's an upfront investment to get to the run rate savings.
Operator: Up next is Andrew Wolf of BB&T Capital Markets.
Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: Looking at the segment numbers sales, could you talk about just SYGMA, why it slowed? Was that what's going on with those customers or did you anniversary some business?
William J. DeLaney: We anniversaried some business, I've never used that term before, but I like that one, Andy. So we've had pretty good growth in the segment the last couple of years, and the key there generally is picking up a new customer and, obviously, not losing any big ones. So we haven't picked up a large new customer here over the last year. And we've lost a little business; some of that we wanted lose and some of it, not so much. Bottom line is SYGMA is going to be a little more volatile compared to the Broadline in terms of ups and downs.
Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: Okay. And with -- we don't see the inflation number by segment. But when I look at SYGMA going down and much more than sequentially in terms of sales growth in Broadline. Does -- what can we -- can you tell us if Broadline case movement was actually -- I'm sure it was better than the combined number, but was it a lot better; was it flattish sequentially or versus down the way it was for the combined 2 segments?
William J. DeLaney: I want to be careful here, Andy, because you know a lot of our people listen to these calls, and we're working hard at kind of this One Sysco mentality here. But when you look at our numbers, as the Broadline goes is how the company goes. So there's never going to be much of a difference between the Broadline numbers and the overall numbers, and there wasn't in this case either.
Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: Fair enough. Okay. And my last question is on business transformation. Kind of simply put, what are the things you're seeing that are -- have the executive -- your folks contemplating accelerating it; what's working?
William J. DeLaney: Well, we had a similar question earlier. I'll give you my best shot at that and let Chris jump in here.
Robert C. Kreidler: Maybe I can help.
William J. DeLaney: Yes, Chris can help me this time. Seriously, look, we've obviously had some bumps along the way here, but we've done 5 of these now. We've continued to bring in folks to strengthen our team at all levels, and we're getting better at all parts of it, the prep work, the programming, the change management work, the training. And as a result, each rollout on these conversion weekends has been a little bit better. East Texas went very well. We've had good results business-wise since then. And so as you see that, people gain confidence, we gain confidence, and so that's the first step, is to make sure that you can handle the conversion right, get the deployment right and begin to hand it off to the business in a way that they run with it. And -- but you can't wait until you're year end to it to kind of have these thoughts. So where we're at right now is evaluating the opportunity to accelerate as we get more comfortable that we're executing at a level that's appropriate, and that we can mobilize the resources that it’s going to take to do that. Chris?
Robert C. Kreidler: Yes, I think about this in 2 different components. There's the confidence level on being able to roll it out, so the actual implementation and then there's how does it work after the fact. And while those are tied together in our minds, they are kind of distinct parts of the equation. We're definitely focused in this particular answer to this question on the first part of this, which is, are we gaining more confidence in being able to roll it out? So I spent the weekend in North Texas during their rollout last weekend. And when you're actually sitting there watching the large number of people roll this thing out and implement it and it goes incredibly smooth, and yes, there are issues that come up right and left, but the team have gotten so adept at handling the issues. And frankly, they're smaller issues than we were seeing in the other ones, that just gives you more confidence that we know how to roll this thing out. And at the same time, we were doing it in another operating company at the same time. First time we've tried that. That gives you more confidence that we're going to be able to roll this thing out a little bit faster. Now we still have to get through a couple other hurdles to make sure that we're going to be ready to do that, and that's the work that we're beginning now. But I'd say that's more color on the whole confidence notion, and that's what's causing us to, at least, look at what it would take to go faster.
Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: Okay. And on the second -- that's sort of where I was -- that answer was very clarifying. So the second way you look at it, the benefits, is there any -- is there enough data for you internally to also feel that more confidence about that, or is it really just more about the first part, the execution of the rollout?
Robert C. Kreidler: Well, if you remember some of our previous conversations around the benefits, we were only looking at the hard dollar benefits, which primarily are driven by reduction in staff and headcount out in the field as we roll these things out. So as we go back and we look at what was our pre-rollout headcount, what did we anticipate getting to after the rollout by a certain amount of time? We're getting close to our targets there. And the first 3 being pilots and the second 2 -- or the first 2 being pilots; and then East Texas and the second 2 just having gone, it's a little early to get a complete read on that, but we are getting the headcount reduction benefits that we had anticipated getting in almost all areas. And the exceptions, frankly, are areas where as we went through the process, we decided that we might have been a little aggressive and -- in our initial estimations and we've pushed back a little bit since that time. So it's too early to read everything. We're not going to quote a bunch of numbers, but we're feeling pretty good about at least the hard dollar savings that we talked about publicly.
William J. DeLaney: Yes, Andy, I'd just take a moment here to remind everyone that a lot of what we talked about in May and what we've shared since then is because we have had some delays here, we are finding other ways to accelerate these benefits. We're not waiting to deploy this thing in 70 U.S. companies and then Canada to get the benefits as we originally designed them in the business case. So when we talk about improvement in SG&A and when you look at that roadmap to 2015 that we put out there in SG&A and operations, some of those benefits were part of the original case, and we're going to drive those out now, and muscle through them where we need to. And then to Chris' point, there'll certainly be some additional benefits as we deploy and we're able to become more efficient post-deployment. But there's 2 paths right now: One is the deployment path, and the other is muscling through these cost savings even without the system.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we turn next to Meredith Adler of Barclays.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I wanted to talk a little bit, go back to the subject of inflation. And maybe just talk a little bit about what you're working on. I think you talked about some systems that would help pass along and were priced better, and I'm sure that relates to inflation. So maybe talk about where you feel you haven't done as good a job and how you see that improving and how quickly can it improve.
William J. DeLaney: Okay, I'm not sure what we've talked about in terms of pricing and in inflation, but what I try to share with you, Meredith, is as we've said very consistently for as long as I can remember, if we could keep inflation in this 2% to 3% zone that we've had the last couple of quarters, and if it was relatively comparable across all categories, that's just a much better environment for our customers and, therefore, it's a much better environment for us. People can handle modest increases. Maybe not as easily as I could 3 or 5 years ago before some of the challenges in the economy and the marketplace, but certainly better than they can a 5%, 6% to 7% increase. We have pretty good systems today. I want to be really clear. We have good systems today on how to manage inflation. And from that standpoint, I think we do a decent job with it. I think the art to this thing right now is to, again, strike the right balance as we manage the business at that district level, at the OpCo level and then even here on how we interact with large customers and suppliers. How do we strike the right balance between profitable growth and pricing? And so along the way, we have certainly explored some different systems and scientific pricing modules, and we continue to assess those. And I think we will get better in that arena over time. And we certainly can see analytically that there's probably an opportunity to have less variability in our pricing. And we'll continue to work on those opportunities. But I would say to you, for now, it's kind of good old-fashioned management on our part and attention to detail and striking that proper balance between growth and profitability.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division: So I guess when you have said, you did say it on this call about could've done a better job in terms -- you're talking about finding a good balance between profitable growth and pricing when you say could've done a better job?
William J. DeLaney: Yes, I'm just saying we, as a management team throughout Sysco, I think could've done a better job. We did better than we did last quarter, and we certainly did better than we did a year ago from a trend standpoint. But what I'm really trying to say is we see opportunity out there where we could perform even better, and that's what we're working on internally.
Operator: And we have time for one final question today, and we'll go to Erin Lash of Morningstar.
Erin Swanson Lash - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: You commented that the acquisition environment was very favorable. I wonder -- I was wondering if you could touch on whether there were any differences that you're seeing between the acquisition environment in the U.S. versus internationally?
Robert C. Kreidler: Well, to the extent that in the U.S. we mentioned the kind of tax rush, if you will, to get some of these transactions done by the end of the year, that does not necessarily apply to foreign acquisitions unless that their ownership may be U.S.-based. So we're not seeing, I'll say, quite as many. The markets are -- just talking about Ireland, there aren't as many players in Ireland. We tend to know who they are, and I think these were very targeted, strategic transactions for us to broaden our appeal to the customer base there and also broaden our network. So we've kind of picked what we wanted there, I guess, if we could say, and done it strategically. Canada, we spoke a lot about or at least I talked about our strategic desires in and around Québec, Montréal. And so again, I think the team was very thoughtful up there about which acquisitions we wanted to go after. But in terms of the pipeline, we've got stuff coming to us, I'd say, in all 3 markets, and we look at it, we evaluate it, we first decide whether it makes strategic sense and we start looking at whether the valuations are going to make sense to both us and the sellers and see if we can get a deal done.
Erin Swanson Lash - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: That's very helpful. And then just finally, I was wondering if you could provide just a little bit more detail. You alluded to the execution issues that you're facing. I was wondering if those were in markets where you've already rolled out business transformation, or in markets that haven't been touched by those efforts yet.
William J. DeLaney: Erin, it’s Bill. No, they were just -- I'm just trying to give you all some color. When you look over our business and you're talking about roughly 70 operating companies in the U.S. and another 10 or 12 large companies in Canada plus Ireland, the beauty of this business is there's always things that we're doing well and we can do even better. And then there's always going to be situations where we're not doing and performing quite as well as we would like. So the point is, is I can tell you without, from where I sit and where our management team sits, that there are several markets where we probably could have managed the operations side of the business a little bit better, and we will. And we're very focused on that. And so I share that with you basically to be candid, but also to illustrate the nature of the business, that it's one of continuous improvement. With that said, we did a nice job on the SG&A side. And so from the standpoint of looking at it overall, that's why you saw in my prepared comments from an overall expense management standpoint, the expenses in the core business grew about 3%. That's pretty good. We think we can do as well as that or better going forward.
Operator: And this concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'll turn it back to the management team for any final comments.
Neil A. Russell: Thank you, everyone, for joining us. Have a good day.
Operator: And this concludes today's presentation. Thanks for joining and have a nice day.

William J. DeLaney: Thank you, Neil, and good morning, everyone. This morning, Sysco reported sales and net earnings for the fiscal year of $42.4 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. Earnings per share was $1.90. Excluding certain items, adjusted earnings per share for our underlying business was $2.13, representing a 4.4% increase year-over-year. Sales grew 7.8% for the year as case volume growth of 3% and product cost inflation of 5.5% contributed to the highest annual sales level in our history. Earnings growth was not as strong as pricing pressures resulted in only modest gross profit dollar gains. However, we did experience improved expense management in the fourth quarter and expect to continue that trend in the new fiscal year. Cash flow from operations approximated $1.4 billion, a significant improvement over our performance in the prior year. On the capital investment front, we recently completed construction and began shipping from 3 new and more efficient distribution facilities, a 420,000-square-foot facility outside of Boston, a second 420,000-square-foot facility located between Austin and San Antonio and a 240,000-square-foot facility on Long Island. All 3 of these operating companies are located in large markets that provide tremendous growth opportunities for Sysco. Looking forward, we remain totally committed to profitably growing our business in the $225 billion market that we serve today. While industry growth is expected to remain modest, we are highly focused on strengthening and expanding our customer relationships, as well as reducing the cost structure of our underlying business. To do so requires transformational change in all aspects of our business. Successfully deploying a new and enhanced technology platform is a foundational component of such change, and we continue to progress on that front. Specifically, we recently converted our East Texas operating company to our new ERP system in late July, our third location to go live. We are pursuing a market-based approach for our rollout schedule, which we believe will enhance the conversion process in 2 key ways: First, we have more -- we will more effectively leverage our market leadership team; and second, the close geographic proximity of the operating companies will permit us to utilize all of our resources in a more flexible and efficient manner. As a result, our next 5 planned conversions will be facilities in Texas and Louisiana, all of which are expected to occur this fiscal year. As conversions have occurred, we have become increasingly encouraged with the ramp-up in services provided and the quality of service at our Shared Business Services center, or SBS, here in Texas. SBS is staffed and effectively supporting our 3 converted companies with multiple centralized functions, including financial support, replenishment, national account pricing and a customer support call center. We have also begun to make progress on our key business transformation cost reduction initiatives. These initiatives focus on improving productivity in our operations, selling and administrative areas, as well as lowering product costs. For example, each of our Broadline operating companies has already taken action in a variety of areas and begun to implement processes designed to enhance productivity in delivery and warehouse operations. On the SG&A side, after careful and thoughtful analysis, we have elected to restructure our domestic nonunion retirement programs. Specifically, effective December 31, we will significantly enhance our 401(k) plan and freeze our nonunion-defined benefit pension plan. The enhanced 401(k) plan will provide benefits to our associates that are highly competitive in the marketplace in a manner that results in meaningful cost savings to Sysco over time. Chris will discuss the financial savings in a moment. On the product side, we are moving forward with developing our category management process, including preparing to pilot several food categories. Returning value to our shareholders remains a top priority for Sysco. We recognize that our dividend represents a significant component of Sysco's shareholder return, especially as we navigate through the transformational changes I noted earlier. Accordingly, we increased our dividend during this past year, the 42nd time since our founding in 1970. In total, we distributed $623 million in dividends to shareholders during fiscal 2012. Looking back on 2012, it was clearly a year of transition for Sysco. While fiscal 2013 will undoubtedly provide its share of challenges, we are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead to profitably grow our core business and expand beyond the core over time. In closing, I want to thank all of our associates for their efforts this past year in supporting our customers. Their contributions going forward are critical to fully realizing Sysco's vision to become our customers' most valued and trusted business partner. Now I'll turn things over to Chris so he can provide additional details on our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year.
Robert C. Kreidler: Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. For the fourth quarter, sales were $11 billion or an increase of 5.9% compared to the prior year, driven equally by case volume growth of 3.4% and food cost inflation of 3.3%. Excluding acquisition, case volume increased 3.3%. In addition, acquisitions within the last 12 months increased sales by 0.6% and changes in foreign exchange rates decreased sales by 0.5%. During fiscal 2012, we completed 9 acquisitions, representing nearly $270 million in annualized sales and met our goal of increasing sales by 0.5% to 1% through acquisitions. Nearly 20% of our new case growth came from acquisitions in fiscal 2012. We have a number of additional acquisitions at various stages of completion in our pipeline and are targeting to increase sales in excess of 1% through acquisitions in fiscal 2013. Gross profit in the fourth quarter continued to be pressured by an intensely competitive market. Gross profit in the fourth quarter increased 2.9%, but gross margin decreased 54 basis points year-over-year to 18.2%. Fuel surcharges provided no benefits to year-over-year comparison as surcharges were comparable in both periods. Gross margins have historically increased in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, but we broke that trend in the fourth quarter of 2011. We are encouraged the gross margin increased 39 basis points from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of this fiscal year, which is more in line with historic trends. Operating expenses increased $103 million or 7.4% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 compared to the prior year period. This increase included $23 million in certain charges that were mainly related to the withdrawal of one of our operating companies from a multi-employer pension plan or MEPP. Excluding these certain charges, operating expenses increased $80 million or 5.7%. Operating expenses were also impacted by a $38 million increase in gross business transformation expense and a $20 million increase in salaries and related costs. Operating income decreased $45 million or 8.1% driven by a decrease in gross margin, partially offset with gains in case volume. Excluding the certain items that I mentioned previously, operating income decreased 4%. Net earnings for the fourth quarter were $309 million, a decrease of $27 million or 8% compared to the prior year. Diluted EPS was $0.53, a 7% decline compared to the prior year. Excluding certain items, diluted EPS was $0.55. As we have discussed on previous calls, we believe it is important to focus on the performance of our underlying business, which not only excludes certain items but also excludes business transformation expenses and the impact of COLI. As a reminder, COLI had a minimal positive impact on our results in fiscal 2012 but had a significantly more positive impact in fiscal 2011.  Adjusted operating expenses, which excludes these items and better reflects our underlying business performance, increased 3.3%; and adjusted operating income increased 2.2%. Net earnings on this basis grew 3.7% to $367 million and EPS grew 3.3% to $0.62. Turning to the year-over-year comparison. Sales increased 7.8% or $3.1 million, due mainly to inflation of 5.5% and case growth of 3%. Food cost inflation declined steadily throughout the year from 7.3% in the first quarter to 3.3% in the fourth quarter. Excluding acquisitions, case volume grew 2.5% for the year. In addition, sales from acquisitions increased sales by 0.7%, and changes in foreign exchange rates did not have a meaningful impact. Gross profit increased 3.8% during the year while gross margin decreased 69 basis points year-over-year to 18.1%. The decline in gross margin was due to high inflation combined with weak restaurant traffic, competitive pressures, segment mix and a more aggressive go-to-market strategy. Operating expenses increased $323 million or 5.9% in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011. Operating expenses for both years were impacted by certain items primarily consisting of MEPP withdrawals. In fiscal 2012, these certain items were approximately $13 million lower compared to the prior year. Excluding these certain items, operating expenses increased 6.2%. Operating expenses also included $147 million increase in salaries and related costs due to increases in delivery and sales compensation, increased volume in acquisitions, a $91 million increase in gross business transformation expenses and a $40 million increase in fuel expense. These increases were partially offset by a $27 million decline in corporate-sponsored pension plan expense. Cost per case in our Broadline Companies was up $0.04 year-over-year. This was mainly due to increased delivery costs, including a $0.02 increase related to an increase in fuel price. Operating income declined $41 million or 2.1% for the fiscal year. Excluding certain items, operating income declined 2.7%. Net earnings for fiscal 2012 decreased $30 million or 2.6% compared to the prior year. Fiscal 2012 EPS was $1.90, a decline of 3.1%. Excluding certain items, EPS was $1.93. To summarize the performance of our underlying business, adjusted operating expenses increased 4.1%, adjusted operating income increased 3%, adjusted net earnings grew 4.7% and adjusted EPS grew 4.4% to $2.13. Turning to the impact of the Business Transformation Project for a moment. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, gross project expenses totaled $70 million, and we capitalized $23 million related to the project. In the prior year quarter, gross project expenses totaled $33 million, and we capitalized $49 million related to the project. For fiscal 2012, expenses for business transformation are $193 million compared to $103 million in fiscal 2011, and total capitalized amounts were $146 million compared to $196 million in the prior year. As we discussed during our Investor Day, we expect cash flows to improve significantly over the next several years due to our business transformation initiative and improved working capital management. Cash flow from operations for fiscal year 2012 was $1.4 billion an approximately $300 million or 29% increase compared to $1.1 billion in the prior year period. This improvement was due mainly to improved working capital management and lower tax payments during the year. Working capital has improved year-to-date due mainly to smaller increases in accounts receivable and inventories this year compared to the prior year. This is due to improvements in DSOs for receivables and inventory, partially offset by a decline in accounts payable DSOs. Of note, we paid our final IRS tax settlement payment during the fourth quarter for a total of $212 million during this fiscal year and $952 million over the last 3 years. The completion of these settlement payments will have a significant positive impact on our cash flows in future periods. Capital expenditures totaled $152 million for the fourth quarter and $785 million for the fiscal year. We had 4 new facility projects during the year, including the facilities Bill discussed earlier, which were completed during the year, as well as a new facility under construction in California that we expect to be complete late this fiscal year. This is compared to having only one such major project underway in the prior year. In addition, capital expenditures related to our Business Transformation Project increased by $50 million year-over-year. Free cash flow increased 36% or $165 million to $620 million. During the quarter, we accessed the capital markets with very attractive rates, completing a bond offering of $750 million. The transaction was completed in 2 tranches, $300 million of 3-year securities at 65 basis points, the lowest rate ever achieved for a 3-year deal at the time and $450 million of 10-year notes at 2.6%. The effective rate for the entire issuance was around 2%, a continual reminder of the strength of our balance sheet and cash flows. Before closing, there are few guidance metrics for fiscal 2013 that I'd like to provide. First, based upon current market conditions and external forecasts, we expect fuel expense to be relatively flat year-over-year; second, regarding business transformation. As we shared with you at our Investor Day, we expect gross business transformation expenses, net of direct benefits related to SBS, to be approximately $300 million to $350 million for the year, including the amortization of project costs. As Bill mentioned, we are now in the deployment phase of our new ERP system. And so this month, we began to amortize the capitalized costs related to the development of this system over a roughly 7-year period. The majority of work occurring going forward is expected to relate mostly to conversion and training, which is expensed for accounting purposes. As a result, you'll see a decline in the amount of capitalized spend on our Business Transformation Project going forward. This year, we expect to capitalize roughly $5 million to $20 million, which is $130 million to $140 million lower than our capital spend for fiscal 2012. As we outlined at our Investor Day, we expect that we'll achieve $550 million to $650 million in annualized benefits from business transformation by fiscal 2015, of which we expect to achieve roughly 25% in fiscal 2013. As Bill said earlier, we have begun to make progress on all of our key business transformation initiatives. Third, total CapEx for fiscal year 2013 is expected to be approximately $600 million to $650 million, which is substantially lower than the $785 million we spent in fiscal 2012. Lastly, I want to address pension expense for fiscal 2013. As we were developing our 2013 financial plan, we learned that we were facing more than $100 million in additional pension expense for next year, primarily driven by continuous declines in interest rates. This substantial increase would have been in addition to the significant increases in 2 of the last 3 years. We determined we needed to carefully review our retirement programs. As a result of our analysis, as Bill discussed earlier, we announced this morning that we made the decision to freeze our defined benefit pension plan effective December 31 and simultaneously enhance benefits to employees under our 401(k) or defined contribution plan. The net impact of these changes will result in the roughly $25 million in additional retirement expense in fiscal 2013. While still an increase, this represents a more than $80 million cost avoidance. It's important to note that the net impact of these changes in our retirement plans will not be even across the quarters during the year. Retirement plan expense in the second half of the year will be higher than the first half. Because these changes become effective at the midpoint of fiscal 2013, we estimate that our retirement plan expenses will be lower in 2014. In closing, while fiscal year 2012 was a year of transition, we continue to stay focused on our future. Fiscal 2013 will be another critical year for us as we work through the first round of ERP deployment and begin to realize benefits from several areas of our business transformation plan. Sysco has been a leader in the industry for over 40 years; and while the change we are undergoing is difficult and requires a substantial investment, it is important to the future success of this company. All of us here at Sysco are focused on transforming the company and believe that this will enable us to further strengthen our financial results over time and enhance our industry leadership position. With that, operator, we'll now take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.
Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: It's actually Steve Forbes on for John today. Just a couple quick questions. The sequential improvement in gross margin this quarter, is that tied to getting more pricing through or a conscious effort to pull back on some promotional spending?
William J. DeLaney: I think, Steve, it's just some modest improvement on our part in terms of execution. As Chris pointed out in his comments, there's a seasonal flow that we tend to participate in as you go into the summer, and I think that helped as well. So I think we're executing somewhat better. I don't think there's anything dramatically different in terms of the promotional spending.
Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And now when it comes to the inflation and pricing for next year, how do you keep your marketing associates focused on gross profit dollar growth and/or case growth?
William J. DeLaney: Well, the way our commission program works, the bulk of our marketing associates are paid on commission, and the biggest factor in that commission is gross profit dollars per delivery. So we continue to tweak that particular model as time goes on to do just what you're suggesting here, which is to keep us focused on growth and quality growth. But the bottom line is they're highly incentivized to service our customers well, but at the same time to strike the right balance between sales and gross profit dollars.
Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then just lastly on case growth. Did you see any change from June to July in case volume growth, I guess, after what some of the restaurant operators reported last week?
William J. DeLaney: We don't comment on inter-quarter type of developments, but I would tell you that certainly, we service pretty much the whole spectrum of the marketplace, and you can see that we saw somewhat of a slowdown in the fourth quarter. Pricing eased a little bit as well, which was good, I think, but at the same time, our top line fell off some, and I think we're going to experience, to some degree, what you're seeing from some of the other people in the space.
Operator: And our next question will come from Greg Badishkanian with Citi.
Alvin C. Concepcion - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Alvin Concepcion for Greg. Just wanted to ask another question related to the margin, gross margin. Sounds like there hasn't been much of a change in the promotional spending. What's your outlook on promotional spending in fiscal '13? And would you expect a year-over-year improvement in gross margin next year?
William J. DeLaney: Okay. Maybe I should take a minute and let's talk about promotional spending because that's 2 questions right off the bat. As far as I know, we don't really talk about promotional spending. So the bottom line is we do promote -- we have various marketing vehicles that we promote locally and to some extent here at corporate. That hasn't changed to any large extent over the last quarter, over the last year. I think as we've talked about margin pressure over the last 12 to 18 months, we've attributed a lot of that to the challenges of passing along mid to high single-digit rates of inflation in a marketplace that's still pretty fragile and just kind of an uneven business recovery on top of that. So I think -- I don't think this really has much to do with promotional spending. The bottom line is we're out there competing. We feel very appropriately and very aggressively in a pretty challenging marketplace. And we saw improvement, as you saw, and pointed out in the fourth quarter and certainly as we talked about in May, we expect to continue to improve those trends. But I don't believe that we've indicated in any way that we would expect to be over last year's gross profit.
Alvin C. Concepcion - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I see. And on the promotional spending front again, I mean, that's from your end, what about from the competitive standpoint? Are you seeing any changes there relative to last quarter?
William J. DeLaney: I'm sorry, could you repeat that question?
Alvin C. Concepcion - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Yes, I'm just wondering if the competitive promotional environment has changed very much relative to last quarter.
William J. DeLaney: I don't think so. Again, I'm going to just attribute that to kind of the competitive environment. And we see different things in different parts of the country, and frankly, we see different behavior with different types of competitors. As you know, we deal with very large regional, national-type competitors, and then there's a lot of niche players as well. So I have to tell you that the environment remains very challenging from a competitive standpoint, and we expect it to continue that way. But I wouldn't say it's changed a whole lot.
Alvin C. Concepcion - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay, great. And then the case volume growth in the quarter, it accelerated relative to last quarter, and obviously, I think you mentioned that you might see some more -- the weak restaurant traffic impact your results. I mean, can you talk about what some of the drivers were in the quarter in that accelerated improvement in case volumes?
William J. DeLaney: Well, I think in this particular quarter, I don't know if there's anything particularly different than any other quarter. We're highly focused, as we've talked about at length over the last several calls and in our public presentations, on the importance for Sysco as a leader in the industry to continue to take share and to do that profitably. But we've got 8,000 marketing associates out there on the street. We've got a strong sales management team. We have great leadership throughout the country and in Canada, and we work very hard in staying close to our customers. All the basic things that we talk about every time we have an opportunity to speak publicly from menu analysis to good quality business reviews to a very focused time with our salespeople spending with their customers. Those are things that we feel we do better, by and large, than our competition. And as a result, that allows us to grow the business. So with that said, still very competitive and we still have some opportunity to work on our pricing and margin management.
Operator: And next, we'll hear from Ed Kelly with Crédit Suisse.
Edward J. Kelly - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Can I just start on the volume side, that 3.3% case volume growth. Can you talk about how that compares to sort of like the true underlying trend, and what I'm getting at is, an easy comparison this quarter versus last year. Did that play a role? Does weather and calendar play any role in this? And just, could you just give us a sense as to where you think the true business is running sort of underlying all that today? Is it really that level?
William J. DeLaney: Well, yes, it is at that level. We'll take credit for it. I think going to your point, as you go back and look at the latter part of last fiscal year, maybe even the first quarter this year, the volume trends were a little bit more modest. And frankly, that led to us becoming more aggressive as we've talked about here in the last 2 or 3 quarters. So I would tell you that yes, we grew the cases 3%. Part of that was acquisitions, which we feel is a big part of our arsenal. And I wouldn't overweight comparisons when you're talking about the difference of 1% maybe from 1 year to the next, that type of thing. So we feel good with the volume, and we'll take credit for it.
Edward J. Kelly - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And it sounds like, and I don't want to put words in your mouth, Bill, but it sounds like so far in the current quarter, things, just generally speaking, haven't been great but maybe haven't gotten worse. Is that how I should read that?
William J. DeLaney: Things are always great here at Sysco. But no, look, the market, what I'm trying to tell you here without getting into a disclosure area that I can't, is that we're going to participate in what goes on in the market. So I expect us to continue to grow cases. I expect us to take share and to some extent, as we've talked about in terms of our medium to longer-term outlook, we are going to be impacted by the market itself. So to the extent that we see a slowdown as this quarter proceeds, I'm sure we'll feel that to some degree.
Edward J. Kelly - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And then on gross profit dollar growth relative to case growth, this was another quarter where it was slightly less, and I know that's not your long-term goal. So could you maybe just walk through a little bit what was the driver there? And then how long do you think it takes to get us to the point where gross profit dollars maybe are doing a little bit better than volumes again?
William J. DeLaney: Well, we need to get there. It's the bottom line. It's a very fair question. So the way I look at it is we did better in the fourth quarter than we did in the third in terms of that particular relationship but not good enough. So we need to continue, as I mentioned a question or 2 ago, to strike a better balance between the case growth and the gross profit dollars. So I'm encouraged that we saw some modest improvement but there's a ways to go. And all I can tell you is that we're highly focused on it here as a management team and throughout the country, into our sales management and into our sales force. So it's a delicate balance in terms of the economy and the marketplace and trying to be responsive to the needs of our customers, but we certainly see that as an issue and an opportunity for improvement.
Edward J. Kelly - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And then on the MEPP side, maybe could you give us a little bit more color on the charge this quarter? And then within your 10-K last year, you disclosed about a couple hundred million dollar withdrawal liability. And I'm just curious as to how that's calculated. Is that your actuarial value of the underfunding? And could you also give us some sense as to what you think the fair value of the underfunding might be at this point?
Robert C. Kreidler: That question just got worse and worse.
William J. DeLaney: Time for Chris to answer a question there.
Robert C. Kreidler: Started off I said, I can do this one and then you just took it down the rabbit hole. Let me see if I can help. The charge this quarter was related to Cleveland. So 220 employees at our Cleveland operating company withdrew from the Cleveland Bakers and Teamsters plan, and therefore we recorded a withdrawal liability of approximately $17 million. We did have some liabilities earlier in the year that were basically true-ups of prior year withdrawals. And the way that works is you have to record the liability at the value that you know when the withdrawal was actually made. But then, each quarter thereafter there are going to be true-ups until you actually are allowed to withdraw from that particular plan, which can be 1.5 years later. So I think that's the first part of your question. The second part, we've generally recorded in our 10-K roughly $200 million of liability. I wouldn't call that an actuarial. That is basically our assessment of the materials that we get from those plan trustees about the status of their plans. We don't manage those plans, we just get materials. And unfortunately, it takes a long time for us to get those materials. We're still stating that liability based upon materials that are as old as year-end 2009 to 2010, so they're just not given to us very timely. And the 10-K that you'll see in a couple of weeks, we'll update that number, which is just, as we described it, it's the total withdrawal or the potential liability if we withdrew from all the plans, which is, of course, not something we would ever foresee doing. But then under new guidelines, we're required to put down a number that we believe is related to plans from which we would reasonably, possibly, either voluntarily withdraw or there would be a mass withdrawal. That number is about half that $200 million. It's about $100 million. Did that get close to answering your question?
Edward J. Kelly - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Yes, I think. And I think when your K comes out, we'll probably be able to do more work on that as well. Another question for you on the national account pricing. I don't -- I'm not sure if I heard this correctly, but it sounded to me like you had suggested that pricing would be moving to the SBS level. Is that right?
William J. DeLaney: No, not the negotiation of pricing or the relationships. We handle our contract customers in various ways, but we have a significant group that works out of the corporate office that covers what we call corporate multiunit, and then we obviously have regional and local chains that we tend to handle those relationships locally through the operating companies. What's going on at SBS is more just the facilitation of the processes themselves.
Edward J. Kelly - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And one last question for you here. Your CapEx guidance, I think, was a little bit higher today than at the analyst meeting. And then related to that, with the IRS payment being done, you should start generating some free cash flow again. So the question is, what do you guys plan on doing with that free cash flow?
Robert C. Kreidler: The CapEx actually is in line with what we talked about at Investor Day. You're focused on the $600 million that I showed at Investor Day, but right underneath that was a line for business transformation capitalization, which was a range of $5 million to $20 million. So depending on where you are in that range, we just put a range around CapEx, $600 million to $650 million. Nothing has really changed in the assumptions that we're using for this year. We just put a range around it so I think it's generally in line with what we talked about. We do intend to generate additional free cash flow this year. We've not changed our posture with regards to how we view our cash. We're reinvesting into the business. We're certainly making sure that we can have a substantial and growing dividend, and we're looking for additional acquisitions as much as possible. If we start to generate significant additional free cash, we'll take a look, again, at the shares. But right now, that's just not the case.
Operator: And the next question comes from Andrew Wolf with BB&T Capital Markets.
Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: On the -- I wanted to ask, did the lower rates of inflation, did that help with the gross margin management? I know you said, sounded like you're just getting a little more acumen with managing it. But I just want to -- in relation to lower inflation, did that help? Do you think a lower inflation had any effect on the case growth?
William J. DeLaney: Andy, I'll start there. Sure, it helps. I mean, as we've talked over the last 2 or 3 quarters, there's a certain math to this whole inflation discussion. So when you go from 5.5% to 3.5%, give or take, that definitely helps. And it goes category by category, that type of thing. So there's no doubt that, that contributed to it, as well as I do think we executed, as I said, modestly better and there's plenty of room for improvement there. I think as far as case growth, I don't know that, that happens quite as fast. I know there's kind of this analytical way of looking at it. The key for us, I think, as it relates to the inflation is over the medium to long term, we've been very consistent on this and we truly believe it is that it's just better for our customers and our customers' customers if we can see a more moderate level of say 2 to 3 points of inflation over time. That's just a better environment for business, and whether it be our customers or ourselves. And so I think, if we can stay there and be relatively consistent and not have too much volatility in the respective categories, I think that's more of a medium-term benefit for us.
Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: Okay. On the case growth getting better, how do you -- how do we look at that or how do you look at that? Was any of that improvement or at same customers? Or was it really mainly new customers and really taking market share in that way?
William J. DeLaney: It's a combination of 3 things. We continue to improve our customer retention. That's had a lot of focus here, and we've talked about it somewhat publicly. So our customer retention numbers have improved over the last year or 2 and that certainly helps. We have seen penetration. That's obviously going to vary by customer and be somewhat dependent on how healthy their business is, but overall, we've seen some case penetration. And yes, largely or not largely, but we tend to do a good job on new business as well. So it comes from the 2 that you mentioned, which is new business as well as penetration. But also, again, just an environment like this, we just need to stay closer and closer to our customers and just minimize lost accounts.
Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: Okay. Are you willing to say if it's more one than the other?
William J. DeLaney: I'd be willing to say if I knew. I mean, it's actually -- it's hard to kind of get precise information on that, but I actually think it's a little bit of all 3, Andy.
Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: Fair enough. My last question is back to the pension freeze. I had to drop off the call for a second. Could you just give the swing, what this year's swing for that? I think you gave the numbers in -- or the numbers that get us to the math, either way.
Robert C. Kreidler: Yes. And actually, I think, we flashed the chart on the screen as we were going through it. But the net-net is an increase of about $25 million for this year, and it would have gone up over $100 million save for the freeze and then we expect it to be lower in '14.
William J. DeLaney: I think there's a broader issue here, though, Andy. And obviously, this is a very sensitive issue internally and it's just being announced today, clearly, throughout Sysco. So we've been looking at this for a period of time, and the reality is as growth has slowed industry-wise and even for Sysco, we've continued to see the liability of the pension plan grow meaningfully faster than the business is growing. So the broader picture here is that we needed to address that in a prudent way, and we feel that we have and we feel, as we communicate the new planned structure with the 401(k), I think our folks will find that it's a very competitive plan and provides a lot of opportunity to appropriately save for retirement.
Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: Absolutely. I mean, you definitely were one of the last companies with a generous pension plan. I just wanted to ask us one last thing about that, then I'm going to drop off, is from my understanding of these plans is they have different vesting, 20, 25 years and so on. And obviously, that helps to keep senior management in place. What's going to happen with those provisions? Are those also frozen, or does the vesting continue just with no more increased contribution?
William J. DeLaney: Which plans are you talking about, Andy?
Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: So your plans are fully vested without relation to time of service?
Robert C. Kreidler: No, the pension plan you do vest over time in the pension plan. What we're doing is we're freezing the pension plan. Whatever benefits you have today, you retain. All of your new benefits will come from a 401(k) defined contribution plan going forward. So upon retirement, what you'll have is the vested benefits in your pension from the date at which we froze it plus your defined contribution benefit that grew from that point going forward.
Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: Yes. So if somebody's a year away from the hurdle for vesting, next year it'll vest, it'll just be on today's amount.
William J. DeLaney: That's correct. And just a point of interest, I mean, our plans, I don't have the specifics but our vesting tends to be pretty much 100% within 5 or 7 years, something like that. So you vest relatively quickly here. So most of our people are vested, and then it will work like you say. And then what we'll be doing over the next few weeks is communicating the components of the 401(k) plan and so on and so forth.
Operator: And the next question comes from Michael Kelter with Goldman Sachs.
Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I recall you guys saying in the past that 1% to 2% inflation is a sweet spot for you, and it appears like we're heading there. And I guess, my question is why won't your gross margins be up in 2013 if that happens if we hit your sweet spot? Or are gross margins going to keep going down regardless of the level of inflation because of the broader industry conditions?
William J. DeLaney: Well, obviously, Michael, we don't have the answers to those questions. Those are great questions. I would tell you, we've had now 1 quarter of 3% inflation, and it looks like this quarter's starting now in a similar way. So I mean, I think we will see some moderate inflation for a period of time. We're not clear on how long that'll stabilize given what's going on with the droughts and various things around the world. So I think we need to wait and see to some extent how this thing plays out here over the next 6, 9, 12 months. What I said and what I do believe is, I think, the lower inflation will take some pressure off of our customers, and that will take some pressure off of us, so that should support some of the initiatives we have to strike the right balance between growth and margins. But the other thing I'm saying is what I also said pretty consistently is this is different than 2 years ago or 4 years ago or 5 years ago. Until this economy shows more consistent improvement and until our customers participate in that, there's going to continue to be a lot of pricing pressure out there. So I'm not saying that we can't improve our margins over time, I'm just saying we need to take it one step at a time and right now, our goals are -- is to reverse the trends that we saw this past year.
Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And the spike in grain that you alluded to, I mean, what kind of a lag before something like that will hit your P&L? And when it does, whether it's a quarter from now or 2 quarters from now, whatever the right answer is there, should we expect that the pace of gross margin declines to accelerate again as we get into the heart of 2013?
William J. DeLaney: I don't know. I wish I did know and I wish I could give you more specific answers there. But typically, what happens is it takes a while for it to work itself through the food chain, into the meal for the cattle and the poultry and all that, so works its way through the feedstock and then into our cost of center of play items. And I would expect that, that will take 3 to 6 months at least for us to see that play out. And we'll just have to see how the business climate is in general. So we're not hiding behind that. We would love to see a nice, stable inflation environment but I'm just pointing out that we could see some pressure on pricing here later in the year. That's all.
Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And kind of switching gears, another thing, you had mentioned that in 2013 that acquisitions would drive over 1% to sales. That actually hasn't happened in 7 years, and so I thought that was interesting. I was curious if there was one specific acquisition of size that's in the pipeline that you're thinking about? Or if it's reflective of a bunch of smaller deals? And if it's one of size, is it in the U.S. or international? Is it a traditional competitor or somehow tangential? Just kind of a better idea as to where you guys are going on the acquisition side would be great.
Robert C. Kreidler: Yes, what we continue to talk about on the acquisition side is a string, as many as possible, of these smaller transactions that are, in combination, become meaningful to us, so that's what we said. We did 9 transactions for $270 million. Actually, I think, last year, we were above 1%. I'd have to go back and check my numbers, but I thought we were just above 1%. But our goal has been 0.5 to 1 point. What we're really pointing out is we're starting to accelerate that and we're starting to increase our pipeline. Our goal this year is north of 1% through a combination of these smaller-ish transactions. I don't want to characterize them as being small and meaningless. They're not at all. Every one of them is important to us, but they're smaller than the $500 million or $600 million regional-sized transactions that we'd love to get, but are just frankly very, very difficult to get and they don't come along very often.
Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And then lastly on these changes to the retirement plans. Just simplistically, is your pension expense no longer going to move with interest rates as we look forward? If -- I mean, just so I understand when you say a freeze, I mean, is that -- are interest rates no longer relevant for you?
Robert C. Kreidler: No, they're very relevant to us. We still have a $1 billion-plus pension plan that's out there that has to be revalued every year. What the freeze does is it stops growing in terms of the assets and the liabilities, so that's [indiscernible] the growth of it will now cease. The next step in managing our retirement plans is starting to go after the volatility of those assets, and we do have more work going on in that area as well. But as Bill said, this is something we've been looking at for a while. Pension expense has been going up significantly over the last few years. It was growing at a rate that was just frankly not sustainable, and so we needed to come up with a different set of plans that would be beneficial to our employees and to help with retention of our employees and help them plan for their retirements, while at the same time not causing our expenses to grow at a rate that's frankly our earnings could not sustain. So we've looked at a number of things. Step one is we've got to freeze what's there. Now we've got to go about looking at how we reduce the volatility of the liabilities that still exist on the balance sheet.
Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And are you guys still then at this point looking at what your assumptions are for your existing exposure? And how conservative do you feel like those assumptions are at this point given how long interest rates have stayed low and returns have stayed low?
Robert C. Kreidler: Well, so there are 2 separate components to figuring out the pension expense. Obviously, the first one is discount rate, which we unfortunately have nothing to do with. Interest rates drive down the discount rate. It's declined even more this year from a rate that I didn't think it could even decline from last year, so that cost us a tremendous amount of valuation and was driving our interest -- or driving our pension expense to be significantly higher for '13. The second component is the discount rate that you -- or sorry, the return that you assume on the portfolio. We evaluate that every year. You look at 70 years' worth of history on a portfolio of assets that you invest in. Obviously, the last 10 years are not good compared to that 70-year history, and so we're constantly evaluating, are we too aggressive? Are we too conservative? That's something we evaluate every year.
Operator: And our next question comes from Mark Wiltamuth with Morgan Stanley.
Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: If you look at the gross margin rate, I was curious how your new business wins look versus the existing book on the gross profit rate.
William J. DeLaney: Great question, Mark. It's another one of those ones that when you have as much new business as we have, I mean, you're talking about double-digit new business, it's hard to critique that, but I would say it's a mixture. Generally, the new business, as it comes these days, comes a little bit harder and a little bit more competitively. So I don't have a lot of data on that in terms of the entire company. But more than likely, it probably comes in a little bit less than the average would be my best judgment on that.
Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And as we look at the business transformation savings as they come in, what kind of timing should we expect on that? Is this something that builds throughout the year? Or do you expect any quarters bigger than others?
Robert C. Kreidler: We've not given any quarterly breakout of that, but I think it would be fairly safe to assume it will build over time. Just as it's going to build over the 3-year period, it's going to build during each of those 3 years.
Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And then on the inflation, what is your protein team saying? It seems like there's a pretty good chance you're going to be looking at much higher inflation next year. I'm curious what your thoughts are there.
William J. DeLaney: Well, we're seeing higher prices now in beef and poultry. And we're seeing deflation actually in dairy and produce right now, and then everything else is kind of around the average. So they're pretty much saying what we're reading and what I tried to say earlier, which is that we should expect to see some pressure as the year goes along.
Operator: And next we'll hear from Ajay Jain with Cantor Fitzgerald.
Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: Yes, I just wanted to get some more color on your outlook, your near-term outlook for ERP in fiscal '13. So could you maybe talk about how much your guidance is in related as far as expenses and the projected cost savings? It looks like $150 million is still what you're roughly expecting on the cost savings side. But if at some point over the next year, it looks like you're not getting the benefits at the rate that you're currently looking for, I mean, would you still plan on absorbing as much as $350 million on ERP cost? How much variability could there potentially be on the expense side?
Robert C. Kreidler: Yes, Ajay, those 2 things really aren't tied. So as we tried to do during the Investor Day, we tried to explain that the expenses are primarily due to the technological implementation of our new ERP system. So the $300 million to $350 million, net of direct benefits from SBS, that's the expense that we plan to incur as we now implement and roll out the ERP system, and we gave guidance of 520 companies during the course of the year. Bill gave you a little more color about where the next 5 of those were going to be. So that's kind of part A. Part B is we also have the business transformation initiatives, cost-saving initiatives, that do not rely upon that technology to go forward. And so we're going down the road on a variety of those that we outlined in great detail, and that's where we expect to receive the 25% of our overall benefit in the first year.
Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. I just had one follow-up question. It's maybe just a variation of some of the questions that have been asked on inflation. So just wondering internally, how concerned are you guys based on the current weather and drought conditions that a lot of that recent volume improvement, case volume improvement, begins to slip away very quickly if inflation starts to get out of control?
William J. DeLaney: I don't think we're overly concerned, at least, not any more concerned in the last 2 or 3 years, Ajay. I mean, it's part of what you deal within this business and when you put it in the context of some of the other challenges that we have out there in terms of the marketplace and our customers' ability to grow and that kind of thing, I think it's certainly -- we take it seriously. But it's also -- comes into the bucket that we don't really have much of an ability to influence it. So I wouldn't -- I'd be probably more concerned about the economy and whether we can see a little bit more stability and a little more consistent improvement there, because then that creates a mindset in the consumer wanting to go out to eat more, and that's always the key, I think, for our business is that people want to go out to eat and they're not totally focused on what it's going to cost or how many times they go out and all that kind of thing. I mean, right now, our information is a little dated, but we're still seeing increases in traffic and check size. And it varies between concept and that kind of thing. But we just need to see improved -- consistently improving psyche of the consumer, and I think we can weather the rest of it.
Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: So can you comment as far as quarter-to-date have volume trends deteriorated at all sequentially?
William J. DeLaney: I really can't. As I mentioned earlier, we just don't do that. But again, you know us real well and we play in the entire space in this market so to the extent that you're seeing softness out there, we would certainly expect to participate in some of that as the quarter goes along.
Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: And finally, can you confirm if there were any quantifiable ERP benefits in the fourth quarter?
William J. DeLaney: We really didn't look at it that way, to be honest. I'm sure they were modest, but essentially what we have said is -- what Chris just talked you through, is we've laid this thing on in terms of our roadmap, and we're looking to knock down about 25% of that cost savings here this year. And it's going to come from operations, it's going to come from SG&A and it's probably going to come a little bit more toward the end of the year than at the beginning of the year.
Operator: And our next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.
John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: At this point, I think it's fairly short. You made a comment, and I think it was Chris that did, I don't remember, talking about expending Sysco beyond the core over time. And I guess, is that a 2013 event? Is that the type of technology initiatives that may come from Sysco ventures or are there other things that we should be thinking about in near-term significance just to put some parameters around that?
William J. DeLaney: John, it's Bill. I think that was actually in my prepared comments. So Chris can take a break here. No, it's no different than what we've talked about before. I think, again, in terms of our communications and messaging, we want to make sure that all of our constituents understand that we're primarily focused on the core right now. We've got a lot going on, a lot of opportunity out there. But yes, we continue to look for ways to grow in an adjacent manner. And over time, we still would like to grow international. But I didn't put a timeline on that as much as I said. Over time, I think was actually words that I used. So it's more of a strategic objective here over the medium term.
John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And you said outside the core is international as opposed to something within the U.S.?
William J. DeLaney: Well, it could be -- we could look at adjacencies of the Sysco ventures as you mentioned as kind of bridges both as you start talking to folks who have opportunities for us to partner with in terms of business solutions that are more technology-driven, those types of things. But the attraction there, obviously, is to create a stronger relationship with our customer base and more traction to help them grow and to solidify our position with our customers over time. So no, it would be both adjacencies as well as international.
Operator: And our question comes from Meredith Adler with Barclays.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I first want to just talk about the money, the 25% of savings that you're expecting to get this year. That isn't really part of business transformation process, right? Those are a whole set of separate initiatives that you've started working on last year -- or this year, I should say this year, is that right, '12?
Robert C. Kreidler: No, we view all of the initiatives that we have undertaken as part of the transformation of our business from what was the old the business model, if you will, to what needs to be the new business model in order to compete going forward. Many of them originally were described as being enabled by this new ERP system. And as we got further and further into the ERP system design and implementation, we realized we did not need to wait on the ERP system in order to attack some of these other business transformation initiatives. So now we're talking about them as separate streams of work, but it's all under the moniker of business transformation because frankly most of this is different than what we've done before.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division: So they're not actually benefits from the ERP system, there's just other ways to save money?
Robert C. Kreidler: Yes, that's fair. I mean, again, business transformation is not ERP. ERP is the technology change that we set out to put in place several years ago. And again, the original plan if we step back before my time, but I certainly understand it now, the original plan was if we're going to do through all the work to develop and design a new ERP system that changes all of our processes, everything about how we go to market, let's go and do this operating company by operating company and change the business model one at a time. So everything was really on one kind of rollout schedule. As we got further into it, we realized it doesn't need to be done that way, and especially as the ERP implementation slowed down, we realized we needed to go faster on the rest of it. So we just disconnected them.
William J. DeLaney: Meredith, if I could just jump in there, I want to -- there's a key point and I think it's key to anybody who would be listening to this call, inside or outside Sysco. If you go back to our May presentation there with all of you, we took a fair amount of time to reframe this deal and to, if you will, rebrand it to some extent from a standpoint of what Chris just took you through. So business transformation is essentially us coming to grips with what we need to do, the changes we need to make in terms of our processes, how we go to market to continue to enhance our leadership position in this industry going forward for the next 5 or 10 years. Now 3 and 4 years ago, when we had more of a design than anything else, we bundled it all together in terms of one. So where we sit today, we're talking to you about deploying the technology platform effectively throughout Sysco so that's one big bucket. And then we're talking about taking a look holistically at all of our practices in terms of how we run the business, selling, general, administrative, all the different things that we do, how we organize the company and revisiting those, some of which, as Chris said, would have been part of the original business case for 2012, a few of which weren't; many of which do not require new technology platform to get those going because a lot of it has to do with a more consistent go-to-market implementation of our business practices. And then third is sitting down and partnering with our suppliers, our product suppliers and finding more efficient and more effective ways of sharing cost savings on product, and at the same time doing it in a way where we can grow the business. So this is a key point. The business transformation going forward for Sysco encompasses all 3 of those buckets, if you will, and not just the technology platform. Now we can't get to the finish line without the technology platform. So that remains very foundational, as I said, in my comments. But it's just one piece of it.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And I guess where I was confused is I thought some of these new cost saving initiatives truly were new and had not originally been envisioned when you laid this out. But you're saying it's just an acceleration of how you implement those things.
William J. DeLaney: I'm saying there's a lot of that, and then I'm also saying, look, we're running a business here, right, so we're somewhat behind on the deployment schedule. We've got some cost overruns, so we're running the business and we've taken stock over the last 6 to 9 months of other things that we can do in the company to offset the cost overrun. So it's a combination but largely it's an acceleration of the original business case.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Great. That's very clear. I have one other question. This wasn't a great year for the company as a whole, and I don't know how that compared to your internal plan. But I was wondering what happened with bonuses for the company this year? Were they up or down versus last year and kind of how did that play out over the quarters?
Robert C. Kreidler: Well, we haven't actually talked about bonuses internally, but I can describe our bonus objectives to you. From the corporate perspective, we basically had 3 bonus objectives: The one was sales, which we have actually achieved our plan and actually somewhat exceeded our plan in terms of sales. We had one that was operating profit and that, of course, was as you -- I'll use your words, was not good in terms of the year. And then one was return on invested capital, and that one kind of went the same way as operating profit. If you don't get your earnings, it's very hard to achieve your ROIC objectives as well. So while we haven't, I don't think we fully ruled on what the bonus outcome is to the employees, that's the general sense of where we were. Compared to last year from a corporate perspective, I would say we'll definitely be lower than the last year, where we had a slightly different bonus plan. Now the operating companies have their own bonus plans. Typically, they're tied partially to the corporate, their leadership team, but then also predominantly to their own performances. So those are going to vary depending upon the performance of the operating company.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division: And have you -- the fourth quarter numbers, do those reflect any assumption about bonus for the year, or is that something that gets actually recorded in fiscal '13?
Robert C. Kreidler: Yes, we had already adjusted and accrued appropriately for where we thought the payouts would be.
William J. DeLaney: So, I think, Meredith, just I'll pile on here a little bit. You're going to see different results on bonus so you won't see them but, obviously, we had some operating companies that performed well above plan and plan, and those folks will make some bonuses and some who didn't. To Chris's point overall, we didn't achieve our earnings goals for the year, so we will not hit our target bonus, but we will pay bonuses this year. I don't know what it is compared to last year to be straight with you, but as Chris also pointed out, we moved to more of a plan-based bonus structure this year and, I think, in the end I think you're going to find it to be very appropriate.
Operator: And with no further questions, we'd like to thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.
William J. DeLaney: Thank you.

William J. DeLaney: Thank you, Neil, and good morning, everyone. This morning, Sysco reported sales of $10.5 billion for the third quarter, a 7.6% increase. Case volume grew 3% including acquisitions, and we believe we continue to gain market share in the industry, which has shown little to no real growth for a number of quarters.  Net earnings for the quarter were $260 million and reported EPS was $0.44. Adjusted EPS was $0.49 and excludes several items including gross business transformation costs. On this basis, adjusted EPS grew 2% for the quarter. We believe this adjusted amount is more representative of the performance of our underlying business. The modest improvement in market conditions we experienced in the latter portion of the second quarter continued through the third quarter, due in part to an unseasonably mild winter in much of the northern part of the geography we serve. Our volume growth for the quarter was solid across nearly all of our business segments as we improved our customer retention, increased our overall account penetration and attracted many new customers to Sysco.  Our cost control performance at the operating company level was very encouraging during the quarter as well. Excluding the impact of fuel prices and prior year multi-employer pension plan charges, we reduced our cost per cases shipped. Conversely, gross margins continue to be a challenge. While 5.5% inflation and some difficult prior year comparisons contributed to the margin erosion we experienced during the quarter, we must execute more effectively in that area of our business. This area is always one of keen focus, and we have several initiatives in various stages of development that are designed to mitigate this pressure and still permit us to be highly responsive to our customers.  Turning to an update on our multiyear business transformation initiative and as we discussed on our second quarter earnings call, we implemented a new technology platform at our second pilot facility back in Oklahoma back in January. While we saw significant improvement in the system's performance compared to our early experience in our first pilot in Arkansas, we did identify certain processes that require additional assessment and enhancement. We are addressing those opportunities now and are targeting a third rollout early in fiscal 2013. Successfully implementing this technology platform is a critical component to our transformation of Sysco.  Effectively driving our transformational change in a company such as Sysco, which has enjoyed a great deal of success over the past 40 years, can be challenging at times. However, in our case, we absolutely need to embrace such change if we are to continue to perform at a high level in a world that is much different than just a few years ago. Notwithstanding the predictable bumps that come with this type of journey, we remain highly focused on positioning Sysco to be a top-performing company for years to come.  In that regard, we recently announced that Manny Fernandez has agreed to expand his role and become Sysco's Executive Chairman of the Board. Manny is an outstanding business leader with a deep technology background. His experience and capabilities will enhance the execution and expedite the implementation of our business transformation work. I've worked closely with Manny for the past 3 years and look forward to his input and support as we build an even more customer-centric and operationally excellent Sysco.  Now I'll turn things over to Chris, so he can provide additional details on our financial results for the quarter.
Robert C. Kreidler: Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter, sales were $10.5 billion or an increase of 7.6% compared to prior year, driven mainly by food cost inflation, which we estimated to be 5.5% for the period. In addition, acquisitions within the last 12 months increased sales by 0.7% and changes in foreign exchange rates decreased sales by 0.2%.  Case volume for the quarter increased 2.9% year-over-year including acquisitions and 2.3% excluding acquisitions. We completed several acquisitions during the quarter, including European Imports, which we announced in late February and enhances our ability to address the specialty foods market. So far this year, we've completed 8 acquisitions representing roughly $260 million in annualized sales. We are on track to achieve our goal of increasing sales by 0.5% to 1% through acquisitions. We have a number of additional acquisitions at various stages of completion in our pipeline that we hope to close in the coming quarters.  Gross profit increased 2.1% during the quarter. Gross margin decreased 95 basis points year-over-year to 17.8%, pressured by an intensely competitive market and high levels of inflation. Operating expenses increased $28 million or 2% in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 compared to the prior year period. The increase in operating expenses was primarily the result of a $29 million increase in salaries and related costs due to higher delivery and sales compensation and acquisitions.  Also impacting operating expenses were a $24 million increase in gross business transformation expenses and a $10 million increase in fuel expense. It's important to note that fuel surcharges offset this increase although they are reflected in gross profits. These operating expense items were partially offset by a $36 million charge in the prior year related to the withdrawal of one of our operating companies from a multi-employer pension plan or MEPP. Reported operating income increased $11 million or 2.7%, and net earnings for the third quarter were $260 million, an increase of $1 million or 0.4% compared to the prior year.  As we have discussed on previous calls, we believe it is important to focus on the performance of our underlying business, excluding the impact of the business transformation project and the impact of COLI, which had a minimal positive impact this year, but had a significantly more positive impact in fiscal 2011 periods. In addition, last year's third quarter included the MEPP charge I just mentioned and a $10 million tax benefit. Excluding these items, adjusted operating expenses increased 2.6% and adjusted operating income increased 0.9%. Net earnings on this basis grew 2.8% to $290 million and EPS grew 2.1% to $0.49.  Turning to the impact of the business transformation project for a moment. In the third quarter of fiscal 2012, gross project expenses totaled $49 million, and we capitalized $39 million related to the project. In the prior year period, gross project expenses totaled $25 million, and we capitalized $42 million related to the project.  Now turning to cash flow. Cash flow from operations for the first 39 weeks of the fiscal year were $908 million. In the prior year period, cash flow from operations was $666 million. As a reminder, we are paying the final $212 million in IRS tax settlement payments during this fiscal year. We have paid $159 million in cash in the first 39 weeks of the year, and we'll make the final payment of $53 million in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year. In total, we will have paid the IRS $952 million over 12 quarters including this final payment.  Cash flow from operations improved by $242 million in the first 39 weeks compared to the prior year, due mainly to improved working capital management, the redemption of COLI policies, changes in accrued expenses and a lower pension expense. Working capital has improved year-to-date due mainly to smaller increases in accounts receivable and inventories this year compared to the prior year. This is due in part to improvements in DSOs, receivables and inventories and in part to changes in inflation trends. Last, as we discussed on the second quarter call, we redeemed some COLI policies, which benefited operating cash flows. This was an element of our previously discussed plan to reduce the market-driven COLI impact on our earnings.  Capital expenditures totaled $199 million for the third quarter and $633 million for the first 39 weeks of the fiscal year. This year, we are constructing new facilities in Long Island, Boston and Central Texas, as well as a major expansion in Lincoln, Nebraska, compared to having only one such major project underway a year ago. Our new facility in Central Texas opened recently, which allows us to consolidate our facilities in Austin and San Antonio. With this move, we have the dual benefits of lower facility costs and a room for growth in this important market.  Before closing, there are a few guidance metrics for fiscal 2012 that I'd like to update. First, we now expect an increase in fuel expense of $35 million to $45 million this year, which is roughly $5 million higher than our previous guidance and is primarily driven by higher projected fuel prices. As a reminder, we implemented a fuel surcharge with a broader customer base late during the third quarter of fiscal 2011, which is intended to mitigate the increase in fuel expense. Fuel surcharges are recorded in sales and therefore benefit gross profit. We've wrapped the implementation of this surcharge, as I mentioned, late in the third quarter, so the year-over-year benefit from the surcharge will not be as apparent in changes in gross profit and gross margins going forward.  Second, we now expect gross business transformation expenses for the year to be approximately $175 million to $195 million, which is roughly $55 million lower than previous estimates. We had previously expected to begin amortizing project costs late in the third quarter, but this did not occur. We now expect amortization to begin in early fiscal 2013 with our next planned conversion. In addition, we expect the capitalized spend on our business transformation project this year to be $145 million to $165 million. This is roughly $20 million higher than our previous estimate, primarily because of the timing of our next conversion in early fiscal 2013. As a result, we will continue to capitalize more of the project's spend than originally planned. This increased CapEx spend on the project has impacted our overall expectations for CapEx for this year. As a result, we now expect total CapEx to be approximately $775 million to $800 million in fiscal 2012, which is back in line with the original guidance we gave in our 10-K.  In closing, while we are encouraged by improving industry trends, we are taking action in many areas to improve profitability in both the near-term and long-term, and believe Sysco's unique capabilities and commitment to ongoing investment in our business provide a solid foundation for future growth.  With that, operator, we'll now take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Michael Kelter with Goldman Sachs.
Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I wanted to ask about the gross margin pressure. Is there a way that you might be able to tease out how much of that is from food inflation versus competitive pressures versus mix shift to lower-margin business? And kind of, I guess, as a second part of that is, if the current food cost environment holds, meaning the basket probably going to be down a bit next year based on the spot market, will GM rebound in fiscal '13?
William J. DeLaney: Mike, it's Bill. Obviously, I mean, I think you know us enough, well enough now to know that I probably can't answer with the kind of precision you'd love for me to answer it with. But let me try this. I would say to you that it's clearly coming from multiple places, all right? So you've got -- first and foremost, you've got our customers who are feeling a lot of pressure to continue to create traffic in their establishments, and that's where you see this difference in inflation, with inflation at the restaurant is, we believe, running 2% to 3% and ours has been in that 5% to 7% so far this year. So there's that kind of challenge that you work through there with your customer each and every day. There's certainly the typical type of competitive pressure that goes along with that. There's -- that's on the sell. Now there's also on the buy, where I think we have opportunities there to continue to find ways to work more effectively with our suppliers and that type of thing in terms of how we purchase the product. And then I think the third thing, and I think this is a little more clear this quarter, is there's us in terms of our mindset and our approach to pricing and trying to strike the right balance between being responsive to our customers and write an appropriate margin and that type of thing. So it comes from all 3. The reality, from where I sit, that makes this quarter a little different than the first half of the year is I just feel like we didn't do as good a job on the margin line in terms of what we can control and what we can influence in the short term. And I would just use an example and don't -- I'm not putting a pencil to this, but I think we're in an environment today with -- if you just listen to everything I just said and look at everything that you all look at, the environment today, I don't think, is an environment where anytime soon we're going to see margins turn around and necessary grow. I do think there's opportunity to mitigate that pressure. And if we had just had maybe 1/2 of the erosion that we saw on the margin line, maybe even just 2/3 of it, I think we -- the tone of my comments and the tone of the release would've been a little different, where our earnings would've -- they would've been good to maybe not great, but they would've been a very acceptable quarter from our perspective. So I think we're in a mode right now where our job is to continue to certainly be sensitive to our customers, work closer with our suppliers. But we've got to do a better job managing the margin. And I think from a messaging standpoint, when you're selling a box of food, and say our average box costs $30, $35, but some of the boxes in the area where we're seeing the most inflation, poultry, meat, those boxes can cost $45 and $55. It's very -- I don't think it's practical to expect that, that is going to be passed along in a short period of time on a proportionate basis. But I certainly think it's appropriate to expect us to do a better job managing the pricing on that. And that's obviously what we're working on.
Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And you mentioned -- you actually referenced in your opening remarks several initiatives to improve gross margin. Could you maybe, to the extent that you're able, give us an idea of what kind of things you're thinking about and if there are any 1 or 2 that we should have our eye on?
William J. DeLaney: Well, I think it's going to be hard for you to have your eye on it, but I think the things that we have our eye on is there's certain things that we do in terms of how we approach pricing and where we might make exceptions and that type of thing and how we work with customers and suppliers. We just need to be more consistent throughout the organization. And so it's not 1 or 2 things. It's several things that go into how we price both -- with both our large contract customers and also with our street customers, how we buy product and how we manage that process internally. And what I'm really alluding to there is we have opportunity to execute better and, in particular, more consistently throughout the company and just make some better decisions there. So I can't give you a lot of granularity for obvious reasons, but I can tell you there's opportunity there.
Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And then lastly, maybe if you could talk about -- a bit about the cadence of sales in the quarter. And I know it's not one -- I hate to slice things so finely. But the change in casual dining sales trajectory intra-quarter this particular quarter was pretty significant, where you had a decent January, February and then a much weaker March, April. So curious if you can give us any color as to what you saw for the quarter.
William J. DeLaney: Well, we don't typically comment on cadence of growth month-to-month. And obviously, we read a lot of what you all write and we have a sense for what you're saying, which is, I believe, the industry view is that things did slow down in terms of growth in March and April. This quarter, as we talked last quarter, it was just a back-ended-weighted quarter for us. March is always going to drive our numbers. So anytime you've got a bigger denominator, I think sometimes that will affect the growth rates as well. But certainly, the things that helped in January and February were the calendar. I believe we had -- I think the holiday helped us early off -- early on in the quarter. In the scheme of the overall numbers, that's not that big a deal. I think weather was probably the biggest thing. And we've kind of gotten to where we stopped whining about weather. But at least on this call, I'm at least acknowledging that it clearly helped the industry and it helped us from the standpoint that, I think, in some of your more metropolitan markets in the north, we saw and felt better volumes. Now I'll quickly add, and I'm not whining about it as I said, we were hurt in areas where you would expect winter to be beneficial. So the big ski areas in Colorado and Utah and Florida, we did not do as well in those areas. And so I'm not going to say it netted out, but it wasn't a totally positive thing from a weather standpoint. So not trying to dodge the question too much here, but we saw good growth in the first couple of months. It continued maybe at somewhat of lower rate. But I'd have to tell you the biggest thing I think we're beginning to see, and we don't comment on this on a month-by-month basis either, is I think the rate of inflation is subsiding and that's going to affect the top line as well. And hopefully over time, it will subside to a level where it's more in sync with what our customers can absorb.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Ajay Jain with Cantor Fitzgerald.
Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: My first question is just on the operating expense leverage, which I think was somewhat commendable. But you clearly benefited from the cycling of last year's charge for multi-employer pension expense. And then just wanted to ask if there are any other factors that you can talk about behind the cost savings and whether or not any of the SG&A improvement has spillover effect into the fourth quarter.
William J. DeLaney: Ajay, it's Bill. Again, yes, I think we did some good things on the expense line. We tried to call out the things that I would characterize as nonrecurring or unusual. So the business transformation expense because of where we are in the timeline was a little less than what we originally thought and we did have the credit last year. The point I made was that at the operating company level, our cost per case was down slightly, which is a big deal. I mean, to manage your cost per case flat to down is something we're always trying to do, and at times, we do it better than other times. So I think if you go and look at our first half of the year, certainly, we had margin pressure. The first quarter, we didn't see the type of volume growth we would've liked to see in that. We did do better in that area in the second quarter. But we had opportunities just on execution in terms of the expense side in the business. And I just felt that our folks did a better job managing expenses throughout the company in all facets, SG&A and operations. So I think we just executed better on that line, and that's a line we're going to have to continue to address, both structurally as well as just day-to-day management, to mitigate the margin pressures that we can't totally overcome.
Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: Okay. And can you confirm if there was a significant payroll or headcount-driven benefit this latest quarter?
William J. DeLaney: I'll let Chris take that one.
Robert C. Kreidler: Got it. Really nothing to be called out, Ajay.
Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: Okay. And as far as the change in the outlook for pension expense, Chris, can you confirm what's behind the updated guidance and if that's on the multi-employer side or presumably with your corporate-sponsored pension plan?
Robert C. Kreidler: Yes, Ajay. I may not be understanding your question. We actually didn't change our pension guidance. It's been the same all year. Was there a different question?
Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: No. I'm sorry, I was just -- I was going off of your presentation materials. I thought the pension expense was indicated to be $25 million lower than fiscal '11.
Robert C. Kreidler: Yes. And that's been the case. For the year, we said it'd be down about $28 million, roughly about $7 million per quarter, and that's been consistent during the year. That's one of those items you set in the beginning, and it's pretty much -- it's set for the year, so I was just calling out that on a year-over-year basis, it is lower and it's one of the reasons why the costs are lower.
Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: Okay, sorry, my bad. Finally, I understand that you were able to eke out some gross profit dollar growth this last quarter. But assuming that you are going to market now with a more aggressive pricing structure, the gross margin impact seems to be increasing each quarter. So even as inflation seem to be moderating, do you have any color about the gross margin outlook for the current quarter in June? I mean, could the impact be more than the 100 basis points from Q3?
William J. DeLaney: The only color I have, Ajay, is we need to improve, as I said a couple of times now. So I certainly hope not. And as I mentioned in my prepared comments, that's an area of keen focus here. So we need to bring that number back. As I said to Michael, at this level of inflation, I don't know that it's realistic that we can totally reverse it, but we certainly need to lessen that variance.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Ed Kelly with Credit Suisse.
Edward J. Kelly - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Could you maybe talk about what the impact was in the quarter from the net impact of, I guess, the New Year's Day shift and the leap year on the volume front?
William J. DeLaney: I think it helped. I'm trying to be as descriptive as I can here. Leap year is always a good thing. You get an extra day. So I'm sure that helped, but -- and the holiday thing. But I think when you line that up with -- over a 13-week period and if you look at in those months, I don't think it's that big a deal, to be totally honest with you.
Robert C. Kreidler: Yes, Ed, this is Chris. We did take a look at that. And frankly, we didn't think it was enough to call out specifically. I think Bill's right. It helped a little, but it's really not material.
William J. DeLaney: I think the weather was probably a bigger help than anything.
Edward J. Kelly - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And could we come back to the gross profit again? And I want to try to approach it a different way because there's a lot of questions on margin, and I'm not so sure how -- and I know margin's relevant. But maybe we could look at it a different way, right? If you think about gross profit dollar growth, which was a couple percent this quarter, your business is really all about driving more cases through the network, right? And gross profit dollar growth was less than real kind of volume growth, if you thought about it, for the first time in a while. So I wanted to get your thoughts on, going forward, is that how we should be thinking about this business? Can you grow gross profit dollars faster than volume? I'm just trying to figure out the best way to model this because up until now you've actually been doing a pretty good job there.
William J. DeLaney: Yes. I think I'm happy to come at it any way you want. We certainly look at it every way we can. I think it's a good callout in your point there and that's the unacceptable part of it. We can't grow gross profit dollars at a lower rate than what we grow cases. What I'm trying to acknowledge is what we've seen here the last few quarters and what I think we may see for a while is GP dollars may grow somewhat slower than the sales dollars grow, but that's, I think, where we're not pleased with the quarter. We should have -- we certainly sought to grow gross profit dollars at a higher rate. And I think if you looked at first half of the year, it was closer to mid-single digits, that type of thing. So that was our callout, and I think that's a very fair way of looking at it. But no, I would not -- we're certainly not planning the business around growing gross profit dollars at a lower rate than case growth. That's not acceptable.
Edward J. Kelly - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Is that something that you can fix quickly, meaning like over the next quarter or so? Or does that take longer?
William J. DeLaney: I think it's just something that you fix each and every day in our business and you bring focus to it. And I think at the operator level, our operator level, we don't necessarily talk about it quite like that. We try to get people just more focused on their categories, on their customers and so on. But I take your point. I actually agree with it that when I look at our business, I look at everything clearly. But if there's kind of 3 lines that jump out, one is volume growth, two is gross profit dollar growth and three is cost per case. So those are the 3 things that we're very focused on. And I think again, in terms of how I approached my comments, we're pleased with the volume growth, we're pleased with the cost per case performance and we're not pleased with the gross profit dollar growth.
Edward J. Kelly - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And, Bill, could you give us your assessment of sort of business transformation so far? I mean, we've got Manny coming in. It looks like there's been some delays in the rollout again. Just help us understand, I guess, what's happening and where the project is today versus kind of where you thought it would be.
William J. DeLaney: Well, we're going to we talk at length about that next week. But I'll kind of dive in here and try to give you some color. So essentially, we've had some delays and we've had another delay here after Oklahoma. We're not happy about that, but the reality is this is new ground for us. And it's better to deal with these issues now in terms of getting the system to perform at a level or at least close to the level that it's going to need to perform. So you state then [ph] to get too deep into this and then have to fix a lot of things after the fact. Now with that said, I think what you're seeing from the board is, we certainly can benefit from Manny's input and Manny's experience and the relationships he has in this area. And so he's going to work closer with our team and with me personally to make sure we're striking the right balance here in terms of driving this out at appropriate pace but also in a way that it delivers the benefits that we expect it to.
Robert C. Kreidler: Ed, let me jump in there, too. We've talked about, today, business transformation primarily around the rollout of our new ERP system. And I think one of the messages you're going to hear from us next week pretty loudly is really helping the audience understand that business transformation is very, very broad and it includes a lot of stuff that's going on inside the organization, one stream of which is the rollout of this ERP system. And again, we're going to give you as much color as we can about all of the different things that we're working on. We're going to try to help you understand better which of those streams of initiatives have benefits that can be achieved in advance of an ERP and which of those are really tied to an ERP implementation, et cetera. So I'm saying all this only because when we think of business transformation around here, it's much more than just how quickly can we rollout the ERP system. As Bill said, it's a critical part of the future success of the organization, so we're frankly solidly supportive of it, and we've got to get it done and all those things. But at the same time, we're not waiting to do everything that we need to get accomplished for that ERP system to be fully rolled out. And again, we hope to give you a lot more color on that next week.
Edward J. Kelly - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Do you think -- you had mentioned in the past that fiscal '13 would be the peak year for expense for the project. Is that still the case?
Robert C. Kreidler: I think going back 1.5 years and 2.5 years ago at Investor Day, the numbers clearly showed that the peak year would be 2013. Now when I've been asked about that since that time, what I've said is we've not put out new guidance for cost and expenses yet. We will get into some of that next week, and we'll update you on where we think the peak is, et cetera. I think, again, the way to -- you didn't ask me; you asked Bill. But if you ask me how I look at this at least from a cost perspective is we're going to have costs for the ERP rollout and additional business transformation stuff for the next several years, obviously, until we get this thing all the way completed. We're also going to have benefits from business transformation that we're going to start to realize throughout this. I don't want to go back to talking about the net -- cost net of benefits. We hope to be able to show you those kind of independently. But I don't want to just fixate on the cost side of the equation. We really want to give you more color around what we believe the benefits are going to be as well.
William J. DeLaney: Yes. I think just to kind of wrap it from my end here, Ed, and we will talk obviously more next week, business transformation is just something we need to do. And that's what I was trying to talk about. We need to go to market. We need to make some changes in terms of how we go to market, and that's a big deal in terms of how we've been running the company here for the last several years. And we need to do that because the landscape in the world that we're competing in and servicing customer in is a lot different than it was even 3 to 5 years ago. The technology platform, as you hear us talk about that, is a very critical foundational part of the entire spectrum of business transformation. But as we get deeper into this thing and as we hit some bumps here and there, we also have the opportunity to adjust our thinking on what defines business transformation, what other things can we do to create some benefits along the way. And those are some of the things we'll talk about next week.
Robert C. Kreidler: Ed, I feel like I dodged your question, so let me answer a little more directly in terms of the cost. While I can't tell you where the peak is yet, here's what I think we have said and will continue to say: 2013 will be more expensive than 2012. That should not be a surprise. As we start to depreciate this thing, we ramp up our shared service center more, 2013 will definitely be more expensive than 2012. What I don't have visibility on for you, as I sit here today, is whether '14 or '15 will be higher or lower or the same as 2013. Again, we hope to be able to talk more about that next week. We're still looking at all of that data as it flows in.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Mark Wiltamuth with Morgan Stanley.
Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Bill, maybe you could talk a little bit about the competitive environment and what do you think your competitors are feeling. Obviously, you've had a gross margin hit this quarter, and case-wise, have gotten a little better. But what do you think is going on for the competitors out there? And are you seeing any further weakening that may cause some of them to exit the business?
William J. DeLaney: Great question, hard to answer because we don't obviously get a lot of visibility to their -- we don't get any visibility to their financial results, so a lot of what we get is somewhat anecdotal. My sense is that the larger players, the better operators of scale, are doing okay. I think this kind of market over time will be good for the people that have scale and who have the capital to invest in the business. So my sense is they're doing fine. I'm sure they're having to compete very hard on the margin line as well, but obviously, I don't have visibility to that. I think maybe we're beginning to see, and I'll let Chris speak to this, there's thousands of competitors out there. As we've talked before, I think perhaps some of the smaller ones are beginning to think even harder about what their future is in terms of the industry and that type of thing. I'm not saying it's a large-scale phenomena, but I think it is probably getting harder both for our smaller competitors as well as for some of the smaller operators in the space.
Robert C. Kreidler: Yes, I'll add to that. I mean, one of the things that we sense from the market, and again, it's more anecdotal than anything, is everyone is highly focused on cost right now. So that should tell you something about where the top line is with some, all of our competitors. It is easier if you've got some size and scale to get some cost structure improvement. I think the smaller players, while they may be great companies and they're highly competitive in their own markets, it is harder for them to get their cost structure down significantly, and it's becoming harder for them to -- I believe, harder for them to compete, and frankly, we're starting dialogues with more of them these days than we have been.
Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. Just a question on the road map here on the business transformation. So I think the plan previously was you would do the second market and then do waves of openings. So now you're inserting one more third market test and then the waves of openings come. And is that moment where you hit the waves of openings, is that when you start depreciating at that point?
Robert C. Kreidler: Yes, actually -- and I don't know exactly what I said on our prior calls, so I'll just say it new and fresh, is we will start depreciating when we go to the next company. Now you're right. Originally we thought we would be going to a small wave of companies next. We're actually going to go to, we believe, one additional company, as Bill said, in the early part of the new fiscal year, probably a month or so later than we had originally intended. So that would trigger depreciation. And that's an accounting determination of when we're putting the machine into service. And so that is still the plan. And that's the only reason frankly the depreciation didn't start in the third and fourth quarter, is we weren't -- we had not rolled to that next conversion yet. Thereafter, we're not really commenting yet about what the conversion cycle or rate or run rate or road map was going to be at this point in time. We'll give you, again, more color on that next week. But it's not our goal to put out there a set number of companies for next year or a pace. It's more along the lines of here's the progress we hope to make in the next year, and it will almost certainly be a range. If we've learned anything about this, it's that the best-laid plans don't always come to fruition, and so we'll range it appropriately.
Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: And are the cost savings more linked to the number of operating companies that are using it? Or is it there are other activities that might generate cost savings as well?
Robert C. Kreidler: Yes. So let me go back to the comment I made earlier about business transformation, in general. Again, as we've gotten into this thing over 3 years now, there's quite a bit that we've been able to identify in terms of cost savings, other enhancements that are not directly tied to a new ERP system being rolled out into our company. As we've identified those and we've discovered how we can accelerate those, we're obviously going after those sooner rather than later and they're not tied to any number of companies being converted. There are obviously other benefits opportunities that are still tied to us having a new ERP system in all of our operating companies. That, of course -- or those, of course, would be weighted more towards the more companies you have, the more benefits you get. Those are things that primarily are tied to the types of business processes and functions that will be put into our shared service operation. So the more companies you roll out, the more of those functions we can consolidate into our shared service operation and begin to realize some of the benefits.
Operator: We'll take our next question from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: So, Bill, a couple of things. Where do you think you are with your analytics around pricing? And then getting back to the gross margin question, with respect to demand elasticity, right, and an ability to forecast or tell what the elasticity is per item in certain geographies, so where does that capability stand? And if it's not where it needs to be, what would you do to make that more robust?
William J. DeLaney: Great question, John. I would say to you that -- in terms of the way I'm interpreting your question, I'd say we have a lot of work to do in that area of pricing in terms of more sophisticated or scientific pricing. But we have done some work there and we'll continue to look at it. The balancing act here is again -- don't hold me to these percentages. But let's just say that roughly 1/2 of our customers have some form of contract and the other 1/2 don't. They work with a marketing associate and that type of thing. So what we're always trying to do is balance the value of having, say, a more scientific approach to pricing with the value of having that marketing associate in front of the customer, taking that order and really understanding what's important to that customer today in terms of their order, and frankly, down the road, over the next 1 to 3 months in terms of running their business. So our marketing associates typically and even our presidents probably typically don't think in terms of elasticity, but that's what they do. I mean, they're making a judgment call every time they take an order: what's the right balance in terms of maximizing that order, supporting the customer in terms of what they need and striking the right overall price, not necessarily per line item but for that order in general? And so that today and as you well know historically has been handled in a very decentralized way through our sales folks and through the operating companies on that large segment of our customer base. I believe there is opportunity to do more sophisticated work in that area, but it's work that's in its formative stage with us at best right now. And I think that will be one of our key -- that is one of our key initiatives that we've called out and that we'll talk a little bit about next week. But frankly, it will take some time to develop. So I guess my answer is there's opportunity there, but I don't necessarily see a scenario where you go all the way to one extreme and you want to be totally pulling levers from a centralized location on a group of customers that still are going to be somewhat -- their decisions are going to be driven, what's happening in that local marketplace, what's happening in their establishment. So I still think that local salesperson and local operating company visibility is going to be very important.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: So to follow on then, the -- and I agree, you can't measure from Houston. But having said that, do the systems exist today to give the marketing associate more information on that? Do they have it -- can they access it? And then, is it more an issue of training so that they are more familiar with how the elasticities work?
William J. DeLaney: Again, I'm going to stay away from the word elasticity. They have more visibility. They have a lot more visibility today, John, than they did, say, 5 or 7 years ago to certain things in terms of cost movements and that kind of thing. They have more visibility today than they did to some other things 1 year or 2 ago. I'd say 2 things. One is our ability, to your point, to train effectively that will lend itself to execution. And then secondly, what else can we provide them in terms of not just maybe what's happening with our customers within what we see, but what else is happening in the marketplace? And that's a whole different level of analytics that is very difficult to get to, but may provide us an opportunity down the road. So they certainly have more information than they've had in the past. But your point is a valid one. There's training opportunities here and there's execution opportunities, and then there's a whole other body of work which is, what else can we provide both at the central location as well at the local location to make smarter decisions that are in the best interests of both our customers and ourselves? So we're making progress, John. I'm not trying to dodge here. We're making progress. But this would be -- this is a big opportunity for us over the next 3 to 5 years.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: And then when you think about tying that back into the macro then, if we're going to see disinflation here, which we probably should, that 5.5% should be a year from now from or quicker, what do you think the elasticity is that, that in itself creates demand, right? So we'll -- we lose a couple hundred basis points in inflation. We gain some percentage of that in unit demand. And I assume, would you agree that it's not one-for-one, right?
William J. DeLaney: Yes, it's not one-for-one. I'm not even sure that's a key variable anymore. I think if you and I were having this conversation 5 or 10 years ago, we'd be talking about that. I think what's more important is the mindset of the consumer and how our customers see that and their ability to absorb price increases and to get traffic to make themselves more profitable. So I think it's actually the psyche of the consumer is more important than that right now. But where the lowering of inflation, if it happens gradually, would be beneficial is it just creates less of a gap between what so far we've had to absorb and what we're able to pass along. Now look, I would also echo what I said earlier: gross profit is a function of a lot of things. You've got to move boxes. It's a function of how we price. It's a function of how we move prices within our system, transferred pricing, if you will. And it's how we buy. So there's other things we need to do on the buy as well. And that really comes down to reassessing how effective some of our strategic relationships are with our suppliers. And we're beginning to do that.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: All right. And then lastly, right now, the plan for the third operating company is to be in test for roughly how long? And then when you start the rollout, what's the capacity within the organization to do this, meaning I don't know how you -- whether you're going to measure it by quarter or what. But what do you think capacity is to get companies rolled out?
Robert C. Kreidler: Well, we're going to roll out, as we said, the third conversion in the early part of fiscal 2013. We don't really have any intention of having a set period of time to watch the system before we make additional determinations. We'll actually put in place a schedule that says, "Unless we find something that is material, we'll keep going and we'll do more." We're not really, again, commenting about how many more of these things we'll do. We'll talk a little more about that next week. But I'll plant kind of a concept is that in the past, when we've talked about the rollout for the ERP system, we've -- frankly, we've put out there what we hoped to be able to accomplish, which ended up being a fairly aggressive rollout schedule. And we've put the numbers out there appropriate for that rollout schedule, and we're learning a lot in the process that tells us that it is aggressive or it was aggressive and we might want to be a little smarter about how we roll this thing out. The way we'd hope to be able to talk about it next week is, look, this is a process that is going to be continuing for a while. There's a pace that we need to do that's a relatively conservative and smart and prudent pace. But if we get legs underneath us, if we start seeing great responses from the first few rollouts, we'll be ready, willing and able to go faster. But that's not going to be the way we plan it. We're just going to be ready to do it if we start getting some great news out of the system. So again, I think we'll talk a little bit more about that next week. But right now, we're not talking about any number of companies per quarter or per year.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Karen Short with BMO Capital.
Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Just a couple of questions on gross margin. And I want to kind of focus on Broadline versus SYGMA, and maybe I'll separate this out into sales and -- or case volume in Broadline and SYGMA and gross margin. Can you maybe just talk a little bit about each segment directionally, which is seeing slightly better than you might have expected case volume growth and which is seeing less gross margin erosion? Maybe just kind of talk directionally about each of those.
William J. DeLaney: Well, let me take the first part. I don't know that we can say a whole lot about the second part, Karen. But in terms of growth, I would say, and I alluded to this in my comments as well, we saw good growth in all the segments, I would say, with the exception of our FreshPoint. The produce markets last year were a lot more volatile, and so that created some challenges this year in terms of both top line growth as well as margin management in that area. So I'd say the Broadline, with the exceptions of some of the -- maybe the weather-sensitive areas where we had some -- perhaps some better performance in places that characteristically we wouldn't see in the winter, up north, and some weaker performance in some of the more vacation spots, I'd say generally, the case growth was good throughout. It was good in Canada. SYGMA had good case growth. The earnings pressure -- they did have earnings pressure more -- they've had more pressure on earnings this year than the last 2 years, where they've had really strong years. Meat companies we've integrated into the Broadline now, so I don't want to call out too much here. But I would say it's generally pretty good with the exception of the produce side of business.
Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: But would it be fair to say that SYGMA has gotten more competitive directionally than Broadline?
William J. DeLaney: No, I wouldn't say that. I mean, I think we've tried to be competitive on both. I think probably one thing I should say because sometimes I think it gets misunderstood, we've seen good growth and pretty comparable rates of growth both on the contract side of the business, including SYGMA, as well as the street side of the business. So I think -- sometimes I think people think all of our growth is coming from the contract side. But the reality is it's pretty balanced. It might have been slightly steeper on the contract side but not that much. Now we've invested in margin to get some of that, to be fair, but we're seeing good growth on both sides of that equation.
Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay, that's helpful. And then just looking at gross margin, if you said this, I didn't catch it. Is there -- can you kind of give a directional split between the competitive environment and inflation on the gross margin pressure you saw this quarter, like 50-50?
William J. DeLaney: No, I tried there and I obviously didn't do very good. I'm almost looking at it in a different way. So I think in one bucket, you can put the customer and what they can absorb, you can put the competitor, you can put the supplier relationships and you can put, for lack of a better term, what's in between our ears in terms of what we think we can do. All right. So that's what the bucket is. It's impossible for me to tell you how much is one or the other. That's why you hear us talk about competitive pricing environment as opposed to competitive competitor environment. The other bucket, I think, is just the math of inflation, which is what I was trying to bring out, which is at this rate of inflation, I don't know -- percentages are not quite as relevant as they are when you have 2 to 3 points of inflation, whether you're looking at margin or whether you're looking at costs. Dollar growth -- at the gross profit line, dollar growth of that operating income line becomes very important. So the way I'm just trying to compartmentalize in my head is, what level of margin erosion could've still provided a quarter that would've met our expectations? And again, I'll let you do the math on that because I don't know what your expectations specifically were. But I would say if we had 1/2 of the erosion on a percentage basis, we would've probably been pretty pleased with the quarter.
Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay. That's helpful. And then I just was curious on the CapEx. Your CapEx for the year comes up about $50 million to $75 million. I think you called out $20 million was business transformation. What was the remaining bucket?
Robert C. Kreidler: Actually, the increase on the annual CapEx is really almost entirely made up of the increase on the ERP system. It's the comparison between the quarterly and the annual. But going back to the range of $775 million to $800 million from where we were last quarter is almost entirely made up of the ERP increase, the amount of additional capitalization there, which is $20 million year-over-year, I believe, but it's about $40 million quarter-to-quarter.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Meredith Adler with Barclays.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division: We talked a lot about inflation and passing it along. But maybe you could talk about -- I think you said you got some business by being aggressive. Could you talk a little bit about sort of what you're doing to go after business? And are there particular customers or segments of the business that you're being particularly aggressive about?
William J. DeLaney: I'll start with that one, Meredith. I think what we've -- what I've tried to say is that we've been aggressive in growing our business in terms -- and I think in a market like this, we certainly should be. I don't know that any of the issues that we're talking about today, whether margin pressure or managing costs or business transformation, I don't think any of those would be a whole lot better if we didn't grow the cases. And I would argue that they'd be even more acute challenges. So the first place we start, and we've had to do a little more of this over the last year or so than in the past, is we're kind of defending our own turf a little bit more than we've had in the past. We have a lot of different people that come after our customers obviously. And we have a lot of customers. We have a lot of good business out there. So we certainly have, I think, dug in over the last several months and tried to work with our customers in every way we can in terms of drop size; in terms of delivery days; in terms of products; and ultimately, where necessary, in terms of price points to give ourselves every opportunity to retain business. And then our most profitable business, beyond what we retain, is the business that we grow within the account. And so as we see opportunities where we might have 23% share of wallet and we see opportunities to grow that business, we certainly -- and this is not something new. I think maybe the degree of it's a little greater than in the past. We go after that business hard and we find creative ways that make sense for the customer and us. And sometimes, that may result in price accommodation with the expectation that we'll get more business and larger drops and that, that should fall to the bottom line on the expense line. That's why traditionally I've always focused more on the sales line and the operating income line, and then tried to explain those deltas between the 2 lines above, gross profit and expenses. And of course, the third area is an area where we're always, I think, very proficient, which is going after new accounts. And our best reference for new business is current customers, and I think it's just -- that's just the environment in terms of what it takes to go after -- if we're going to after business we don't have, that's typically somebody else's gold account. So we're coming at it from all directions, but I would tell you they're all important. But I think if there's a little bit more emphasis than the other in the last 12, 15 months, it's been more on making sure that we don't lose business with the quality customers that we do have and we find acceptable ways to retain that when other people come after us.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then a question about the business transformation process. You folks did actually invest in a shared services facility in Houston, but obviously, I don't think it is being fully anywhere near fully utilized at this point. I was wondering whether there are dis-synergies caused by the delay in rolling out the ERP system.
Robert C. Kreidler: Yes. I think absolutely correct, Meredith. I think we've talked about that on a previous call, that one of the reasons why these numbers, these expenses are high right now is that we've got significant costs out at our shared service center because you have to ramp up in anticipation of additional converted companies. And so you don't get to kind of scale, if you will, until you're pretty far down the road. Now we've tried to be sensible -- once we got more of an idea about the pace of conversions, et cetera, we tried to be sensible about not getting the ramp-up -- or getting too far ahead of the ramp-up curve. But even still, in the early days of these things, they cost more money than the benefits that they derive for you, and that's going to continue to be the case for a while.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And actually, I want to go back to Bill and sort of follow up with my first question to you. I guess, you made a comment, I think, last quarter about the most important thing was to drive case volumes. And if you were successful, the profits would come. And I don't know. I've been around a really long time, and my experience is that you may drive volume, but sometimes the profitability of an industry just goes down permanently after that kind of aggressive behavior. And of course, it sounds like everybody's being aggressive. Could you comment on whether this is a phase for the industry? Or have we set a new lower bar in terms of profitability?
William J. DeLaney: I think, as far as I'm going to go today, Meredith, is I think what we've acknowledged for quite some time now is that we expect the rate of growth in this industry to be modest at best, perhaps even flat. And that we believe that our abilities and capabilities and scale should translate into us being able to grow faster than the market. Clearly, as I've mentioned here even a couple of times today, we're in a different environment than where we were 3 or 5 years ago. So I think a lot of industries are going to be challenged with profitability. So let me try to connect the points. So I think you've quoted me pretty accurately. I do believe that we should be out growing cases and growing volume, not at the expense of profitability at all levels. But I guess, I'm confident in our people and in our systems that we will turn those sales and those incremental business into profits. Now in the short term, obviously, we're seeing some pressure there and there's some execution issues and that type of thing. The connection, I guess, would be that doesn't mean that we don't have to do some things differently. And we'll talk some more about that next week as well. But it connects to some of the things that Chris alluded to in terms of, what is business transformation? So certainly -- I don't think I can just say it's a phase. I think we have moved into a part of the time in terms of the business world, our industry is no exception, where the consumer expectations and our customers' expectations are more acute and more specific than they've ever been. And so price, product quality are always going to be important. So I think it's all of the above. We need to continue to grow our volume. We need to grow it the right way. We need to continue to take our cost structure down, both in terms of our day-to-day execution, as I mentioned earlier, but also looking at our structure overall in terms of operating costs, our product costs, how we work with suppliers and all that as well, so -- and we clearly need to manage our margins along the way, so it's not one or the other. But no, I don't think it's a phase. I mean, I think we're in a new normal, so to speak, and we need to do all of the above. My only point is to just cut and -- or to try to squeeze too much out on the margin line at this point in time, I'm not confident that, that takes us where we need to go as a company.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our Q&A session and our presentation for today. We appreciate your participation and you may now disconnect.

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill DeLaney.
William J. DeLaney: Thank you, Neil, and good morning, everyone. This morning, Sysco reported sales of $10.2 billion for the second quarter, a 9.2% increase. Net earnings for the quarter were $250 million, and EPS was $0.43. Excluding the year-over-year impact of gross business transformation expenses and COLI investment income, EPS was $0.46. On this basis, which we believe is more representative of the performance of our underlying business, EPS grew 2.2% for the quarter.  Overall market conditions remained soft for much of the second quarter but appeared to strengthen during the holiday season. Our case growth trends improved as the quarter progressed, as we aggressively supported our customers, protected our business, grew our share of wallet with existing customers and brought on new accounts. As a result, case volume growth during the second quarter was 2.8% excluding the impact of acquisitions and 3.6% including acquisitions.  Based on recent industry data, we believe we grew our market share by about half -- excuse me, by about 0.5 point during calendar year 2011 to approximately 17.5%. Food cost inflation remained at historically high levels and approximated 6.3% for the quarter. While slightly lower than the level we experienced in the first quarter, this type of inflationary environment is difficult for our customers and provides us with significant pricing challenges.  Although we are encouraged by our recent volume growth trends, earnings growth from our underlying business for the quarter fell short of our expectations as expenses grew at a faster rate than did gross profit dollars. Our leadership team is addressing the internal factors that limited our earnings growth, and we expect to see gradual improvement over the next few quarters.  In addition, we are currently developing several key strategic initiatives that will better position Sysco to profitably grow our market share in the years to come. One such initiative that is now in the early stage of implementation is our multiyear Business Transformation Project. Last April, we went live at our pilot facility in Arkansas. Following a successful weekend cutover, we subsequently experienced several system performance challenges, including the following: timely order entry processing; effective balancing of service and inventory levels, as well as efficient and user-friendly reports.  This past November, we implemented several enhancements, and Arkansas has subsequently seen improvement in all of these areas. We are now more comfortable with the system's performance and recently went live at our second pilot facility in Oklahoma. The key goal of this pilot is to ensure that the new system can support multiple operating companies.  While we are still assessing early results, preliminary indicators from Oklahoma are encouraging. Assuming system performance remains satisfactory, we will continue our preparation to launch the first wave of multiple operating companies before the end of the fiscal year. Upon concluding that the system is capable of supporting a broader rollout, we will update our timeline and long-range projections for the cost and benefits of the project. We hope to provide that update at our Investor Day in May.  Reflecting for a moment on the first half of fiscal 2012, we are most appreciative of the efforts of our 47,000 associates who support the ongoing success of our broad and diverse customer base. To a large extent, our performance in the second half of the year will be heavily influenced by how much the recent uptick in consumer confidence translates into increased consumer spending on meals away from home, as well as our ability to better leverage our case growth.  Looking beyond the current fiscal year, we remain bullish about our opportunities as the pre-eminent leader in the $225 billion U.S. and Canadian foodservice market. Specifically, we remain committed to strengthening our customer relationships, reducing our cost structure and pursuing attractive opportunities to expand beyond our core business.  Now I'll turn things over to Chris so he can provide additional details on our financial results for the second quarter.
Robert C. Kreidler: Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. For the second quarter, sales were $10.2 billion or an increase of 9.2% compared to the prior year, driven mainly by food cost inflation, which we estimated to be 6.3% for the period. In addition, acquisitions within the last 12 months increased sales by 0.7%, and changes in foreign exchange rates decreased sales by 0.1%.  Case volume for the quarter increased 3.6% year-over-year including acquisitions or 2.8% excluding acquisitions. We saw solid increases in volumes across all areas of our business.  Gross profit increased 4.8% during the quarter. Even though gross margin decreased 75 basis points year-over-year to 18%, gross profit dollars per stop and per case increased once again. Operating expenses increased $94 million or 7.1% in the second quarter of fiscal 2012 compared to the prior year period. The increase in operating expenses was primarily the result of a $58 million increase in salaries and related costs. The most significant factor impacting this variance was an $18 million increase in management incentive accruals. And last year's second quarter, we had reduced these performance-based accruals, which now creates a meaningful year-over-year difference when compared to this year's accrual. In addition, we saw increases in salaries and related expense due to delivery and sales compensation, acquisitions and volume growth that has increased pay for activity-based positions.  Also impacting operating expenses were a $12 million increase in gross business transformation expenses, a $10 million increase in fuel expense. It's important to note that fuel surcharges offset this increase, although they are reflected in gross profits, and a $9 million lower benefit from COLI. These operating expense items were partially offset by a $7 million decrease in expense related to the company's corporate-sponsored pension plan.  Reported operating income decreased $10 million or 2.3%, and net earnings for the second quarter were $250 million, a decrease of $8 million or 3.1% compared to the prior year. As we discussed during our first quarter call, we believe it is important to focus on the performance of our underlying business, excluding the impact of the Business Transformation Project and the impact of COLI, which had a minimal positive impact this year but had a significantly more positive impact in fiscal 2011 periods.  Excluding gross business transformation expenses and the impact of COLI, adjusted operating expenses increased 5.5%, and adjusted operating income increased 2.5%. Net earnings on this basis grew 3.3% to $272 million, and EPS grew 2.2% to $0.46 per share.  Turning to the impact of the Business Transformation Project for a moment. In the second quarter of fiscal 2012, gross project expenses totaled $36 million, and we capitalized $33 million related to the project. In the prior year period, gross project expenses totaled $24 million, and we capitalized $51 million related to the project.  As Bill discussed earlier, we have made a lot of progress over the last few months. We installed enhancements to the system in Arkansas, our first pilot location. We went live in Oklahoma, our second pilot location, and we have begun preparations to move forward with our first wave of multiple operating companies, which should occur prior to the end of our fiscal year.  While we are continuing to assess the results of the Oklahoma implementation, which will ultimately determine the timing of our deployment plan, I wanted to remind you that once we are confident that the system in Oklahoma is operating as intended and it is ready to deploy more broadly, we will begin to depreciate the project costs that have been capitalized to date. We currently anticipate that we'll reach this point late in our third fiscal quarter. Once we do, project expenses will ramp up quite significantly, and capitalized costs will similarly decline significantly. I will provide our latest estimate for 2012 expense and capital in just a few minutes.  Turning to cash flow. Cash flow from operations for the first half of the fiscal year was $539 million. In the prior year period, cash flow from operations was $283 million. As a reminder, we are paying the final $212 million in IRS tax settlement payments during this fiscal year. Due to the timing of these payments during our fiscal year, there was no cash impact on our first fiscal quarter, a $106 million cash outflow occurred in the second fiscal quarter, and a $53 million cash outflow will occur in each of the third and fourth fiscal quarters.  Cash flow from operations improved by $227 million in the second quarter compared to the prior year, due mainly to improved working capital and the redemption of COLI policies. Working capital improved during the quarter due mainly to improved days outstanding for accounts payable. The redemption of the COLI policies was an element of our previously discussed plan to reduce the market-driven COLI impact on our earnings. The redeemed COLI policies were replaced by less volatile corporate-owned real estate assets.  Capital expenditures totaled $207 million for the second quarter and $434 million for the first half. This year, we are constructing new facilities in Long Island, Boston and Central Texas, as well as a major expansion in Lincoln, Nebraska, compared to having only 1 such major project underway a year ago.  During the quarter, we renewed our unfavorable terms, our $1 billion credit facility, which supports our highly rated commercial paper facility.  Before closing, there are a few guidance metrics for fiscal 2012 that I'd like to update. First, we now expect an increase in fuel expense of $30 million to $40 million this year, which is roughly $5 million higher than our previous guidance and is primarily driven by higher projected fuel prices. As a reminder, we implemented a fuel surcharge with a broader customer base late during the third quarter of fiscal 2011, which is intended to mitigate the increase in fuel expense.  Second, we now expect the capitalized spend on our Business Transformation Project this year to be $125 million to $145 million. This is roughly $25 million higher than our previous estimate, primarily because we have been able to capitalize more costs than anticipated and we're purchasing more hardware than originally forecast. In addition, we expect gross business transformation expenses for the year to be approximately $230 million to $250 million, which is roughly $20 million lower than previous estimates because of a slower ramp-up of our shared services center, requiring fewer resources than originally projected in this fiscal year. Increased capitalization of costs also contributed to this decline in the estimate.  In closing, while trends in our business continue to be uneven and difficult to predict, we are encouraged by the level of case growth this quarter and our continued ability to increase our market share. We are taking actions in many areas to improve profitability in both the near term and the long term and believe Sysco's unique capabilities and commitment to ongoing investment in our business provide a solid foundation for future growth.  With that, operator, we will now take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll have our first question from John Heinbockel, Guggenheim Securities.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: A couple of things. So first thing, so business picked up towards the end of the quarter. Has that continued thus far in January? Obviously, weather has been good in a lot of parts of the country, and sentiment has been good. So has that persisted here or have we slid back?
William J. DeLaney: I'd say it's persisted. It's early, John. You know us real well so you know this quarter is a hard quarter to trend line anything this early. March drives the disproportionate amount of the volume and the earnings for the quarter. But there's some phenomenons going on. You haven't heard us talk much about whether last year or this year in terms of it hurting us or helping us. I would say a couple of things this year, we had some bad weather where you normally don't have bad weather last year in the south, so that's going to help us here or did help us in January. We did have the holiday kick in into the first quarter, so those kind of offset. So I'd say net-net, the weather has been good relative to last year. The only caveat to that would be, we haven't seen a lot of snow in some of the ski resort areas. So some of those opcos that depend on that business side, they're not seeing that. But net-net, I would say the trends have continued on the top line.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: And then the -- so you talk about things you can do to improve profitability near and long term. So talk about 2 things, one, away from SAP, where do you think there might be some cost containment opportunity? And then secondly, is there anything pre-SAP that can be done on pricing in terms of, well, you may not be optimizing your pricing geographically by customer category, whatever?
William J. DeLaney: Okay. Well, those may connect here. If I don't handle the second one, come back to me on that. So what I'm really alluding to there, John, as you look at this thing, clearly, this isn’t a typical Sysco quarter in terms of what we were able to leverage or not leverage. And so in the short term, there are just some basic things that we need to readdress and to bring a little bit more intensity to. So basically, we need to flip the gross profit dollar growth and the expense growth. So if we can get to where the gross profit dollars are growing 5% to 6% to 7% and the expenses are growing 4% to 5%, then we'll be fine. Now how do you do that? Clearly, we need to continue to work really close with our customers and understand that the value package has worked in both ways in terms of the service and the pricing. And then internally, we saw pressure on productivity, in operations, in particular, in the transportation side, even x fuel and, to some extent, in selling. So selling, potentially some of that has continued to invest in the sales force. But there's opportunities for us just to manage the business a little bit better here, I think, on the cost side and get our productivity improvement to go along with the cost improvement. So I don't want to sound too cliché-ish here, but there are some blocking and tackling fundamentals here that we need to improve somewhat here over the second half of the year. As far as the pricing, we are, in different ways, and have been for the last year or 2, working with some different forms of what, I guess, would be characterized as scientific pricing. We have -- as we have moved into this stage of the business transformation work, we have looked at opportunities to decouple some of the things that were essentially integrated into the software, whether it be CRM -- we've talked a little bit about inside sales. Pricing would be another one. I'm not going to tell you today that there's anything imminent there, but that's certainly -- I would put that more into the long-term strategic initiative bucket that I talked about, along with strengthening some of our supplier relationships, a more fundamental look at our cost structure overall, as well as obviously what I did speak to, which was business transformation. I also think you'll see us continue to improve our understanding of our customers and customer engagement. We hired a gentleman here this quarter, Bill Goetz, who's going to start up our marketing department with a lot of focus initially on the customer side of things. So there's several things we're working on there for the medium term, and we'll be able to explore those a little bit more with you here later in the year.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: And as a follow-up to that, to what degree are you still doing reviews with your customers? And is that -- are you still getting a top line benefit like -- it probably is not what you were getting, but some kind of benefit from that process?
William J. DeLaney: We definitely are. I’d say that's an area where we're very pleased. We continue to do them. I think we're doing them better in terms of the planning, the targeting of the actual review itself. A lot of these people have been through this now several times so you need to raise the quality of the review each time, as well as the follow-up. So we definitely get better retention, which is the main goal here, and ultimately penetration with the folks that we do review. And those tend to be our larger accounts and/or accounts with high potential. So that's definitely a positive for us right now.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: All right. Then one final thing. First wave, remind us, that's going to be how many operating companies per week or per month?
William J. DeLaney: Per week?
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: Again, well, I guess it's per month, right?
William J. DeLaney: It's per cycle. I'll let Chris kind of jump in there, John.
Robert C. Kreidler: We haven't actually talked about how many, and to be honest, John, that's something that we're still working through. But ultimately, we'd like to be able to get to more than a handful per wave. I would guess -- I would say that the first one is probably a bit smaller than that, but it's going to be enough to prove the next set of things we need to prove, which is, we can roll out multiple companies at the same time.
Operator: We'll go next to Greg Badishkanian, Citigroup.
Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Two quick questions. First is just when you talked about taking some share and being aggressive, how much of that is due to price versus maybe having your reps out there just maybe calling on customers more? And is there -- have there been any reactions in the marketplace from your competitors?
William J. DeLaney: Okay, Greg, I'll start with that. So I think it's more of just an attitude or mentality. We -- if you go back and look at the numbers, as I'm sure you have, we have seen kind of a plateau-ing out in terms of real growth over the last 2 to 3 quarters at pretty low level. And we just -- we've mentioned here for the better part of a year or 2 that the pricing environment is pretty acute. And our whole business model is predicated on case growth and in terms of driving productivity, driving -- strengthening relationships with customers and that type of thing. So I think it's more of an internal mentality across our geography that we were just going to get more aggressive. And when people are coming after our business in aggressive ways, we, I think, have fought back a little bit harder than maybe in the past and maybe in ways that we don't really like in the short term. But the bottom line right now for us is I would have liked to have seen a better bottom line this quarter, but it's better for us to get the cases and, over time, work on improving our productivity than to continue to accept the kind of real growth that we were looking at in a market that's -- it looks like it's growing a little bit right now, but it's still going to be, we think, somewhat uneven. So we're just trying to be more aggressive out there in a smart way. There are certainly things that we need to improve upon, but we just felt that we needed to kind of take it to the market a little bit here.
Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Right. Is that more in the street or more on kind of multichain or multiunit chains?
William J. DeLaney: It plays out different. I mean, in the street, you have 8,000 sales people. And on the big CMU accounts, you tend to be working one-off with the larger customers. But I would say it's both. I mean, what I'm really trying to say here is, we're trying to be highly responsive to our customers. This inflation environment doesn't appear to be going away anytime soon. That's very difficult for the customers. From the data that we see, it would appear that the inflation at the operator level that they're absorbing or passing along to their customers is 2% to 3%. You see our numbers around 6%. So that's something that we have to work through with the customer level. But to answer your question, it's on both fronts.
Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And what do see your customers as doing to absorb some of the higher costs that they have besides trying to push back on you? Are they menu or are they -- what are they doing to be more creative?
William J. DeLaney: Well, I think all the things that they've been doing, I mean, certainly, the menu analysis and trying to work with us and work within their own shops in terms of how to make the menu more attractive, more profitable. They're trying to find ways to -- there's a lot of different vehicles out there to increase traffic in their restaurant, manage their labor staff more effectively, all the things that you would expect a good business person to do in that type of operation.
Operator: We'll go next to Meredith Adler, Barclays Capital.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I guess I'd like to just continue a little bit on this theme. I have heard that maybe some of the very largest of your competitors were not feeling quite as much pressure as you are. Do you have any sense if that's true? And do you have any sense about your positioning that might make things a bit more competitive for you right now?
William J. DeLaney: Meredith, what was the second part of the question?
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division: If it's true, what is it about your business, the way you're positioned that may make you have to be more competitive right now?
William J. DeLaney: Well, I don't know that it is true. It's hard for me to comment on what we may have heard from other sources, given that they're all private sources. So I can't really comment on how they're doing. I can tell you that this market, if it's growing at all, it's growing very little, and we just put up 2.8% to 3.6% growth, depending on how you look at acquisitions. So like I said, I mean, this quarter, we're not pleased with the bottom line, but we feel we're doing what's right for Sysco and our customers and our shareholders. And we're in this thing for the long term, so we've got a lot of different competitors out there with different time horizons, and I really don't know what they're feeling or seeing.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And on some of the smaller competitors, we thought they would get hurt during '09 because business was really weak, but we had deflation so it probably benefited on the working capital side. Do you think that they're under more pressure now because working capital is going up significantly? And are they having trouble getting financing?
Robert C. Kreidler: Meredith, this is Chris. I'll try to take that one. Again, it’s hard to make generalizations across the pool of some multiple thousands of smaller competitors. But as sales go back up, re-inflates as we like to say, if they want to participate in that growth, if they want to sell more boxes, they're going to have to find the financing for the working capital somewhere. I don't know if they have access to that capital or not, to be honest with you. They may not be participating in the growth. I mean, one thing you kind of have to look at, if Technomic is saying that the market grew last year, I think, basically 0.1% or flat, and we know we grew our cases and you're at least implying that others may have grown their cases, some of the big guys that kind of lead you to believe that somebody out there is shrinking, we just don't have visibility as to who it might be.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And I guess I'm just trying to understand better. It is an extremely competitive environment. And do you have a sense where that competition particularly might be coming from? Or is it just very competitive in every market from lots of different competitors?
Robert C. Kreidler: Yes, I think it's a continuation of the theme that Bill and I have talked about here for several quarters. You've got a very, very high inflation coupled with stagnant growth. And when you get those 2 things together, it is just highly competitive. Everybody is used to growing, wants to continue to grow, and they've got to fight out there on the street to find that growth when it's not coming organically.
William J. DeLaney: And to compound that, Meredith, I know you know this, your customers are dealing with the same issues as are your suppliers. So that's what we mean when we talk about the pricing being acute and all that type of thing. It's acute at every level of the chain here.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And how long do you think it really takes to kind of get expenses and productivity in line with the gross profit dollar growth?
William J. DeLaney: Like I alluded to, I think you'll see us improve there. I think it will be gradual. This quarter, a little cautious in this quarter. Just from a standpoint, we had a pretty good bounce back quarter last year in the third quarter, and it's just hard to predict, like I was saying earlier, because March drives us so much. But I think as the rest of the year plays out, you'll see improvement there.
Operator: We'll go next to Karen Short, BMO Capital.
Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: I guess it sounds like maybe you were a little surprised by what it cost you to drive the improved volume or case volume growth. So I guess I'm wondering, would you say you reacted more to an acute pricing environment in the quarter? Or did you lead the more competitive environment?
William J. DeLaney: We probably have reacted in some particular instances, Karen. And as I've mentioned earlier, I think internally, we just got a little bit more connected and coordinated on the fact that -- I don't know if you'd call it leading, but we're just -- we're not going to sit back in a flat environment and just hope that we get some case growth. You’re going to have margin pressure whether we grow 0% or whether we grow 2% or 3%. And the part that we know for sure in our model is that when we grow cases and there's a good balance of that growth between street and contract, over time, we'll be able to make money. And that may be not as much on the delta as what we've seen in the past, but it's certainly better for us than accepting flattish type growth. So I wouldn't say we were surprised. Frustrated might be a little better word in terms of that we weren't able to take more of it to the bottom line. But we're being very, I think, appropriately aggressive out there. And obviously, over time, the investment that we're making needs to turn off -- turn into some positive margin -- operating margin enhancement. And I think it will. I just think it's going to take a little longer than maybe what we've seen in the past.
Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay, that's helpful. And then any color on how much the timing of the holidays this year maybe helped your top line? I realized you'd probably give it back in the next quarter but...
William J. DeLaney: I don't think I can quantify that, but certainly, the calendar played to our favor this time, and I think it was more that than anything. I mean, basically, what we saw in terms of the retail, we think we saw in our business. December was a better month for us, meaningfully better than what we saw certainly in October and the first part of November. So I don't know about the numbers, but I can tell you, it was much stronger the last 5 or 6 weeks.
Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay. And then just kind of looking forward, I don't know if you have any update on what you think the inflationary environment is going to be looking like. Obviously, there was a slight improvement this quarter.
William J. DeLaney: Yes. It's really hard to predict and a lot of different views on that. I don't see any views out there that say it's going to subside significantly the next 3 to 6 months. Hopefully, it will come back a little bit, but you've seen it go from, what, 4% to 5% to 7% back to 6%. So a lot of commodity pressure, a lot of pressure in the meat area. I'll let Chris speak to some of the other categories in terms of what it means to our business. But we're not really looking for a whole lot of relief here over the next couple of quarters.
Robert C. Kreidler: No, that's right. I mean, I keep saying we may have a crystal ball, but we don't know how to read it. It's -- it eased off. I'd like to say it was easing off throughout the quarter. That would not be factually correct though. It didn't ease off throughout the quarter. So it's hard to say where it's going to go. And then I think one of the things we've talked about in the past, not so much recently, is it used to be just a few categories. Now it's pretty broad-based. It continues to be fairly broad-based. Bill mentioned meat. That's been a category that's been under inflationary pressure for a while. And if you just look at supply and demand, it looks like it's going to continue to be under pressure for a while. Other categories may have the opportunity to ease off faster. Should we get some help in the commodities market, we'll just have to look at that. My best guess is we'll get back to a place where we have some categories that are highly inflationary and others that are more normal. And so the overall rate may be high, but it will only be across certain categories. That would certainly be better than the situation we're in today. But, again, that's crystal ball type stuff, and I can't tell you how long it takes to get there or even if we're going to get there.
Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay, great. And then just last question. Any initial comments on how the second opco is doing on the new system?
William J. DeLaney: Yes. I thought we made some comments on that. I'll try again here, Karen. Look, we just went live there last weekend. So we're into early part of week 2, and it went well. I mean, it went well from an operational standpoint, and some of those things I alluded to in my comments in terms of where we had some struggles. Certainly, on the order entry and on the reports, we're off to a much better start there. And like I said, we saw those improvements already in Arkansas back in November. Now as you can appreciate in the cycle of our business, it takes 2, 3, 4 weeks to go through an inventory turn and all that type of thing to get a full handle on how some of the demand planning and the ordering and reordering systems and all of that will work. And so we'll be watching that real close here over the next 2 to 4 weeks.
Operator: We'll go next to Ajay Jain, Cantor Fitzgerald.
Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: I'm trying to reconcile the sequential improvement in volumes with your gross margin performance. So just based on the magnitude of the volume growth in the quarter, can you comment on whether there was any greater emphasis on price investments that might explain some of the variability in the top line and your gross margin performance?
William J. DeLaney: Ajay, it's a great question. I understand it from your perspective. It's just not exactly how we run the business here or how we’d think about it. What I'm trying to articulate to you is, we did -- we had our presidents in for our regular fall council here in the middle of November, and we talk a lot about the business. And I think coming out of that meeting, we probably did take a little bit more of a cohesive approach to being more aggressive in terms of protecting our business, supporting the customer base and going after new business opportunities. So it wasn't like, okay, we're going to invest x in price to get to that, but we saw some pressure on margins as we did that. But to be honest with you, I can't tell you if the margin pressure really exacerbated that much the second half of the quarter. So I think my point is the pricing pressure is there. We're going to go out and get cases while it's there and learn how to manage it as best we can. And at the same time, there's a learning here that's been with us for some time. And certainly, our strategy, which I feel very good about, is addressing it, which is in the world that we're in and that we're going to be in for the foreseeable future, we need to continue to work on our cost structure. And it goes well beyond cutting and slashing. I mean, it's just a fundamental, a more cohesive approach to productivity opportunities in all parts of the business: operations, selling and admin. And you see us, over the medium term, beginning to address some of that with the business transformation work. In the shorter term, when you have 70 Broadline operating companies and 8,000 sales people on the street and 47,000 employees, there's always opportunities to improve productivity in a business. And those are the things that we're working on today. And clearly, there's opportunities for us to assess where we are in our pricing and tweak that as well.
Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: Okay. And I think you confirmed, just based on the general operating environment and the read-through for your case volume trends, it looked like you did see some pickup in number [ph] and you're seeing some similar improvement in volume trends in the current quarter. It doesn't sound like things have tapered off -- correct me if I'm wrong -- things have tapered off over the last month or so. But can we infer from that, that your volumes or case volumes are still in the 2% to 3% range through the first 4 weeks of the quarter?
William J. DeLaney: I think what I said, Ajay, was that the trends that we saw in the latter part last quarter are continuing. I just want to be a little cautious here is that you've followed us for a long time. January, even February, are not that relevant in terms of this quarter. The month of March is kind of the month where you have the -- you still have the seasonal business in the South, but people start getting out again in the North. So yes, so far, we've seen continuation in the trends, but March is going to drive this quarter. And as I mentioned in my prepared comments, I think that the real key for us in the second half of the year is improving in the areas that have been questioned on and that we've addressed this morning. But we need to see a continuation of those trends. And if we do, I think we're well positioned.
Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: And if I could, I also wanted to ask a question about the facility in Indiana. I know that the timing has gotten pushed out a few different times over the last few years, and each time, it seems like the main reason cited for the delay is just the lack of industry growth. So I just wanted to confirm if the business decision to build out the third RDC is purely a timing issue from your standpoint. Or is there any kind of a scenario where you might feel that the capital investment just simply isn't warranted?
Robert C. Kreidler: Well, I mean, Ajay, as you might imagine, those are all coupled together. When we build facilities, we expect to get a return. And when we first looked at that facility, just like the other 2, a lot of the return came from what we call the avoidance of capital, which is, as cases grow, we won't have to build out facilities around that new facility because that facility will take up much of the volume. So it helped with the return. So when you get into a low case environment, you're not seeing the same return on the facility. So we said, you know what, we need to push this thing off a little while and keep looking at it. We continue to look at it. Case growth here is certainly helping the case for that facility, but it's also causing us to be a lot smarter about what other benefits can we derive from that facility, how can we work with suppliers better in terms of inbound transportation, et cetera, to get more return out of that facility if we don't think we're going to get the return the same way as we did in number 1 and number 2. So it's really all of the above. It's certainly not something we've taken off the table. We just continue to evaluate it. And we said we'd look at it again in the spring, and that's our plan.
Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: Okay. And one final question, if I could. Just based on your update for the ERP guidance of, I think, the new range is $2.30 to $2.50, how much of that is, if you can comment, Chris, is depreciation?
Robert C. Kreidler: I can't really comment specifically on the depreciation number. What we have said is that if everything continues to go well with Oklahoma as we read the assessment, if we're prepared to roll out the first multiple wave, we would expect our depreciation to start somewhere in the latter part of the third quarter. And that is factored into the updated expense guidance that we've given you. We've not broken out how much it is at this point.
Operator: We'll go next to Ed Kelly, Crédit Suisse.
Edward J. Kelly - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I'm just trying to get a sense for what real underlying market growth is doing here and what the cadence is for Q2 versus Q1. If you had not been, call it, a bit more aggressive in terms of growing volume, would your case volume growth have been similar to Q1? Would it have been slightly better? How should we be thinking about that?
William J. DeLaney: Yes, it's another one of those really good questions. It's hard to tell. I think what you should be thinking is, for the calendar year, the early estimate is that the market was flat. I think we said up 0.1%. I think at the same time, it was probably better than that in the December quarter for the reasons that we alluded to and certainly what you've seen in other businesses. So I think you probably would have seen better growth in the second quarter -- our second quarter than the first, even if we hadn't maybe gotten a little bit more aggressive in terms of our approach and mindset, but I don't think you would have seen what we put up. So that's the best I can conjecture on that, Ed.
Edward J. Kelly - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And I'm trying to see if I'm reading you guys correctly here, but you sounded a little frustrated about the flow-through on the bottom line of the volume growth. But it doesn't sound to me like you really plan on changing how you go after volumes. So if you're going to improve that flow-through, was it really all about the operating expense line and how you get that done?
William J. DeLaney: Yes. Look, I used the word frustrated. Maybe, I don't know, depending on the day, that could be a little strong or it may not be. But the bigger point here, I think, from our standpoint is, when you look at our business model, it's predicated on growth, whether you're talking about building RDCs, whether you're talking about growing the earnings and that type of thing. And we know when we grow boxes that over some period of time, generally, we can leverage that into earnings growth. And that's what the goal is. So, yes, we acknowledge here that the number on the bottom line didn't come in where we expected it to for the quarter. So that's disappointing on one level, but I'm not disappointed in the sales. I mean, we feel good about how we're going after the business. I feel very good about our people and the effort that we're seeing there. I feel very good about the cash flow of the company. I mean, we put in this IRS thing -- after this year, that's behind us. I think you'll see our working capital management improve somewhat over time. And I feel good about the strategy. So overall, I feel good. The frustration is -- look, we're competitive people. We know that we have shareholders that are looking for certain numbers, and we just came in a little bit short of what we expected to come in at. But I'm not frustrated in terms of the business or the people.
Edward J. Kelly - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And then related to the business transformation costs, I know you're obviously not prepared to give numbers beyond what you've given this year. But do you think that the peak year in spending on business transformation costs will be fiscal '13? Or will it be the current year?
Robert C. Kreidler: When we had originally put up numbers for -- I'm going to try to answer your question not by looking forward but by reminding you of what we said before. When we first put up numbers, we showed the peak year being, I think, either fiscal '12 or fiscal '13. Since then, we’ve talked about the delay that we've experienced. And so I think you can make a reasonable assumption that the peak year got pushed out. So my best guess, and I don't have numbers to share with you yet, but we do believe we'll have quite a bit to talk about in May. My best guess is peak year is going to be fiscal '13.
Edward J. Kelly - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And just last question for you. Can you help us with how much you've capitalized to date? And then as you think about that line item beginning to amortize, over what time period should we be doing that on average?
Robert C. Kreidler: Yes. So we're going to issue our Q tomorrow, and I think you'll be able to -- with that number and previous numbers, you'll be able to come up with the total capitalized number. I don't have it in front of me or off the top of my head, Ed, but you'll be able to see what it is. And then in terms of the timeframe, some of the stuff that we're capitalizing is at 7 years, some is at 5, some is at 3. Ball-parking it, not knowing the number off the top of my head, you can probably take an average around 5 years, and you will be -- plus or minus a year, you're going to be accurate.
Operator: We'll proceed next to Andrew Wolf, BB&T Capital Markets.
Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: Bill, I know it's -- I don't blame you for being a little cautious on sales. But given the macro backdrop got a little better and your sort of -- your internal numbers got a little better in sync, and I know you're going out and getting share, too. But you also characterized, I guess, your outlook is -- you still think the market is going to be choppy. What would -- what might make you turn to a little more -- saying something like cautiously optimistic? Would it be a good March or -- for Sysco and the market? Or are you just -- that's your outlook? You just think it's going to be choppy? And if that's the case, could you explain why?
William J. DeLaney: I let Chris use the word choppy this time. I didn't say choppy. So I'm trying to be optimistic here, Andy. So, yes, I think a couple of good quarters in a row would be all I need, to be honest with you. And so I think we had a nice finish to the last quarter. How much of that was driven by holidays is to be determined. I just think, if you take a step back and just look at the economy in general and the mindset of the consumer, every piece of data that you're seeing right now on the consumer side is increasingly positive. So if that can continue and if that translates into people going out to eat a little bit more, as I said in my prepared remarks, then that's a good thing. So it's just -- it would be nice to see a trend over 2 or 3 quarters where you see that. And then I think that -- then that would really validate the approach that we've taken, which is to get more aggressive in the marketplace and to be well positioned when the volume picks up, then we can leverage a lot of our scale at that point in time. So I feel like we're doing the right things. It would be nice if we saw the results a little faster. We haven't. I think we will see them gradually. And, yes, I think cautiously optimistic is where we're at, but all that really means is, we need to see a couple -- maybe 3 good quarters together. And it really comes down to what's between the years of the consumer and are they to a point now where they're going to start going out to eat a little bit more. We're seeing a little bit of that, more at the quick service side. But what we've consistently seen over the last few months is that the tickets, the size of the purchases when people go out to eat, that is increasing. So we're seeing signs, and we just need to see them, I think, for a little bit longer.
Robert C. Kreidler: Andy, I'll jump in since I'm the one that used the word choppy. The economist in me just continues to remind myself that we're comparing these latest quarters to a historically bad point in time. And by any measure, the economic -- the macroeconomic [indiscernible] still say that this economy is very fragile. So while we're -- Bill's words, I'll echo, while we're feeling a little bit better, you do have to sometimes pull back and remind ourselves that this economy overall is still very fragile. If we get some rhythm to it, the consumer confidence picks up, the jobs data is certainly helping here, that stuff starts to build momentum, you'll hear us starting to be a lot more confident about it. But we're not very far from the trough that we were in.
William J. DeLaney: I mean, the one thing -- I know you know this, Andy. But, I mean, the one thing we have to remind ourselves and we've been in this period here for an extended time now is going out to eat is still a relatively low-cost form of entertainment, and I've been saying that off and on for 25 years here at Sysco. And we certainly have had to deal with a new environment the last 3 years, but once that mindset turns, we think that, that will be helpful to our business. We just haven't really seen it turn in the business as much as we'd like to see yet.
Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: Good. That helped me. A couple of housekeeping questions. Did you have a similar bonus increase accrual in Q1 that you called out this quarter?
Robert C. Kreidler: Yes, it's a little bit of a mismatch. Last year, in the second quarter, based upon our full year forecast and the bonus plan and targets we had in place at that time, we reversed the bonuses basically back to 0. That's just what the forecast was telling us. We were not going to hit the grid. We had a good third quarter, as Bill alluded to earlier though, and that put us back in contention. This year is a slightly different bonus plan. There are different targets and objectives because you change those year by year, depending on your plan. And we did not reverse -- we do not take our bonus accrual down as low as last year, hence you have a lapping effect of $18 million.
Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: And lastly, actually do have a follow-up on gross margin, which I thought was exhausted. But -- and you might have mentioned this, but was there a mix aspect to it, too? Are you growing a chain type or non-street type of business that might be lower margin at a greater rate? And is that just part of what is going on with the gross margin? Or was it mostly on the price side?
Robert C. Kreidler: No, we really -- I mean, we've done the same analysis on gross margin that we've done every quarter to try to ferret out is it mixed, is it this, is it that, and really nothing. The thing that stands out most is the category we've been calling inflation, which is just in the high inflationary product categories. That's where we're seeing the most margin. That accounts for the vast majority of the 75 basis points.
William J. DeLaney: Yes, I think the only other thing I would add to that is, as you read our material and as we speak here today, we're talking a lot more in terms of deltas on dollars, piece growth, sales dollars, in particular, gross profit dollars, expense dollars, that type of thing. Look, we have concerns about the margin as you can expect. But the percentages are not as relevant. When you've been through a period -- extended period here now of several quarters of inflation, whether you're looking at expense percentages or gross profit percentages, I don't know that, that's as meaningful a way of looking at it as it might have been historically. But clearly, what is meaningful is the dollars that we're taking to the bottom line. So that's how we're evolving here in terms of how we look at the business internally, which is our gross profit dollar growth versus our expense growth.
Operator: And we'll have our last question today from Shaurja Ray, JPMorgan.
John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I'm on for John -- I'm John Ivankoe. Just a quick housekeeping one first. Did you quantify how much the weather and the calendar shifts were to the sales growth for the quarter?
Robert C. Kreidler: No, we did not.
John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Could you? Or is that...
William J. DeLaney: I don't think it was a big deal, to be honest with you.
Robert C. Kreidler: I wouldn't try to be short with you. We didn't quantify them because, frankly, they weren't a big deal. They weren't enough to call out.
William J. DeLaney: We had some bad weather last year, I think, in the North, but we don't -- I don't really count that because bad weather in the North in December is not a big deal.
Robert C. Kreidler: Yes. It's kind of something you expect year-after-year and you never know what day it's going to hit.
William J. DeLaney: I think the one thing that did help, but we didn't quantify it, was the way the calendar fell with Christmas and New Year's Day being on a Sunday. That did, I think, allow people to get out more. But I think we benefited more and our industry benefited more from just what you saw in retail and everything else, which is business just seemed to pick up throughout the holiday season. But even with that, I feel like we were able to grow our business better than others.
John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then just in terms of, I think, longer term, you've talked to maybe 0.5 point or 1 point of sales growth coming from acquisitions. Could you just talk a little bit about how you guys see the acquisition pipeline going forward, if you still have kind of confidence in your ability to roll in maybe some smaller companies?
Robert C. Kreidler: Yes, I mean, that continues to be our goal and our plan, 0.5 point to 1 point. We've got a very robust pipeline. We're trying, as we've said in prior calls, to go back to kind of the way we used to do things in the past, which is just build relationships with the families that are out there. And when it comes time for them to exit the business for whatever reason, we're a phone call away, and hopefully we can put together a transaction. So we have a pipeline of folks that are thinking about exiting the business either now or sometime in the near future, and we try to turn that pipeline into actual transactions. We've done a number of deals this year. They’re usually pretty small. We don't announce every one of them because of their size. But in aggregate, we hope they add up to 0.5% to 1% every year.
Operator: That concludes today's Sysco Corp. Conference Call. Thank you all for your participation.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Sysco Reports First Quarter Fiscal 2012 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Neil Russell, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Neil A. Russell: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for Sysco's First Quarter 2012 Conference Call. On today's call, you will hear from Bill DeLaney, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Kreidler, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, please note that statements made on the course of this presentation that state the company or management's intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results could differ in a material manner. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ in a material manner from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's SEC filings, including, but not limited to risk factors contained in the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 2, 2011, and in the company's press release issued earlier this morning. On the call today, if you've joined us via webcast, you will notice that we have -- that we are augmenting our comments with a slide presentation. You can download a copy of the presentation by going to the Investors section of sysco.com. This presentation was also filed with the SEC on Form 8-K this morning. Non-GAAP financial measures are included in our comments today and in the presentation slides. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the applicable GAAP measures are included at the end of the presentation and can also be found in the Investors section of our website. In addition, all comments about earnings per share refer to diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. Lastly, as many of you know, we recently rescheduled our Investor Day to May 17. We expect that the Investor Day will be held in New York City, but we'll provide an update on meeting location early next year. With that out of the way, I'll turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill DeLaney.
William J. DeLaney: Thank you, Neil, and good morning, everyone. This morning, Sysco reported net earnings of $303 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 and earnings per share of $0.51. Sales increased 8.6% for the quarter, driven mainly by food cost inflation of 7.3%. This represents the sixth consecutive quarter of sequential increases in inflation. Case volume for the quarter was positive, but the growth rate remains modest in this difficult macroeconomic environment. Operating income for the quarter was $509 million, our highest first quarter on record. We're encouraged with these results at a time when the industry's as competitive as it has ever been. Our first quarter performance demonstrates our associates' commitment to focusing on our customers and managing costs. To get a clearer view of our underlying business performance, we believe it's helpful to exclude gross business transformation expenses and the impact of COLI. Looking at the results in this way, you'll see that while reported EPS was flat year-over-year, adjusted EPS grew 7.8% for the quarter, which is a result we are reasonably pleased with. We continue to believe that the food service industry will experience modest volume growth over the medium term. With that said, current industry trends appear to be flat at best. Thus, the approximately 2% case volume growth that we generated during the quarter in our business is encouraging. Looking forward, our focus remains on striking the right balance between volume growth, managing margins and controlling cost. Turning to our multiyear Business Transformation Project for a moment, we are implementing this month a significant system enhancement at our Arkansas location. We will then assess performance, address any concerns and move forward to our second facility. Once we have achieved a successful implementation at the second facility, we will update our rollout schedule and long-range projections of the cost and benefits of the project. It is imperative that we remain disciplined in our approach as we move forward to ensure that the larger rollout of future waves will be successful. Sysco is fortunate to have an outstanding leadership team. In that regard, last week, we announced changes in the responsibilities and the reporting structure for several of our senior executives. These changes reflect the strength and depth of the team and will enhance our ability to successfully execute our annual business plan, effectively implement our Business Transformation Project and accomplish our key strategic objectives. The changes include: Mike Green, Executive Vice President and Group President will assume responsibility for leading all Sysco operating companies. And Larry Pulliam, also Executive Vice President and Group President, will lead several key business support functions, including supply chain, information technology and business transformation, as well as contract sales and distribution services, which he currently has responsibility for. Both Mike and Larry will continue to report to me. In addition, we also recently announced that Fred Lankford, who previously served as President of Sysco Eastern Maryland, was promoted to Senior Vice President, Distribution Services for Sysco. Fred has over 30 years of operating company experience and will lead the development of an enterprise-wide approach to enhance our operational execution. In this new role, Fred will report to Larry Pulliam. In closing, I should note that while the pace and extent of the economic recovery remains uneven and difficult to predict, we are committed to being our customer's most valued business partner and to invest in the future growth of Sysco. This focus will serve us well by strengthening our competitive position and providing a strong foundation for success over the long term. We believe that Sysco's capabilities are unique in the industry and position us well to achieve our financial and strategic goals. Now I'll turn things over to Chris, so he can provide additional details on our financial results for the first quarter.
Robert C. Kreidler: Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. For the first quarter, sales were $10.6 billion or an increase of 8.6% compared to the prior year, driven mainly by higher prices. Prices were higher due to increasing levels of food cost inflation, which we estimated to be 7.3% for the quarter. In addition, acquisitions within the last 12 months increased sales by 0.7%, and changes in foreign exchange rates increased sales by 0.7%. As Bill discussed a moment ago, case volume for the quarter increased nearly 2% year-over-year including acquisitions, or a little more than 1% excluding acquisitions. SYGMA's case growth was flat compared to double-digit growth in the prior year quarter, so all of the case growth we saw this quarter came in our Broadline organization. Turning to gross profit. I'd first like to make you aware of a change that is reflected in the results we announced today. Last year, we made the decision to reorganize our buy-in cooperative to streamline certain business functions and help us achieve the goals under our business transformation initiative. We completed the reorganization at the beginning of this fiscal year and the buy-in function now operates as a shared corporate cost center. As a result, we have reclassified certain centralized procurement costs from cost of sales to operating expenses. This change has the effect of enhancing transparency into our gross profits and operating expenses. The net effect of this change is an increase to both the gross profit and operating expense lines, averaging roughly $15 million to $20 million per quarter. Because these 2 increases net out to 0, there is no change to operating income or earnings. We have made these reclassifications retroactively, so the year-over-year variances previously reported on the gross profit and operating expense lines are not materially different. These changes are reflected in all financial information disclosed today. Tomorrow morning, shortly after filing our 10-Q, we'll also file an 8-K that provides our financial results on this new basis for the last 3 years. Gross profit increased 5.5% during the quarter, while gross margin decreased 53 basis points year-over-year to 18.4%. The decline in gross margin was due to high inflation rates combined with only modest volume growth. However, gross profit dollars per stop and per case increased once again. We remain focused on our cost structure. We understand that slow growth and high product cost may be a trend that stays with us for the foreseeable future, so we are committed to finding ways to improve our profitability in this environment. Managing our cost very tightly is one area of focus. Historically, Sysco has done a very good job of reducing its cost structure, and we believe we continue to have opportunities to do more. Operating expenses increased $98 million or 7.3% in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 compared to the prior year period. The increase in operating expenses was primarily the result of a $40 million increase in salaries and related costs due to increases in delivery and sales compensation, acquisitions, foreign exchange and growth in our Canadian Broadline operations, a $16 million increase in gross project expenses related to the company's Business Transformation Project and a $14 million increase in fuel expense, although it's important to note that fuel surcharges offset this increase entirely. In addition, as we discussed last quarter, we recently made changes to the investments underlying our COLI policies, which significantly reduce the volatility to our earnings. As a result, we had a $1 million gain this quarter, which was a period during which the market declined significantly. If we had not made this change, the impact from COLI during the quarter would have been substantially negative. While this is a positive result, the $1 million gain compares to a $14 million gain last year, creating a negative $13 million year-over-year variance for us this quarter compared to the prior year. The operating expense items I just discussed were partially offset by a $7 million decrease in expense related to the company's corporate-sponsored pension plan. Reported operating income increased $3 million or 0.6% for the fiscal quarter. As we discuss during our fourth quarter call, we believe it is important to focus on the performance of our underlying business, excluding the impact of the Business Transformation Project. Excluding gross business transformation expenses and the impact of COLI, adjusted operating expenses increased 5.3%, and adjusted operating income increased 6.1%. Net earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2011 were $303 million, an increase of $3.6 million or 1.2% compared to the prior year. EPS for the first quarter was flat year-over-year on a reported basis at $0.51. Excluding gross business transformation expenses and COLI gains, adjusted EPS grew 7.8% to $0.55 compared to the prior year. So to summarize the first quarter performance in our underlying business, sales were up 8.6%, driven mainly by inflation; gross profits were up 5.5%; and adjusted operating expenses were up 5.3%, meaning we were able to leverage the gross profit growth and deliver more dollars to the bottom line. Adjusted operating income was up 6.1% and adjusted EPS was up 7.8%. As Bill said, we're reasonably pleased with these results given the current environment. Turning to the impact of the Business Transformation Project for a moment, in the first quarter, gross project expenses totaled $37 million, and we capitalized $45 million related to the project. In the prior year quarter, gross project expenses totaled $21 million, and we capitalized $53 million related to the project. Turning to cash flow. Cash flow from operations for the first quarter was $255 million. In the prior year period, cash flow from operations was $227 million. We will pay the final $212 million in IRS settlement payments during the remainder of this fiscal year, with $106 million to be paid in the second quarter and $53 million to be paid in each of the last 2 quarters of the fiscal year. Capital expenditures totaled $227 million for the first quarter compared to $143 million in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by investments in facilities. This year, we are in the midst of constructing new facilities in Long Island, Boston and Central Texas, as well as a major expansion in Lincoln, Nebraska, compared to having only one such major project underway a year ago. There are a few guidance metrics for fiscal 2012 that I'd now like to update. First, as the price of fuel has eased somewhat over the last couple of months, we now expect an increase in fuel expense of $25 million to $35 million this year, which is roughly $10 million lower than our previous guidance. As a reminder, we implemented a fuel surcharge late during the third quarter of fiscal 2011, which is intended to mitigate the increase in fuel expense. Second, we continue to assess the appropriate timing to start construction on our third redistribution center or RDC. Given the macroeconomic conditions, as a result, it's unlikely we'll spend as much on it during the fiscal year of 2012 as previously anticipated. We are therefore reducing our CapEx estimates for the year by $50 million to a range of $700 million to $750 million. Lastly, we now expect our gross business transformation expenses for the year to be in the range of $250 million to $275 million. We expect the impact will increase each quarter, such that more than half of the total expenses will come in the second half of the year. In closing, while the macroeconomic environment continues to pressure our business, we are focused on managing our margins and costs and also on productivity improvements to mitigate these pressures. Sysco has built a seasoned team of professionals over the years that has the skills and experience to manage through these types of challenges. We believe that our capabilities and the investments we're making in our business will enable us to build on our industry leadership position over the long term. With that, operator, we'll now take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take a question from Karen Short with BMO Capital.
Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Maybe can you just talk a little bit about, more of an update on the pilot in Arkansas and just talk about some of the kinks that you obviously were focused on in the fourth quarter, how those have worked out? And then also maybe some update on the timing of the rollout to the second opco?
William J. DeLaney: Karen, it's Bill. We can tell you some things and we're obviously right in the midst, as I mentioned, of putting in some of these enhancements this month in Arkansas. So the last time we would have talked with this group and internally for that matter, we said we were going to focus on Arkansas. We had some performance issues there, which kind of mean speed in terms of order process and that type of thing, and as well as some report issues and some inventory replenishment issues. So those are 3 basic things that we're addressing. And we're not addressing them all at this point in time. We've got a couple of those 3 that we're working through this month, and we hope to see some good progress there. And like I said in my prepared talk, we'll assess it at that point. And when we think we, that we're ready to go to the second company in a way that will work for our sales people and our employees and our customers, then we'll go. But I would hope it would be at some point early in the new calendar year. And then once we go through that pilot, really, the key to that pilot is just to confirm how well the system supports 2 companies, and the hope would be to get through that in good shape and then we'll reestablish what our rollout schedule would be.
Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay, that's helpful. And then just talking about sales throughout the quarter, I know you've kind of talked about the cadence in sales in the fourth quarter. Maybe it was looking a little bit better in June, but it wasn't clear. Can you just talk about your sales cadence throughout this quarter?
William J. DeLaney: Yes, I think what we said last time, we saw -- generally, I mean, it's never the same in every company or every market, but generally, we saw a little bit of a flattening or a leveling out after Mother's Day, and it really didn't pick up in June. And I'd say that's continued into this quarter. What we were also concerned about is we got into this quarter when certainly the consumer sentiment that I spoke to from the standpoint of what went on in Washington in July and all that type of thing. So you guys all follow the consumer and many of you follow our industry, so if you've looked at that over the last 2, 3 months, you've seen the optimism of the consumer decline to some extent and that's been a concern. So we've experienced some of that although we're a little bit encouraged by what we've seen here in the last month, that some same type of surveys where it appears the consumer is becoming more optimistic again. So that's critical to us, it's great. We need the economy to grow and that's very important, but what's critical to our customers is that the consumer be in the right frame of mind to go out and enjoy a meal away from home and hopefully, people are gaining confidence again here ever so gradually and that should bode well for us and for our customers.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Ajay Jain with Cantor Fitzgerald.
Ajay Jain - Hapoalim Securities USA, Inc., Research Division: I just had a 2-part question on the current incentive structure for your marketing associates. So the first part of the question is, can you just maybe clarify some of the operating metrics that you think are the most relevant on how the marketing associates are incentivized right now? And then the other part of the question is, whatever those metrics might pertain to, whether that's gross profit per delivery or cases per trip or pieces per trip, did you see any improvement last quarter sequentially? And also based on your earlier comparisons, is that something you can comment on at all?
William J. DeLaney: Let me take the first one, Ajay, you may have to come back to me on the second one. So really, the way we compensate our MAs hasn't changed dramatically. And it does coincide with what, at least, what I would view as one of our top key economic metrics for the business. So there's a lot of key metrics, but certainly one of the top 2 or 3 would be gross profit dollars per delivery. And our MAs, once they reach a point that they're on full commission, they are paid off of gross profit, but off of gross profit per delivery. So they're pretty well aligned in terms of the basic economics. Certainly, there's opportunities over time to continue to assess that. And in addition to how we compensate people, we also recognize people, and that's a big thing within Sysco and it's certainly a big thing with our sales managers, our MAs. So certainly growth and quality growth at the territory level has always been very much emphasized within Sysco, and we continue to look for ways to keep that at the top of our list as well. The second question?
Ajay Jain - Hapoalim Securities USA, Inc., Research Division: Yes. So Bill, I think in terms of your prepared comments, you mentioned that volumes are -- it sounded like they decelerated a little bit since last quarter. So I guess in that context, the metrics by which you incentivize the MAs, have those metrics improved, like both in the context of last quarter...
William J. DeLaney: I try to be a little more bullish here in my comments, but actually, don't think I said that. I think what I'm trying to say is we saw some volume growth and we're pleased with that. And we saw some -- the real volume growth as you can calculate was flat, but we did try to show you that we saw some case growth in the core business and that's encouraging. But at the same time, it remains very competitive out there. So I would say to you going back to Karen's question that the volume trends we're seeing in our business are pretty comparable to what we've seen in the last couple of quarters. The market is -- the market's, I would say, also about the same, and the consumer sentiment, like I mentioned, really did tail off here in July and August, and it appears it might be coming back a little bit. So we didn't see any material changes in terms of gross profit per delivery or miles or any of that type of thing.
Ajay Jain - Hapoalim Securities USA, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then in relation to ERP, it looks like, even based on your updated outlook for this year, looks like you're already on track to maybe exceed that original $900 million budget by the end of fiscal '12. So it looks like between the operating expenses and CapEx, the cumulative total would be in -- it would still be in excess of $1 billion by the end of the year. Is that correct?
Robert C. Kreidler: You're kind of comparing apples and oranges there, Ajay. The $900 million, which we used to refer to was an overall cash number, but there were a number of things as we've talked about, including our Sysco Business Services that weren't included in that number because we always assume there'd be a netting against them from benefits. So what we're talking about -- obviously, we've spent an amount of cash already. We're continuing to spend cash on the project rollout, but it's very difficult to compare where we are versus that number and draw a conclusion. That's one of the reasons why we went to the, what I think is a totally transparent, here are the gross expenses, and we'll update you on the benefits as we go forward.
Ajay Jain - Hapoalim Securities USA, Inc., Research Division: Okay. But on a gross expense basis, is that -- am I still conceptually right that it's -- you're sort of on track to be in a $900 million to $1 billion range by the end of this year?
Robert C. Kreidler: The gross amount of expenses that we've incurred for the projects will obviously be over $900 million, yes. All I'm saying is, I'm not comparing them back to that original $900 million. It's a bit of a -- again, it's comparing it against something that wasn't reflective of what we're now telling you the numbers are.
William J. DeLaney: Yes, Ajay, I would just take you back to our last call, where we talked about our timeline, and we're 6 to 12 months behind and more than likely that could translate into additional cost. But until we get through Arkansas and the next pilot facility, it's very difficult to address that question with any accuracy.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Ed Kelly with Credit Suisse.
Edward J. Kelly - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I'm sorry for this question upfront, but I actually don't understand. So you're talking about case volume growth in the core business, so 1%, 2% whatever that number is, but real growth is being flat, which you can see if you take your sales and adjust for inflation and acquisitions and currency. So what's the difference between the 2 of those?
Robert C. Kreidler: They're just different numbers. The real growth is an industry calculation that we had heard for years and years. We actually started putting it into our releases about maybe about 3 or 4 quarters ago because we knew everybody did the calculation, so we thought we'd make it easy. It's not perfectly reflective of case volume growth. It's always directionally correct. It's sometimes very close, but it's just not the same number. Case growth is a real number that we look at that just is a -- we calculate how many cases we deliver this year versus the last year, and what you're looking at is just again a definitional calculation which is sometimes pretty close.
William J. DeLaney: I think, I guess as the long-term guide here, for years, we've talked around real growth in terms of inflation and the impact of acquisitions, and once we have Canada, the FX impact. So it's a long-running statistic or set of statistics that we've always provided. We've run the business off the cases, and so we're just trying to give you a couple of different ways of looking at it. To Chris' point, they're not significantly different, but we thought it was worth, at least sharing that with you.
Robert C. Kreidler: Yes. I mean, one of the things, not to belabor it, but one of the things that's in that real growth calculation is ForEx, and you really have to scratch your head and think about whether ForEx should be in a calculation that tries to get underlying case growth. But again, we've provided you what we think you all calculate in the past, and this time, we thought we better provide you the real volume growth because it is pretty different.
Edward J. Kelly - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And can you update us on your outlook for inflation over the next few quarters?
William J. DeLaney: Sure.
Robert C. Kreidler: Well, let's get out the crystal ball.
William J. DeLaney: That won't take long. Now look, you've seen it gradually trend up from 3% to 5% to 7%, and it was -- we had it across many categories again this quarter. Certainly, the dairy and meat and seafood led the charge. But our largest categories are canned and dry and frozen, and we saw meaningful inflation there as well. So that's how you end up with a number as high as 7%. So our best sense, and I wouldn't go out anymore than a couple of quarters is that, it's with us here for a while. I wouldn't be surprised if it mitigated somewhat, but I wouldn't expect it to dramatically decline here over the next couple of quarters.
Edward J. Kelly - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And where do you see inflation from a product standpoint? Does that impact your ability to pass it through? So for instance, there's been some talk about, I guess, meat pricing going up beginning of the year. Is that a more difficult category to pass it through for you or is it pretty much the same everywhere?
William J. DeLaney: Well, meat's tough, just because those cases cost a lot to begin with. Those are expensive cases. So when you have 6%, 8%, 12% inflation, that just makes it a bigger ticket item for the customer. But in general, they're all -- it's all difficult when you've got 6% or 8% or sometimes by category double-digit price increase or cost increases for us at a time when our operators are still struggling to get traffic into their businesses. So we're in a different time. We've managed inflation of this type in the past, we've managed it well. It's harder this time and as I said before, I think there's an obvious reason for that, which is just the, what we're coming back from in terms of the economy, people's psyches, it's just more difficult. So I don't know that it's category-specific, but when you get into high single-digit, low double-digit cost increases, those are difficult for people to swallow in a short span of time. We do pass it along over time, but the bigger the number, the longer it takes.
Edward J. Kelly - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And just last question for you, your D&A was down, I guess, modestly year-over-year. I don't know if you can help us there. And then you've been capitalizing costs on SAP, and I was curious as to when the amortization on that would actually end up starting?
Robert C. Kreidler: Yes, the way we're looking at the project or the machine, as I keep referring to it is, once we're out of the pilot stage and we're actually into the implementation stage, we will begin to amortize it. I mean, internally, we've assumed that when we get past the second pilot, that, that's when it will happen. And I think I've said in the last call that in our internal plans, we do assume that we'll start depreciating it this year. So in the numbers that we've given you, we do have an assumption that we'll start depreciating the project this year. We've not been specific about what month, but we've said it will begin this year.
Edward J. Kelly - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. But that's when the second pilot is complete, that's right?
Robert C. Kreidler: Yes, when we've put the second pilot in, and we've assessed that it does indeed work, and we're going to start a rollout process, and that's when we'll declare the machine to be ready and fit for implementation.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Mark Wiltamuth with Morgan Stanley.
Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Just to stand back here. If you take the business transformation cost out, do you think you can actually grow earnings this year?
William J. DeLaney: Yes. I mean, we grew it this quarter. That's the plan, I guess we're trying to make, Mark, that we did grow operating income about 6% this quarter. If you take that and the COLI out, which I think is fair in terms of this type of a perspective. So I'm a little cautious in terms of the environment and that type of thing, but that's certainly what we're planning to do.
Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: And if you leave them all in, if we leave -- it's like almost a $0.26 to $0.28 drag, you leave that in versus the $0.11 drag last year, do you think the earnings numbers is up on that basis?
William J. DeLaney: Mark, that's not fair. I'll let Chris take that one.
Robert C. Kreidler: Yes, I think we call that guidance. Mark, look, I'll go back to your first question. You're hitting on the point that we've been trying to make, which is, we understand we're responsible for business transformation, and we've got a lot of very, very quality people working on that, we're managing the costs appropriately, but we're not going to avoid spending money and do the wrong thing on that project. What we're trying to make sure people understand and remember that there's an underlying business here, and we have to keep that underlying business growing. And so we're trying to give you the numbers you need to show that we are indeed continuing to grow the underlying business. It's hard, but as Bill said, we do believe we can continue growing the underlying business.
Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And by quarter here, so it sounds like a big back half weighting here on the remaining business transformation for the year. Can you give us any help on the individual quarters on what those are going to look like?
Robert C. Kreidler: No, we're really not going to break it down by quarter. Look, this is just me talking. We've been doing pretty good to give you guys rough estimates for the year and some would say we haven't done that good a job at that. So to break it down by quarter, the ranges would be very, very wide. Look, the meat of this year will be when we get through the pilot and we start to roll out. That's going to be where the expense picks up because that's when we'll have both depreciation kicking in and implementation teams kicking in. So that's why we make the comment, we'll be heavier in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year.
Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: And do you think the high watermark for expense is going to be next year or is it this year?
Robert C. Kreidler: I'm going to have to hold off on that one, only because we continue to relook at the number. And it may sound like it's taking us a while. The reality is we need to get through the second pilot and reassess the implementation plan, the rollout schedule, before we really have a good view on the next few years. And our goal is to be able to talk about that in the spring, as we said the last time around. So maybe you can give us a little more time before we can give you a multiyear look on that.
Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And just outside of the gross margin pressure from inflation, how do you think the other factors there? What's going on with price competition and just the overall competitive environment?
William J. DeLaney: Look, it's very hard to separate inflation from price competition, from the challenges in the marketplace that our customers are working in. So I would stick with what we said here, Mark, which is -- I would characterize the competitive environment as, as strong as it's ever been, and I probably have been saying that for the better part of the 1.5 years to 2 years, and I don't think it's let up.
Operator: We'll take our next question from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.
John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: A couple of things, if I may. Firstly, I mean, I guess it looks like, I mean, I guess being a restaurant analyst, I mean what you're seeing is your customers are ordering less expensive food this year versus last year. And that would explain the difference between case volume and real sales, I suppose? I mean, is that a phenomenon that, I mean, that you're kind of seeing across the industry? I mean, is it located in certain pockets? I mean, maybe on the lower end and is there anything that you can do to kind of prevent that, perhaps some investments in the types of products that they're not ordering year-on-year?
William J. DeLaney: John, I'm Bill. I think from a logic standpoint, your theory is plausible, but it certainly is not necessarily the whole reason why you might see a difference. Again, we're not talking about a large difference so I would say over the last 2 to 3 years, our customers have taken a very hard look at their spending budgets and have focused very much on being economical with their purchases and still having a consistent quality of offering for their patrons. So I don't know that I can tell you that they're offering less expensive food this year. There's other things that can be driving that as well like mix. And these calculations, we do them across all of our companies. They're not precise like a scientist would be precise. So I wouldn't overplay that difference there too much. So that could be a contributing cause, but if that is, I don't think it's a new phenomena, I guess, is my point. The second part of your question?
John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Regarding SYGMA. I mean, I'm assuming that inflation number is somewhere near right for SYGMA. I mean, it does look like it was -- I mean, if that's flat, probably negative case volume or real sales, whatever you want to call it, in SYGMA in the quarter. And it's not really what we're seeing in the industry. I mean, it seems like traffic is at worst about flat across the industry for the September quarter. So I just wanted to get a sense of whether there's -- whether you're intentionally giving up some business or if there are some flow of, from customers in and out of that segment that we should be aware of.
William J. DeLaney: No, I think our SYGMA business is in line with what you just said in terms of, if you will, our comp for same-store sales, that type of thing. With SYGMA, we've had a nice little spurt here over the last 1.5 or 2 years. We've brought on some customers. We're running the business a lot better and SYGMA is going to ebb and flow a little bit based upon bringing in new accounts and that type of thing. So we haven't lost any major customers. We just kind of wrapped the period of time and we haven't bought any large ones on either. But I would agree with you that kind of the same-store part comp, if you will, is about flat in what we're seeing in that side of the business.
Operator: Our next question comes from Greg Badishkanian with Citigroup.
Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Why do you guys think maybe the Broadline business did a little bit better, particularly with soft consumer confidence? I mean, are those, some of those, I would think some of the pricing might be a little bit higher than kind of the, more of the chain business?
William J. DeLaney: Better than SYGMA, is that what you're getting at, Greg?
Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Yes, yes, better than yes, I would think just from a pricing perspective maybe there's a little bit price points in that Broadline business.
William J. DeLaney: Yes, I think I'll stick with the answer I just gave John. I don't think it's -- they're just 2 different businesses in terms of, we're always bringing on new business in the Broadline, and SYGMA tends to be a little bit more volatile as far as that goes. So I don't have a great insight in terms of that. It's not that much difference, to be honest with you, in terms of how we look at the numbers. But we're pleased with what the Broadline is doing. We're growing it both on the contracts side and in the street. We're just not seeing the volume growth that we'd like to see.
Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Right, right, yes. And just from a business transformation purpose, is there anything next quarter that's different than this quarter? I mean, is it going to be around $0.04? Or without giving guidance, but I mean, is there anything that we should consider, if there's any type of step up next quarter?
Robert C. Kreidler: We're not going to give any guidance. So it's really hard for me to answer that question. I'll go back to what I said earlier and I'm sorry, but we just can't give you much guidance. But as we said, and I'll now weave in what Bill said earlier, we are, this month, making some upgrades and enhancements to Arkansas, and he said early in the calendar year, we would hope to go into our second pilot site, so that actually gets you past the second quarter. And what I've said is that, once we go into pilot side and we make sure that, that works, then we would start amortizing and then we would reassess the rollout, and that's where the expenses would really start to kick in. So to the extent that you want some sort of insight, that's probably the best we can give you.
Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Yes, all right, okay. And then just generally in terms of -- were there any changes in terms of mix or menu price over the last few months? Or has it been pretty, kind of status quo versus kind of what you saw in the second calendar quarter?
William J. DeLaney: I don't think there's any big changes one way or another.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Andrew Wolf with BB&T Capital Markets.
Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: I wanted to follow-up on the trading down and the differential and I know -- it was nice of you to give that information, I know there's some estimation in such large organizations. But I think from your answer to John, I would take away that you're probably saying there's a little stickiness in passing through some of this rapid inflation? Is that fair to say and that's sort of market driven?
William J. DeLaney: Say that again, Andy?
Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: Well, the 1% differential that you talked about in case volume to the calculated real sales? If it's not from trading down, I was thinking about this too. If it's not from trading down, then it's probably because the inflation you're actually increasing your cost, your pricing by is a little lower than your product cost.
William J. DeLaney: Possibly. I think all I'm saying is, we're talking about a directional move here that's comparable, and the difference between the 2 is not to me overly significant. So I wouldn't overanalyze that particular difference. We're just trying to give you a feel for cases, and so I guess I'll just leave it at that. I think we're seeing some case growth we're having to invest in price a little bit to get it, and we're managing our expenses reasonably well, but as I said in my comments, we have an opportunity to do all 3 a little bit better here as we go forward in the year.
Robert C. Kreidler: Andrew, I want to jump in because I don't want folks to fixate on some 1% number. I think when you back out ForEx, we're talking less than half a point that is explained in terms of the difference between those 2 numbers. And as we keep saying, they're never exact, they've never been exact as long we have watched them, they're usually directionally correct. So I wouldn't spend too much time trying to explain away the half-point differential.
Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: But you do think the 1% real case estimate for the organization is pretty close? We don't have to -- we should consider that, right?
William J. DeLaney: I'd say that's closer than the other because we actually can see that.
Robert C. Kreidler: Yes, I mean, it's a little better than a point after excluding acquisitions and that's our real volume.
Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: Got it. And is that coming more from penetration or new customers or could it just be your customers are doing better than the industry and you have good selection, positive selection volumes.
William J. DeLaney: We'd like to think that, but when you do the amount of business that we do, our overall results are going to reflect the industry to a large extent. I'd say when you take it down to cases, I'd go back to what would appear to us that the market's relatively flat, we're seeing that at the customer level, and so what you're seeing here is the new cases coming in and faster than loss cases are going out, which is a good thing. I mean, we're working very hard on that.
Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: You think it's your lines as you look at invoices, are the amount of lines going up, penetration?
William J. DeLaney: We don't really show that number, probably any of that.
Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: Okay, fair enough. And I just wanted to ask the inflation question. You're not the only folks. Some of the food retailers are also talking about mitigation, and some are using the word hope, and you guys talked about a crystal ball, and I mean, I don't blame you for nobody really knows especially where things are at. But is there any -- first of all, when you define mitigation, are you talking about just a lower rate of inflation or are you actually think there could be some sequential lower prices, maybe in some of the big commodity groups? Which -- what would be mitigation to you?
William J. DeLaney: I said mitigation, and I'll see it in the transcript here at some point, I probably should have said that it would subside, the rate of inflation. We would hate using that word hope, so I think the best case for us, as you know very well, best case for our customers and for us is 2 or 3 points of inflation. I don't see that coming in the next couple of quarters, but it would be nice if the 7% turns out to be the high watermark and that it subsides here as we go through the next several months. It's really hard to predict beyond that though.
Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: Okay. And are any of the futures markets are in forward contracts that you can enter into? Are any of these at kind of lower inflation rates? Is there any hard evidence at this point that there might be some?
William J. DeLaney: Well, in some of the commodities if you go out and if you look at the numbers year-over-year, there's a little bit of a lessening, I guess, if you will the inflationary pressures, but not a lot. And so we typically don't go out and do a lot of forwards on commodities, and I don't expect that we'll do that anytime soon. Again, our whole model is predicated on as a marketer and distributor, being able to pass along these cost increases. And to some extent, we're in unprecedented times here, but I wouldn't expect us to start doing a lot of forward speculating.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: So a couple of things. The lower business transformation expense this year, is that simply a timing issue that it gets pushed out to next year? Or is that a true reduction in cost?
Robert C. Kreidler: That's really just firming up our estimates from earlier in the year. When we were putting together our plans and guidance for the year, we were kind of in the middle of still reading the results from Arkansas. So we put together the best numbers we thought, and as we've gone through the first quarter, we've been able to true those up. So at this point, I'm just going to say, the true up in the numbers.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: But you were conservative -- or you were conservative before that -- this is where we're coming out now?
Robert C. Kreidler: I would say we were probably erring on the side a bit on conservatism, and I'm not going to say that it won't be a timing issue. Again, we're holding off on giving you further out guidance until we got a chance to read the second pilot and finish our rollout. But right now, I'll just say, it's a true up for 2012 and that's pretty much the best view I've got.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: All right. Now Bill, on price elasticity, if we end up a year from now with inflation of 2% or 3% or something like that, what's your sense on price elasticity and how much of that helps unit demand? Or in this macro does it not help much?
William J. DeLaney: Well historically, it's helped, John, as you well know. Historically, whether it's a mindset or elasticity or whatever when you have lower levels of inflation, our trends would tell you, our historical trends would tell you, we're able to grow our boxes a little bit more. I think that's though because that the operator that we're selling to is in a better place in terms of their business and in terms of their outlook. So time will tell, but I would still say that we would be better served, and our customers will be better served if we can get to that lower level of inflation, the 2 or 3 points. And I just think people's outlooks will be better in that kind of environment. So I would much rather see that. It would be good to get there in the right way, and not get there too fast, but I would think that, that's a better scenario for us.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: But there's not a 1:1 relationship, right? If inflation backs off 400 basis points, we'd probably don't see a 400 basis point improvement in unit demand?
William J. DeLaney: No, I don't think you do. And I would, double on what I had given -- just given the world that we operate in today, which is much different than one we operated in 4 or 5 years ago, so I would not make that leap.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: All right. Then finally, if you think you just talked about other opportunities to reduce cost. When you look at the growth in payroll, is that primarily, is that hours, is it cost per hour and where is there opportunity if you think there is to bring that increase down?
William J. DeLaney: I think there's a couple levels of opportunity. One is, I mentioned Fred coming on board here and working with Larry on rolling out this enterprise-wide enhanced operational support work, if you will. So you watched us over a lot of years, so we've gone from basically pretty much letting the operating companies do whatever they want, to do operationally, to best practice websites, to integrated delivery models, to now we're just kind of trying to strike a better balance between what the OpCos can see through their prism locally, where they can make improvements in terms of the productivity, and what we might be able to see across the entire enterprise. And so, I think over the medium-term, there continues to be opportunity, like we've created over the last 3 or 4 years, where you've seen our productivity improve nicely, both in the warehouse and in delivery, and I think that continues to be that type of opportunity going forward. And keep in mind, that was all part of the umbrella -- under the umbrella of business transformation. It just didn't happen to be part of the SAP component of it. So I think that's a kind of a medium-term opportunity ongoing for us. And then secondly, I've said this before and I don't mean to be oversimplified or trite, but I think anytime you've got 500 people coming to work together every day, anytime you got 200 people in operations and a sales force of 100 people, there's always opportunity to mobilize those folks in a more efficient way. So we do a great job, I think we do better than most, if not all. But when you have that many transactions, that many cases and pilots coming in and going out every day, there's always opportunities to manage the business and little bit better, and that's certainly what we're working on very hard here.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Meredith Adler with Barclays Capital.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about your staffing for marketing associates. There was a time where I think everybody thought the economy was going to improve more quickly, and I know you didn't want to be behind in terms of training marketing associates. When you look where you are now, do you just think that you need to make some changes in the staffing?
William J. DeLaney: Meredith, it's Bill. I actually think we're in a pretty good place right now. We have gone through a transition to your point over the last 12 to 18 months. Where I think some of our operating companies, got behind or maybe cut a little bit more than, in retrospect, than we would've liked to have cut. But as I look at our numbers today, we're up modestly in terms of MAs, and we're up about, what the cases are up, and we're up about what our expectations for case growth are, so I think we're in a pretty good place there.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay, that's great. And then I think this is beating a dead horse, but if you were to start depreciating the business transformation cost, saying, let's just make this up in the fourth quarter and you were also going to start to have the actual expenses of the rollout should be running through the P&L. Can you give us some idea of, based on what you know today, what that would do to earnings per share?
Robert C. Kreidler: Well, we've given you the full year guidance on that, Meredith, which includes both those items. So we updated it today, of course, $250 million to $275 million of expense for the year. You can make your own assumption on how much of that is the first half versus the back half of the year. Included in that is depreciation and the expensing of the items, and so roughly $10 million per $0.01 per share, that would be the impact on our earnings per share.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay, I'm sorry I didn't realize that, that included the D&A component in it.
Robert C. Kreidler: Yes, it's all expensed.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Erin Lash with MorningStar.
Erin Swanson Lash - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: I had -- I wanted to go back to some of the strategic pricing initiatives that you've talked about over the past couple of quarters. I don't think that you mentioned it this time around, and I was wondering if you could give us an update or a little bit more detail on that.
Robert C. Kreidler: Yes, Erin, this is Chris. I didn't mention it frankly because it wasn't a significant impact at all. We -- that number or the impact of that number on our gross margin has declined the last couple of quarters as we've discussed, to the point where it's not really, it's not something we're going to call out because it's not material. So the translation -- we're starting to see the impact that we wanted to see. We're starting to see the benefits on those geographies that were rolled out earlier, offsetting the geographies that we rolled out later in the process.
Erin Swanson Lash - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: Right, thank you, that's helpful. Following up, I'm pretty sure that you mentioned this about a year ago. But could you remind us what the impact is regarding the timing of the holidays, meaning with Christmas and New Year's falling on Sundays for the upcoming -- in the current quarter, how that impacts your case volumes versus if they were to fall on a weekday?
William J. DeLaney: Okay, I'll take a shot at that one. It's actually better if it falls on a Sunday because that's a normal day off, obviously, for most of our people. The reality is though that they get holidays. There's the expense side of this, so we'll incur some extra cost anytime you have a holiday week, especially a big one like Christmas or New Year's the following week. So the reality is Christmas, in particular, is a time where at some point that weekend, people stop going out. So in the case of Sunday, we'll do a little better because you'll have Christmas Eve, most people though pretty much shut it down by noon on Saturday. So it could help us a little bit. I think the holidays fall at the same time this year as last year. I'll have Neil come back to you on that if that's different. But I think in terms of what weeks they fall in, it's the same. And Erin, that's probably more important, to be honest with you, in terms of the week as opposed to the day of the week.
Robert C. Kreidler: I think that's where we gave you some guidance a year ago because actually one of the quarters had one less holiday than the prior year, one had one more holiday than the prior year, so we did the adjustment to help you out with that.
Erin Swanson Lash - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And then just finally, any update on the acquisition pipeline or premiums that sellers are potentially looking at? Or should we assume that most of your focus is going towards the business transformation and not on the acquisitions at this point?
Robert C. Kreidler: No, we continue to spend a great deal of amount of time working on acquisitions. We've got a small team of people, and then we've got a large group of people out in the field that one of their roles is to continue to source potential acquisitions. So the pipeline is reasonably robust. We don't announce every deal that we do. We tend to make an announcement involving 3 or 4 deals that we've done. We'll continue to say that most of these are smaller-ish transactions given our size. Most things are going to be smaller transactions, but we'll keep doing them. And the first part of your question in terms of pricing, it's really about the same. We're pretty disciplined in our approach. We don't feel we overpay for anything. We like to be fair, but we continue to see owners of companies that are at a point where they're ready to exit the business, come forward and we're typically able to get to an agreement on pricing and we move on down the path towards closure.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Bob Cummins from Wellington Shields & Co.
Robert Cummins - Shields & Company: My question just happened to be also on acquisitions. I see that you did spend $36 million on acquisitions in this quarter, so you're not standing still. But it also occurs to me in the current environment that there might be and particularly in areas of the country where you have a relatively small market share, there may be more acquisition opportunities and perhaps of a larger size that you might consider doing. Can you kind of give me a sense of whether you see more people looking to sell out their businesses around the country and what your strategy would be? You still have a relatively small market share nationwide.
William J. DeLaney: Bob, thanks for pointing that out. But the reality is, the market share moves around depending on the market. So as you go to 17% nationwide statistic, there's markets where we have considerably more than that and to your point, there's markets where we have less. So we are seeing, to Chris' point, we are seeing and have seen over the last year or so and I think we're being more effective and proactive, some fold-in opportunities, which, Bob, I think could be the more likely scenario for us. So there are some bigger players out there. We don't have the sense that they're overly interested in selling their businesses right now, but certainly we'd be open to talking to them. But I think the bigger opportunity is on the smaller to midsize competitors. And to your point, in markets where we do have more opportunity to grow our share.
Robert C. Kreidler: Yes, I'll weigh in there, Bob. I mean, we're looking everywhere. We have folks working everywhere. I hate to say it like this, but we'll talk to anybody if they're interested in selling. So we don't necessarily focus on areas where we've got low market share although in certain markets, Los Angeles or Southern California we're under-penetrated, we announced a deal there within the last year, a decent sized deal to help us out. We'll certainly look in those areas, but we don't look exclusively in those areas. We'll look at transactions anywhere we can find them.
Operator: That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Sysco Announces Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2011 Results Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Neil Russell. Please go ahead, sir.
Neil Russell: Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for Sysco's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2011 Conference Call. On today's call, you will hear from Bill DeLaney, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Kreidler, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, please note that statements made in the course of this presentation that state the company's or management's intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results could differ in a material manner. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ in a material manner from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's SEC filings, including, but not limited to, risk factors contained in the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 3, 2010, and in the company's press release issued earlier this morning. As disclosed in our earnings release this morning, our operating results last year included an extra week of operations due to the timing of the last day of our fiscal year. As a result, the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 included 13 weeks of operations compared to the fourth quarter last year, which included 14 weeks, and fiscal year 2011 included 52 weeks of operations compared to the prior year, which included 53 weeks. On the call today, we will discuss year-over-year comparisons that include the impact of the extra week of operations. However, to provide financial results that are more comparable on a year-over-year basis, certain metrics will be provided which remove the estimated impact of the extra week. These adjusted metrics are non-GAAP financial measures. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the applicable GAAP measures on the Investors section of our website at sysco.com. Also, all comments about earnings per share refer to diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. Lastly, we ask that you reserve December 9 on your calendars for our Investor Day in New York. Additional information will be provided in the next couple of weeks. With that out of the way, I'll turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill DeLaney.
William DeLaney: Thank you, Neil, and good morning, everyone. This morning, Sysco reported record sales for both our fourth quarter and fiscal year of $10.4 billion and $39.3 billion, respectively. EPS for the quarter was $0.57, which was flat on a GAAP basis compared to the prior year. However, excluding the impact of the prior year's extra week of operations, adjusted EPS grew by 7.5% for the quarter.  For the year, EPS was $1.96 compared to $1.99 last year. Similar to the quarter, adjusted EPS grew by 4.2% for the year after excluding the impact of the prior year extra week, the current year's $36 million multiemployer pension plan charge and the year-over-year effect of certain net tax benefits.  Focusing on the fourth quarter for a moment, volume growth was positive but remains at modest levels. At the same time, food cost inflation in our product mix remained high and, in fact, was higher than each of the previous 3 quarters this year and the prior year. Thus, due in large parts to these 2 factors, we grew our gross profit dollars but once again experienced a decline in gross profit as a percentage of sales.  Turning to the fiscal year, we grew our case volume and generated nearly $40 billion of sales in a market that most industry observers believe is currently flat, resulting in about half a point of share gain. We generated $1.9 billion of operating income, produced cash flow from operations of $1.1 billion and distributed nearly $600 million in dividends to our shareholders.  In addition, we invested significant capital in our ongoing business, improved our customer retention performance and improved productivity in our operations. We're also pleased with our progress to date in better integrating our specialty Meat and Broadline operations in a manner that more cohesively addresses our customers' needs.  Turning to our multiyear business transformation initiative for a moment. On our last call, we had just recently gone live at our pilot facility in Arkansas. We were pleased with the initial results of the go-live, but as we've moved into a more of a steady-state mode, we have identified some performance issues. We plan to take additional time to further assess the new system's performance and make sure it meets our expectations before the initial wave of operating companies go live. We are evaluating the financial impacts of the delay but expect the result will be extended time and costs to complete the project. We remain firmly committed to a successful business transformation implementation, but as we've said all along, we won't roll this out until we are confident the system will perform as intended. In just a moment, Chris will provide an update on the project's impact on fiscal 2011 and our expectations for fiscal 2012.  Taking a step back and looking at the overall business landscape, for sometime now, we have characterized the current economic recovery as slow, choppy, uneven and even fragile. Our fourth quarter results and the events that played out in Washington and in the financial markets over the past 2 weeks certainly support that outlook. Nevertheless, we continue to believe that our industry will experience modest real growth over the long term and that Sysco is particularly well positioned to build upon its industry leadership position over time.  Specifically, our commitment to enhancing our service to customers, improving productivity in all parts of our business and broadening our foundation for future growth are key to Sysco's ongoing success.  In closing, I would like to thank our entire leadership team and all of our associates for their efforts and engagement over the past year. Their commitment to the success of Sysco's customers is unsurpassed in our industry.  Now I'll turn things over to Chris, so he can provide additional details on our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year.
Robert Kreidler: Thank you, Bill. Good morning, everyone. What I'd like to do first this morning is provide a brief summary of the formal GAAP results. As Neil just mentioned, fiscal 2010 was a 53-week year compared to our typical 52-week year. GAAP results include the impact of that extra week of operations last year, which means the results that I will discuss compare 13 weeks of operations in the fourth quarter of 2011 to 14 weeks in the fourth quarter of 2010 and similarly, 52 weeks of operations in fiscal 2011 to 53 weeks in fiscal 2010.  On a GAAP basis, for the fourth quarter, sales were $10.4 billion, an increase of 0.7% compared to the prior year. Gross profit declined 2.3% to $1.9 billion, and operating expenses declined 1.5% to $1.4 billion. As a result, operating income was $561 million, a decrease of 4% compared to the prior year. Net earnings were $336 million, a decrease of 0.4%, and earnings per share were $0.57, which were flat compared to the prior year.  For the full year, on a GAAP basis, sales were $39.3 billion, an increase of 5.6% compared to the prior year. Gross profit increased 3% to $7.3 billion, and operating expenses increased 5% to $5.4 billion. As a result, operating income was $1.9 billion, a decrease of 2.2% compared to the prior year. Net earnings were $1.2 billion, a decrease of 2.4%, and earnings per share were $1.96 compared to $1.99 in the prior year or a decrease of 1.5%.  As I mentioned, these year-over-year comparisons on a GAAP basis are not comparable because that extra week of operation in last year's fourth quarter impacts all the year-over-year comparisons, so what I'd like to do next is discuss our results for the quarter and the year excluding the impact of last year's extra week. That means these adjusted numbers compare 13 weeks of operations in both quarters and 52 weeks of operations in both years. This should give you a better sense for what's going on in our business and, at the same way the management team tracks and analyzes our financial results. These numbers are detailed in 2 tables we included in the earnings release that I think you will find helpful.  On an adjusted basis, for the quarter, sales increased 8.5% compared to the prior year due primarily to the impact of food cost inflation, which we estimated at 5.9% for the period. In addition, compared to adjusted sales in the prior year, sales from acquisitions increased sales by 0.9%, and changes in foreign exchange rate increased sales by 0.7%. This equates to real sales growth of 1%.  Adjusted gross profit increased 5.3% during the quarter. However, gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased 57 basis points year-over-year to 18.6% due in large part to high inflation rates and fairly stagnant industry growth during the period. In addition, while strategic pricing initiatives were also a factor, they were largely offset by the fuel surcharge benefit.  As Bill mentioned, the 5.9% inflation rate was higher than any of the 3 previous quarters this year and significantly higher than the 1.5% deflation experienced in fiscal year 2010.  Adjusted operating expenses were higher in the fourth quarter by $78 million or 6%. The increase was driven by several factors. First, salaries and related expense increased $24 million. The increase was due to higher delivery payroll costs, payroll from newly acquired companies, foreign exchange translations and sales compensation. These additional expenses were partially offset by a decline in annual incentive compensation.  Second, fuel cost increased $17 million. However, the fuel surcharge we implemented late in the third quarter was designed to mitigate this increase and did so. As a reminder, fuel surcharges are reflected in gross profit.  Third, as we've seen all year, expenses related to the company's corporate-sponsored pension plan increased $15 million. Fourth, expenses related to the company's Business Transformation Project were $12 million higher. This number represents the increase in gross project expenses, which is all project expenses, including all employees and consultants working on the project, severance costs and depreciation, without any offset or credit for any benefits from the project.  Adjusted operating income increased 3.4% in the fourth quarter. Adjusted net earnings for the fourth quarter were $23 million compared to the prior year, and adjusted earnings per share increased 7.5%.  Turning to the year-over-year comparison. Sales increased 7.7% or $2.8 billion for the year on an adjusted basis. Food cost inflation was estimated at 4.6% for the year. In addition, compared to adjusted sales in the prior year, sales from acquisitions increased sales by 0.7%, and changes in foreign exchange rate increased sales by 0.5%. This equates to real sales growth of 1.9%.  Adjusted gross profit increased 5.1% during the year, while gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased 46 basis points year-over-year to 18.6%. The decline in gross profit as a percentage of sales was due to high inflation rate, strategic pricing initiatives and fairly stagnant industry growth for the period.  Adjusted operating expenses increased $358 million or 7.1% in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010. The increase in operating expenses was primarily the result of: one, a $129 million increase in sales and related costs due to increases in delivery and sales compensation, foreign exchange and acquisitions; two, a $60 million increase in costs related to the company's corporate-sponsored pension plan; three, a $36 million charge related to the withdrawal of an operating company from an MEPP; four, a $37 million increase in fuel expense; and five, $25 million in higher gross project expenses related to the company's Business Transformation Project. As a result, adjusted operating income was essentially flat for the fiscal year. If the MEPP charge had been excluded, operating income increased 1.7%.  Adjusted net earnings for fiscal 2011 decreased $4 million or 0.3% compared to the prior year. Fiscal 2011 EPS was $1.96, which included a $0.04 negative impact from the MEPP charge and a $0.02 tax benefit. Adjusted EPS from the prior year period was $1.95, which included a $0.05 benefit from the company's IRS settlement. Excluding the MEPP charge and tax benefit in the current year and the IRS settlement gain in the prior year, adjusted EPS increased 4.2% year-over-year.  Turning to a brief update on our business transformation initiative. We have previously estimated that the incremental EPS impact from the project, which is the incremental cost of the project net of estimated benefits, for fiscal 2011 would be from $0.02 to $0.04. The actual impact for the year came in at the low end of the range at $0.02.  For the past couple of years, we've provided the estimated impact from the Business Transformation Project to our EPS using this incremental net of benefit concept. Going forward, we're going to use a different basis of presentation to give you more visibility into both the total project expenses and the underlying business performance. We will provide expenses and capitalized costs as we typically have. However, instead of providing the EPS impact of incremental expenses net of benefits as we've done in the past, we will provide gross project expenses. Now gross project expenses include all expenses related to the project, including all the employees and consultants working on the project, severance costs and depreciation without any offset or credit for any benefits from the project. They also include additional costs, such as those for our shared business services.  We're sharing the numbers this late because we want you to be able to see and track the total cost of the project, which will decline over time, as well as how the underlying business is performing. So using our new dimension for fiscal 2011 results, gross expenses related to our Business Transformation Project totaled $102 million. In addition, we capitalized $196 million related to the project. The total cash outlay during the year, which, of course, is different than expense, was $279 million, roughly in line with the guidance we've previously provided. However, as we discussed throughout this year, the nature of the work actually performed allowed us to capitalize more than we had originally anticipated.  As Bill mentioned earlier, we have experienced some delays on our rollout schedule for the project. As we discussed in the third quarter, we extended our testing phase by about 3 months to ensure a successful go-live in Arkansas, which we achieved. Now that we are close to a steady-state environment in Arkansas, we have identified some performance issues. We plan to take some additional time, probably as much as 3 months, to assess and enhance the system's performance.  Looking forward, we now believe it's more prudent to roll out only one of the wave 1 companies initially, to ensure we can operate successfully in multiple locations, and then we'll roll out through the rest of wave 1. That will probably extend the timeline another 3 months or so. As a result, we are probably 6 to 12 months behind. These delays will increase the total cost of the project. We're in the process of reevaluating the long-term costs, benefits and timing of the project and expect to provide updated guidance at our Investor Day in December. For fiscal 2012, we expect gross project expenses to total approximately $280 million to $300 million. In addition, we expect to capitalize approximately $100 million to $120 million related to our Business Transformation Project.  So if you look back at 2009, we reported EPS of $1.77. Our gross business transformation expenses in that year were $0.04 per share, so adjusted EPS without these gross project expenses would have been $1.81. In fiscal 2010, we reported adjusted EPS of $1.90, excluding the extra week of operations and the IRS gain. Our gross business transformation expenses that year were $0.09 per share, so adjusted EPS without these expenses would have been $1.99.  In fiscal year 2011, we've just reported adjusted EPS of $1.98, excluding the MEPP and tax benefit. Gross business transformation expenses were $0.11 per share, so adjusted EPS without these expenses would have been $2.09. So the way we look at the underlying business performance over the last 3 fiscal years, EPS on an adjusted basis excluding the costs related to our Business Transformation Project has grown from $1.81 to $1.99 to $2.09. This is during one of the worst business climates any of us have ever experienced.  While we've indicated our business transformation expense will be higher in fiscal 2012 by between $0.18 and $0.20 per share, we believe we will continue to grow our underlying earnings excluding these gross project costs. Going forward, we'll continue to provide our results with and without gross project expenses so that you will be able to see that progress. We remain firmly committed to a successful business transformation implementation, and we continue to believe that it will provide significant benefits to our customers and our business.  Turning to cash flow. Cash flow from operations for the fiscal year was $1.1 billion, reflecting IRS settlement payments totaling $212 million. In fiscal 2010, cash flow from operations was $885 million and was net of IRS payments totaling $528 million and an extra pension contribution payment of $140 million. We have now paid the majority of the total IRS settlement amount, and we'll pay the final $212 million in this fiscal year 2012.  Capital expenditures totaled $182 million for the fourth quarter and $636 million for the year. Spending for the year included investments in technology, including our business transformation initiative, fleet replacement, the renovation of our shared services facility and replacement or expansion of facilities in Pennsylvania, California and Central Texas.  Looking ahead into next year, there are several important items that we want you to keep in mind as you think about fiscal 2012. During fiscal 2011, we recorded $28 million in COLI [Corporate Owned Life Insurance] gains. We haven't talked about COLI much this year because the year-over-year variances have been immaterial. Going forward, we do not expect to record any substantial gains or losses related to COLI as a result of changes we made during the fourth quarter and the underlying investments. While there will be a notable year-over-year COLI variance in fiscal 2012 of $28 million, we're pleased to be able to remove this volatility from our financial results going forward.  In addition, we are also providing a few guidance metrics for the year ahead. First, we expect capital spending for fiscal 2012 to be in the range of $750 million to $800 million as we continue to invest in our business. This projection includes $100 million to $120 million related to business transformation capital spending, as well as capital related to a number of facility expansions and new facilities in Southern California, Boston, Long Island and our third RDC.  We expect pension expense for the year, as measured on June 30, to be approximately $25 million lower than fiscal 2011. This decrease is primarily due to improved performance of our planned assets during the year.  Third, we expect fuel expense, which impacts operating expense, to be approximately $35 million to $45 million higher year-over-year, but we expect that increase to be substantially mitigated by fuel surcharges.  And finally, we expect share buybacks to increase next year to offset dilution from option exercises but expect the diluted shares in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 to be similar to diluted shares in the first quarter of fiscal 2011.  In closing, while the business environment in fiscal 2011 was challenging, our operating companies did a great job of managing through those challenges with a strong focus on serving our customers, growing cases, managing costs and improving productivity. And although the macroeconomic outlook remains uncertain, we are confident that our strong balance sheet, industry leadership position and solid strategy for the future provide us the resources and capabilities to drive continued success. With that, operator, we will now take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question today from Meredith Adler with Barclays Capital.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: I'd like to just ask a couple of -- maybe these are sort of housekeeping questions. Sales got a benefit from fuel surcharges. How much of a benefit was that?
William DeLaney: Meredith, for whatever reason, you were breaking up. This is Bill. Could you just repeat that?
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: Sure. I'm just wondering how much benefit to sales came from the fuel surcharges as a percentage of growth?
William DeLaney: I wouldn't say it was overly significant to the sales line. I think as Chris pointed out, it helped to defray our fuel expense in terms of the delta there, but I wouldn't say it was a big part of the sales percentage.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: And can you talk a little bit more about the performance issues you're seeing at the Business Transformation Process?
William DeLaney: Sure. Essentially, I would say to you that we, like I said in my prepared comments, we got into the pilot site in Arkansas in April. As Chris pointed out, we did do some additional testing, so we're probably 3 months delayed getting into that. And as we got into the conversion weekend, as you can appreciate, there's always a lot of things that go on in those weekends, but we got through it. We delivered groceries. We've ordered product, and we're taking care of our customers. As time went on, it became clear that we were still having issues with the ease of taking orders, the ease of processing orders, both on the buy and the sell side. We have some speed issues from a performance standpoint in terms of how long it takes for the customer or for the salesperson to put an order in. We've also had some issues with reports, that type of thing. So obviously, as we went into this initiative, Meredith, we've cautioned ourselves and everyone that we talk to to be prepared for the unexpected. And so while we were generally prepared for some challenges, these were things that we couldn't really anticipate until we got into the pilot. So those are examples, kind of high-level examples of some things we're running into. And where we are right now is we're very focused on a combination, really, of a couple of things. One is, pardon the expression, we're fixing those things, and so to the extent that they were designed and that they are working close to how they're supposed to work, we're attempting to make them work better and more efficiently for our customers and for our sales people and for all of our associates. To the extent that we've tripped into some design issues or flaws, we're going back, and relooking at that. And then to the side, there were several, what we call, enhancements or additional features that were never targeted to go into Arkansas being a pilot, and we're also working on those. And we would hope to have all that worked into the Arkansas company here as we get into November and early December.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: I mean, obviously, you had some issues, and you need to fix them. But would it be fair to say that the environment has turned out to be much more challenging than you thought it would be at this point in time and that it just is prudent to slow down this project because the expenses are very high? I mean, if you kept ahead, the gross margin being this weak, aren't you -- weren't you running the risk of pretty weak earnings overall?
William DeLaney: Well, I don't think it's gotten to that point. What I would say to you is basically what I said in my prepared comments, which is we need this system to work better before we roll it out to additional companies. And that's really what our focus is, which is to get it working as well as it needs to work. That's why you do a pilot, and that's where we're at. I don't think -- what you see Chris trying to do here in his comments is we're going to do as diligent an effort as we can as we go forward to separate for you how the core business is running and then what the project is costing us at any point in time. So clearly, we have to be aware of the project cost and sensitive to that. But at this point, I wouldn't say we're at a point where the expenses of the project are that big of a concern. We just want to roll it out in a way that our operating companies will embrace it and engage appropriately and that it serves our customers the way it's designed to.
Robert Kreidler: Meredith, I'll jump in also. I mean, just taking on your question. I mean, it's a classic issue of "do you slow down a long-term strategic project because the short-term expense implications are too high?" And clearly, the answer we're going to give you is no. It is a very important strategic project to us. We're tripping over some of the steps that, frankly, we expected would be there eventually. You just don't know where they're going to come from, but you know they're going to come out of the woodwork once you turn the thing on. And we'll work through those, and we'll work through the expense related to any delays. But we're nowhere near a point where we would say, "we should slow this thing down because it's costing us in the short term in a difficult operating environment".
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: Great. That's a good way of thinking of it in my view. And then just finally, are there any benefits at this point in time to the Business Transformation Process?
Robert Kreidler: Yes. Look, the way we measure benefits, which you've got to find some science to measure benefits, and so the team established some science behind it, the way we measure benefits. Yes, there are benefits, what we call the hard dollar benefits. And to do that, you basically start with a point in time and you measure your headcount in the affected areas, those areas where you're going to be making some fairly dramatic changes, and then you track the headcount reductions over time, and that's how you measure benefits. Well, we have some of those benefits. But the struggle is some of those benefits come from attrition, as well as other means, and you may get some attrition before you're expecting it, and you just choose not to replace those people. So you're getting some of that benefit early. That doesn't necessarily mean it's going to stick because the system is only in Arkansas right now. So anything we have right now is one, small and two, it's going to fluctuate because of the way we're measuring it. The real proof will be, frankly, as we start to roll this thing out and we start to look at the overall expense reduction out in the field and the affected areas, that's where we're going to have the hard dollar benefits as we continue to talk about those. And that's going to be a little while.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: And benefits in terms of revenues?
Robert Kreidler: Nothing that we could even begin to measure, no.
William DeLaney: Again, Meredith, to take you back to the business case, we've been really clear on this. There's a hard dollar business case here that's driven mostly by headcount reduction, I mean, the administrative side of the business and by leveraging our headcount more effectively as we grow the business and sales. So Arkansas is a pilot, and at this point, we have our hands full in Arkansas and in the shared business center essentially getting through this transition. So we're not really -- we never were really looking for significant benefits at this stage of the project in Arkansas. That's why we call it a pilot. The benefits Chris was alluding to are some more structural things that we've done to prepare in terms of overall headcount, management-wise, and organizationally heading into this transition.
Operator: Next, we'll hear from Neil Currie with Dahlman Rose.
Neil Currie: I just wanted to, first of all, talk about the inflation trend. Obviously, inflation was a little higher than it was in the third quarter, but you have more of a struggle passing it through than you have in the third quarter. So I was wondering what changed so meaningfully to put that much pressure on your gross margin compared to the third quarter, which looked as if it was very much an improving trend?
William DeLaney: I'll take a shot at that, Neil. Essentially, you're right. I mean, what we've seen is increasing levels of inflation in our cost of goods as the year's gone along, and it was at least a point higher, I think, in the fourth quarter versus the third. In terms of the reasons for that, a lot of the same categories that have been high all year, the Meat, the Dairy, the Seafood, they've remained high, and some other categories that represent a significant amount of our purchases, Canned & Dry, comes to mind, have also begun to absorb higher increases in our purchasing costs over the last quarter or 2. So that's pretty much been the consistent trend. In terms of why we struggled more in the fourth quarter versus the third, that's a difficult thing to answer in terms of specifics. I would tell you that as inflation goes up, it is harder and harder to pass that along as you can appreciate. And I would also tell you that we see all the data out there that comes with the economy and some of the restaurant surveys and that type of thing, but we felt, we certainly felt, our people felt that after Mother's Day, the business slowed down a little bit, flattened out some in May, maybe picked up in June, hard to tell depending on who you're talking to and what sources you read. But I would say the market environment itself got a little tougher here as the quarter went along.
Neil Currie: Okay. And without a crystal ball, it must be hard, but do you have a view on when inflation may peak?
William DeLaney: Well, we've got a crystal ball. It actually just doesn't work. And it's hard to tell. What I would tell you is it doesn't appear to be leveling out. As we sit here today, everything you read and feel is that it's probably going to be with us here for the foreseeable future. We'll have to communicate that with each quarter, that type of thing. But looking out the next couple of quarters, I certainly expect it to stay relatively high.
Neil Currie: Okay. And looking at your 2-year real -- your real sales growth trends, it actually looked a pretty good quarter. You saw some continued improvement in the 2-year number. Did you say earlier that through the quarter, that sales moderated and then improved towards the end of the quarter? July was better than June, is that right? Did I hear you say that?
Robert Kreidler: No, we actually didn't say that. Yes, I think what you're referring to is the 2-year year-over-year-over-year is actually fairly good on a real basis, and I don't think we actually looked at that number in the last couple of days, but you're probably right. Despite the fact that, as Bill said, the industry is very stagnant right now, the calculations that we've done using external sources says we actually grew our share in here during the course of the year, we grew our share by another half point, which we manage to do consistently. So we continue to find growth, even though the market is not helping us.
William DeLaney: Yes, I think -- I went back and looked at some of that as well. If you looked at the 4 quarters for the year, our best quarter for the real growth was the first quarter. I don't know. I think things may have felt a little bit better at that point in time, but there's some math in that number, too. We were comparing off of a very weak time from the year before. So when you look at this thing over the last 4 or 5 quarters, it really is hard to draw a conclusion from one quarter to the next in terms of the divine growth.
Neil Currie: But intra-quarter, did you see -- what was the sales trend in the fourth quarter? How did that progress?
William DeLaney: It's a tough quarter as you saw in terms of our numbers. All I can tell you is what -- and this is anecdotal. And then what we all read is that we felt like we started to flatten out a little bit here in May compared to April. And others are saying, there's some surveys out there that talk about the restaurant business numbers improving somewhat in June. I don't know that we experienced that in June. So I would say it's soft in beginning of May and stayed that way, at least from our perspective, through the end of the quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Wolf with BB&T Capital Markets.
Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets: I wanted to circle back and kind of follow up on Meredith's question on the business transformation costs. I just want to make sure I understand, number one, if the gross cost was $0.11 and the net was $0.02, that's a $0.09 per share differential. But I'm pretty sure it wasn't what you guys would call benefits from the project, so could you kind of just tell us what is in most of that $0.09? Is it really the kind of the accounting that's been -- you talked about in the Q that is allowing you to capitalize more of the costs and things like that?
Robert Kreidler: No. And actually, I'm glad you asked the question because you're tripping over, frankly, the reason we're changing the method in which we report this. I got to take you back in history. We reported this from the beginning as incremental cost to the company net-of-benefits. So let me take first the incremental. That meant only the additional costs to the company, so all these people internally, and we have a large number of people that are dedicated to this project that were Sysco employees that we transferred into the project, we did not count as an additional expense. So when we added up the expenses, it wasn't $100 million in that particular way of accounting for it, and then we've netted benefits against that, and you're right, the benefits were not $0.09 a share. So that's where we got to our estimate, most recent estimate of $0.02 to $0.04 on an incremental-net-of-benefits basis. The problem with that is it doesn't give you full visibility to the actual cost of the project. So we just pushed that away. We said, "Look, we're just going to disclose everything". So it’s all categories, all functions that are directly related to our Business Transformation Project, that's the $102 million that you're seeing today. I'm not netting the benefit to get that. As I said to Meredith earlier, they're not very large at this point in time.
Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets: Okay, all right. So I need to look -- what was the fiscal '10 gross spend, so we can look at the net number there?
Robert Kreidler: Fiscal '10 gross spend on a per share basis...
Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets: Well, that's the $0.09?
Robert Kreidler: Yes, that's the $0.09. You got to go back to $0.09. Yes, $0.09. And again, Andy, what we're trying to do in that is take you backwards so that you got the same basis that we're reporting now. You've got it for 2009. You got it for 2010.
William DeLaney: That's the gross expense, not the gross spend per se.
Robert Kreidler: That's right. That's the gross expense. It doesn't really apply to cash.
Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets: Got it, yes. And Bill, as you're talking about slowing things down on functionality, I mean, it's kind of normal for IT to have that. But as you talk about just things like order entry, for example, is it -- the issue is more around the employees needing to get familiar with what they're doing and a new way of doing things and being trained, or is it more kind of substantive that you feel that maybe the pages they're looking at on the computer or whatever actually need to be redesigned? Or are you still -- or is it somewhere in between? I'm trying to figure out if the actual heart of the programming is something that is not performing, or is it more around sort of normal things in IT?
William DeLaney: I get it. That's a good question, Andy. So I would say, look, there's always opportunities, I think, to improve how we train and prepare people for these changes and conversions and our change in [indiscernible] process. We felt we did a pretty good job there, and I think if that was the only issue we had, we probably wouldn't be having a delay right now. So there's always issues like that. Some of it's screens. I think to give you an illustration of an example, I guess, of what it would be is we built this thing. And obviously, keep in mind that what we -- the whole mantra for this thing is we're trying to build a platform here that will help us be more productive in the selling exercise and help our customers be more productive as well and have the experience be more positive experience. So as we went down that road and built in some of these enhancements, what's turned out to happen is in certain instances, those have worked or most of them have worked, but there's been residual effects, say, on processing time or on the ability for the MA or the account exec to see the orders as well as they'd like or maybe to modify the order, those types of things. So it's kind of a cause-and-effect thing. We did this to enhance it, but there is a side effect that we could have anticipated, so we got into the pilot, and so we're working through that. But there's enough of that that we need to slow down here and address it.
Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets: That flavor is helpful. And just lastly, as it -- you've been talking previously about acquisition pipeline getting a little better. And does this delay in the ERP and business transformation, would that affect that, or do you think that's something you could kind of carve out and do some acquisitions, either minor or major regardless?
Robert Kreidler: No. The way we think about acquisitions, there's the kind of the small step we do every chance we get and that anything going on with our ERP project wouldn't affect that at all. We continue to do those. I think we grew sales last year. The amount of deals we closed last year represented a little over 1% of sales. We're reporting about 0.9% impact in the fourth quarter. So we're going to continue to do those without regard to the timing and sequencing and all that from the business transformation. When you start to talk about larger transactions that would affect our Broadline company, we are cautious about that. We've talked about that before. This is a very important strategic objective for us, this business transformation. We're not going to take risks and screw it up, and so we're being very careful that anything we do would not get in the way of that rollout, and that will continue to be the case as long as necessary.
William DeLaney: I think just to amplify that, Andy, we've been real clear on this. We would not take on a major acquisition that we felt going into it would significantly impact our core business in the near term as we're going through this 2012. So I guess to put my color on it, to the extent that we've got a delay here, that will extend that period for a little bit.
Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets: Great. I really appreciate the added insight and clarity into the business.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC: A couple of things. When is the first wave now scheduled that you guys think to be completed with the SAP rollout?
William DeLaney: We don't have a point estimate for that, John, at this point. Where we're at right now in order is we're very focused on Arkansas and the shared business center and getting that up to, as I said earlier, to where it's working the way we designed it to work or at least very, very close to how we designed it to work, and secondly, to get our enhancements in as well as the fixes that we've tripped over here going through this pilot. So those are the 2 priorities, getting Arkansas and SBS working and getting the fixes and the enhancements in. We hope to be in a position to have accomplished a good part of that by the end of November, early December. And then right now, our plan would be to go to one site. You could almost call it a second pilot, John, at some point after the first of the year. And the whole goal of that site would be strictly to see that this system can support multiple, or in this case 2 operating companies. And if all goes well there, then we'll come up with a revised schedule for the remainder of wave 1.
Robert Kreidler: And John, just a little more color. To the extent we can when we get together in December, we'll give you additional color. To the extent we have at that point in time, we'll give you everything we know.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC: Because you do think you will get to a point where all of the kinks are worked out, so you can go fairly quickly at the subsequent waves that there will not have to be learnings, new learnings with each wave, or do you think there will be?
Robert Kreidler: Look, it's the good news/bad news of having 85 Broadline operating companies that eventually, we're going convert. While they're all a little bit different, what they do out there is generally the same. And so I'm not going to say that what happens in Arkansas is exactly the same thing is what happens in Dallas is what happens in L.A. But the underlying business processes are generally the same. And so going to one and working out the majority of the kinks makes it much more probable that number 2 and number 3 will work just fine. The reason that, as Bill said and I've amplified also, that we've decided we're going to one more operating company next is we actually want to nail the fact that we can do this, that it's up and running and works just properly at multiple operating companies. That's why we're going to take that added step in there. We know it's going to cost us a little more time, but that's why we're going to do it. But there's nothing that we've seen that tells us that this thing is not going to work. These are problems. They can be fixed. They all have solutions. It's just a matter of getting the solutions implemented and tested and rolled. And I'm just going to keep coming back to the same statement. We don't want to roll this thing before it's ready because a problem in Arkansas, while it's a real problem for Arkansas, does not disrupt our business. What we can't afford to have is a problem when we've rolled it out before the operating companies, and we're just not going to take that risk.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC: As a follow-up to that, if you think about, and maybe it's too early to get your arms around this, but when you think about the ultimate benefit, has that changed at all? And then when you think about -- you guys have sort of laid out how this would roll through the P&L, and there was a point at which, I think it was 2013, but a point at which where the benefits would begin to ramp. Is that all basically in place just later? So I guess 2 related questions. But can you get your arms around that yet, or it's too early?
Robert Kreidler: Well, let me tell you what we know. Again, we're trying to be as full disclosure as we can. One, do we still believe in the benefits of the project? Absolutely, we do. Two, is it fair to say that those benefits are probably delayed to the extent that the project is delayed? Yes. And the third point is do we have a time frame for those yet? And we don't. That was my comment. We're reevaluating based upon everything we're learning in Arkansas. We're reevaluating the long-term costs and the benefits and the timing of that. And again, to the extent we can, we'll give you more insight into that in December.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC: But the magnitude of the benefits, whatever you thought would exist in whenever, 2015 or '16, is it too early to tell whether that magnitude has changed?
Robert Kreidler: Yes, we don't sit -- as we sit here today, we don't feel there's a significant difference in the magnitude of the benefits. Now the timing of the benefits, of course, will change. But there's nothing that causes us to believe that we can't get the benefits that we set out to achieve.
William DeLaney: And John, I would just add to that. When we went into this thing, we were talking about a business case, which I took you through earlier. But we're also talking about a transformational case here, which we've chosen not to quantify because, frankly, it's impossible to quantify because you have to compare it to something that you didn't know what it's going to be. So if anything, look, this is a little frustrating for everybody, but we knew these things are going to happen at some point in the project. But in terms of where we are and in terms of our commitment to it, the only thing I wish, I just wish we had started this a year or 2 earlier because the marketplace we're in today requires us to be much more nimble and requires us to be even more customer-focused and engaged than what we've been historically. And that is the transformational case of this work. So we're very, very committed to it.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC: And then one final thing on inflation. How do you get your arms around elasticities and knowing whether taking pricing will -- it would seem to me like you could take more pricing than you have. Is there a way to get more comfortable with that and get a better sense of elasticity on the volume side, so you can take pricing more quickly?
William DeLaney: Well, to be honest with you, and I think you know this, John, we don't talk a lot about elasticity. We're sitting on a table and certainly, our opcos don't talk a lot about elasticity. Where we're at today, we're in a market right now that isn't growing. We're taking share, but we've got to make an investment to take share. So I would tell you my view on this thing is that for the foreseeable future, it's about gross profit dollar growth and it's about cost per case. And if we continue to grow the gross profit dollars, we need to do somewhat better than what we did here this past quarter, then we'll be fine. We've got to manage the cost per case, and it's very difficult right now to determine how much of that gross profit dollar growth is going to come from inflation, come from case growth, come from margin mitigation, whatever you want to call it. And that's the charge that we put out on our operating company presidents and their management teams and probably their people, their sales managers and their marketing associates, as well as the account execs. We're all in this together here, and we're just trying to make good decisions on a day-in-and-day-out basis at the customer level to strike the right balance between case growth, pricing and margin. And so again, where I come out of this thing is we're very locked in right now on our gross profit dollar growth and managing our cost per case.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC: But you seem as if you don't really want cases to go negative, meaning if you took more -- if you got more price pass-through, say gross was down 15, 20 basis points, but case growth went negative, that would be, in your mind, a worse outcome, even if it had the same gross profit dollar performance, a worst outcome than where we are today. Is that fair?
William DeLaney: Well, it's a little bit of a loaded question. I think what I'm saying to you is, first of all, we've been very focused this past year and will continue to be on improving our customer retention performance. It's good. It needs to be great. And so that ties in your cases, that type of thing. So I would say yes. I mean, look, it's a very competitive world out there today, and we've rolled up our sleeves, and we're grinding out there with everybody else, but not if the cost of doing things that we think are shortsighted or unintelligent. So I wouldn't say -- it just depends on the situation in terms of that trade off. But certainly, long term, our DNA and our whole mode of operating is to grow the business. But we think we're making intelligent decisions out there. It's just from quarter-to-quarter, you are going to see some volatility.
Operator: Next, we'll hear from Mark Wiltamuth with Morgan Stanley.
Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley: I wanted to ask a little more about the nature of the inflation. You had hinted like the last quarter that there might be a broadening of inflation into some other areas beyond really the Meat and Dairy and Seafood. Can you talk about that a little bit? And as we are getting into the first and second quarter where you lapped the big gross margin declines last year, is it that you have really already taken those body blows in Meats and now we shouldn't see as big margin declines?
Robert Kreidler: On the first part of your question, Mark, we are seeing broader inflation, and by that, I mean across more categories. It's difficult the way we define the impact from inflation. We basically look at which categories saw the most significant increase in terms of our product mix and our basket of goods, and we define those as the high-inflation categories. And when we talked about how much of our gross margin decline is attributable to inflation, we point at those categories, and all the rest kind of balance out, some are up, some are down. This quarter was not the case. We looked at the high-inflation categories, and then you looked at all the rest, and they were still up. And so we've got inflation across a broader spectrum, not nearly as high as the ones we're calling out but across a broader spectrum. So that's the first answer to your question. Second, looking ahead is very, very difficult for us to do. On the one hand, you'd like to say, "It's very rare for us to go year-over-year with a decline in gross margins". At the same time, we're looking at inflation, and as Bill said earlier, "We don't have -- well, our crystal ball apparently is not working very well". We can't tell you what's going to happen to the inflation rate. All we know is what we're seeing right now is it's not going back down. And so that's going to play into the next quarter, quarter 1, 2 and 3.
Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley: Okay. And maybe just talk a little more of what you're seeing anecdotally out there. The Knapp-Track data, I guess, turned negative in late July, and are you getting any feedback from the operators out there, what they're hearing after the stock market correction? Has there been any change in restaurant demand?
William DeLaney: Well, it's only been a couple of weeks, and I would say it's probably too early to make that call. Obviously, we're concerned about it, but the other thing I would say is "I think, to some extent, this market is reacting to things that our customers and the consumer and our people have already experienced over the last year, which is this choppiness of the recovery. And again, I'm not an economist or politician or anything, but I think what you're seeing in the market is just a lot of uncertainty from day to day. There's not going to be any great solutions coming in the short term, and I think the market is kind of focused on that, as well as some things beyond the U.S. So we're concerned about what's going on in the market, but I think we need to take a few weeks and just see how this plays out because I don't know that in terms of the world we work in that all that much has changed.
Operator: You have a question from Greg Badishkanian with Citi.
Gregory Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc: So I guess over the last 2 weeks or so, it really doesn't sound like it's changed all that too much for you, even with the stock market volatility?
William DeLaney: Well, we don't typically comment, Greg, on interim quarter results. I'm trying to paint you a picture here where, so far, I think it's just too early to make that call.
Gregory Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc: Right, right. Okay, that's helpful. And just in terms of gross margins sort of the impacts like this quarter, what was the biggest impact? Was it the high-inflation certain categories, certain customer, product mix, changes or just discounting by either you or your competitors? Was there one thing that was the biggest factor?
William DeLaney: I think it just goes on. It's more and more difficult to attribute it to any one factor. What we're trying to articulate today is -- Chris talked about the strategic price initiatives. There were still some of that, the fuel surcharge offset, most of that if not all of it. I think my message to you today is it's 2 things. One is the environment where the continuing and now the acceleration of inflation does make it difficult, as well as the market environment, where essentially, you're flat to no-growth type of low growth environment. It just makes it tougher, and everyone is out there competing from our customer to the suppliers to ourselves and our competition. So I think part of it is the environment that is continuing to really not improve a whole lot. It's better than it was 2 years ago, but it's not an easy environment to operate in. And then second, there's areas where we just need to execute better, and I touched on those earlier. We need to do a little better job growing our gross profit dollars relative to our expectations, and we need to manage our cost per case better. And those are the things we're very focused on here as we start the new year.
Operator: Our final question will come from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.
Amod Gautam - JP Morgan Chase & Co: It's Amod Gautam on for John. The past couple of quarters, you guys provided a breakout in terms of the gross margin impact between strategic pricing and commodity inflation. I was wondering if you could do that for the latest quarter?
Robert Kreidler: We really didn't break it out for the quarter. And I'll be honest. The reason we didn't is because the inflation broadened so much that the way we were coming up with the numbers, we didn't have as much confidence in. As we've said in the script, inflation was a significant impact of it, and then the strategic pricing initiatives were still there, but they were offset by the fuel surcharge. So that's the best breakdown we can give you. For the year, we're basically -- I think the numbers add up to about 2/3 of it is what we would call kind of inflation and the related issues around that, and about 1/3 of it would've been strategic pricing initiatives for the year, which is, I believe, 46, 47 basis points.
Amod Gautam - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Okay, that's helpful. And just in terms of building off of that, I mean, the strategic pricing initiatives, if you could just give some qualitative color about how those have played out relative to what your expectations were when you implemented them? And then second to that is how much longer you expect the pricing initiatives to continue to impact year-on-year margins.
Robert Kreidler: Yes, I think we've said in prior quarters we continue to get the benefit that we sought from strategic pricing initiatives, which is we're growing cases in the specific categories that we targeted there. We also acknowledged that if anything, it's going to take longer to get the case growth that we originally had set out to achieve. Whatever estimate we did originally, it's just going to take us longer to get that, so you're going to still see the impact in our numbers. At some point, there will be a lapping effect to that. I'm not going to try to predict that for you here, but it's still in our numbers. There will be a lapping impact that will make it less of an issue, and we certainly aren't sitting here today designing any new strategic pricing initiatives that we put in place quickly. So hopefully, we'll continue to get the benefit as we go forward.
Operator: Thank you. That will conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and have a nice day.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Sysco Reports Third Quarter Fiscal 2011 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Neil Russell. Please go ahead, sir.
Neil Russell: Thank you, Rochelle, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for Sysco's third quarter 2011 conference call. On today's call, you will hear from Bill DeLaney, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Kreidler, our Chief Financial Officer.  Before we begin, please note that statements made in the course of this presentation that state the company's or management's intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results could differ in a material manner. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ in a material manner from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's SEC filings, including, but not limited to, risk factors contained in the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 3, 2010 and in the company's press release issued earlier this morning.  On the call today, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the applicable GAAP measures on our Investor Relations website at sysco.com. Also, all comments about earnings per share refer to diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted.  With that out of the way, I'll turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill DeLaney.
William DeLaney: Thank you, Neil, and good morning, everyone. This morning, Sysco reported third quarter sales of $9.8 billion, operating income of $427 million and EPS of $0.44 per share. Sales grew more than 9% over the prior year, due mainly to higher prices and increased case volume. Higher prices were driven by an increase in our product costs of just over 5% compared to last year. Gross margin trends also improved compared to the first half of the year.  Operating expenses increased year-over-year, due in large part to a $36 million charge related to the withdrawal of one of our operating companies from a multi-employer pension plan [MEPP], higher fuel prices and higher pension expense. Earnings per share on a GAAP basis increased nearly 5% compared to last year's third quarter. However, excluding the multi-employer pension charge and a one-time tax benefit that Chris will discuss in a few minutes, adjusted EPS increased nearly 10%.  Amidst a slow industry recovery, our associates did a very good job supporting our customers while producing record third quarter results for Sysco. These results reflect both improved execution by our operating companies in a modestly improving market environment. While the foodservice industry and overall economy continue to recover slowly, we and our customers have also been faced with the dual challenges of product inflation and rising fuel costs. While not yet appearing to a significantly dampened consumer demand, these unfavorable economic factors do create ripple effects throughout our business that may continue to create choppiness in our near term results.  With that said, I want to emphasize our commitment to successfully executing Sysco's long-term strategy. The majority of our resources and activities remain centered on optimizing our core business. Our recent results reflects steady progress on this front. Specifically, we've had success in improving our customer retention, and we have also increased contract sales this year in both our Broadline and SYGMA units.  One of the most critical aspects of optimizing our core business is successfully carrying out our Business Transformation Project. We have made good progress during the last few months, and we recently achieved a major milestone by going live at our pilot facility in Arkansas. Just reaching the point where we were comfortable going live was a huge accomplishment. However, we're even more pleased that the implementation was such a success. Implementations like this rarely, if ever, go off without a hitch, but the team was ready for the issues that did arise, and they worked quickly and effectively to find solutions.  So it's an appropriate time to pause for a moment and acknowledge all those on the team who have been working so diligently and effectively to ensure that this project is a success. We began this journey 2.5 years ago, and an extraordinary amount of work has gone into the project thus far. While there remains a great deal of work ahead of us, I'm very proud of the team's efforts and appreciative of their dedication.  Now that the pilot side is live, our plan is to take some time and evaluate the new system's performance. We will reassess our rollout plan in light of everything we learn, make necessary adjustments and then move forward with implementing the business transformation initiative at our first wave of operating companies.  In addition to optimizing our core business, we're also committed to looking for acquisition opportunities, both in and beyond the core. We're doing this mainly through building a pipeline of high-quality potential domestic acquisitions and also by looking at adjacencies in new geographies. We continue to make progress in this area, and Chris will update you on our recent transactions in a few moments. We believe that all of these efforts strengthen our strong commitment to supporting the successful growth of our customers. The investments we are making in our business are meaningful both in terms of their inherent financial commitment as well as the benefits we expect them to produce. As the industry continues to recover, I am confident that we are taking the right steps to secure a strong future for Sysco.  Now I'll turn things over to Chris, so he can provide additional details on our financial results for the third quarter.
Robert Kreidler: Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter, sales were $9.8 billion, or an increase of 9.1% compared to the prior year, driven mainly by increased prices and case volume. Impacting prices was food cost and inflation. We estimate it to be 5.1% for the period. In addition, acquisitions within the last 12 months increased sales by 0.6%, and changes in the foreign exchange rates increased sales by 0.6%. We mentioned the last quarter a holiday shift that impacted the second and third quarters. As a brief reminder, last year's third quarter included the New Year holiday, which is one of our low-volume holidays, while this year's third quarter did not. We estimate that our reported increase in sales year-over-year in the third quarter would've been about 70 basis points lower on a comparable, holiday-adjusted basis. Taking the holiday shift into consideration, we estimate real sales growth, which is sales growth adjusted for the impact of inflation, acquisitions and foreign exchange rates, to have been 2.1% in the third quarter and is an improvement over the second quarter. Gross margin increased 7.6%, or $127 million, during the quarter, while gross margin as a percentage of sales declined 27 basis points year-over-year to 18.6%. Strategic pricing initiatives continue to impact margins but to a lesser extent than in previous quarters, with the magnitude of the impact estimated to be about 10 basis points this quarter, down from 15 basis points last quarter. So if you've been following this issue, the impact has declined each quarter as benefits from the program continued to build. We believe this confirms our view that these strategic pricing initiatives will increase our market share and grow our gross profit dollars over the long term.  The remainder of the impact to gross margin was largely driven by high inflation, although to a lesser extent than we've seen over the last 2 quarters because of better execution. As I just mentioned, inflation, as measured by the estimated change in Sysco's product costs, was 5.1% during the third quarter, which was an increase over the 4.5% reported during the second quarter of this year and a significant upswing from the 0.8% deflation reported last year. The inflation we experienced this quarter was mainly driven by increases in the Meat, Seafood and Canned & Dry categories. While we experienced increases in many of our other product categories, these 3 represent about 40% of our sales and, therefore, had a larger impact due to the volume of business in those categories.  While you've heard us talk about Meat inflation for some time now, the most significant change we saw in category inflation this quarter was driven by the severe cold weather that impacted crops in major growing regions, such as Florida and Mexico. While gross margin as a percent of sales was down year-over-year in the third quarter, once again, gross margin dollars and gross margin on a per-case basis increased. The latter is a clear indication that we are passing through inflation.  Additionally, gross margin dollars per stop, which is, generally speaking, one of the most significant metrics we use to manage the business, also increased. The trend for this metric has been steadily improving for us over the last 5 quarters. Also of note, Broadline sales accelerated in the third quarter, and so we didn't have a segment mix impact to gross margin as we did in the first half of the year.  Before we leave the subject of gross margins, I wanted to discuss fuel costs for a moment. Fuel costs have consistently increased throughout this fiscal year, and in the third quarter, our average fuel price was up nearly 30% year-over-year. In response to this dramatic and sustained increase in fuel cost, we made the decision in March to implement a fuel surcharge in the street side of our business. The vast majority of our contract sales already have fuel surcharges built in. As a reminder, fuel surcharges are recorded in sales and, therefore, impact gross margin. Due to the timing of adding the surcharge, the impact was not significant during the third quarter, but we expect surcharges to offset a substantial portion of our projected fuel increase in the fourth quarter. Turning to operating expenses, we saw an increase during the quarter of 10.6%, or $132 million. As we mentioned in our press release this morning, one of the most significant drivers of the increase was a $36 million charge related to the withdrawal of one of our operating companies from a multi-employer pension plan, or MEPP. Without this charge, operating expense would've increased 7.7% and operating income would've increased 7.3% versus the 1.1% decline we reported on a GAAP basis.  For those of you who may not be familiar with the MEPPs, they are essentially pooled pension plans that are union-sponsored. Each plan is funded by more than one employer, and each employer funds the plan according to its Collective Bargaining Agreement. If one of the employers in the plan is unable to meet its obligations, the others may be required to make up the difference. This is the second time this fiscal year that we've been able to withdraw from an MEPP.  From a strategic perspective, withdrawal from these plans reduces the long term financial risk that is inherent in multi-employer arrangements. At the same time, we can continue to provide competitive benefits by moving the impacted employees into our corporate-sponsored pension plan.  Other drivers of the increase in operating expense included higher payroll, pension and fuel expense. Payroll costs increased $36 million for the period. Higher case volume and pay rates drove some of the increases, and similar to last quarter, increased gross margin drove higher sales compensation. However, total headcount was down about 1% compared to the prior year, so we're pleased with the way our operators are managing in this area. Also similar to the last 2 quarters, pension expense increased $15 million. Lastly, fuel expense increased $14 million in the quarter. We currently anticipate the increase in fuel expense in the fourth quarter to be of a similar magnitude. Income tax expense during the quarter decreased $9 million, or 5.6%. This equated to a tax rate of 36.3%, or 2.4 percentage points lower than last year's rate. During the quarter, we developed plans that will allow us to utilize more of our deferred tax assets, resulting in a benefit to us this quarter of about $10 million. Net earnings for the third quarter were $258 million, increasing $11 million, or 4.4% compared to the prior year. Earnings per share increased 4.8% to $0.44, including a $0.04 negative impact related to the multi-employer pension charge and a $0.02 tax benefit related to the recognition of deferred tax assets, both of which I mentioned previously. Excluding the impact of these 2 items, the MEPP charge and the tax benefit, adjusted EPS would've increased 9.5%, which we are relatively pleased with. Turning to our business transformation plan for a moment, Bill noted the major milestone we achieved recently of going live at our pilot facility in Arkansas. Let me take a moment to give you an update on this strategically important project from a financial perspective.  We put together the budget for this project roughly 3 years ago based on our best estimates of costs, benefits and scheduling at that time. As we move through the various phases of the project, we're finding, as you might imagine, that some of our estimates and assumptions were pretty good, and others we've had to revise along the way. For example, as we mentioned previously, the testing phase of the project that we just completed was extended to incorporate a fourth round of testing. This was the right decision, because we believe the additional testing had a lot to do with our success in Arkansas. We had built a measure of contingency into our $900 million project budget to handle just these types of situation. Thus far, we have consistently reported that we're on schedule and on budget, and that's generally still the case. However, we're going to continue to emphasize that this is unlikely to be the first IT project in history to finish precisely on schedule and on budget.  We are currently evaluating everything we've learned through the rollout in Arkansas and what changes, if any, we need to make to our overall development plan. We will provide you an update of our fiscal 2012 expectations in August when we speak to you about fourth quarter results, and we'll plan to update you on our 5-year outlook, as we have done in the last 2 years, at Investor Day in December.  Coming back to the near term, I want to update our estimates of the EPS impact of the project on this year's numbers. We now expect the impact to EPS for fiscal 2011 will be in the range of $0.02 to $0.04 per share compared to our previous range of $0.06 to $0.09. As a reminder, this impact is the incremental cost net of the benefits from the project. Reduction in our estimate is due mainly to our ability to capitalize more project cost. Our overall cash expenditures were generally as expected, but the extended testing period allowed us to capitalize a larger portion of these expenditures. Turning to cash flow, in the first 39 weeks of the fiscal year, we generated $666 million in operating cash flow compared to $477 million in the prior year period, due mainly to lower IRS payments and pension contributions this year, partially offset by a decline in working capital. Operating cash flow during the first 39 weeks of the fiscal year was impacted by several factors: first, we paid $159 million in IRS settlement payments compared to $475 million in the prior year period. We expect to pay $53 million in the fourth quarter this fiscal year for a total of $212 million during the fiscal 2011. In fiscal 2012, we'll pay the final $212 million in scheduled payments. Second, we experienced a decline in working capital, driven mainly by the increase in sales and case volume during the year. Third, accrued expenses declined, due mainly to the payment of incentive compensation in the first quarter related to fiscal 2010. Lastly, cash contributions to our Retirement Plan have been lower in the first 39 weeks by approximately $100 million.  As you may recall, we paid our fiscal 2011 contributions early in June of our last fiscal year, and as a result, we haven't made the quarterly contribution this year that we typically would have.  Capital expenditures totaled $137 million for the quarter and $454 million for the first 39 weeks, mainly related to facility expansion and replacement, fleet replacements and investments in technology, including our Business Transformation Project. At the beginning of our fiscal year, we had expected to spend roughly $700 million to $750 million during fiscal 2011 on CapEx. However, due to timing changes for some of our facility expansions and foldouts, we now estimate total spend for the year to come in at around $625 million to $650 million for the year. As we enter the fourth quarter, it is important to remember that last year was a 53-week year for Sysco. So our fourth quarter this year, we'll have 13 weeks versus 14 in the prior year.  As Bill mentioned, we remain focused on building a pipeline of quality acquisitions. We are pleased by the current level of activity we are seeing in the marketplace, and we've recently closed or expect to close in a matter of days acquisitions of companies that represent approximately $200 million in annualized sales. These transactions combined with the Lincoln Poultry transaction we announced in the first quarter mean we have acquired companies this year representing approximately $420 million in annualized sales. In closing, we are encouraged by the results announced this morning. And while consumer confidence, housing and unemployment still have a ways to go before reaching pre-recession levels, there are continuing signs that the general economic picture is improving. Our financial results may continue to be a bit choppy, reflecting the uneven nature of this recovery, but we believe that the business is improving. At the same time, we continue to make investments in our business that we strongly believe will generate long term benefits to our business and our shareholders.  With that, Operator, we'll now take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Greg Badishkanian from Citi.
Jeffrey Hans: This is Jeff Hans, actually, on behalf of Greg. Can you guys talk a little bit about your case volume growth and improvement through the quarter? I think you've mentioned last quarter that January was hurt a little bit by some bad weather. So did you see any sequential pickups in Feb [February] and March? And then just curious what type of momentum you're seeing already in April and early May?
William DeLaney: Jeff, it's Bill. Case volume movement, it's really hard to characterize that on a month-to-month basis. If you go back to the second quarter, as reported, it was soft compared to the quarter before if you adjust for the holiday week, still a little less but not quite as much of a gap. So I would say this to you the -- we're pleased with the volume. We did see pretty good, consistent growth throughout the quarter. We saw in some places, we haven't seen it in 2 or 3, 4 years like Florida, which was really encouraging to see. We saw in most of the country -- we were hurt by weather in January in the Northeast, which -- we don't talk a whole lot about weather in the Northeast in the winter time. But we were actually hurt in the Southeast in Atlanta and that part of the country. But I'd also have to tell you that with the late Easter this year, that probably more than offset, or at least equally offset it. So I think with the call-out that Chris made here on the favorable benefit of not having a holiday week, it's pretty much straight up, what we're reporting in that 2% range.
Jeffrey Hans: And then on, one last one, I guess, inflation on "center of the plate" items. Are you seeing that inflation subside? Or have you just been able to pass more of that through to your customers?
William DeLaney: We saw its subside a little bit in the Dairy area. It's kind of coming back some, but we're not seeing it subside at all in the Beef and Meat area or the Seafood area. And what we're also seeing now is it's starting to broaden out into other categories. Produce, there were some weather issues there, produce is obviously very volatile. I think Chris mentioned our Grocery, Dry Grocery or the Canned & Dry, the increase wasn't as much as what we saw in the Meat area, but that's a very significant piece of our mix. So I think this inflation, all of the commodities, and I think it's working its way through the whole supply chain right now. You're starting to see it be positive in more areas, whereas a couple of quarters ago, it was really driven pretty much by 3 areas, for us, 3 categories.
Jeffrey Hans: So you guys, basically, have been able to pass a little bit more of that through this quarter versus last quarter, basically?
William DeLaney: Yes. I mean, when you hear us talk about execution, I mean, that's 3 pieces. I think, we're out there every day trying to grow cases in the right way, take share, pass along what we can and do that in the right way and obviously, keep working on our productivity and our cost structure. So I would say we did a better job, clearly, in the third quarter in passing it along.
Operator: And next, we'll move to John Ivankoe with JP Morgan.
John Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co: A question again on the overall industry. Many restaurant companies are talking about taking more pricing in fiscal '11 than they give in '10 and I think even at levels we haven't seen for at least half a decade or so. I mean, what are you seeing in terms of not only their receptivity in terms of higher prices, but I think, more importantly, as kind of the industry overall improves, are you seeing some of your foodservice competition getting more competitive on price? Or is that something because of cost inflation and fuel that you're seeing even less competitive on price? And obviously, what I'm trying to understand is how via strategic price investments were less in the March quarter than the December quarter while you were expanding in case volume. I mean, does that say something specific about your competition?
William DeLaney: I'll start and let Chris finish, maybe, on the strategic pricing issues. I would say, John, those are 2 different issues. On the strategic pricing initiatives that those are some areas where we chose to go at some things in an aggressive way where we feel that we have an opportunity to take share, and it's going to take a couple of years to get a payback on that. To the broader question of taking price increases in the industry, we're seeing what you're seeing. In terms of what -- the restaurants are beginning to be more receptive and to pass it along. This is just my view. I mean, I think that's a combination of 2 things. One, the nature and the level of the inflation is getting higher and higher and is more broad, as we just mentioned. So on the one hand, I think we're all at a point where we have to pass it along to some extent. But I also think it tells you that they're feeling little bit better about their business, and some of the surveys we see would confirm this. So I think as people get more confident that the growth, albeit modest, that they're seeing in their business is going to be able to sustain itself, that does give you the confidence to pass along increases in a way that maybe you wouldn't have been so comfortable doing 6 or 9 months ago. So I think more broadly, there's just a need to pass along, because all of our costs are going up. But I think people are modestly more confident right now.
John Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co: And Bill, in terms of your competition, and this is obviously a marginal change question. I mean, are you seeing your competition more or less price-aggressive in this current environment? Again, with inflation, fuel cost and improving in case volumes, I mean, are you sensing that they're increasing [indiscernible] the pressure on you or perhaps even decreasing the pressure on you?
William DeLaney: Obviously, it depends on the competitor. But I would have to tell you that the sense of competition on the price line value item right now, it is as intense as it's been. I don't think it's getting more intense, but we've been in a pretty acute level here for the last 1.5 years, and we're not feeling it subside at all.
Operator: And next, we'll move to Mark Wiltamuth with Morgan Stanley.
Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley: I wanted to dig in a little more on the inflation issue. When you talk about executing a little better, is it just that you're more on top of the increases as they're coming through, and the marketing associates are better manned to deal with that? Or characterize what was different in the last couple of quarters versus this quarter on the pass-through of inflation.
William DeLaney: Well, I think, Mark, some of it is what I just went through, which is the environment that we're in. So while on the competitive side, it remains very intense and very competitive, on the customer side, I think we are working more effectively with our customers and helping them find ways to pass these increases along in the right manner. So I think that's part of it. But lookit, the other part of it is just -- we're more pleased with our results in the second quarter, and we went back to the drawing board and looked at everything we're doing, and we got 80 Broadline Companies out there and SYGMA and a bunch of specialty companies. So there's no magic buttons we're pushing from here. But I can assure you that the focus on striking the right balance between case growth and margin management expense control has been heightened, and we're encouraged with what we saw this quarter. So it's a combination of things.
Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley: Were you actually getting any pushback from customers, saying, "Look, these increases are too big, I just can't take them," or how was that going?
William DeLaney: I'm sure our marketing associates get that pushback every day. And that's -- I think you work through it and you try to make good decisions each day and -- depending on the customer and their particular set of circumstances. So ultimately, our job is to get our customer to understand what it takes for us to be successful. And in the end, we're only successful if they're successful. So at some point, we're trying to paint a picture for them on how they can manage their menu more effectively and pass these increases along to their customer in the right way. But as we all understand, it's not easy. The biggest difference -- we've managed through inflationary times before, as we've discussed in the past. What make this one different is the environment that we're still coming out of. And when you hear us talk about choppiness or uneven recovery, that's kind of what we're getting at, which is it's hard to categorize where we're making improvements or how our customers are dealing with those in a consistent way, because it's case-by-case, and one month might be a little bit better than next month. That type of thing.
Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley: And lastly, on headcount, you said you were down 1%. Are you still working to add back MAs in certain areas for strategic reasons?
William DeLaney: We're looking to adding MAs relative to what our expectations for growth are over the next 12, 18 months. So yes, our MA count is up slightly, and we'll continue to try to strike the right balance there.
Operator: And next, we'll move to Ajay Jain with Hapoalim Securities.
Ajay Jain - Hapoalim Securities USA, Inc.: I just had a question on ERP. I think, Chris, you mentioned that the non-capitalized portion was going to be down relative to what you budgeted before. Can you just confirm the actual dollar amount that was expensed in Q3? And based on what you're expecting right now, can you give the outlook for the fourth quarter?
Robert Kreidler: Yes, Ajay, we actually don't talk about the specific dollar amounts to be expensed. The guidance that we've given is that, and I think it goes back to the 10-K, we expect expenses to be about $25 million to $45 million higher for the year, and we're not updating that guidance at all. We expect the cash outlay to be $260 million to $280 million for the year. And again, we're not updating that guidance either. All we've really said is that our guidance that we gave early in the year of $0.06 to $0.09, we've adjusted down. And this is incremental impact, so it's not the same as cash outlay. We've adjusted that down to $0.02 to $0.04 and the difference in the entire adjustment was the fact that we were able to capitalize more than we originally thought, because testing ran longer than we had originally planned.
Ajay Jain - Hapoalim Securities USA, Inc.: And then can you also talk a little bit more about the multi-employer pension? To what degree was this plan that you just exited an isolated issue, and is there any potential that you might take another earnings hit if you decide to exit another plan in the next year or so?
Robert Kreidler: Yes, I hesitate to call it an isolated incident as we obviously have other multi-employer pension plans out there. Our general strategy is we look at all of these plans one at a time. Some of them are, we'll say, in worse shape than others. They give us some concern. And this is one that, frankly, we had some concern about. We look for opportunities to exit those plans when we get them, and this was an opportunity we had, and we took it for strategic reasons. We've got some multi-employer plans that are in good shape, and then again we've got some that aren't necessarily as bad as this one, but we'd prefer them be in better shape. I think one of the points to remind folks of, and we did put this in our 10-K but it bears reminding, the data we get on these multi-employer pension plans is very outdated. I think the latest information we have on these plans right now is December 31 of 2009. And so we don't have performance for 2010 or 2011. And so whether it's well-funded or underfunded, is -- you're really looking back a year and a half and making a best guess. And the charge that we take this year will be trued up for actual performance through the end of this fiscal calendar year. It's the best guess we have at the time, and frankly, we're hopeful that their performance has been better during the last 18 months of market.
Ajay Jain - Hapoalim Securities USA, Inc.: And if I could just ask one final question. If you look at the comparisons for incentive compensation in the fourth quarter, to what degree could that be a material issue in the fourth quarter? Is that a potential headwind? And then also, do you expect any anomalies with the tax rate this quarter based on your current expectations?
Robert Kreidler: I'll try both of those, and Bill may wade in. On incentive compensation for the third quarter, one thing, again, you'll see in it in the Q when we file it tomorrow -- I don't know that we break this out or not, but the $36 million of payroll incentive comp increase, about 1/3 of that was an accrual for a corporate bonus incentive. And frankly, it's a catch-up. We did not have an accrual for the year based upon the first 2 quarters for the first half-year performance. And so we've effectively put on 3 quarters worth of accrual in one quarter. So from that basis, it was probably a little heavy in Q3. If it goes up in Q4, frankly, it's due to performance. And I'll say the same thing about the field compensation. It that number is heavy in the fourth quarter, again, it's going to be driven by case growth and gross profit growth, which is a good thing.
William DeLaney: Ajay, this is Bill. I don't usually hope for headwinds, but I'd love to have one in the fourth quarter. But I think we have pretty full accruals last year, so I don't think that's going to be a big issue.
Robert Kreidler: As far as the tax rate, no, we don't have anything on the horizon that would cause me to think that we're going to have anything significant on the tax line. That can change very fairly quickly. The thing that we normally are talking about is COLI, and, again, we can't predict what's going to happen with COLI during the course of the quarter.
Operator: And next from Andrew Wolf with BB&T Capital Markets.
Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets: Bill, I just wanted to get back to Greg's question on how the business trended during the quarter. I just want -- did you say it got up to a little over 2%, and that's sort of where it's at, or was there any cadence to it that we should -- that you'd like to tell us about?
William DeLaney: Yes, I think I acknowledged that when you go through all the adjustments that we've verbalized here that you'd be around 2% the way we recharacterize volume growth, or real growth, I guess. And the only point I was trying to make is it's very difficult to describe a cadence a month at a time. I didn't comment on April, because we don't do that, as you know, during the quarter. But April happens to be a month where we had a late Easter. That's good, but at the same time, Mother's Day is falling on a different week. So it's really hard to stall [ph] on any one quarter. What I'll remind you, and I know you know this, is in the third quarter, in particular, March is a critical month. So we had a good March, and we needed to, to have a good quarter.
Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets: Any noteworthy changes in your customer segments? Were the higher-end restaurants starting to do better or continuing to do better? Anything? And the 1% or so sequential pickup in real sales?
William DeLaney: It's hard for us to kind of tell that from here. To be honest with you. We certainly have some perspective, but we also look at everything that you look at. And the best I can ascertain at this point, there's some, I won't call them conflicting, but there's some contradictory data or anecdotal views out there, but I think the quick-serve side continues to do well, and their traffic appears to be up a little bit. I'm not really sure what's driving that, necessarily, but it seems to be good. I think as you get into casual dining, family dining, the traffic isn't up that much, if at all, but as people go out today, they seem to be spending more than in the past. So for the most part, those folks are seeing a little bit of an increase. What's harder to gauge is just the overall industry number, because we go to different sources there. And some people believe right now that the market is still relatively flat. So in a few months, we'll know that a little bit more accurately. So I'd say the family, casual dining is holding its own, maybe up a little a little bit based on increased purchases. And the high end, I would say that that's doing better.
Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets: And this might be for Chris. On the fuel, the $14 million in this quarter and your expectation, we'll see where that goes. But was any of that recaptured through the contract pricing? I know Bill said you're going -- or you said you're going to institute surcharge against -- for independents. But is that $14 million, I'm not sure I heard it right, was any of that we got recaptured due to contract pricing this quarter? Or is that the amount that wasn't?
Robert Kreidler: No, I mean, we actually note fuel costs separately from fuel surcharges. Fuel surcharges go through gross margin. And so what you'll see in the Q tomorrow, we'll break that out for you. But fuel expenses on the cost side was up $14 million. Fuel surcharges are always on for the contract side of the business. So there was an offset there. On the street side of the business, that's where I said we put in a fuel surcharge starting in March, they had very little impact for this quarter. But we do expect it to have a good offsetting impact in the fourth quarter to the increase. And we will be -- I think we do this in our Q tomorrow, updating some credits on Q4. I mean, as I've said in my statement, we expect fuel cost for the fourth quarter to be up $15 million to $20 million. We expect the fuel surcharge to be up $10 million to $15 million. So those will substantially offset.
Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets: Just on other income, there was a big pickup there. Could you just tell us what the source was or just...
Robert Kreidler: Yes, it was actually 2 transactions. In the third quarter of fiscal '11, so this third quarter, we recognized a gain on the sale of a facility up in Canada that was about $4.5 million. In the third quarter of last year, we recognized a loss of about $3 million on the sale of our Jamestown, New York facility. So the year-over-year lap of that looks pretty big.
Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets: Actually one more. And then, also housekeeping, COLI was pretty de minimis, looks like stock market, foreign about the same in both periods, isn't that right?
Robert Kreidler: Yes, we don't talk about COLI unless it has a significant year-over-year impact. So we didn't talk about COLI.
Operator: And next, we'll move on to John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC: A couple things. So Bill, it seems very encouraging that price pass-through is picking up and there has been no sign of demand dampening, which I think maybe most of us might have expected some of that. Are you seeing that anywhere? If you look at categories, geographies, is there any early sign of demand getting hit a little bit by inflation or no, not yet?
William DeLaney: John, I think I'm not going to call of them out, but I think there are some geographies, and you'd probably guess where they are, where the economy is still on a tougher place and maybe some others whether you look at it on an absolute sense or relative to a year ago, where you have high unemployment, that type of thing -- higher than average, obviously, it's pretty high in general right now. So yes, there's one or 2 markets that we see where we don't see as much growth as we might see in some other areas. But generally, I would say it's been pretty consistent across the country. So far as categories, no, I wouldn't say that I've noticed anything there that's worth getting into. I think, again, these things need to be managed. There's always pushback. We try to make good decisions with our customers through our MAs, and that's our job to manage it. So these high-inflation categories, that's typically where you're going to see the pushback. It's big increases, and often it's on items that cost a lot. So we're continuing to work through that, and like I said earlier, when you hear us speak about execution, that's just we're -- we feel like we're managing it better. But lookit, there's still work to be done here, I can tell you that.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC: Does the fact that the volumes are behaving as well as they are give you more confidence to put more pricing through, than if -- I would imagine that if volumes were negative, so we should see more of that?
William DeLaney: Yes, I think it does. And I'll give you the same answer I gave in the context of our customers. It gives you more confidence, but we're also at a point where we need to. And again, the key, and I've said this couple of times now, it's really important. The key is how we do it. It's just not necessarily just passing along a price increase. I mean, it's working with the customer on their menu, working with them on different items, perhaps substitute items. Work with them on specials. Those types of things. All those things that our MAs are trained to do. Business reviews. All that type of thing. So you try to do it in the context of how can we help get through this together and still both of us run our businesses better?
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC: The other thing, inventories were up a decent amount year-over-year. Is there a lot of forward-buying taking place? And do you think that's an opportunity to offset margin going forward?
Robert Kreidler: No, we don't generally do a lot of forward-buy activity. I wouldn't say that that's coloring the numbers. The inventory increase is really driven by the case and overall performance. And then we did have -- DSOs went slightly the wrong way on us this quarter, and so that accounted for a little bit of the inventory as well.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC: I mean, is forward-buy an opportunity? I mean, you got inflation for the first time in a while, you're carrying cost is pretty low. Do you -- is it more you really don't want to take advantage of it, or you don't see the opportunity from the vendors?
William DeLaney: Well, I don't think we have any great expertise, to begin with, in terms of forward-buys. We do a little bit, John, in certain commodity areas. So generally, we just philosophically don't believe that that's part of our value package, to be honest with you. So we try to be smart, and where there's opportunities, we'll take advantage of them. But our role we see as being a marketer and a distributor, and we don't really -- we don't go real big into that area at this point. Frankly, John, we don't have -- we'd have to do a lot more work in the whole risk management area, I think, to take a bigger step in that area.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC: Then finally, with the Arkansas test, what one or 2 things kind of surprised you? You mentioned issues that you resolved, maybe surprised you negatively, what one or 2 things surprised you positively as you go forward to a bigger test?
William DeLaney: Yes, I think there's really no negative at this point. There's delays, there's performance issues, that type of thing. So I'd say on the testing side, Chris alluded to this, we did extend testing, and we pushed the go-live date back appropriately. So because [indiscernible] do more testing. So I wouldn't call that a negative. I think I've made the right decision, but I -- trying to give you some color on how these things play out. The thing we're working on right now is what we call performance. So more consistent response time, shorter waits more of the time, that type of thing. We've made great strides -- just getting through the weekend, as I mentioned, was a huge stride, and we've made good strides in the last 3 weeks. But there's still work to be done on that. There's some work to be done on the reporting area. But the bigger issue, and I apologize if the people from Arkansas are listening right now, the broader issue for us is to take stock of what we're learning through this pilot and understand what that means as we go forward with this first wave. So we've got to do everything we can to help Arkansas operate their business at a high level, but at the same time, we're taking a step back and look at different things that we've learned from the processes that we put in place and the feedback we're getting from our MAs and customers.
Robert Kreidler: John, I thought I'd weigh in just with my own thoughts. It's a bit of a shout-out to the teams here, but I think one of our surprises was how fairly quickly we were dealing with what I'll call moderate issues instead of really big issues. After 2.5 years of this journey, as Bill described, and the massive amount of people that we've had working on this project, you build up this expectation just from fear that something horrible is going to wrong and you're going to have to go backwards, or you're going to be able to ship groceries. And even though we've talked about mitigation strategies, every time we've talked about such a big project, you don't know how all that's going to work until you flip the switch. And I would say that we didn't have a problem shipping groceries, and the teams did a fabulous job of tackling the issues as they came up. And, as I said, fairly quickly, we were down to what I'd call moderate and then down to -- I don't want to say anything is a minor problem, but in a pilot site, frankly, I think we expected worse. The other thing just to note is, we've talked a lot about turning on the pilot site in Arkansas. We also turned on our Sysco business service center here outside of Houston, in Cypress, Texas, which is our, frankly, our shared service center, our back-office function. So a ton of work is going into preparing that group for the change-over as the operating companies go live. So again, flipping that switch and seeing the success was a very welcome thing.
William DeLaney: Yes, I think, John, just to maybe crystallize the thought, the way we define success on this thing was we were able to ship groceries on time and accurately on Monday morning. And so we had some bumps along the way, and we're still working through some things. But that's how we define success, and that's why we're calling this a successful launch.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC: Just lastly, have the MAs there fundamentally changed how they're spending their time? And is it too early for that to increase productivity? Where has that gone?
William DeLaney: Again, it's a pilot site. So I would say it's a little early on that front. Right now, we're trying to get the MAs through the transition. Certainly, some of them are, I'm sure, but I would say those are things that we'll look at over the next 90 to 180 days. Right now, we're very focused on the system and all that goes behind the system. So I'm sure there's some of that that's happening. Chris' point, the SPS is a new environment for them, and they're adjusting to that. But I would expect you or us to be able to see that improvement as we get 3 to 6 months into it. But that probably is more relevant as we get into the first wave and the subsequent waves. This is truly a pilot. We're trying to learn as much as we possibly can before we go forward any further.
Operator: Meredith Adler with Barclays Capital will have our next question.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: I want to go back to something Chris said about having paid pension early at the end of last year. Did that change the way pension was expensed or only a cash impact?
Robert Kreidler: It's only a cash impact, Meredith. We still expense it quarterly. We just sent the cash early, frankly, to take advantage of what we thought were good market conditions, and given the result of our pension investments for the year, we're pretty happy we did it.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: And then I'm assuming that if you've been able to apply fuel surcharges in this latest quarter, then the competitive environment must be allowing you to do that? But others are also taking fuel surcharges. Is that fair to say?
William DeLaney: Well, we've done this in the past, Meredith. And then we've unwound them on the street as well at the appropriate time. So we did some surveys, if you will, or analysis, and different competitors are doing different things. And so essentially, this is an example of something we're -- if someone's going to do it consistently around the country, it's going to be Sysco, and so we did it. We really didn't think so much about the competitors.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: And then I know that you got a question about forward-buy, which it doesn't sound like you want to take that risk, really. But often, distributors just naturally have inventory profits for when there's inflation in the Dry Grocery category, obviously not in perishable, because it turns too quickly. Is them is there some reason to believe that you will be able to realize some inventory profits?
Robert Kreidler: We typically have that running through in our variance every quarter, to the extent prices are going up, of course. Whether you'll see significant quarter-over-quarter improvement, one, it's hard to say, and 2, I wouldn't expect it. So, yes, I don't think you'll see much from us in the way of significant increases from inventory valuation.
William DeLaney: I mean, our inventory turns on average around every 20 days, Meredith, so there's not much time for that.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: No I guess, but some categories are slower than others, I would think.
William DeLaney: You're right. There would be in some in the Nonfood categories.
Robert Kreidler: Yes. But again, the average days on hand that we have across all categories including the slowest of categories is not significant enough that we would -- we could roll that much of an improvement around.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: And then I have a question about -- you talked about because the testing went on a little bit longer, you were able to capitalize more. Can you give us some sense -- I don't think you want to tell us how much has been capitalized, but can you give us some sense of what the depreciation period would be for when you capitalize those things?
Robert Kreidler: Yes. Generally, sometimes I've had my team when I do this, but I call it the machine. So when we capitalize stuff, we're basically saying we're building the machine, and at some at some point we start depreciating the machine. We did that when we turned on Arkansas, effectively, and generally that's going to be capitalized over 7 years.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: And when does it start being capitalized? I mean, when will that 7 -- it's already started, presumably.
Robert Kreidler: It has now started, yes.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: Okay. And the others' investment for the business transformation process, are most of them going to be 7-year depreciation?
Robert Kreidler: No, it's going to vary. I'd say on the short side, there'll be some things we do that are 3-year investment or a 3-year depreciation period. And some of the SPS investment, which is building plant equipment, will be materially longer than that.
Operator: And next, we'll move Colin Guheen with Cowen and Company.
Colin Guheen - Cowen and Company, LLC: A question on inflation and the real growth dynamics that are going on now. I guess historically, at a 5% inflation level, you would expect some demand destruction. Are the operators out there saying or feeling that they have some pent-up pricing given the deflationary environment and, thus, we're seeing a stronger pricing power halo, maybe, coming forward? Or is that not the way to look at it?
William DeLaney: Can you give me that one again? I'm not sure I understood the question.
Colin Guheen - Cowen and Company, LLC: Yes, I mean, normally, when you're seeing 5% inflation, you would think that they have some demand destruction if you look historically, I think, at the business with this inflation levels. Are the operators feeling because you're lapping over deflationary period that they have some pent-up pricing ability and, therefore, are willing to take price, and they do have that with the consumers? Or how would you characterize, I guess, the willingness to take price right now at the operator level?
William DeLaney: I think going back to some of the earlier questions, I would say that they're reluctantly taking price increases right now, because they know they have to, to run their business. But I think it has very little do with the fact that are there was deflation a year ago. The memory bank in this business is not that real long. So I think it's just more of a perception of what they need to do to run their business and a little more confidence than maybe couple of years ago that their business is going to be in better stead than it would have might have been before. So I think there's a higher degree of confidence on the -- modestly higher degree of confidence on the next few months. And just the reality that that's what good business people do.
Operator: And our final question today will come from Bob Cummins with Wellington Shields & Co.
Robert Cummins - Shields & Company: I have to say, as a long-time shareholder, I'm pleased to see your stock up $4 to a new 12-month high today, in case people haven't noticed. And I wonder if you could elaborate somewhat on your acquisition strategy. I see for the year-to-date, you've spent quite a bit more on acquisitions than you did a year ago during the same period. But is that likely to be stepped up further? And in particular, are you emphasizing regional acquisitions to strengthen your position where you maybe don't have the market share that you would like? And to what extent would your expansion translate into more international operations as you go forward?
Robert Kreidler: Let me start with the domestic stuff. We've talked about pretty much everywhere we've gone. Most you that cover the industry know that there are a few large players, but when you get down half, maybe number 15, the numbers drop off, even though we've got over 16,000 competitors in the industry, the size of those competitors drops off fairly quickly. We decided that we can wait around and try to strike relationships and hopefully get some opportunities to acquire some of the biggest players in the industry, or, frankly, we can go out and do what's Sysco's always done extremely well, which is form relationships with all of the other companies that are out there, at least as many of them as we can, and build what Bill referred to as a pipeline of quality transaction. So people that we meet today may not have any interest in selling today, but if they get to know us, we get to know them, 3 or 4 or 5 years down the road, they may have a family event that causes them to want to sell. Hopefully we get the phone call. We've been building that pipeline. It takes a while to build that pipeline. So the answer to your first question is, we've actually now closed or within days of closing about $420 million worth of -- I should say that differently. Acquisitions that represent $420 million worth of sales. And so that's, I'd say, an increase in performance and tempo. We've said publicly that we'd like to do at least a half-point of sales generation every year through acquisitions. Internally, we'd like to do even better than that. But you've got to have a willing seller as well as a willing buyer. So we'll take them as they come. So we're going to work on the smaller transactions. We're going to keep working on regional opportunities, to your point, where they make sense for us and where we have an interested party on the other side, we'll build those relationships, and we'll try to work through those deals if they're available to us. Moving to the last part of your question, we've said that the 3 strategic streams that we're working down, one being broadening our U.S. and Canadian opportunities, the core as we call it, 2 being adjacencies, the third one in there is international. We continue to look at other geographies and try to understand where we might find something that would be a good fit for Sysco, where we could add some value and we could set up Sysco for long-term growth and new markets, and we'll continue to look at those opportunities.
Robert Cummins - Shields & Company: Being a Texas-based company, is Mexico an option?
William DeLaney: Mexico is always an option, Bob. It's just a little bit of timing. We've looked at Mexico before. I think when you look at countries like Mexico, maybe other developing markets, one of the questions becomes how would you go in, and that would probably be a market where we'd want to affiliate ourself with a partner, that type of thing. So we have some good relationships with a couple of organizations in Mexico, and we'll continue to look at that. And to Chris' point, we're right now how we focus on the quarter, but at the same time, if we can find some strategic opportunities that will either help us better differentiate ourselves with our customers, i.e., the adjacent side, for example, or provide a broader platform for growth in the future, then we'd like to do that. But it's a whole different approach and assessment process and highly strategic.
Robert Cummins - Shields & Company: And how is your Irish operation performing?
William DeLaney: Well, they're performing great. I mean, I was over there, Chris and I were over there for some investor meetings a month and half ago and we stopped by and spent an afternoon and evening with their people and their management team, and when you factor in what's going on in that country, we're exceptionally pleased with the effort, enthusiasm. They're growing the business. There's a lot of pressure, as you would expect on the profit line, but they're performing very well, and we couldn't be more pleased with the people in that company.
Robert Cummins - Shields & Company: Just one final question. I see that your share buyback expenditures so far this fiscal year are way up from the prior year, and that's understandable. And I'm not going to ask if you're going to cut back on that. But would be your strategy between stock repurchases and keeping that money on hand to use it for acquisitions?
Robert Kreidler: Actually, Bob, our strategy in share repurchases, as we've talked about, has been really just to offset dilution from options issuances. The reason it's heavier this year is as we entered the year with the share price where it was and the plan that we have in front of us, we set a target for how many shares we thought we need to buy back. Then the share price declines, and suddenly we didn't need to buy back that many shares. And so we haven't had a lot of activity here recently. But our strategy right now is not to increase in the share repurchase program it's not to spend a certain of amount of money. It's, frankly, just to offset dilution.
Operator: And that will conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Sysco Reports Second Quarter Fiscal 2011 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Neil Russell. Please go ahead, sir.
Neil Russell: Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for Sysco's Second Quarter 2011 Conference Call. On today's call, you will hear from Bill DeLaney, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Kreidler, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, please note that statements made on the course of this presentation that states the company's or management's intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results could differ in a material manner. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ in a material manner from those in the forward-looking statement is contained in the company's SEC filings, including, but not limited to risk factors contained in the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 3, 2010, and in the company's press release issued earlier this morning.  Also, all comments about earnings per share refer to diluted earnings per share, unless otherwise noted. With that out of the way, I'll turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill DeLaney.
William DeLaney: Thank you, Neil, and good morning, everyone. This morning, Sysco reported second quarter sales of $9.4 billion, operating income of $437 million and EPS of $0.44 per share. Sales grew 5.8% over the prior year, while operating income decreased 5.5% and EPS was $0.01 lower than last year's second quarter. Volume growth was softer than what we experienced in the previous two quarters, and expense pressure increased in our selling and delivery areas. However, the primary factor in our producing lower earnings compared to the prior year was the decline in gross margins of just over 0.5%. For the second consecutive quarter, we experienced double-digit rates of product cost increases in three categories: Meat, Seafood and Dairy, that comprised 1/3 of our total sales dollar mix. These are key product categories for many of our customers and absorbing steep and rapid price increases is difficult for them, especially at this early stage of what we all hope is a sustainable if somewhat uneven economic recovery. While we actually produce real volume growth in these categories, we are unable to increase our case growth enough to offset the fact that our product cost in these categories grew at a faster rate than our selling prices.  While not impacting our earnings as significantly as inflation pressures, the strategic pricing initiatives we discussed last quarter also contributed to gross margin erosion in the second quarter. We are, however, encouraged by the double digit year-over-year volume growth we are experiencing with the items included in these programs, and we remain confident that the long-term benefits of these initiatives will meet our expectations for profitable market share growth. In assessing our performance for the quarter and for that matter, the first half of our fiscal year, we clearly struggled to achieve some of our key business objectives. Market conditions definitely contributed to our struggles. However, there is no doubt that we have opportunities to improve the execution of our business plan as we move into the second half of our fiscal year. Such improvement is a top priority for me and our entire leadership team.  Looking forward, I'm highly confident that Sysco is well positioned to grow our business profitably and at a faster rate than our $210 billion market gross over the longer term. We do believe that we are in the early stages of an economic recovery based upon our trends throughout calendar year 2010. However, as we saw on the second quarter, that recovery and to some extent, our financial results, may be somewhat choppy due to the economic challenges that consumers continue to face.  Our operating cash flow remains strong and our strategy, which we presented in detail at our Investor Meeting in early December, is sound. As you may recall, our strategy is customer centric in nature with the strong emphasis on operational excellence. Our associates throughout Sysco continue to provide dedicated support and excellent service to our customers. Our business review process is more targeted than ever, and the quality of these reviews improves each year. While fuel cost increases in the impact of nearly 5% inflation in our overall product portfolio created pressure on delivery and selling expenses, we did experience productivity improvements in our warehouse operations and administrative support functions in the second quarter. We're also encouraged by the current level of quality acquisition opportunities in the marketplace. In addition, we recently welcomed Paul Moskowitz to Sysco in the capacity of Senior Vice President, Human Resources. We're excited to have Paul join our team and look forward to his contributions and leadership as we further develop our human capital capabilities. Two key goals reflected in our strategy are to grow sales faster than our market gross and grow earnings faster than sales over the long term. Successfully implementing our multiyear Business Transformation initiative is critical to achieving those goals. We are currently well into the testing phase of our work and are targeting implementation in a pilot site prior to the end of the fiscal year.  Before turning today's call over to Chris, I would like to emphasize that we are committed to striking the appropriate balance between achieving both our near-term financial goals and investing in our business in a manner that will allow Sysco to realize its full potential over the long term. While some of the unfavorable market conditions and operational challenges I have discussed this morning will likely remain with us for the next few months, we expect the economy to continue to gradually improve. Our clear focus as a management team, over the balance of the fiscal year, is to both support our customers with their operational challenges and improve the execution of our business plan.  Now I'll turn things over to Chris, so he could provide additional details on our financial results for the second quarter.
Robert Kreidler: Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. For the second quarter, sales were $9.4 billion or an increase of 5.8% compared to the prior year, driven mainly by the impact of food cost inflation, which we estimate to be 4.5% for the period. In addition, acquisitions within the last 12 months increased sales by 0.6%, and changes in the foreign exchange rates increased sales by 0.4%.  During the quarter, our SYGMA division grew sales more than 13% and Broadline sales increased approximately 5%. Sales in the quarter were somewhat impacted by a holiday mismatch that's worth taking a minute to explain. This year's second quarter included two holidays, which are typically lower sales volume days, Christmas and New Year's, while last year's second quarter included only one of these holidays. At each quarter, it had the same number of holidays, in other words, that they were comparable. We estimate that sales would have been approximately 80 basis points or $630 million higher year-over-year. Operating income decreased $25 million or 5.5% to $437 million during the second quarter, driven by a decline in gross margin as a percent of sales and an increase in operating expenses. While gross margin increased 2.8% or $47 million during the quarter, gross margin as a percentage of sales declined 55 basis points year-over-year to 18.6%. Similar to last quarter, pressure from high inflation, strategic pricing initiatives and changes in segment mix continue to be the main factors impacting gross margin performance. We estimate that about 10 points of the margin decline related to a change in segment mix, as is similar to the decline we experienced last quarter.  As I mentioned earlier, SYGMA once again grew sales at double-digit rates during the quarter and since SYGMA operates a lower margin business, this mix shift unfavorably impacted total margins. As we discussed last quarter, we do not view this as a negative outcome. We see a great deal of opportunity on the contract side of the business, both in the Broadline and SYGMA segments. Our aim is to grow both our street and contract sales over time.  The strategic pricing initiatives we discussed last quarter also continue to pressure margins with the magnitude of the impact estimated to be about 15 basis points or slightly lower than the impact we experienced in the first quarter. As a reminder, these initiatives were designed to drive volume increases in targeted categories. The positive trends we began to see last quarter from these initiatives had continued in the second quarter.  As Bill mentioned, we are experiencing double-digit volume increases in markets where the strategic pricing programs have been effectively implemented. We believe that this initiative, while admittedly putting near-term pressure on our margins, will create long-term benefits for us in terms of higher volume and increased market share. The results we're seeing in the early markets demonstrate that we're on the right path.  The last and largest factor impacting gross margin performance this quarter was inflation. Inflation is measured by the estimated change in Sysco's product cost was 4.5% during the second quarter, even higher than the 3.3% reported during the first quarter this year and a significant swing from the 3.5% deflation reported last year. As Bill mentioned, Dairy, Meat and Seafood were again the categories that saw extreme levels of inflation, with each being in the 11% to 12% range during the quarter. We estimate the impact of inflation represented approximately 30 basis points of the decline in gross margin as a percent of sales. While gross margin as a percent of sales was down on a year-over-year basis during the second quarter, it's worth noting that total gross margin dollars, as well as the gross margin we generate on a per case basis, were up. Turning to operating expenses. We saw an increase during the quarter of 5.9% or $72 million. The increase was due to three main drivers: First, as we have discussed previously, pension expense increased by $15 million year-over-year primarily due to a decrease in the discount rates used to determine pension expense, which was, in turn, driven by the decline in long-term interest rates. Second, salaries and related expense was higher by $13 million due to increases in sales compensation and other payroll costs. Total headcount was down slightly compared to the prior year. Third, fuel expense increased $10 million over the prior year. Net earnings for the second quarter were $258 million, declining $10 million or 3.8% compared to the prior year. Earnings per share declined 2.2% to $0.44, which included a $0.02 benefit from COLI. In the prior-year period, earnings per share were $0.45 and included a $0.01 benefit from COLI. Turning to cash flow. In the first half of the fiscal year, we generated $283 million in operating cash flow compared to $146 million in the prior year period due mainly to lower IRS payments this year, partially offset by a decline in working capital. Operating cash flow during the first half of this fiscal year was impacted by several factors: First, during the first half of the fiscal year, we paid $106 million in IRS settlement payments. We also expect to pay $53 million in each of the third and fourth fiscal quarters of this fiscal year for a total of $212 million during the year. In fiscal 2012, we'll pay the final $212 million in scheduled payments. Second, we traditionally build inventories towards the end of the second quarter for a pickup in Educational business after the first of the year. Additionally, we typically deliver less inventory during the final weeks of the quarter as sales are often lower during the holiday period. Due to the timing of the end of the quarter this year versus last year, the payables related to that inventory build were paid prior to the end of the quarter. As a result of these factors, we saw an increase in inventories and a decline in accounts payable during the period. Third, accrued expenses declined due mainly to the payment of incentive compensation in the first quarter related to fiscal 2010's performance. Capital expenditures totaled $174 million for the quarter and $317 million for the first half, mainly related to facility expansion and fleet replacements and investments in technology, including our Business Transformation Project. In addition, we closed two small acquisitions during the quarter. As Bill mentioned, we are encouraged by the current level of quality acquisition opportunities we are seeing in the marketplace.  In closing, while we are making progress towards some important initiatives, this was without a doubt a very difficult quarter for Sysco. The management team is focused on improved execution, and we are committed to our long term goal of leveraging our sales growth. We are making investments in our business that we strongly believe will generate long-term benefits to our business and our shareholders.  With that, operator, we'll now take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Meridith Adler with Barclays Capital.
Sean Kras - Barclays Capital: This is Sean Kras for Meridith. Can you comment on maybe the trends toward change taking share from independent customers which can be less powerful business for you guys? And, I guess, the company can offset the margin pressure from the mix shift over time?
William DeLaney: As far as change taking share from independents, yes, that's been a slow but steady trend really since I've been in the business, which is over 20 years. So I think that continues. It's not a rapid change, but it certainly continues to be the case. I think if you look at some of the industry data, you'll see in terms of restaurant closings, most of those are on the independent side, you have a net basis. With that said, I just think it's always important to point out that there are a lot of independent restaurants out there and certainly, we have tremendous relationships with many of them. And when you have great operations or if you're a great operator whether you are on our side of the business or whether you're on the restaurant side, let's say, you're going to do well. So the better operators are continuing to do well both on the distribution side and on the operator side, and we would expect that to continue. But there currently has been a gradual shift from independent to chain. But I wouldn't say it's picking up steam or anything like that.
Sean Kras - Barclays Capital: But just maybe how the company kind of offsets some of that pressure over time I guess, the margin pressure implied by that?
William DeLaney: Yes, well, that certainly plays right to a lot of what we talked about up in New York back in December which is that phenomena as I mentioned has been going on for a while. For a couple of decades, we had great demographic tailwinds in this business, and the industry growth had slowed here in the late 90s and most of the new millennium, and I think we're all aware of the environment in the last couple of three years. So essentially, our strategy is just two-fold: one is to continue to work as closely as we can with the customers that value a partnership with Sysco become more and more relevant to their success and at the same time continue to take cost out of our system, both in the short term through a lot of key operational initiatives that we talked about in the past in terms of managing our miles and looking at our engineered standards in the warehouse and all that type of thing. But even beyond that, over the last couple of years, we've committed ourselves to a transformational project here, which we believe will position us well to continue to take shares for the years ahead, but also allows us to take some additional costs out of our system.
Operator: And our next question will come from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Partners.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC: If you look at that perishable inflation, do you that it ultimately get passed through? And I would imagine we're getting to a point it's been out there for a while where it could get passed through soon or is that just something that you're going to have to eat a chunk of that, given the macro? Or do you think it does get passed through eventually?
William DeLaney: Well, I think eventually allowed to get passed through, John. We're two, two and a half year highs, you've got a lot of these commodities that I'm sure you follow regularly as well. So as I mentioned in my comments, these boxes -- these are expensive boxes in these particular categories, especially in the Meat and Seafood areas, so they're very significant part of the spend budget for our customers. And so it's difficult for them to absorb price increases in the short term and as a result, we've struggled to pass it along in the right way. So I expect that over time, generally and gradually we'll be able to do that, but I think it will take a lot longer.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC: Do you think you're a price leader? Meaning -- I sort of look at your competitive position versus everybody else, and if you're hurting, everybody else has to be hurting a heck of a lot more. Where you could be in a position to push some of this through and others would follow, or is that a great concern that maybe others don't follow and you end up losing share?
William DeLaney: I think you have to kind of look at it in context over the years. I think how we position ourselves still continues to be the case. We want to be competitive. We think if you look at our overall offering to our customers, we feel we're competitively priced and the survey work that we get back from the customers that do a fair amount of business through Sysco they see us being competitive. I don't know that I would characterize ourselves as a price leader, per se. But with that said, John, in the environment that we've been in, as we’ve kind of crossed over into an interesting time now where there's growth in the marketplace, but it's modest growth. The psychology of the market place is probably as good as it's been in some time. But everything feels a little tenuous. So it's still very competitive out there. I think the one thing you're seeing is we're trying to strike the right balance between obviously growing our earnings but making sure that we hold our position with our customers and find a way to grow share where that make sense. Case-by-case, maybe a little bit more on the aggressive side here over the last six to nine months.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC: And if I look at the 1/3, so the other 2/3, it looked like inflation there is 2% or less. Are you having any trouble passing that through or that's going through pretty much as you get it?
William DeLaney: I mean, you're right. I think it's pretty moderate in the other categories. Other than the -- I'd say in the core Grocery category, let me focus on that, which is a good percentage of what we sell, it's modest and we've been able to pass out a lot. I think we have opportunities to grow our volumes on those categories, and that's something I think that when I talk about us being more and more focused on executing our business plan, I think there's opportunity there.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC: One final thing on the -- you've taken pricing on those specific items and are getting double-digit volumes, is that following through and you're seeing increases in the drop size or total purchase, the baskets that include those items? Or was it not yet generating increased share kind of across somebody's purchasing book?
William DeLaney: You're talking about the pricing initiative?
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC: Yes.
William DeLaney: Tough to answer. We certainly -- as I said, we're seeing the volumes as you point out. Our drop sizes, I can't tell you that they have improved appreciatively but I don't know that it has anything to do with that. I still think that's it's a low-volume growth, it's going to be tough to improve your drop size. We've done a lot of good work in that area over the last two or three years. So I think that's -- the whole key to that, John, is we want to grow those categories in those particular product lines but to your point, we want to become more relevant in those areas to our customers. So I'd say that's more of a medium to long-term goal. So I think we've seen it in pockets but I can't tell you that's moving the needle at this point.
Operator: Next we'll take a question from Andrew Wolf with BB&T Capital Markets.
Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets: First, on the 80 basis points from the holiday swing, I gather that means on New Year's Day, the restaurants are closed and maybe some of the fast food restaurants are open some. Just trying to -- could we just put that all in Broadline or should we sort of spread it out pro-ratably between the segments? Or somewhere in the...
Robert Kreidler: It's an estimated calculation, and it's across all of our business. So we just put it across everything.
Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets: Do you think it's more in Broadline, given that those independent stores are also the most likely to be absolutely be closed or some of the fast food stores are still open at least, or am I just trying to make it more fine than you're willing to because it's an estimate?
Robert Kreidler: I think you're looking really, really hard. I don't think we would say that.
William DeLaney: I think it's more about people being out and about, Andy, than it is who's open, who isn't.
Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets: I guess, last quarter you're feeling pretty good. You said it was the best quarter in a couple of years or so or maybe more, in case volume. And as I look at this quarter, it seems like a fairly abrupt shift. I know you're not saying it's completely rolled over, but it's rolled a lot. So what do you -- I guess, my question really is, do you think that's more something competitively going on where maybe you're being undercut in price or something or is it more the behavior, which I think you alluded to in your press release, but I just want to hear you talk about it, the behavior, the restaurant, tourists, how they're ordering, maybe they're being more cautious with supply, or maybe it's a trickling down to their customers, is the marketplace actually starting to change a little bit in terms of restaurant trips?
William DeLaney: I think, Andy, if you go back the last three quarters representative. I think these are -- I'm thinking I’m in the ballpark here, check with Neil, you can look it up later, but if you look at the fourth quarter, our real growth was around 2%, 3% in the first quarter, 1% this quarter, if you adjust for what Chris was talking about there, and if you give us that on the holiday phenomenon. So it's falling off some. I mean you're talking about gradations of a point. Comparisons are tougher. We're now beginning to wrap at least a flat quarter whereas in the first quarter, we were going against the down quarter. Some of it's in the math and some of it is the environment. And we're out there with 8,000 salespeople every day and with our account execs working with our top customers and all of our customers across the country and trying to strike the right balance between price and growth and supporting their efforts to run their business. So I think it's more the choppiness that I referred to that you're in a recovery right now that depending on what you pick up and who you read, the psychology is better, the underlying growth is a little uneven depending on the source. You have seen a big pick up in traffic but you are seeing bigger tickets when people go in. The QSR seems to be doing a little bit better. As you broaden the discussion to some of the articles you see on Retail, there's a little bit of a bifurcated recovery going on here with your higher-end consumers spending more than the regular people. That's a formidable expression there. So I just think there's a lot of different things going on here. And while we are, we believe, in the early stages of recovery, it's uneven, and I think you're going to see some uneven results. But all in all, I'm still feeling good about certainly our people and the effort and our ability to improve as we go forward.
Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets: And so in the press release, just to read from it, it said inflation, I think, caused a -- significant food cost inflation negatively impacted our customers' purchasing budgets. So I understand that for a consumer, the price of something goes up a lot, they've got to cut back elsewhere. But I guess, for a restaurant operator, if the price of meat goes up, why would they but less canned goods or something unless demand was down, less people are coming to the restaurants. So I'm just trying to -- or is there some shifting in their buying habits or did they sort of get cautious, I'm just trying to understand what that means, actually.
William DeLaney: So what I was trying to explain there is about a third of what we sell in terms of dollars and for the operator, what I was talking about earlier, these cases or boxes in these particular areas, they're expensive boxes. When you see 10% and 12% increases in significant cost items in terms of your inventory, it does force you to take a hard look at your spend budget in an environment where even if things are picking up, you're still extremely cost-conscious. It's just a general observation I think that the people, I think you agree with this, are still very, very focused on their bottom line and making sure that they're taking as much cost, they're managing their cost as well as they can. So we just have to high cost items, their commodities, it's very easy to identify what's going on in these marketplaces, and so they tend to be highly competitive items.
Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets: That did clarify it. Because I know how much rapid inflation does change behavior, until people sort of figure out where it's all going to spread out.
Operator: And our next question comes from Ajay Jain with Hapoalim.
Ajay Jain - UBS: Bill, I just wanted to follow up on that the earlier question about in terms of whether there's anything specific you're seeing that's causing your customers to buy less than compared to the last couple of quarters? And I wanted to ask you specifically if you're getting the same type of customer response to the strategic price investments as you did earlier in the year?
William DeLaney: Let me be clear, Ajay. I'm not saying that our customers are buying less. What I'm saying, we believe we had real volume growth and what I'm saying is they're very focused on their spend budget and they're very meticulous in terms of how they do spend their money. So on average, I'm not saying that they're spending less, I'm just saying that they're pretty locked in on what they're going to pay and all that type of thing, and rightfully so. As far as the initiatives, can you give me that question again?
Ajay Jain - UBS: Yes, I mean, do you think that you're getting the same type of sales lift or customer’s response to the strategic pricing investments as you did when the program was first initiated earlier?
William DeLaney: Well, again, these are different programs and there's different parts of the country that we’re rolling these out in. So I would say in the early stages, we're still seeing similar results. You heard me mention the word execution here a few times, so I mean, it does come down to how well we roll it. So it's not constant in every rollout. But generally, we're still seeing good results as you expect, Ajay, the competition does react to things. So to some extent, we've seen some reaction and we had to deal with that but we're pleased with what we're seeing at this point.
Ajay Jain - UBS: And from looking at Sysco for a while, I don't think it's totally unprecedented for you guys to have negative case volume trends when you're dealing with high single-digit inflation. So I'm just wondering if you can offer any comment on whether the inflationary pressures have gotten any worse in the current quarter and is there a potential that negative case volume trends could be a reality in the near term?
William DeLaney: Well, we hope not. I mean, what we're reading and what we sense is like I've mentioned here a couple of times is actually the psychology in the restaurant community and the operators is as good as it's been here for two or three years. We certainly hope that, that translates into higher purchasing levels over time. Yes, we're not at a negative level right now. Again, we're barely positive if you just look at the map. Maybe about 1% positive if you adjust for the holiday phenomenon. So I still think that we'll have a good opportunity to see volume growth through all the second half of the year. As far as this quarter in particular, I think as you know from following us from a long time, the month of March is a really important month as far as this quarter, both on the top line and the bottom line because of a lot of the seasonality. So that will drive a lot of results, and you haven’t heard us made a lot of excuses so far in this call but I think the bigger issue we're dealing with right now in the short term is weather. Obviously, last week was a very difficult week in a good part of the country, including down here Texas, believe it or not, actually saw in Dallas. We had some issues in the Southeast early in January. So we're actually -- when it's kind of a level playing field, we're pleased with the start in January but there are some weather issues out there, and the reality is that March is really going to drive the quarter.
Ajay Jain - UBS: I know you've been hiring some more marketing associates and making some adjustments in your headcount. But it looks like payroll costs were still up in the second quarter but at a lower rate than in Q1. So can you just talk about the pace of hiring right now based on the market conditions and whether you might be looking to cut back on payroll costs even further over the back half of the year?
William DeLaney: The payroll costs were up I think we've been pretty candid I think with everyone that if you go back and look at the last couple of years, we've taken a lot of headcount out of this company over the last few years. And so there's some limit on how much of that you can do in an environment where you still expect to grow albeit on a moderate level. With that said, we continue to prune and there's been some modest reductions throughout Sysco late fourth quarter, early first quarter. So we continue to do our job and certainly look at headcount and productivity and all that type of thing. As far as sales in particular, there's some operating companies where they have great opportunity relative to the market or perhaps they cut too far in the sales side, and we have invested in those companies a little bit more than, say, the rate of growth this year necessarily so. And I would certainly expect as we go into the new year, in our planning process, that our investment in sales people will be more commensurate with what we expect our growth to be.
Operator: Next we'll take a question from Mark Wiltamuth with Morgan Stanley.
Joseph Parkhill - Morgan Stanley: This is actually Joe Parkhill in for Mark. I was just wondering I don't know if you mentioned this already. But in the categories where you're seeing double-digit inflation, are you seeing any volume responses when you are passing some of the pricing through?
William DeLaney: Can you be a little more specific, you mean in terms of growth?
Joseph Parkhill - Morgan Stanley: So when you're passing through a portion of that double digit inflation, are your volumes getting affected by that?
William DeLaney: Actually, if you look at this on a relative basis, we're seeing decent volume growth in those particular categories, maybe even a little bit better than the other categories. I think we're out there, very aggressive. These are standard play items. These are items that typically, over the longer term, are very important to holding traction with accounts and so yes, it's an ebb and a flow and obviously, each situation is different. But generally, we've been able to grow the volume. It's just that the rate of the cost increases is 10%, 12%. And it's hard to -- we're growing the gross profit dollars to your point, it's just hard to grow the price point at that level and still make the sale. So it's a Catch-22, I guess, is what I'm trying to say.
Joseph Parkhill - Morgan Stanley: I mean, it sounds like your volume is doing well where you're making investments in price and then also these categories, I mean, is there a category out there that's weaker than what you expected?
William DeLaney: Yes, there is but I'm probably not going to get into that, Joe. There's always opportunities.
Joseph Parkhill - Morgan Stanley: And then just finally just from a modeling perspective, I mean can you help us a little bit on what SG&A will look like in the future? I mean, is this something that you're going to grow in line with sales? Or is there some initiatives that you have that could potentially leverage sales in the future?
Robert Kreidler: This is Chris, I'll jump in. Obviously, you've heard us talk about the ERP implementation and over time, we expect that we'll be able to leverage the SG&A line. That's not something that you should expect from us in the next couple of quarters. That's only after we roll out the initiative. I think one of the things you're seeing on the selling compensation line, of course, is the commission schedule basically pays on sales dollars to a great extent. And so when you have high inflation, you're going to unfortunately be paying more on the commission line and that's part of what's driving those sales costs up right now.
Operator: Next we'll take a question from John Ivankoe with JP Morgan.
John Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co: I remember last year when your sales looked a lot better than the restaurant industry, we talked about your non-restaurant accounts, which I think are about a third of your business doing a lot better. If there's some comment on the Institutional business, whether we should expect it to grow kind of in line with restaurants over time and just your observations there? And I have a couple of follow ups, as well.
William DeLaney: Yes, John, I think you should. A lot of that business as you know is more on the contracts side than the street, but certainly so. We're seeing good growth in those areas. We've got great relationships with some of the big players in those areas, and we certainly expect to grow those segments at least as fast as the traditional restaurant side of the business.
John Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Just looking at the second quarter relative to the first quarter in terms of the real sales, much of the reported restaurant industry actually, and I think you're sensitive to this, did show some improvement in the second quarter relative to the first quarter. And I'm sorry if you kind of touched on this a number of ways. Do you think competition is even more aggressive incrementally? Is there feeling better about their businesses, I mean, are you noticing an uptick in competition?
William DeLaney: I don't think I can say that. I mean, it's been pretty acutely competitive out there for the better part of a year and a half, two years. So I just think it hasn't subsided. I wouldn't want to say that it's stepped up at all, but it's... Sometimes you tend to think when the volumes come back and people start feeling a little bit better that the competitive forces might lessen some. We're not seeing that.
John Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co: And the final question, if I may, regarding some of the things that really hurt you on the gross margin line in the second quarter, arguably gotten worse in the third quarter, I mean some Dairy, certain Meat, certain Seafoods are kind of setting new, all-time highs. I mean, should we just accept gross margin decline for the back half of 2011 or is there anything that you can do to, perhaps with your pricing architecture with your customers to allow you to get back some of that lost margin?
William DeLaney: Well, we're not accepting it. To the degree that we can mitigate it, that'll be the tail of the tape here. But there are some structural things in the marketplace and just some basic market conditions that we've alluded to. But certainly, half a point of erosion for six months is not how we plan the year and that's not how we plan the second half of the year. So yes, we'll continue to look for improvement on the initiatives that we’ve talked about. We'll continue to work very closely with both our suppliers and our customers to find the right balance here on how all those pricing works its way through the system. So I would certainly hope that we've improved, I wouldn't expect it to totally dissipate.
Robert Kreidler: John, one of things we're watching for and you're starting to read it in the press a little bit is about the restaurant operators' willingness and ability to pass on some price increases to the ultimate consumer. That's not something that I think they were prepared to do during the very early stages of the recovery. You're starting to read in the press for some of them at least are thinking about doing that in 2011 and as part of that shift that I think we'd all like to see because that allows the supply chain to start passing through some of the cost increases as well.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And next we'll take a question from Greg Badishkanian with Citi.
Gregory Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc: Just wondering in the second fiscal quarter, how much does weather have an impact on your sales volumes?
William DeLaney: There were some weather, Greg. I think you saw in some of the restaurant reports in, I think, the Northeast in particular bore the brunt of it in December. It's hard to compare whether year-over-year, I'm sure we had some weather last year in December. I'd say it was a minor factor, certainly not big enough to call out in terms of the quarterly performance. But like I alluded to, I think so far in January, it's been big enough to call out.
Gregory Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc: Kind of looking out when you do your price initiatives in certain segments, what's the competitive reaction to that? Is there like a delayed reaction within a maybe a step-up pricing or do you just gain the volume and over time does something else happen to change that?
William DeLaney: Well, I think anytime a company that's positioned the way Sysco is in the industry does something in a very focused way, there's going to be a reaction. So I think it takes a while probably. These are done, like I mentioned, in different parts of the country at different times. And we're essentially talking under a street type of business. So I think sometimes it takes a while for the customer, I guess, in this case, more than the competitor to understand what we might be doing or not doing and then respond. So a short answer is it depends. But as I mentioned earlier, there's always going to be a reaction especially in this type of climate where the case growth is pretty modest.
Gregory Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc: Maybe you can just give us a few examples of some of those pricing initiatives that you've done, and I know you've talked about some of that in the past. For example, just maybe kind of just to make it a little bit more easier to understand?
William DeLaney: Actually, I don't recall talking about it in the past. We don't find it too often, but there's some competitive issues here. So I think we'll kind of keep it right where we have it.
Operator: And that does conclude our question and answer session for today, as well as our conference call. We do thank you for your participation, and have a great day.

===== 2011 Q1  (2010-11-08 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone. Welcome to the Sysco’s first quarter fiscal 2011 earnings results conference call. As a reminder, today’s call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I’d like to turn the call over to Neil Russell. Please go ahead, sir.
Neil Russell: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for Sysco’s first quarter 2011 conference call. On today’s call you will hear from Bill DeLaney, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Chris Kreidler, our Chief Financial Officer.

If you haven’t already registered, please do so prior to November 22. With that out of the way, I’ll turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill DeLaney.
Bill DeLaney: Thanks Neil, and good morning, everyone. This morning Sysco reported net earnings of $299 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Our sales in the first quarter increased 7.4%, driven mainly by increased case volume and estimated food cost inflation of 3.3%. Case volume was higher across all regions in our Broadline and SYGMA segments and the year-over-year increased represented the strongest improvement since the second quarter of fiscal 2007. While the pace of the macroeconomic recovery remains sluggish and restaurant traffic patterns continue to be under pressure, recent data suggests the industry is slowly recovering. Sysco’s gradual but consistent improvement in case volume confirms this trend and we believe we are continuing to grow our market share. We are pleased with our sales growth for the quarter and I should also note that we achieved record first quarter operating income. Nevertheless operating income growth over the prior year was less than our sales increase as improved expense management was more than offset by a 46 basis point decline in gross margin percent. Several factors contributed to the decline in gross margins. Approximately 10 points of the margin decline related to a change in business mix. While both our Broadline and SYGMA businesses grew this quarter, SYGMA grew at a faster rate and since SYGMA operates a lower margin business, this mix shift impacted total margins. We do not view this as a negative outcome. As a matter of fact, we see a great deal of opportunity on the contract side of the business, both from the Broadline and SYGMA segments. The key is to strike an appropriate balance between street and contract sales growth over time. The remainder of the gross margin decline was split about evenly between two drivers. The first is a set of ongoing strategic pricing initiatives designed to drive volume increases in targeted categories. While these initiatives are putting near-term pressure on our margins, we are starting to see double-digit volume increases where these programs have been effectively implemented. We expect this specific pressure on gross margins will persist in the near-term, but we also believe these initiatives will result in profitable market share gains over time. The last component of the gross margin decline relates to the significant raise of inflation in the meat, dairy and sea food categories which together approached 10%. While we typically are able to pass through modest levels of price inflation on a timely basis, it is more difficult in the short-term to pass through double digit price increases to our customers without negatively impacting their business. Our ongoing productivity initiatives helped to mitigate a portion of the gross margin pressure with U.S. Broadline warehouse cases per man hour and cases per trip increasing compared to last year’s first quarter. In addition, total sales per employee also increased year-over-year. All that said, while operating performance in the first quarter is acceptable, it’s not up to our standards. We recently held our annual senior leadership meeting at which the importance of profitable sales growth was thoroughly discussed. Our management team understands that we must find ways to grow our earnings faster than sales during these challenging times. Turning to our multi-year business transformation initiative for a moment, the project remains on track. We are preparing to begin the last of our four cycles of testing prior to go live with our pilot facility early next year. We’re also beginning to staff Sysco business services and have recently named Kirk Drummond to lead this strategically important part of our business. Kirk has been with Sysco for the last 24 years working in various capacities at our local operating companies and at corporate including five years as our Chief Information Officer and the last five years as our Senior Vice President and Treasurer. This organization will centralize back office administrative functions such accounting, receivables, payables, billing and call center support. I’d like to close by thanking our associates and our management team for their ongoing contributions and commitment to Sysco’s success. This is an excitement time in our company’s history and our associates continue to deliver a high level service and support to our customers. While our business is facing certain challenges, we remain dedicated to being our customers’ most valued business partner and to investing in the future growth of Sysco. We know this focus strengthens our competitive position and provides the strong foundation for success over the long-term. Now, I’ll turn things over to Chris so he can provide additional details on our financial results for the quarter.
Chris Kreidler: Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. For the first quarter, sales were $9.8 billion, or an increase of 7.4% compared to the prior year, driven mainly by case volume growth and the impact of food cost inflation which we estimate to be 3.3% for the period. In addition, acquisitions within the last 12 months increased sales by 0.6% and changes in foreign exchange rate increased sales by 0.5%. Operating income increased $9 million or 1.8% to $506 million during the quarter. While sales increased 7.4%, gross margin increased only 4.8% and operating expense increased 6%. Operating expense increased $75 million for the quarter due to three main drivers. First, salaries and related expense increased approximately $40 million, primarily from increased case volume during the quarter, including increased commissions and incentives and delivery personnel costs. Total headcount was down very slightly compared to the prior year, meaning we held our headcount levels relatively steady despite increased case volume. While total headcount is down, we’ve increased MA headcount over the last year. It typically takes one year to two years for an MA to be fully productive within the sales organization, but we consider this investment in the business to be an important one that will enhance our ability to grow sales as the industry recovers and continue to take market share. Second, as we had discussed on last quarter’s call, pension expense increased by $15 million year-over-year. Lastly, operating expense included a $14 million benefit from the impact of Corporate Owned Life Insurance or COLI, which is an unfavorable comparison to the $21 million benefit we recorded in the prior year. Net earnings for the first quarter were $299 million, declining $27 million or 8.3% compared to the prior year. Net earnings reflect a $39 million year-over-year increase in tax expense, primarily due to the IRS settlement gain and higher non-taxable COLI gains recorded in the prior year. Excluding the impact of COLI in both periods and the IRS settlement gain, net earnings for the quarter as adjusted would have increased 3.4%. In addition the $15 million year-over-year increase in pension expense impacted net earnings by another 2.8 percentage points. Earnings per share declined 7.3% to $0.51, which included a $0.02 benefit from COLI. In the prior year period, earnings per share were $0.55, and included a $0.05 gain related to the IRS settlement and a $0.04 benefit from COLI. Turning to cash flow; cash flow from operations for the fiscal year was $227 million compared to $42 million in the prior year. Cash flow from operations increased year-over-year due mainly to the timing of our IRS settlement payments. During the first quarter of this year we had no settlement payments, however in the prior year period we paid $316 million. We expect to pay a total of $212 million in settlement payments during this fiscal year and again next year. As a reminder, these scheduled payments include $106 million cash outflow in the second quarter period and a $53 million cash outflow in the third and fourth fiscal quarters. Cash flow from operations was negatively impacted during the quarter by an increase in accounts receivable and a decline in accrued expense. Receivables increased due to higher sales during the period, and the decline in accrued expenses this quarter was due mainly to the payment of incentive compensation related to the prior fiscal year. Capital expenditures totaled $143 million for the quarter including facility expansion and replacement, fleet replacements, and investments in technology including our business transformation project. In closing, while the business environment remains challenging, we’re seeing improvements and our operating companies continue to have a strong focus on growing cases, controlling costs, improving productivity, and successfully implementing our business transformation. As a result, we are confident that Sysco is well positioned to take advantage of the economic recovery as it takes hold. With that operator, we will now take questions.
Operator: (Operator instructions) And we’ll take our first question from Ajay Jain with Hapoalim Securities.
Ajay Jain: Hi, good morning. I just wanted to clarify a few things on the gross margin impact during the quarter. I think some of that decline I am sure is a little bit cosmetic because of the inflation impact And Bill, I think you already talked about the mix shift between SYGMA and Broadline, but as far as the strategic price investments that I think you cited in your press release, it seems at least to me a little bit unprecedented for Sysco to have to resort to discounting based on the way you guys have typically gone to market. So can you just talk about how far reaching these price investments are going to be over the rest of the year, and if you had to quantify how much of the 46 basis point decline was driven by price investments in this last quarter, is that something that you can quantify at all?
Bill DeLaney: I’ve given my best shot, and we’ll see where we end up here. So to repeat, of the 46 basis point decline we think about 10 basis point of that is the business mix of SYGMA versus the Broadline. So that leaves you a little over a third of a point of margin decline. Our best estimate is about half of that is we would attribute to pretty significant inflation in those three categories. I mentioned meat, dairy and seafood, and the other half I don’t know I’d call discounting or pricing so much as what we would characterize is as what we said is strategic category initiatives. Where we see opportunities, Ajay, where we are somewhat underpenetrated and we think it’s appropriate for us to get a little more focused and get a little more finely priced in those categories. So we’ve been into this year for a few months and I would expect that to continue here over a good portion of the balance of the year, but it’s not a random type of thing. Its distinct categories and we’re doing it in different parts of the country and over time throughout the country, and again, I would expect us to maybe not in 12 months, but over a reasonable period of time see it pay back there on the sales line.
Ajay Jain: So going forward, would the gross margin implications from these category management initiatives, with the magnitude be similar to this latest quarter?
Bill DeLaney: It’s actually hard to predict. I mean, there’s a lot of things that go in the gross margin, Ajay, but I would say, for this piece of the pie so to speak, I think as we said and I think as I said in the narrative, I expect the pressure to continue here for at least a couple more quarters. With that said, I think there’s other things we can manage better including the inflation part and that’s what we were alluding to in terms of our discussions with our management team. There is opportunities for us to manage this inflation environment somewhat better.
Ajay Jain: Just this one quick follow-up on the tax rate, I know there’s some variability each quarter based on stock compensation and COLI, but could you talk about what you’re assuming as far as a normalized tax rate for the rest of the year?
Chris Kreidler: Obviously, a normalized rate for Sysco is probably 38%, 39%. What’s going on with the tax rate is primarily driven by the IRS settlement last year and the COLI, both last year and this year. Those are the two main drivers that’s affecting the tax rate.
Ajay Jain: But as far as what you’re modeling in internally, is 38% to 39% representative of what we should be assuming as well?
Chris Kreidler: Well, that’s a normalized tax rate. I’m not really commenting about what we expect for the year, to be candid. We don’t really know what COLI is going to be for the full year. We start the year off assuming COLI is going to be flat. Obviously, it wasn’t flat in this first quarter. We got a benefit from it. We don’t really know what’s going to happen for the duration of the year. So I would say, yes, we started the year assuming 38% to 39%. We knew that we were going to have a lapping issue in the first quarter because of the things that happened in the first quarter last year.
Ajay Jain: Okay, thank you very much.
Chris Kreidler: Thank you.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Meredith Adler with Barclays Capital.
Meredith Adler: Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering since you were kind enough to give us a sense of how much of the gross margin was due to the strategic price investments, maybe you could talk a little bit about how much of the volume, the case volume increase we saw also came from those specific categories? I think you said in your prepared remarks that you did get a good response in sales in those categories.
Bill DeLaney: I’ll give it my best shot again here. I think in terms of putting that together, what we did say here is that we are seeing double digit increases in those categories where we effectively roll these initiatives out, and we’re not all the way through doing that. So it doesn’t transcend the entire book of business so to speak for the quarter, but we’re pleased with the sales growth that we are seeing. With that said there’s other categories as well that contributed to the sales growth and some of which were the same ones that had some pretty significant inflationary pressures. So its mix, I guess, so there’s not a direct correlation is the short answer.
Meredith Adler: And then I have a question about inflation. I know you said that you think that the operators could have done a better job passing it along, but maybe you could talk a little bit about the condition, I mean I am sure they all want to make money, so what the conditions might be that would be making it difficult for them to pass it along and is it fair to call that price competition?
Bill DeLaney: Well, what I said, I want to be really clear, because I see a lot of our people listening here too. I said we need to do better going forward. We are fine with the quarter, as I said it was acceptable. These are very interesting times in addition to being exciting times. So we got a situation out here where a year ago we had about 3.5 points of deflation, cases were going the wrong way. A year later we’re seeing just the opposite amount of inflation, and we’re encouraged by the case growth. If you look at it from our customer standpoint, if you go back three years we’ve been through an environment of two years of pretty significant inflation, a third year deflation, and now we’re into our fourth year here where inflation is picking up in these certain categories. So I’m not saying that we should have done better, I’m really just saying we need to do better going forward and our folks to understand that. In terms of how you manage that, essentially you manage it territory by territory, account by account, and you look at each situation and you’re always getting an eye at the operating company level, you’re always trying to strike the right balance between opportunities for growth and opportunities to more effectively, more productively service these accounts with the reality that our customers are running a business as well and we need to be sensitive to what their higher cost items are and what their key concerns are. That’s why we have 8,000 commission sales people out there, that’s why we have Presidents in all these operating companies as to make those decisions on an account by account basis, and overall from an enterprise standpoint we try to give them good guidance and feedback. And then on the contract side of the business, the inflation as we’ve talked before impacts a little different, most of the categories are contractually linked to some type of pricing mechanism, and there typically is up to a 30-day time lag from the time the products comes in to when the prices roll. So it depends on whether its street business or contract business.
Meredith Adler: And then I just have a final question, you were talking about that SYGMA business growing faster, and I just think you generally have opportunities on the contracted side. I was wondering whether the business transformation process is part of what needs to be accomplished for you to go after the contracted business more aggressively, and make sure that that brings at least a comparable financial benefit to the company because it’s obviously lower gross margin business.
Bill DeLaney: Well, I think the business transformation initiative is going to help us on both sides. It will definitely help us on the street side in terms of I think our sales people having better tools to work with, as well as our customers, and over time allowing our customers to participate I think more actively in what level of service the wanted, what types of price points, the whole channel opportunity there. On the contract side, we are starting to see this already, but to your point, I think we’ll see it more as we have better data and more integrated systems. Our big opportunity on the contract side is to create a more consistent face to the customer of all Sysco’s capabilities. So when you hear us speak about more effectively integrating our capabilities we’re talking about both on the merchandising and the sales side as well as across all of our different businesses, SYGMA, FreshPoint, Meat Company, Guest Supply, all those types of things. So I think the biggest opportunity on the contract side is just from an enterprise standpoint being able to go after this business more cohesively and that’s what we are looking forward to there.
Meredith Adler: Great, thank you very much.
Bill DeLaney: Thank you.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Mark Wiltamuth with Morgan Stanley.
Mark Wiltamuth: Hi, good morning. On the business transformation process, when do you think we start to see some of the cost savings falling out of that because it seems like there’s probably some duplicative efforts there at the operating company level versus the parent?
Chris Kreidler: As we talked about we finished the design of the business transformation process. We are going through testing, the fourth round of testing of that’s begin, and we’ll start to roll out sometime in the early part of next calendar year. We won’t actually start to see reductions in costs until we get further into the rollout process. That’s the schedule of numbers that we put up back in December at the Investor Day meeting, which we’ll update for you this December at the same time. So while we’ve outlined all the costs and the way we’ve been doing that is incremental net of benefits. You really don’t start seeing significant benefits until fiscal 2013, and in that year our current estimates again will be updated in December, but what we showed you last December was the benefits would offset the costs in 2013. So, it’d be about break even in that year, and then thereafter of course we’d see more benefits than costs.
Mark Wiltamuth: So we’ll watch for that update on the schedule. And then on the inflation, what do think is a comfortable level of inflation to pass through, where you can get it through and it doesn’t kind of shocks the system and you don’t have problems passing through margin there?
Bill DeLaney: I’ll let Chris start with that one, Mark, and…
Chris Kreidler: What we’ve always talked about is small amounts in inflation are great for us, one to maybe even three points of inflation. We can handle that and our customers can handle that. When you start spiking above that it causes some problems. We typically believe we can always manage those increases effectively, but maybe they may take more time to pass through the system. What we’re commenting about this quarter is three categories. Whereas Bill said, we saw inflation combined in those three categories of close to 10%, and that’s more than we can pass through in any timely manner. So one, two, three we can handle that, our customers handle that. When you start spiking across the board or in certain categories it gets more difficult, and these particular categories are meaningful (inaudible) especially are fairly high margin categories.
Bill DeLaney: The other point I think which I am sure most of you on this call understand is this challenge is not unique to our industry, and certainly not to us, there’s a lot of companies that are dealing with this growing inflation issue and the product mix right now. So we need to stay close to our customers and for that matter our suppliers and make good decisions and I believe you’ll see that we’ll do that.
Mark Wiltamuth: Okay, thank you.
Bill DeLaney: Thanks Mark.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Greg Badishkanian with Citigroup.
Jeff Hans: Hi, guys, this is Jeff Hans actually on behalf of Greg. Following up on the strategic pricing initiatives that you guys have rolled out and as it relates to the overall environment, what are you seeing from your competitors, I guess kind of following those initiatives in those specific markets and I guess just overall, I mean is the environment still pretty competitive versus where it’s been the last few quarters?
Bill DeLaney: I’d say the competitive environment is just I think it’s comparable to where it’s been, people are very still very acutely sensitized to case growth and volume growth and getting people into restaurants and their operations that type of things. So I don’t think there’s been a lot of change there. It will be hard for us to gauge any competitive reaction to this. What I would just say again is that we’re seeing some good results on our end. So that’s coming from some place and we are just pleased with what we are seeing and the only point we are trying to make today is it did impact our margin and probably will here for a couple more quarters anyway, but we think it’s an appropriate opportunity for us to take advantage of.
Jeff Hans: Just one last one I guess in terms of the trend in case volume growth into October and maybe early November, did that kind of continue at the rate you saw in your fiscal 1Q and also kind of the rate of inflation I guess in October-November as well that accelerated or just stayed constant?
Bill DeLaney: We don’t typically a lot of guidance or updates in terms of the quarter, but I think I would say this to you; there has been I think favorable stand in the marketplace we tried to signal that in our comments earlier this morning. We’re encouraged with the volume growth that we’re seeing right now and at the same time, what we’re reading what we feel on our side of the business I don’t think the inflation is going to abate any time soon.
Jeff Hans: Thanks so much.
Bill DeLaney: Yes.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Andrew Wolf with BB&T Capital Markets.
Andrew Wolf: Good morning.
Bill DeLaney: Hi, Andy.
Andrew Wolf: I guess just a question popped in my head as you answered last question. What is prompting price competition in an improving environment, it seems counter intuitive in most industries and certainly how food service distribution as I know that has historically structured the industries as a lot, they got better, price competition eased seems counterintuitive?
Bill DeLaney: While I’ll take a shot at this, if I don’t get it Andy, come back to me. We need to put this in some type of context, this industry has always been highly competitive, there is a lot of competitors out there, there is lot of different people with different business models and different agenda, there is always competition. I think maybe to your point we’re in a inflection point now and the cycle I was trying to describe earlier is, if you look at it over three year period I am no food services story, but I don’t know that we’ve ever had a three year period like this, where we had two years of lot of inflation and put lot of pressure on our customers, then you have a year of deflation. Now we’re finally starting to see some case growth and we think the industry has shown a little good signs of recovery, but there’s still a lot of sensitivity out there at the operator side and the distributor side in terms of growth and how we continue to based upon our respective businesses. So this favorable turn reminds us, let’s be clear we’re talking about may be 2% or 3% growth in our line of business. We’re not talking 7% or 8% real growth. So I think it’s still very, very competitive out there and I think people’s memories are a long right now and everyone is doing everything that he can to not just improve their business but to be prepared for any surprises that come down right here over the next six months to 12 months. So I think it’s more just a weighted impact of what we’ve been through the last two, three years.
Chris Kreidler: I am going to jump in and just have one thing. I think we’ve mentioned it, but there it’s mentioning it again. Last year at this time we were reporting deflation of I think 3.4% in our number. We went from a negative 3.4% to positive 3.3% in fairly short year of time and that we’d saw that volatility causes a lot of uncomfortable out there in the market. So we’re going that it’s.
Bill DeLaney: A few point, we have an opportunity managers better as I said and we’re committed to doing that.
Andrew Wolf: Let me ask you specifically on this DMA, this consortium of regional. If they just want to I think the McCormick & Schmick contract from you guys was that un-priced and if so what I am trying to figure out is how deep is this price competition and is that what you would consider just kind of normal give and take and there is plenty of stuff you want or is the capacity utilization that some of the distributor might be at, it’s own inflection point where the marginal cost are de minimis as well be it kind of low end contracts, I’m just trying to understand a little more whether market dynamics are the way they are?
Bill DeLaney: Yes. I think the only thing I’m going to comment on specifically as it relates to McCormick & Schmick we’re disappointed we lost the business, it was good business for us. In terms of what triggered that decision, I’m not exactly sure of probably all the above. With that said, we’re encouraged with what we’re doing right now in the contract side both in SYGMA and on the multi unit sales portion of our Broadline business here Larry Pulliam, and Kent Humphries and their team. We’ve got a lot of momentum there, we’ve made some organization moves and we’re much more focused on segments and that type of thing. We’ll talk more about it in December. We never wanted this business that’s something we’re working very hard on throughout our company to minimize those situations. But I can tell you we’re bringing on business as well and we feel very good about the direction in that area.
Andrew Wolf: And the last thing, we aren’t using pricing to win business and share, is it more getting actually new customers or is it more expanding into new lines with existing customers and kind of getting to sometimes in this industry, if you win customers and then margins kind of normalize?
Bill DeLaney: It’s a little bit of both. I don’t know that I can break that down for you. Certainly the most profitable sale we can make is in incremental sale with an existing customer. So I think there is plenty of opportunity there, it’s also an opportunity to put our best foot forward with prospects. I think it’s both.
Andrew Wolf: The last thing, as I must missed this on the SAP; could you give us the impact, the earnings impact?
Bill DeLaney: We didn’t comment about it because it was not a material change quarter-over-quarter and our guidance has not changed from the 10-K.
Andrew Wolf: Okay, thank you.
Bill DeLaney: Thank you, Andrew.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.
John Ivankoe: Great, thank you. Actually it’s just a follow-up on my previous question. Over the last couple of years, your case volume has significantly exceeded that of restaurant traffic as I understand it is reported by the chains, and so the question is, where has your sales growth come from, has it come from sales to existing accounts or as you just mentioned lower margin sales to new accounts, what do you anticipate that mix in general going forward and do you have a good sense for your existing accounts, how your share has changed over the past couple of years, and is there like a medium term target we could possible think about?
Bill DeLaney: Is that it?
John Ivankoe: Yes, it’s really one question.
Bill DeLaney: John, it’s similar to Andy’s, I mean, I think it’s I’m going to need you come back I think but essentially it’s coming from both. I mean, we certainly want to participate in the growth of our existing customers, we are everyday out there trying to improve our share of wallet with those folks, and we do believe we’ve been able to do that. Now that’s hard to quantify, and hard to sometime say with a straight face when the industry has been in decline for a year to two years. But we certainly think that we’ve taken, improved our share of wallet, and taken share for that matter in all segments. So I think what’s helped us a little bit in the overall numbers relative to the restaurant numbers is about 30% of our business or a little bit more than that, 35% I guess, is non-restaurant business. So we continue to do well in the institutional side of things and that’s certainly been a buffer for us through these difficult times. But our approach and our model hasn’t changed. We want to grow with our current customers. We want to help them grow, but as we’ve talked before, and we’ll talk in more in December, there is plenty of opportunity for us both on the street side as well as the contract side of this business to bring on new business. The last piece of this and the part that we continue to focus on even more is to protect the business that we have and ensure those customers have been very well to us over the years.
John Ivankoe: Okay, understood, thanks for the color.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Bob Summers with Susquehanna.
Bob Summers: Hey, good morning. I’m just trying to get my arms around the variable labor component of the model a little bit and understand, and I appreciate this is a big picture look, but why an $84 million increase in gross profit dollars drives about a $40 million increase in salaries and related items, so I guess on the surface that seems a rather aggressive path?
Bill DeLaney: Well, I’ll start, but I think Chris got some more specifics on this still, but essentially what we try to explain is, just in general you’ve got some incentive increases there at the management side. Bob, we here just talked about productivity improvements, we’re pleased, and we continue to be pleased with what we’re seeing on the operational side of the business as well as on the admin side now. But one thing we have done and we talked about this, and we’ll continue to do is we have more aggressively invested in our sales force here over the last six months or so and those numbers are beginning to populate themselves both in terms of the numbers of MAs on the street as well as trainee. So that does translate into higher commissions with the sales growth and into higher fixed investment on the selling payroll side as we try to get back on track in terms of our headcount in sales. Without being real specific here, I am just trying to bifurcate that for you in terms of we’re pleased with what we’re seeing operationally on the admin side in terms of productivity, but we are investing in sales folks, and have been over the three to six months. Chris, do you wanted to?
Chris Kreidler: I think you actually have the numbers, I mean, obviously, we started with a gross margin number that was lower than we would have liked, and then the payout came out of that lower number. It comes back to leverage and you’re specifically focusing on the labor side of the equation, I think that’s the answer.
Bob Summers: And then second, can you just talk a little bit about Sysco brand sales? If I am looking at this table that you have in the back properly, did the penetration rate go down?
Chris Kreidler: Yes, that’s a trend that we’ve seen now for the better part of two years. So our brand sales are off, and as we’ve been talking we’re concerned about that to a point. Obviously you need to sell customers what it is that they need and they want, but we do have some opportunities there and internally we are doing a lot of work in that area, and I think you’ll see some progress there, but it takes a while to move the needle on that, but we are very focused on that. But again we need to approach that in a way that works for the customer base and that’s the balancing act that we’re dealing with at this point.
Bob Summers: Right. Agreed, but if I were to think of is there intending gross margin drag associated with that change, I’m just trying to think through another component of the gross margin?
Bill DeLaney: There can be, but it tends to get woven into the other factors, the other two factors I was talking about. So I can’t tell you that I can call it out specifically, but certainly over time I think it’s clear that when we are able to sell Sysco branded items that that does translate to more leverage on the earnings line.
Bob Summers: Okay, great, thank you.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim.
John Heinbockel: Bill, so couple of things. If you think about managing the inflation part better, is that just kind of a willingness to pass through more and more quickly or is it something different in terms of how you buy source, get product into the warehouse, which are the two, or is it all of those.
Chris Kreidler: Look, I know some little bit like a buffer, it’s a little at the latter and a lot of the former I think so. There is always opportunities as we work with our suppliers to make sure that we’re controlling our cost and we do a good job with that, and we certainly worked very hard on that. The flip side of this is I think we are signaling to you in terms of where we’re at and what we need to do is really more about focus I think. We’ve got the best people in the industry out there, we’ve got great presence, we’ve got 8,000 sales people, they’ve great GSMs working with them. So, it’s essentially what I was talking about earlier, which is looking at each customer, each territory, each operating company and just making good decisions and striking the right balance for, in terms of what the customers keeping new jar and what we need and how that translates into moving boxes versus price versus cost efficiency. So I’m going to just leave that focus internally, where we think we can do better than what we have and expect that we will over time.
John Heinbockel: Have you seen, as the inflation dampened yet particularly where we’ve had the 10% inflation or you haven’t seen that yet?
Bill DeLaney: No, I can’t say that we have seen that, we’re seeing pretty good growth in some of those categories.
John Heinbockel: On the selective price investments, so you’ve got double digit case volume improvement. Does that exceed the amount of price reduction or similar to it or how does that compare?
Bill DeLaney: You need more than just double digit to make that working in the short-term. So what you heard me say John was that I think there is opportunities out there for us, but it may take more than a year to get the full payback on that type of initiative.
John Heinbockel: So it sounds like the investment is in excess of the double digit case volume and you’re hoping to mature into whatever the price investment was?
Bill DeLaney: Let me try to be clear here. What I’m saying is, we see opportunities in these particular categories, we’re making some investment in it. We’re rolling it out in different parts of the country at different time. There is somewhat of a cascading effect here and it’s not a six month payback, that’s what I’m trying to say.
John Heinbockel: Do you expect to get a lift where you’re making those price reductions get a lift not just in those categories, but strategically important in terms of lifting the customers total purchases with you or you haven’t really built that into…
Bill DeLaney: Excellent point and that’s all part of it. That’s why we used the word strategic here which is some of that opportunity is to solidify relationships with customers and grow not just on those items but within that category and ideally cost categories. So that’s exactly what we’re trying to do here.
John Heinbockel: Final question. The three cycles you’ve done on the rolling out the enterprise and package, what have you learnt, is there anything that jumps out negatively or positively that might have been different than you thought?
Bill DeLaney: We’ve learnt; its lot of hard work. We got people working lot of hours down here and there is lot of complexity a lot of detail to it, and we are staying the course, we’re doing everything we can to minimize the surprises once we go to the first part out here.
John Heinbockel: All right, thanks.
Operator: (Operator instructions) And we’ll take our next question from Bob Cummins with Wellington Shields.
Bob Cummins: Thank you and good morning, everybody. I wonder if you could give us a broad overview on the state of the restaurant industry in general now, are we in an early stage of recovery, are the operator still complaining, is the business still down. Where are we going, are we in up trended as yet?
Bill DeLaney: There is a part of me that wants to say yes. Certainly the signs we’ve seen since late summer Bob are encouraging. Some reports are coming out and data, both in terms of what the restaurants are seeing in terms of their volume and getting folks into their businesses as well as the sentiment, we’re seeing the psychology pick up a little bit and the optimism pick up ever so slightly, but everything helps here. I think we are beginning to see some things that we’ll hopefully lead to more positive growth for the industry. With that said, I think what we’re also continuing to see is the strongest operators are doing the best, as it is in our situation and the distribution side. It’s definitely better than it was a year ago and we believe it’s certainly better than it was maybe six months ago. It’s still somewhat tenuous, but if you are good operator out there today I think overall you’re starting to see some good signs.
Bob Cummins: Great, that’s very helpful.
Operator: With that being our last question that concludes today’s conference. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2010 Q4  (2010-08-16 10:00:00) =====
Executives: Neil Russell – Vice President, Investor Relations Bill DeLaney – President and CEO Chris Kreidler – Chief Financial Officer
Analysts: Meredith Adler – Barclays Capital Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets Greg Badishkanian – Citi Jason Whitmer – Cleveland Research Company Mark Wiltamuth – Morgan Stanley Neil Currie – UBS John Ivankoe – JPMorgan
Operator: Please standby. Good day, everyone. Welcome to the Sysco Announces Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2010 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today’s call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I’d like to turn the call over to Mr. Neil Russell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Neil Russell: Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for Sysco’s fourth quarter and fiscal year 2010 conference call. On today’s call you will hear from Bill DeLaney, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Kreidler, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, please note that statements made in the course of this presentation that state the company’s or management’s intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results could differ in a material manner. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ in a material manner from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company’s SEC filings including, but not limited to, risk factors contained in the company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 27, 2009, and in the company’s press release issued earlier this morning. As disclosed in our earnings release this morning, our operating results this year included an extra week of operations due to the timing of the last day of our fiscal year. As a result, the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 included 14 weeks of operations, compared to the fourth quarter last year, which included 13 weeks. And fiscal year 2010 included 53 weeks of operations, compared to the prior year, which included 52 weeks. On the call today, we will discuss year-over-year comparisons that include the impact of the extra week of operations. However, to provide financial results that are more comparable on a year-over-year basis, certain metrics will be provided which remove the estimated impact of the extra week. These adjusted metrics are non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the applicable GAAP measures on our Investor Relations website at sysco.com. Also, all comments about earnings per share refer to diluted earnings per share, unless otherwise noted. Lastly, we ask that you reserve December 2nd on your calendars for our Analyst Day in New York. Additional information will be provided in the next couple of weeks. With that out of the way I’ll turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill DeLaney.
Bill DeLaney: Thank you, Neil, and good morning, everyone. I’d like to begin this morning by recognizing our management team and all of our associates for both their commitment and hard work. They kept their full attention on servicing our customers and effectively managing expenses throughout a second consecutive challenging year. This morning Sysco reported net earnings of $338 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. We were pleased to see case volumes once again increase year-over-year. While we have seen no consistent pattern of improvement on a week-to-week basis, we are encouraged by the fact that we have now experienced positive volume comparisons for the past several months. In addition, we experienced food cost inflation as measured by the estimated change in our cost of goods during the fourth quarter for the first time in a year. Specifically, inflation contributed approximately 2.2% of our overall sales growth for the quarter, driven mainly by higher prices in the dairy, meat and produce categories. I’m particularly pleased with how well our operating companies continue to manage their expenses. Along with supporting the growth of our customers, improving our operational effectiveness remains a key area of focus throughout Sysco. While industry conditions are more favorable than they were a year ago, our marketplace remains highly competitive. This environment has increased pricing pressures which we have and will continue to work through with our customers. Specifically, we focus our efforts on differentiating our product and service offerings, more effectively utilizing our scale to better integrate our enterprise-wide capabilities and reducing our cost structure overtime. We believe that we’ve been able to take share as a result of these efforts. Reflecting on the entire fiscal year, we sold more than $37 billion of product, shipped more than 1.2 billion cases, generated $2 billion of operating income, recognized record earnings of $1.99 per diluted share, produced cash flow from operations of $885 million and distributed $580 million of dividends to our shareholders. Turning to our multi-year business transformation initiative for a moment, we currently have more than 300 people dedicated full-time to the project. Over the past two years, we have completed much of the design and technology development work and are currently testing systems and processes. The project that we track and we currently expect our first operating company to go live early next calendar year. Subsequent rollouts will occur in waves of 5 to 10 operating companies through the end of 2013. This project is the single most important initiative we have undertaken since the formation of Sysco. As previously communicated, we are investing significant amounts of financial and human capital to better position Sysco for profitable sales growth for years to come. We will continue provide periodic updates as we move forward with the work. On last quarter’s call, we discussed the new operational leadership structure we were preparing to put in place. Mike Green is now leading the U.S. Broadline companies and Larry Pulliam is overseeing Contract Sales, Sigma, Distribution Services and the Specialty companies. Additionally, we have recently realigned our U.S. Broadline leadership responsibilities into 11 geographic markets. These changes became effective with the beginning of our new fiscal year. This new structure enhances our go-to-market strategy, allows us to more effectively implement our business transformation project, helps us develop and strengthen customer relationships across over local lines and improves our approach to building our pipeline of acquisitions. In addition, the new organization structure provides a broader platform to further develop our most talented and experienced leaders now and in future. I would like to close my prepared comments this morning in the same manner in which I began, by thanking our 46,000 associates for their efforts and engagement over the past year. While encouraged by volume trends that continue to be favorable, we recognize that the broader economic climate may remain tenuous for some time. Accordingly, we are committed to aggressively deploying all of Sysco’s resources and capabilities moving forward to effectively support our customers and fully realize the opportunities available to us in the $200 billion food service industry. Now, I’ll turn things over to Chris, so he can provide additional details on our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year.
Chris Kreidler: Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. What I’d like to do first this morning is provide a brief summary of the formal GAAP results. These GAAP results include the impact of the extra week of operations that Neil mentioned earlier. That means these numbers compare 14 weeks of operations in the fourth quarter of 2010 to 13 weeks in the fourth quarter of 2009 and 53 weeks of operations in fiscal 2010 to 52 weeks in fiscal 2009. On a GAAP basis for the fourth quarter, sales were $10.3 billion, an increase of 13.9% compared to the prior year and operating income was $584 million, an increase of 8.1% compared to the prior year. Net earnings were $338 million, an increase of 7.1% and earnings per share were $0.57, compared to $0.53 in the prior year or an increase of 7.5%. On a GAAP basis for the year, sales were $37.2 billion, an increase of 1.1% compared to the prior year and operating income was $2 billion, an increase of 5.5% compared to the prior year. Net earnings were $1.2 billion, an increase of 11.7%. Earnings per share were $1.99 compared to $1.77 in the prior year or an increase of 12.4%. As I mentioned, those year-over-year comparisons on a GAAP basis are not comparable because that extra week of operations in the fourth quarter impacts all the year-over-year comparison. So what I’d like to do now is discuss our results for the quarter and year excluding the impact of that extra week. That means these adjusted numbers compare 13 weeks of operations in the fourth quarter of 2010 to 13 weeks in the fourth quarter of 2009 and 52 weeks of operations in fiscal 2010 to 52 weeks in fiscal 2009. This should give you a better sense for what’s going on in our business and is the same basis the management team has been using to analyze our financial results. On an adjusted basis for the quarter, sales increased 5.8% compared to the prior year, driven mainly by case volume growth and the impact of food cost inflation, which we estimated to be 2.2% for the period. In addition, changes in foreign exchange rates increased sales by 1.3%. Adjusted operating income was essentially flat in the fourth quarter, increasing only 0.4%. Adjusted operating expenses were higher in the fourth quarter by $76 million. The increase was primarily due to $30 million charge related to Corporate Owned Life Insurance or COLI and $29 million in higher incentive compensation expense. Bonus accruals were lower last year in the fourth quarter because we did not meet all our 2009 performance objectives. However, based on the financial results announced today, we met certain 2010 performance objectives and have accrued for bonuses accordingly. Additionally, gross margin was slightly lower, which we largely attribute to the pricing pressure as Bill mentioned earlier. Adjusted net earnings for the fourth quarter were $314 million and were essentially flat compared to the prior year, declining less than $2 million. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.53, including a $0.02 negative impact from COLI. In the prior year period, earnings per share were also $0.53, but included a $0.03 positive impact from COLI. Turning to the year-over-year comparisons, while sales declined 0.9% for the year on an adjusted basis, it really was a year with two distinctly different halves. The first half of the year was marked by deflationary pressures across most food categories and case volumes that were negative year-over-year. Consequently, sales in the first half were down 5.7%. However, in the second half of the year, deflation moderated and turned inflationary while case volumes began to increase year-over-year. As a result, sales in the second half of the year increased 4.1%. Throughout the year we managed our costs very aggressively with particular focus on pay related costs. At the end of the fiscal year, headcount was down 2.2%, demonstrating this progress. This is on top of the 6% reduction achieved in fiscal 2009. Our sales per employee has increased 1.3% this year and 5.7% over the last two years. We continue to implement and see benefits from our various operating initiatives, which helped us leverage more of our sales to the bottom line. Adjusted operating expenses declined $132 million or 2.6% in fiscal 2010, compared to fiscal 2009. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily the result of more than $70 million reduction in fuel expense, a $65 million favorable change related to COLI and a $40 million decline in bad debt expense. These decreases were partially offset by a $37 million increase in company’s sponsored pension expense. As a result, adjusted operating income increased $62 million or 3.3% to $1.9 billion for the fiscal year. Adjusted net earnings for fiscal 2010 were $1.2 billion, an increase of $100 million or 9.5% compared to the prior year. Adjusted EPS was $1.95, aided by a $0.05 tax benefit related to the company’s IRS settlement announced in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 and a $0.04 favorable impact from COLI. EPS in the prior year period was $1.77, which included a $0.07 negative impact from COLI. This is the end of our discussion of the results of operations on a non-GAAP basis. Comments from here forward in the call reflect GAAP amounts. Turning to a brief discussion or brief update on our business transformation initiative, the project decreased diluted EPS this fiscal year by approximately $0.02. This resulted lower than the $0.03 estimate we provided on our third quarter call, due primarily to timing and our ability to capitalize more cost than anticipated. Turning to cash flow, cash flow from operations for the fiscal year was $885 million, compared to $1.6 billion in the prior year period. Cash flow from operations in the current period was impacted by IRS settlement payment totaling $528 million and early pension contribution payment for fiscal 2011 totaling $140 million. We now paid more than half of the total IRS settlement amount and will pay approximately $212 million per year in fiscal 2011 and 2012 to the pave of our normal estimated tax payments. Due to the timing of those tax payments during our fiscal years, there is no cash impact on our first quarter, fiscal quarter of either year, $106million cash outflow in each second quarter period and a $53 million cash flow in each of the third and fourth fiscal quarters. Capital expenditures totaled $157 million for the quarter and $595 million for the year in line with our guidance. Spending for the year included investments in technology including our business transformation project, fleet replacement and purchase of a facility for our future shared services operation and replacement or expansion of facilities in Vancouver, Toronto, Houston, Philadelphia and Plainfield, New Jersey. In July, we announced the acquisition of Lincoln Poultry & Egg Company in an all cash deal. Lincoln Poultry serves more than 800 customers located mainly within the central United States and generates approximately $200 million in annual revenues. We believe that their high quality operations and strong customer relationships will be an excellent growth opportunity for Sysco. As discussed previously, we continue to be active in the acquisition market, working to identify opportunities that we believe may be a good fit for us. Looking ahead into next year, there are a couple of important items that we want you to keep in mind as you think about fiscal 2011. First, fiscal 2011 will be a 52-week year. The 53-week anomaly we had in fiscal 2010 occurs every six years. The next year we have this issue again will be in fiscal year 2016. And second, we recognized certain gains during the year to be mindful of, a one-time tax benefit of $29 million in the first quarter of this year related to our IRS settlement and $22 million in total gains related to COLI that impacted operating income throughout the year. In addition, we are also providing a few guidance metrics for the year ahead. We expect capital spending for fiscal 2011 to be in the range of $700 million to $750 million as we continue to invest in our business, including $160 million to $180 million of capital related to our business transformation project. We expect pension expense for the year to be approximately $60 million higher than fiscal 2010. This increase is primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate used to determine pension expense, which is in turn driven by the significant decline in long-term interest rates over the last year. Finally, we estimate the net impact of the business transformation project will reduce EPS by $0.06 to $0.09. This range is a bit lower than the projections we provided last December at our Investor Day and is primarily attributable to our ability to capitalize more of the cost of the project. In closing, while the business environment in fiscal 2010 was challenging, our operating companies did a great job of managing through those challenges with a strong focus on growing cases, reducing costs and improving productivity. That focus has continued into the New Year and we are confident that Sysco is well positioned to successfully address the new challenges and opportunities that we will experience in fiscal 2011. With that, operator, we will now take questions.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We’ll take our first question today from Meredith Adler with Barclays Capital.
Meredith Adler – Barclays Capital: Thanks very much. First question I would like to ask is just, if you could talk a little bit more about the competitive environment. You talked about a lot of pricing pressures. Could you just maybe elaborate on that a little bit?
Bill DeLaney: Good morning, Meredith. This is Bill. Yeah, it’s -- we’ve been talking about it really for the better part of a year, I guess. And what we’re seeing out there is I think what you’re seeing across all the spectrum of the economy right now. Our customers are doing everything they can to improve their service to their customers and at the same time manage their bottom line more effectively and part of the equation is to get more people in their restaurants and part of it is managing cost. So we’re regularly working with customers on how to do that. As I mentioned in my comments, we tend to focus largely on differentiating ourselves and giving them a lot of the value added services that we talked about in the past. From a pricing standpoint, I think probably about this time a year ago was when it really I think went to another level and it continues to be quite competitive out there. So as you know and as we’ve talked before, the way we manage the business here is we obviously focus on the top line and then we focus on the bottom line and then we try to manage our expenses in a way that will leverage that and at the same time offset any gross margin pressures we may see.
Meredith Adler – Barclays Capital: Great. And then I just have another question, maybe if you could talk about sales. Is there anything that you can point out, either regionally or type of customer, where you’re seeing either the greatest improvement or the least improvement, anything that kind of stands out?
Bill DeLaney: Yeah. We look at that. Now, we’ve got all different ways to slice and dice it here with the new organizational structure and we look at it weekly and monthly and quarterly and it would be -- I would be hard-pressed to tell you there’s any one region that’s particularly outperforming another or -- Florida continues to be difficult. This is going on for years now. Hopefully, we’re going to start seeing some improvement down there. But I can’t really tell you geographically that there’s a big trend or variability one way or another. As far as the customer mix, that’s an interesting question because as with all numbers, whether you’re talking about your earnings or your sales or your margins or your mix, you’ve got to look at where you were last year and where you are now. So there are different views out there in terms of what the industry is seeing. I would say that we’re seeing about the same performance both on the QSRs, we’re seeing on, say, the meat companies as what we’re seeing on the more family-oriented dining with our Broadliners but for different reasons. QSR, I think those numbers seems to be performing quite well right now but the top line comparisons are a little tougher than a year ago. On the meat company side, we’ve had two really, really hard years there. As you can appreciate, the bulk of that business is, at least a large percentage of it is high end and that’s been very difficult segment of the market. Our numbers are actually starting to improve there albeit off of two tough years. And then in the family dining, I’d say pretty much mirrors the market. So at least from our perspective, we’re not seeing a lot of changes but part of that is the baseline.
Meredith Adler – Barclays Capital: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Next, we’ll hear from Andrew Wolf with BB&T Capital Markets.
Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets: Thanks. Good morning. Want to follow up on the question on competition. Just when you think about the source or when you ask about the source of your operators, is this other competitors coming in with just lower pricing or is it more chains and maybe even some of the bigger independents, let say, or what have you, actually kind of bidding it out, calling up and saying we need relief, let’s try to create an option for our business?
Bill DeLaney: Well, Andy, I think it’s both of those. They tend to be interrelated but it’s more than that. I mean, it’s also us understanding the depth of the relationships we have with our customers and understanding that even though the environment is better than it was a year ago. It’s still very tough environment out there for any business and so we spend a lot of time, invests a lot of resources both with our Street customers and our contract customers to stay close to them and understand what their needs are and try to be as proactive as we can. So in fairness, is there more of that, what you described probably going on today than there was a couple years ago, probably, and are we dealing with it effectively? I think so. But the reality is, this business is always very competitive and the margins are relatively slim. So it’s a combination of us being proactive and then in certain situations reacting to the specific needs of our customers, which tend to be precipitated by the competition.
Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets: Thanks. So I mean, let’s say we’re in a new economy that doesn’t really have a robust rebound. Do you think the attributes of demand for food service distribution might have shifted more towards the price and away from quality and reliability or could, theoretically have shifted if things don’t pick up?
Bill DeLaney: I don’t think it’s a shift. I mean, I think it’s just a deeper or more acute emphasis but certainly in terms of how we look at the business, both from ourselves and as we work with customers, if you don’t have a topline, it’s very difficult to leverage anything. So certainly you want to make sure your product costs are in line and that your operating costs, you need to continue to get more productive and more efficient. But I don’t think you ever want to move away from what the customer expects relative to your particular eating establishment. So service will continue we think to be very, very important. I think it starts there and -- but with that said, we are in a slower growth environment. We understand that and that’s why you see us both in the short-term over the last few years as well strategically, be very focused on reducing our cost structure over time, that will give us more latitude to continue to compete well.
Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets: And just last follow-up on the sales environment. It strengthened at least for the quarter and I understand you’re saying the weeks, week by week, it’s still somewhat erratic and I understand that to mean. Your customers are obviously having variable results and so forth. But if you look at it on a monthly basis and include July because the advanced sales from commerce looked pretty good for July, is there any discernable pattern? Obviously, I’m trying to see if it’s up or sideways, can’t be down I suppose -- could be down, I guess. But are you seeing any signs of strengthening when you look for the quarter through July?
Bill DeLaney: Andy, I think what we’re trying to address in those comments was we’ve had several months now going back. I think if you look at last year, Chris talked about two halves, let’s break it into thirds. I mean, the first third we were in pretty deep dive both on the case volume and on the deflation. And we started to see that turn in November and then it did turn in December and last several months. So we’re continuing to see case growth even into July. We continue to see comparable inflation. The point we’re trying to make there is what we haven’t seen is kind of a step-up in that rate of growth and we would like to see that but the reality is we haven’t seen that, from week to week, it will move around and that could be as simple as just how the calendar falls. So the point we’re just trying to sensitize it to, it’s choppy but it’s definitely still positive. And to your point there are mixed messages that are coming out of the industry trade right now.
Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets: Thanks and that’s very helpful. I appreciate.
Operator: Our next question will come from Greg Badishkanian with Citi.
Greg Badishkanian – Citi: Great. Thanks. And just as a follow-up on the sales question, obviously very, very robust volumes relative to how the economy is doing. Market share have anything to do with versus your other distribution competitors?
Bill DeLaney: Greg, could you repeat that?
Greg Badishkanian – Citi: Are you seeing market share gains driving that acceleration in the real sales volume or is it strictly kind of the overall market kind of lifting?
Bill DeLaney: No, we look at it -- first of all, let say, it’s hard to precisely answer that question. The industry numbers continue to get updated but we think which tends to be where we go for a lot of our perspective. We think you’re going to see a second year that’s down. So you’re looking at two years where the industry has been down. And we’re flattish to maybe up a little bit, depending how you look at the numbers. So we think we’re taking share, it’s just hard to get too aggressive with that comment when the industry is down like that. So no, we’re taking share on a relative basis and we believe if you look at the industry information that people are in the medium term a little more optimistic than they were six or 12 months ago for future growth of the market, although in the short term it’s not so clear.
Greg Badishkanian – Citi: Okay. Good. And then just with the recent acquisition of Lincoln Poultry & Egg, maybe a little bit more color around that, kind of how you think that’s going to do for you?
Bill DeLaney: I think it’s a very traditional type of Sysco acquisition. It’s in a market where we have good market presence but this is a real good company with a good management team. And we think it’s going to complement what we’re doing out there in the Midwest very well.
Greg Badishkanian – Citi: Great. Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Move on to Jason Whitmer with Cleveland Research Company.
Jason Whitmer – Cleveland Research Company: Good morning. Bill, I want to come back a little bit to your pricing pressure versus trend comment, seems like competitively not a whole lot’s different today than maybe over the last 12 months. But maybe could you provide some thoughts on the swing in inflation as it relates to pricing power? So looks like the 2.2% is fully product cost but how much of that has been realized? Is that what you’re talking about is more of a pinch there in the spread between what you’re experiencing in wholesale versus what is getting passed through?
Bill DeLaney: You know, Jay, that could be part of it. I purposefully didn’t go there just from the standpoint of -- that’s a very hard phenomenon to qualify. We’ve talked about that in the past. So I think what you’re getting as -- when you move from a deflationary environment, which -- while that hurts you on your gross profit dollars, it tends to actually help you to some extent on your percentages. And you move into some nice inflation that we are seeing now that could pull the pressure. There’s a lot of things that obviously impact margins, various components of margin in terms of mix, the product mix, the business mix, the customer mix, all that type of thing, what the numbers were last year. So I think that could be part of it. But I think in the broadest sense in terms of giving you a feel for what we’re seeing out there, I think it’s somewhat of a cumulative build to what we’ve seen over the last year, just the marketplace where there’s just -- everyone’s trying to grow and they’re trying to -- more than anything they’re trying to make money. So I think that’s the bulk of it.
Jason Whitmer – Cleveland Research Company: I think where there’s some confusion, this would have made more sense two or three or four quarters ago, when sales were under pressure, where there’s more customer product mix shift. And now that sales are good and margins as face value look worse, so I’m hoping you can reconcile either the timing of all that or maybe more importantly, we’re trying to get our hands around as where this goes over the next six months, 12 months, within some of those core components, whether competitive or not but core components of your business, are there any real inflations to be watching here or is there something structurally building here before we even get to the SAP expense dollars.
Bill DeLaney: That’s fair. I accept the question. I think, look, the margins are a little bit like momentum. They’re out there and so while the pressures have been out there for a year or so, it takes a while for some of that pressure to work its way through the system and even though -- let’s say half of our business is Street business and that tends to get priced on a daily or weekly basis, the other half is not. It’s contractual and those types of fluctuations tend to take a little longer to work their way through the system. So I think part of it is a time lag that one would expect over a period of time. And then part of it is just how we manage our business. I mean, if you’re running a Sysco operating company or if you’re running Sysco, you look at your top line, you try to figure out how you’re going to grow your bottom line and we’re very focused on the fact that we know it’s competitive out there. We know we need to fight hard to continue to earn the business of our existing customers and to grow with them and hopefully attract new customers. So I think a lot of it’s just more the environment. I can’t tell you that -- I don’t believe there’s a structural change. It’s still a relatively modest -- I think we’re off about a quarter of a point for the quarter. We’re flat for the year. But I would acknowledge, I think you could see some margin pressure here over the next couple quarters.
Jason Whitmer – Cleveland Research Company: That’s fair. When you look forward a little bit further out, I know you’re trying to tackle 50 basis points of margin expansion just on the core and another 50 from SAP over time, but where and when should we start to see, looking for those to develop? Is that something that could be tangible here in the next 12 months or is that still more of a three or four year time horizon?
Bill DeLaney: I’m going to let Chris jump in on that one.
Chris Kreidler: Yeah. I’ll jump in. and what you’re referring to is, I think, is going back to our Investor Day Presentation where we talked about, basically a point of margin improvement, half of which would be our traditional initiatives, productivity improvements and half of which would come from ERP.
Jason Whitmer – Cleveland Research Company: Correct.
Chris Kreidler: The valid answer to that is as we roll out the tools with ERP, we’ll start seeing those improvements. We’re at the very, very early stages of starting to roll out things like Sysco market, eSysco, things of that nature, so over the next 12 months you might see -- we might see bits and pieces of it, but I don’t think it’s going to be significant enough to flow through to the numbers that you all see. I think it’s more likely 24 to 36 months before we start to see that impact as we outlined in our timetable.
Jason Whitmer – Cleveland Research Company: Chris, are you talking more about the SAP specific benefits from that or is there another component just on the core blocking and tackling separate from that?
Chris Kreidler: I’m referring more to the SAP stuff. The core blocking and tackling what we refer to is the step that we are always working on. And I think we spoke about the initiatives that were already underway that we just hadn’t fully rolled out and then new initiatives, I think we talked about that points and some other things that we had barely touched upon yet that will be rolled out over time. Those are the types of things that are always ongoing that we use to offset the normal increases, that we seen in our price structure, cost structure.
Jason Whitmer – Cleveland Research Company: Great. Thanks, guys.
Bill DeLaney: Hey, Jason. This is Bill. Just to add here, because certainly the questions are on point. There’s a lot of numbers in this quarter’s release and Chris has done a great job taking you through some of the chunkiness of it, but I would just point out that while there is some ladies legitimate margin pressure out there and we are certainly are acknowledging that, but when you adjust for the week and adjust for the COLI, we’re very pleased with the quality of the earnings growth at the operating level this quarter.
Jason Whitmer – Cleveland Research Company: Great. Thanks.
Bill DeLaney: Yeah.
Operator: Move on to Mark Wiltamuth with Morgan Stanley.
Mark Wiltamuth – Morgan Stanley: Good morning. With the case volumes steadily improving, where do you stand on the redistribution centers at this point?
Bill DeLaney: Yeah, we’re more optimistic, obviously. We did defer moving forward in the Midwest because a big part of that business case is generated by anticipated case growth. So we’re close to moving forward there. Haven’t quite pulled together all the administrative things that we need to do. But we’re prepared to move forward here hopefully next year and we’ll come back to you on that in the Midwest and that’s a very key third leg now in the RDC initiative.
Mark Wiltamuth – Morgan Stanley: Okay. And just to get at your point that costs were managed well this year, are you finding any new opportunities for cost cutting as you’re going through the SAP processor process or is that kind of already reflected in your comment that 24 to 36 months away, we’ll start to see some cost improvement.
Chris Kreidler: I’ll jump in on that. I think as we go through the ERP implementation process, if you just back up and think about what we are doing, we are redesigning all of the processes by which we conduct our business. Did we get them all down on paper, when we first started the initiative? No. So as we pursue this and go through the process of implementing the change, I think it’s fair to say we’re finding new stuff that we can go to work on and new places where we might be able to do things either more efficiently or less expensively. Do they amount to a significantly increased savings amount compared to our business case? No. But the answer to your question is I think we’re always finding new ways to save and improve as we go through this process. But again, we’re redesigning our business kind of from the ground up.
Mark Wiltamuth – Morgan Stanley: Okay. And then maybe putting SAP aside, you were moving forward and rehiring MAs. How does that stand and should we be looking for costs to gradually be up in percentage terms this year or what should we be thinking about for our SG&A numbers?
Bill DeLaney: I’ll start and let Chris clean it up here a little bit, so. On the SG&A side, we would continue to expect to leverage those numbers to the extent that we get sales growth. So to the specific question, MAs, we are up year-over-year on MAs and that was something that we had fallen behind on. But I would tell you this because the only area that we see any meaningful headcount increase for the new year, given the levels of volume we’re seeing today, would be on the sales and marketing side. So we would certainly expect to leverage the SG&A line. Now, with that, I mean, we have cut quite hard here over the last two years in terms of headcount. So we do need to see some growth to attain that leverage.
Chris Kreidler: I’ll just jump in and add. I was doing some quick numbers last night. From Q4 of this year looking back two years to Q4 of 2008, our headcount is down just shy of 4,000, close to 8%. And that includes the fact that we have now started rehiring MAs. And so our MA headcount has actually started to grow back in the last couple quarters. So I’ll echo Bill’s comment. I think the company did exactly what it needed to do, given where cases were going and where the economy was going. We cut very hard and appropriately. We started hiring MAs back because we do believe the market’s turning and we are starting to see case growth. At some point, we will have to give serious consideration to whether we start hiring back in some other areas as well to prepare ourselves for larger amounts of business and growth.
Mark Wiltamuth – Morgan Stanley: Okay. Thank you very much.
Bill DeLaney: Thank you.
Operator: Next, we’ll hear from Neil Currie with UBS.
Neil Currie – UBS: Thanks for answering the questions. Just wanted to just clarify on the gross margin decline, when you say that the decline was all price or was there anything else in there?
Bill DeLaney: It’s never all price, obviously. Not to be too much of an accountant. But it’s your cost of goods and your price. So it’s both and it’s also mix in terms of the product mix and the customer mix. So there’s a little bit of all that but I would say a lot of it is on the pricing side.
Neil Currie – UBS: Okay. Thanks. And just in terms of you’re starting to see inflation compared to last quarter starting to pick up now. Could you just go into which categories you’re seeing the strongest price increases and perhaps comment on your ability to pass through these price increases and where do you see this going over the next six months ago also?
Bill DeLaney: I’ll take the first part because that’s easier and we’ll open it up here to the second part. We’re actually at a pretty nice level right now. 2%, as we said historically, we’ve seen it all here over the last several years. We’ve seen deflation. We saw a lot of inflation for a good while and then we saw deflation. If we could maintain a relatively constant environment of 2, maybe 3 points of inflation, that tends to work for our customers. It works for us and our systems and that type of thing and that’s about where we are right now. The particular categories I think we mentioned, where we’re seeing the most inflation right now would be in the -- I think it’s in dairy and meat area and the produce area. Now, the second part of your question is a much tougher one to answer in terms of where it’s going. Some of the phenomenon that is going on with wheat prices and what that might mean within the food chain over time. So you’re hearing people talk about deflation in terms of the broader economy on one hand and then perhaps a lot of inflation in some of the commodities on the other and right now we haven’t experienced that. Our inflation report for July was comparable to what we saw for the quarter. But we’ll have to watch that very closely. Chris, you want to add anything to that?
Chris Kreidler: No. I mean, you all are seeing the press releases from other companies that are warning about commodity prices over the next quarter or two. We read the same stuff and so if all that comes to bear, we’ll have some inflationary pressure but our source is about the same as yours.
Neil Currie – UBS: In terms of how you’ll handle that, we just look to pass through or wait to see how customers feel about it? Or is a lot of this just contractual?
Bill DeLaney: Some of it is contractual to your points or some of that will roll on a weekly and some on a monthly basis. On the street side, we just work through it with customers like we do any sales or marketing opportunities, so. But generally, like I said, when you’re at lower levels, it’s something they can handle more than what we were seeing a couple years ago when we were at 6 or 8% inflation.
Neil Currie – UBS: Okay. Thanks very much and congratulations on the underlying results.
Bill DeLaney: Thank you.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) You will now hear from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.
John Ivankoe – JPMorgan: Hi. Thanks. Just, first a quick clarification, on the ERP and EPS investment in fiscal ‘11 I think you said, Chris, $0.06 to $0.09.
Chris Kreidler: Yeah.
John Ivankoe – JPMorgan: Is that incremental relative to ‘10 or in total?
Chris Kreidler: When we use the term incremental, what we’re basically saying is that $0.06 to $0.09 of additional cost that we would not otherwise incur where we not doing the ERP implementation. You would then take that number, whatever it is, between $0.06 to $0.09 and compare it to $0.02 which is what we reported this year and that’s the year-over-year change.
John Ivankoe – JPMorgan: Okay. Great. That’s what I thought. And secondly, in terms of -- I guess some of the restructure, if you will, of the operating companies with some regional supervision and I think, Bill, you mentioned in terms of -- that that would give you, A, it would give you better look for some acquisitions but also serve customers across geographies. Of course I immediately think about change. Do you think that there are any chains or might that become a more strategically important over time to add some big chunks of business that might currently reside with some of your competition on the chain side?
Bill DeLaney: Well, we believe we certainly have opportunity on the contract sales side. With that said, the Street business is very, very important part of our business model, so we need to focus on both. But to your point, what we’re really saying to you there is, we believe, whether it’s regional chains or national chains where maybe more of a market type of emphasis within that group, these are sometimes big groups. We think just having the type of people that we put in these jobs were highly experienced, very accomplished people within Sysco, many of them have a very strong sales background. We certainly think the customer and the sales opportunity is something we can capitalize there, along with the acquisition. But it’s also an opportunity, when you’ve gotten as large as we have and as geographically disperse, I think that level of management will allow some of us to stay focused on the key drivers to the business over time.
John Ivankoe – JPMorgan: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: And that’s all the time we have for questions today. That will conclude today’s conference call. Thank you for your participation and have a nice day.
Bill DeLaney: Thank you.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Sysco Announces Third Quarter Fiscal 2010 Earnings. [Operator Instructions] At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Neil Russell, Vice President, Investor Relations.
Neil Russell: Thank you, Casey, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for Sysco's Third Quarter Fiscal 2010 Conference Call. On today's call, you will hear from Bill DeLaney, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Kreidler, our Chief Financial Officer.  Before we begin, please note that statements made in the course of this presentation that state the company's or management's intentions, beliefs, expectations or projections of the future are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results could differ in a material manner.  Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ in a material manner from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's SEC filings including, but not limited to risk factors contained in the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 27, 2009, and in the company's press release issued earlier this morning.  Please understand that all comparisons given during the call refer to changes between the third quarter of fiscal 2010 and the third quarter of fiscal 2009, unless otherwise noted. Also all comments about earnings per share refer to diluted earnings per share, unless otherwise noted.  With that out of the way, I'll turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill DeLaney.
William DeLaney: Thank you, Neil, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter of fiscal 2010, Sysco reported net earnings of $248 million. Earnings per share were $0.42, an increase of 10.5% compared to the prior year. Sales increased 2.4% for the quarter, the first year-over-year quarterly increase in sales since our September 2008 quarter. This increase was driven by improving case volume and benefits from foreign currency translation.  Case volume grew year-over-year in the third quarter. The numbers week-to-week were a bit uneven but we saw a sequential improvement in each month throughout the quarter. As we have indicated in our last call on February, March trends typically drive third quarter results and our performance for the quarter was favorably impacted by stronger sales growth in March than we originally anticipated.  Deflation was 0.8% for the third quarter, which is substantially less than the 3.4% deflation we experienced in the first half of the year. Deflation subsided sequentially each month as we move through the quarter, with March coming in essentially flat. These changes were driven by higher prices in dairy, meat and produce.  Operating margin improved year-over-year to 4.8%. I'm particularly pleased with our associates' ability to leverage of the sales growth we saw during the quarter. All of our employees are dedicated to helping our customers succeed and remain focused on driving continued improvements in service and productivity throughout the organization. Our financial results reflect Sysco's ability to execute effectively in a dynamic and highly competitive market. We currently have a number of initiatives underway which are intended to improve certain operating processes, which we described at our Investor Day last December. Many of these initiatives have contributed to our operating margin performance over the last several quarters in our Broadline Companies. These include efforts to standardize warehouse operating systems, utilize discrete engineered labor standards and implement activity-based compensation.  While the implementation of some of these changes is nearing completion, we have a pipeline of various other initiatives in the early stages of rollout that we expect to complete over the next 12 to 15 months. This include initiatives to implement new systems to determine the most efficient product placement on our trailers, scan orders as they are taken off the trucks and better manage fuel consumption and fleet maintenance. In addition, we remain on track with our business transformation project. We have substantially completed the design phase, and we are currently building and testing the underlying ERP system and processes with extensive resources dedicated to this critical phase.  We anticipate going live with the implementation of the ERP system at our first offering company in early calendar 2011. As a result, we're beginning to process for getting our shared services operation up and running to support the first location and the others that will follow. During the third quarter, we purchased a facility in Houston that will house this organization, which will be known as Sysco Business Services [ph](9:11). We expect to begin staffing this facility in the second half of this calendar year.  It's important to understand that we are not simply waiting for our ERP system to go live to realize benefits from this project. We are making numerous changes along the way to prepare for the transformation, and many of these changes will provide modest benefits before we actually go live. An example is the standardization of warehouse operating systems that I've mentioned a few minutes ago.  Along the same lines, we have been populating [ph](9:41) our new online Order Management System, which will replace our eSysco platform and are now in the early phases of rolling it out to some of our contract customers. We're excited about the progress we're making and will continue to keep you informed of further developments along the way.  Now I'll turn things over to Chris, so he can provide additional details on our financial results for the third quarter.
Robert Kreidler: Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. As Bill mentioned, we reported net earnings this morning of $248 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2010, an increase of 9.5% compared to the prior year period and the highest third quarter on record.  Sales increased 2.4% which was driven by year-over-year case volume growth; foreign exchange rates, which increased sales by 1.6%; and the impact of acquisitions, which increased sales by 0.6%. Offsetting these increases, estimated deflation was 0.8%, which is measured as the estimated change in the cost of products we purchased.  Operating margin in the third quarter improved to 4.8% from 4.6% last year, a 19 basis point improvement. Operating costs were higher in the quarter by $20 million. While there are multiple line items variances, the increase was primarily due to payroll expense that was $35 million higher in the current period. Approximately half of the increase in payroll expense was driven by higher incentive compensation accruals year-over-year.  Last year in the third quarter, we released our bonus accruals when it became clear that we would not meet our 2009 performance objectives. However, based on performance to the third quarter of this year, we believe that it's likely, we will meet our 2010 performance objectives and we continue to accrue them accordingly. The majority of the remaining year-over-year increase in payroll expense was due to the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, assuming from the conversion of our Canadian results into U.S. dollars. It's important to note that while payroll expense was up for the reasons I just mentioned, headcount was actually down 2.6% year-over-year in the third quarter.  There were a few other notable operating expense variances compared to last year's third quarter. First, company-sponsored pension expense was $9 million higher in the current quarter which is in line with the guidance we gave in our 10-K. Second, last year, we had a $9 million loss in the third quarter related to COLI. This year, we recorded a $5 million gain resulting in a $14 million favorable comparison year-over-year.  Third, fuel expense was $13 million lower than last year. And fourth, the provision for bad debt we recorded in the current period was $12 million. This compares to $31 million in the prior year period, resulting in a $19 million favorable year-over-year comparison. The current provision is based on recent activity, and simply means that there are fewer customer accounts meeting our criteria for write-off. For the current quarter, our bad debt expense as a percentage of sales was 0.14%.  Earnings per share for the quarter increased 10.5% to $0.42 per share. The $0.42 of earnings per share include the $0.01 favorable impact related to an increase in the cash surrender value of COLI compared to $0.38 of earnings per share in the prior year, which included a $0.01 negative impact from COLI. Turning to a brief update on our business transformation initiative. Today, we are updating our fiscal 2010 estimate of the net impact of this project. The revised estimate I will provide you represents the net impact of the project on our financial results. This means that it includes estimated benefits from the project as we define them, and it excludes costs for those Sysco employees that we have redeployed and dedicated to this project. As we've discussed previously, we do not consider the cost of employees that were redeployed to the project to have an incremental impact on our financial result. And to be clear, this is the same basis underlying the estimates we provided at our Investor Day last December. We now expect the project will decrease diluted earnings per share this fiscal year by an estimated $0.03, which is lower than the $0.05 estimate we presented at our Investor Day.  As Bill discussed earlier, the project work is on schedule and the change in estimate is not an indication that we're behind schedule. The change is primarily attributable to two reasons. First, the balance between expense and capital spend has been more weighted to the capital side than originally estimated. As a result, EPS has not been impacted as much. At the same time, our cash expenditures for the projects are on track with expectations and consequently, we have not changed the total estimated cash outlay of the project.  Second, we're seeing slightly higher benefits than anticipated at this stage of the project. The benefits expected for this fiscal year are modest and come primarily from payroll savings. For example, when we redeployed people to the project, we anticipated that we would backfill certain positions. However, we've not yet done this to the degree originally projected, and this has resulted in a greater benefit. Turning to cash flow. Cash flow from operations for the first 39 weeks of the fiscal year was $466 million compared to $985 million in the prior year period. Cash flow from operations in the current period is net of IRS settlement payments, which totaled $475 million.  Working capital has slightly increased from the end of the prior fiscal year in June 2009. Receivables, payables and inventory have all increased due to the increase in sales in third quarter. In addition, receivables tend to trend upward at this point in the year. This is due to a seasonal shift in sales mix, with sales from multi-unit customers and full districts representing a larger percentage of our sales.  The other significant category of changes would've been working capital relates to the decline in accrued and deferred taxes. These declines are driven by IRS settlement payments made during the year and correlate to declines in cash.  Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $190 million. Looking ahead, we now expect capital spending for the full year to be in the range of $575 million to $625 million as we continue to invest in our business. This spending includes maintenance items such as ongoing fleet replacement and facility repairs, as well as growth items such as acquisitions, expansions of current facilities, potential foldouts and technology. Technology spend includes capital related to our business transformation project. In closing, I'd like to thank all of our associates for their hard work during the third quarter and for your interest in Sysco.  With that, operator, we'll now take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Meredith Adler with Barclays Capital.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: I'd like to start by talking maybe a little bit about the growth you are seeing and whether there's anything in terms of the nature of the customers that are showing growth. Is there some variation between them and are there any surprises there?
William DeLaney: The growth were seeing it's -- first of all, it's just nice to see some growth. And I would say that were seeing it across pretty much all the lines of restaurant segments for different reasons. And so I think the quick serve or QSR continues to be pretty strong on a relative basis, although the comparisons there are tougher because they held up pretty well a year ago. What we think we're beginning to see with the consumer spending picking up somewhat is that the family-style, which as you know, basically, a family restaurant with all different varieties. That generally drives our business and that seems to be picking up as well. And I would say, even on the high end, where over the last year and a half, maybe almost two years, some of the high-end steakhouses, those types of places, those numbers are beginning to improve as well. Partially, I think, just because the comparisons are relatively easy, we've had a really tough year and a half or two years. So again, it's good to see the growth, it's still somewhat modest, but I would say it's across all segments.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: And then I have a question about the shared services, whatever you call it, not just the facility but the operation. I'm not sure whether you talked about it in those terms when you had your analyst meeting. Could you maybe just describe what functions will be moving to the shared services operation?
William DeLaney: We probably didn't talk a lot about that in detail at the analyst meeting because we want -- it's far along in our design work. So generally and then obviously, this is something that we're continuing to refine our thoughts on and communicate internally. But generally, what you would find there would be more of your administrative type of services.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: Administrative services that service lots of operating companies?
William DeLaney: Yes.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: And then my final question is just about the competitive environment, because you do have a comment in your press release about it still being a highly competitive environment?
William DeLaney: Right.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: Any more comment?
Robert Kreidler: We put that in there on purpose, or at least I did, from the standpoint that, like I said, we're pleased. We've seen strength in the economy here for a while. We think we're beginning to see the consumer participate. And as a result, we're seeing some growth with our customers, and obviously in our top line. I wanted to temper that a little bit with just the reality that it's still very competitive out there. And I wouldn't expect that to change a whole lot in the near term.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Neil Currie with UBS.
Neil Currie - UBS Investment Bank: I just wondered if you could maybe give us some insights on your outlook for deflation and any trends you're seeing in April so far, whether you're actually starting to move to inflation now?
William DeLaney: Our track record on projecting inflation and deflation isn't really strong. But what were trying to say, Neil, to you in our comments this morning is we believe that the deflation has subsided to the point where, as we say, in March, it was pretty flat. And we don't have a lot of information yet so far this quarter. But it looks like it is starting to pick up modestly. So I think we are back in an overall net inflationary environment, albeit very modest.
Neil Currie - UBS Investment Bank: In terms of underlying demand, you obviously talked about easy comparisons because it was so tough last year. But I wonder if you could talk to what's going on behind the underlying volume growth that you're seeing right now? How much of it is share growth, and how much of is -- how much have you seen a pickup in demand recently?
William DeLaney: Well, we're clearly seeing a pick in demand, and as I said, we're real pleased to see that. Obviously, it's good for our customers, it's good for our people. The psyche is, is that everyone in this industry is -- it's been difficult for the last year and a half or two years. So from that standpoint, we're seeing an overall pick up in demand. Yes, we think were still taking share. That's a hard question to answer at a given point in time. But we do not have any reason to believe that we're not continuing to take share. So we're pleased with the year-over-year numbers. I think if you go back two years, we would tell you that we're still a little bit below where we were two years ago. And I think that's consistent with our headcount reductions and that type of thing as well.
Neil Currie - UBS Investment Bank: And finally, I wonder how fragile or robust you think this recovery is? And if gas prices were to get notably higher over the summer, how would you think that might impact both demand? And do you opt only onto [ph](22:31) your customers?
Robert Kreidler: Well, we have fragile in one of our early drafts, Neil. We took it out because we think we've moved past fragile, but we're not quite robust. So somewhere it's in between there. I think what we need to see is -- personally, I'm really encouraged that we're starting to see the consumer start to participate. That's what we've said, all along, would be the key for us, is we can see case growth and that allows us to do what we're really good at, which is leveraging that case growth. So that's our best read in that situation right now, I think.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Greg Badishkanian with Citigroup.
Gregory Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc: Just in terms of a little bit on the kind of the food inflation and promotional environment. As you kind of go into an inflationary period, how much does that help you relative to when you look back two quarters ago, you're running even last quarter, negative low single digit? How much benefit do you get as you get to an inflationary environment?
William DeLaney: Greg, that's hard to quantify. What we've consistently said, and for those of us who have been around this business a long time, it does hold up. The preferred environment, we could pick an inflationary environment, it would be one of the modest inflation, one, two, maybe three points inflation, for a couple of reasons. One is it that's a level that typically, our customers have been able to handle over the years with their customers. And two, we can manage that fairly well. So that's the more favorable environment. The environment where we're in a year to two years ago, where we're looking at 6%, sometimes 8% inflation, that's not good for anyone. That's not good for the customer and certainly, not good for the industry. And then what we think we're coming out of the deflationary environment would be the least attractive, probably of the three. Although, I have to say we've been real pleased with how our folks have managed through that over the last 6 to 9 months or so, so it'll help us some. But I think the main thing, when you look at our business right now, where we're at right now is we need to see case growth, our customers need to see volume increases. So at relatively low levels of inflation, that shouldn't be a barrier.
Gregory Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc: At then in terms of the promotional environment, as you start to see inflation, as you start to see some decent volume growth and that only builds as the consumer gets stronger, do you think that, that's going to abate the promotional environment?
William DeLaney: I think it will affect it. There's always a lot of promotion activity that goes on in our business, both with our customers and we do some, as do our competitors. I would hope that it results in a more targeted and more cost effective promotional environment. Whereas, what we were seeing six and 12 months ago is just kind of constant [ph](25:29) type of promotion activity, that is not clear that, that really was successful for a lot of people that implemented that. We really didn't approach it that way. We took a more targeted approach.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Andrew Wolf with BB&T Capital Markets.
Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets: Bill, I think when you updated us last quarter, you said January was cases were up. But it sounded like barely, and I think, sounds like from your tone, February is sort of the same and then March strengthened up. Can you tell us a little about how you think -- and I'm inferring but I'd like to ask you directly, how April went? Did you see that kind of follow through? And could we expect perhaps an update on the Mother's Day, since May is a big month for the company?
William DeLaney: Now you're asking a lot there on Mother's Day. But as far as April, Andy, that's when we took fragile out of the early draft. I think we've seen now the month of April, and it's pretty comparable to what we saw in March. So again, we're not out of the woods to this recovery yet. But we're seeing two good months in a row, and April is encouraging. We'll see on Mother's Day. The tricky thing on Mother's Day is what I alluded to earlier. That is our biggest week of the year. And it's always an exciting week within the operating companies. But in terms of what that number is, hopefully, it will be up over last year. I think it'll be interesting to see where it is relative to two years ago.
Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets: And just on the SAP update, some of those things sounds like getting some of the benefits perhaps above budget. Sounds like they could be longer lasting than just this fiscal year. Whereas, the accounting may not be, it may just be the way the project's rolling out. But should we, perhaps, anticipate some updates to beyond fiscal '10, perhaps when you present your fourth quarter numbers?
Robert Kreidler: Yes, you can anticipate updates. Our current intention is when we come out with fourth quarter, we'll give -- and I think, Sysco's traditionally giving guidance on a few items for next year, capital expenditures et cetera. And we've said that we will try to update you on the business transformation for 2011. We will also be taking a fresh look periodically, we're going through it now, on the entire chart that we presented in December. We may not present that in our fourth quarter update, but we would intend to present that, certainly, at our Investor Day later in the fall, winter. So you can expect updates as we go forward.
Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets: Okay. I mean, it sounds like it's certainly coming in early at, but it's being run pretty tightly and some of the benefits are better than expected. Would we be getting ahead of ourselves if we took something away from that to the positive side?
William DeLaney: I'll echo what you just said. I think it's being run very, very tightly. I think the team that's running that is doing a good job of cost control. I wouldn't get to it you fork yet [ph] about seeing more benefits here. As we described and we were pretty careful to describe but say, you understood it. Some of the benefits we're seeing right now is we didn't backfill yet some of the positions that we thought we would backfill. That doesn't mean we won't backfill them. Obviously, we don't hire people once we need them. But there's a chance we still will backfill some of those people and so that benefit would then go away, but we're giving you the best look that we've had right now. And that says that forward this year, we're not going to spend as much as we thought. But it was important that we noted that we're not changing the overall cost of the project. Eventually, we believe we're going to spend the money and it will be broken down between the capital and the expense fairly similar to what we had anticipated when we described it at Investor Day.
Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets: And just one last question is a follow-up on the -- now that there's some inflation coming back. As your sales people and your operators are seeing week-to-week, sequential increases in protein and other categories, dairy, maybe keep produce out of this since it spiked. But sort of some more normal incremental inflation, the market basically absorbing that, which it normally does or are you seeing some sticky pricing and a little gross margin pressure?
William DeLaney: Well, we've seen -- like I said, Andy, it's Bill again. We've done a nice job managing the margins, I think through this last year. But it's been very competitive on the street, I would say especially right around the first of the calendar year and we've continued to work on margins here over the balance of the quarter into April. As far as the stickiness, I would say to your point, most of what we're seeing on the inflationary side is more commodity driven right now, but it's not radically up. Dairy's up but dairy's been down for quite a while. So I'd say we're -- so far would been able to pass along most of it.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Mark Wiltamuth with Morgan Stanley.
Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley: Wanted to ask a little bit about your operating expense progression. You just lapped the big cost cuts from last year. The operating environment is getting a little better. I mean, what do you think is a reasonable progression for operating expense growth in percentage terms?
William DeLaney: Well, Chris is hesitating, so I'll start. I wish I knew the answer to that exactly, but I think what we need to call out here, Mark, is I think we're at an inflection point. So for the last year, year and a half, the way we have been looking at the business is how aggressively can we, should we cut relative to the decline in volume. And as you can see, we've been able to manage our headcount pretty much in line with the volume decreases and that's necessary in this business, given the people and people relate is 70% give or take of our total cost structure. So I think we've said here for the last few months any way that we've sort of continued productivity improvements, which we expect to continue to enjoy, like I talked about earlier. We've cut a lot, it's really, really hard to cut a whole lot more. And as we go forward, with the premise that we're expecting to see some modest growth, I think you'll see us, and we actually for the first time, I think here in several quarters, we are up year-over-year with our sales headcount, marketing associates and so on. And so we will add there, and we have been adding there over the last six months or so. But I think the other areas, assuming we see a relatively modest pickup in cases, we still have quite a bit of capacity in our facilities and in our trucks continue to leverage. So I think nothing really changes other than the environment here. So you could expect us to continue to try to drive the earnings faster than the top line.
Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley: And those changes you've made to the marketing associate headcount, do you think they've had time to kind of have an effect on market share or is it still too early?
William DeLaney: I think it's a little early. I mean, the thing to keep in mind is even though the net number they've been flatten out for a period of time, we're always refreshing the pool of sales people. So when we're at our best and things are quicking, there's always a percentage of that sales force that's what you might characterize as a training mode. And so the folks that were coming out last year, they're a little bit better than they were last year, a little more experienced [indiscernible] so -- but I would say what we're speaking through here today, that it takes generally, to the honest with you, it takes 18 months to three years for people to fully hit those stride in the sales area.
Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley: Could you give us an absolute number on how much the volumes had changed? I mean, we're kind of doing it back of the envelope mass, we think it's maybe around 1%. Is that about right for the volume gain?
Robert Kreidler: Mark, we've never really talked about specific volume increases. For the first time, this release we actually indicated whether they were up or down. One of our goals is to try to get to a point where we're comfortable talking about volume increases, but there's some math we've got to play through before we can actually get comfortable releasing that number. There is a number that I know all of you guys get to call the real growth, I guess, which you just take the number that we put out in terms of sales and then you adjust it for the acquisition to ForEx, and the deflation or inflation and you get to a real growth number. I think that's what you were referring to when you got to the 1%. Yes, I mean, I think a lot of you guys do that calculation. You can kind of see the trend in that number. Again, we don't put that in the release because whereby today would be non-GAAP and we can't talk about it.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Ajay Jain with Hapoalim Securities.
Ajay Jain - UBS: Just in relation to the $0.03 dilution for ERP. Can you confirm the earnings impact in Q3 and what you're anticipating this quarter?
Robert Kreidler: No, we're not really talking about it on a quarter-by-quarter basis, Ajay, and that's kind of what we indicated back at the Investor Day. Our goal is to give you an annual impact from that so that you guys can put it into the models, which I know are important to you. Trying to do it quarter-by-quarter is going to be very difficult for us to predict in advance because of the significant timing, things that occurred during the quarter. So we're not doing that today. In the 10-Q, we do actually talk about ERP expense. Well, I'm not sure if it's broken out to ERP expense date, it's probably not. But we do indicate we've spent, I believe, 70% of the range that we gave you.
Ajay Jain - UBS: And do you have any comment, Chris, on the lower interest expense and why it was down a little bit sequentially?
Robert Kreidler: Yes, we have swaps, which were not employed at this time last year. I didn't actually go back and look at the effective interest rate between this year and the last year. I'm not sure it's significantly different, so I'm guessing that the majority of that difference was the swaps.
Ajay Jain - UBS: And I know you guys mentioned that sequentially, the volume trends improved each month in the March quarter, and it sounds like volume trends are still pretty solid through April. So with improving in case volume trends, are you any closer to making the decision for the Indiana RDC because it sounded like a couple months ago that the only thing holding you back was just a more material improvement in demand, so if you can comment.
William DeLaney: Ajay, it's Bill. We are, but we're not just quite there yet and the one other factor -- so to your premise you're question, that's exactly right. We were looking to see some meaningful improvement because it's basically the 24-month time period from the time you break ground until you're in full ramp on one of these deals. I won't call it complication, but the other factor that centered the equation here is synchronizing the Midwest RDC with our ERP rollout to those companies that are impacted there. So I don't expect us to break ground this year beyond to be honest with you. But I do expect later in the year to be in a position to be more specific on that. But it's kind of moved off of the volume issue and it's just trying to sync this thing up towards the most efficient relative to how we do the ERP rollout but with our operating companies.
Ajay Jain - UBS: And finally, I think you guys made some changes last year on your bonus structure, at least, at the corporate level. So after you factor in the comparisons from last year and the changes in your incentive structure, I'm just wondering how material that impact could be on bonus accruals for this quarter because I'm assuming that the corporate level, the majority of bonuses were still paid out in Q4, is that correct?
Robert Kreidler: Well, yes, they're paid out. We accrue from throughout the year. We really didn't make any changes last year, Ajay. Two years ago, we made some changes, relatively modest. We went to return on capital as opposed to return on equity and that type of thing. The thing that hasn't changed is it's pretty much driven on improvement, earnings per share improvement over the prior year, and then the other axis on the grid is a three-year trailing average on returning capital. I think the substantive difference this year is we have earnings improvement, so we would expect to pay our bonuses this year, where as last year, we didn't pay them out at the corporate level.
Ajay Jain - UBS: But is it material enough that you think it's appropriate to call out?
William DeLaney: Well, we did so...
Robert Kreidler: Yes, we've called out the year-over-year change. The absolute amount of it now. I mean, we've been accruing to work periodically, and it doesn't rise to the level of materiality, to be honest.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Jason Whitmer with Cleveland Research Company.
Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research: Will, you've absorbed a few more responsibilities over the last quarter so, as Ken is retired, can you might tell me about some strategic, some tactical and maybe some people changes, whether in Houston or in the field that you've been evaluating or executing?
William DeLaney: Yes, I'd be happy to, Jay. As you had said, it's not really just -- Ken's retirement, that's a significant event for us here at Sysco. Steve Smith has also announced his retirement. In conjunction with that, we are making some changes. All these changes are effective with the new fiscal year, so where in what I would characterize as a transition period right now. We're also in a period where -- over the last week or two, and in particular the next six to eight weeks, we're very, very focused on doing our profit plans with all of our operating companies, as well as here at corporate. But essentially, what you'll see going forward is Mike Green will take over responsibility for the U.S. Broadline operating companies. Larry Pulliam will continue to oversee contract sales, our distribution services corporate group, as well as SYGMA and our specialty company. So those two gentlemen will be overseeing the business. Reporting in to Mike will be Scott Sonnemaker and Chuck Staes, who currently report in to Mike; and we've added a third gentleman, Mike Headrick, who will oversee our companies in the South. Mike's a longtime Sysco veteran, a very astute business person, we're excited to have Mike step up here. And then in conjunction with that, we've also identified 11 other folks, as well as what we're doing up in Canada, which I would characterize as more market VPs, and this is all new for us, Jay. If you go back, I don't know, I guess 15 years, I think around the mid-'90s, we went to the senior VP of Ops Structure, which was a first for us. And at that time and for many years after that, most of those folks, generally, we have four regions, they might have 15 maybe as many as 20 companies, which was effective but probably not overly manageable in some ways. As you know, in recent years last year to, in particular, we've gone to a more of a pod structure, which I think has been the transition to get us to where we're headed today which is more what I would characterize as a market structure. We're trying to be very customer centric and so with this market structure, we're going to have 11-plus Canada folks overseeing markets, they will not be running operating companies. They'll be working very closely with the operating company presidents in their marketplace to drive out our go-to-market strategy, to effectively implement the 212 business transformation work, to enhance what we're doing on the talent management side of the company, to better develop customer relationships that might crossover local lines, as well as -- and hopefully bring even more effective focus to our acquisition work. So I'm excited about that. It's a new structure and we'll begin to transition into it here as we go into the new year. In addition to that, we've had Kent Humphries, who has done a great job running our Canadian business to pick up expanded responsibilities and Kent's going to report in to Larry, head of our contract sales effort across the country. And Kent brings, not just a lot of experience, but a lot of, frankly, enthusiasm; and energy to that position and tremendous relationships, both within Sysco and with the customer base. In addition to that, Alan Hasty, who currently runs our Cleveland company is going to come down to corporate and work with Bill Day and his group to -- Alan's primary responsibilities will be to work in our BSCC merchandising areas. So we have made several moves, there'll be some more that I'm sure you'll learn of, which will be more replacing some of the folks that we've promoted and those will come out as appropriate over the next couple of months. But essentially, to cut through it all, as we go through these changes, we transition through the retirement of Ken and Steve. I just thought it was appropriate to leverage the talent that we do have in a bigger way and we have a very deep bench in Sysco. We've got a lot of people that are more than capable and want to contribute more, and that's what's behind these changes.
Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research: The shared service announcement, that sounds like if you're doing a separate facility being down in Houston a number of times, it looks like you have a big campus to begin with. But a sep [separate] facility, I'm curious how big is corporate now and how big is the shared services and headcount as you build that from scratch?
William DeLaney: Well, we're going to come back to you with the specifics on that, but in the difference between the campus that you seeing which, for the record is two buildings, but it is big and there's plenty of square footage. So hopefully, Jay, it'll be an opportunity for us that we'll have some capacity here over time. But the difference in this facility that we're going to be moving into is it formerly was a call center for another major company and we think it's best suited for our business going forward. It's quite large, it's several hundred thousand square feet and I won't be able to speak to the numbers and all that, I think as we get closer to the end of the calendar year.
Operator: We'll take our next question from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.
John Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co: First, just a housekeeping question on fuel costs. I think it was mentioned that it actually was a benefit in this quarter. If you could remind us or tell us how to think about the next six or 12 months? And then second question, maybe a little bit longer, it's just kind of the overall state of the industry in terms of health of competition, if you think most of the competition has gotten out of the woods and is going to benefit from this improving environment or there might be things that I don't understand, and there could be even closures or more share loss of the competition, and whether this is the right environment for you to be looking at acquisitions as we begin the upturn?
Robert Kreidler: John, this is Chris. I'll take the fuel costs one first. Fuel costs, we look at it as a net between the cost of fuel and surcharges. On a year-over-year basis, we saw a benefit. The guidance that we've given is we expect the fuel costs to be as much as $50 million to $80 million better than last year, and the fuel surcharge to be about $60 million roughly worse than last year. So net-net, depending on where we fall in that first range, we should see a benefit year-over-year and that's recent guidance. So that's where we thought -- that's where we believe the net fuel charge will wind up for the year.
William DeLaney: I think as far as the competitive side, John, look at the improving climates, good for everyone. I mean, it's good for our customers, it's certainly good for us, and I would expect it's good for our competitors now. I think going forward, we're extremely well-positioned to grow and to continue to invest in our business. The one interesting thing as we've talked before with the model for this business is when you're not growing, assuming you can manage your receivables relatively well, you actually don't need a lot of capital unless you're going to expand your business. So when you do grow, that does put some pressure on the working capital. So I think from that standpoint, if we have some competitors out there that are able to grow, then they'll be dealing with that, and I'm sure they'll be able to deal with that. But I don't see a whole lot of change on the competitive environment. On the acquisition angle on that, we keep hoping for angles here and perhaps, a better environment will help us all come to more realistic terms on valuation, some of these situations and people will be more motivated to strike some common ground and evaluation now that the business is beginning to improve. So I think it could be a good thing.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Bob Cummins with Wellington Shields & Co.
Robert Cummins - Shields & Company: It strikes me that this is only the beginning. Obviously, your numbers are up a bit over last year, the top line I mean, but it seems -- as we all know, Americans love to eat out, and the environment I think, as it's developing, is going to encourage them to eat out even more. And obviously, from your point of view as a company, you don't have a lot of bodies to your staff as the business increases, you just load more goods on the truck, which is very profitable business. It seems to me that both top line and bottom line results over say, the next four quarters or so should continue to gain substantially year-over-year. Am I right in thinking that? You don't have to comment if you don't want to.
William DeLaney: Well, I'll start and let Chris clean it up here a little bit on the financial side. But I think if you take a purely operational point of view, you're exactly right that with an improved environment out there, our customers should see more traffic, and that translates into more opportunity for us to grow and to be more efficient. We've done a nice job, Bob. We've done -- we've been able to grow our pieces per mile and all that type of thing, but it's difficult to grow your pieces per stop when your customers' business is offend. So certainly that would be a metric that we would expect to improve. There's no way of knowing on these things, and if you go back and look at the psychology and over last year, two years, we've kind of struck, I think a reasonable middle ground. We've never said that we thought that the industry was going to just go totally south for an extended period of time. We certainly acknowledge that the last year to two years have been difficult and the industry has declined. I think the reasonable case is it continues to be what we talked about up in New York in December, which is a modest nominal growth for the industry over time, and that would translate to good things for us. There's some below the line things for next year that I think we've called out and that you would need to deal with. And I'll let Chris kind of transition to that conversation.
Robert Kreidler: Yes, I hate to be the finance guy that delves this cold water on anything especially since you stated it in such a nice way. I agree with everything Bill said in terms of kind of the medium term, short term, where we're just looking at year-over-year lapse. We've gotten some good benefits this year from COLI, which is not the way you want to make your numbers, obviously, but that's just what's happened in the market. We certainly would not anticipate that type of benefit occurring every year. We've gotten some benefit this year for fuel. We've gotten some benefit year-over-year from bad debt expense. So some of the things we've talked about in these calls as being year-over-year benefit, of course, we can't count on them having those come back in our favor next year. Next year, is the year where we just need to have operating performance, and I'll go back to what you said, the sign book good, the trend book good, and we're very hopeful. Bill alluded earlier that this month, the next month, are doing all of our profit plan for the operating company and we're rolling all that up to see what we really believe we can accomplish next year, and we're all anxious to see what our operators, to post close this to the customers believe. As we roll that up, and then bake it into our one-year forecast with all these items, we'll have a better idea of what 2011 looks like.
Operator: And we'll take our final question from Meredith Adler with Barclays Capital.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: The first is, will you be making an announcement this year about sales for Mother's Day, and I wasn't sure if you did that last year?
William DeLaney: I'm sorry, sales from where?
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: Mother's Day, you used to make an announcement every year.
William DeLaney: Did we do that last year? I don't think we did last year, Meredith.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: No, I don't think so. Do you think you'll do it this year?
William DeLaney: Probably not.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: And then my final question is just about back to fuel expense. You do hedge in some fashion a certain percentage of it. Can you talk about how much of it is hedged through the end of the year? I was kind of surprised that you had such a big range on the cost, given that you only have one quarter left for the year. So I was wondering is it less hedged now?
Robert Kreidler: We do put in place hedges. We essentially hedge a portion of our fuel. When we look at how much the hedge we factor in the fact that a lot of our contract customers whether they'd be SYGMA or contract customers, there's already effectively a hedge in those contracts in terms of the fuel surcharge. So we look at what effectively unhedged, and we go out and we put in place hedges on a substantial portion of that. I think the number is roughly 40% of our overall gallon per hedge. We roll those forward month to month, and that just means that we keep going out another month, another month, another month as we see the need to do that. So we're never completely hedged in terms of real financial hedges in the marketplace. 40% is roughly the number where we've been at. The guidance number comes from several things. One of which is we just don't know what fuel costs are going to do in the next couple of months and so the guidance is still reasonably wide.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the Sysco second quarter fiscal 2010 earnings call. As a reminder this call is being recorded. At the time for opening remarks and introductions I’d like to turn it over to Neil Russell, Vice President Investor Relations.
Neil Russell: Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us for Sysco’s second quarter fiscal 2010 conference call. On today’s call you will hear from Bill DeLaney, our Chief Executive Officer, Ken Spitler, our Vice Chairman, President and Chief Operating Officer and Chris Kreidler, our Chief Financial Officer.

Also, all comments about earnings per share refer to diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. With that out of the way, I’ll turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Bill DeLaney.
William DeLaney:  Thank you Neil and good morning everyone. On the second quarter of fiscal 2010 Sysco reported net earnings of $268 million and earnings per share of $0.45 which is up 12.5% compared to the prior year. Sales trends improved throughout the quarter with the year over year rated decline swelling to only 3%, a result largely driven by deflation. Notwithstanding the challenging economic conditions, operating margin improved due in part to the favorable impact of COLI as well as excellent cost control throughout the organization. Ken will discuss this in more detail in a few minutes. Despite these challenging times, we remain steadfast in our commitment to helping our customers achieve their objectives. We are executing well and reinvesting in our business. Challenges have historically provided opportunities for Sysco to further differentiate ourselves in the marketplace because our customers increasingly look to us for support and business solutions. As the industry leader, we have an unsurpassed ability to leverage our size and scale to benefit our customers.  Our financial results for the quarter reflect the disciplined operational execution and excellent customer service to operating companies each and every day. While encouraged by our financial and operating performance today, we remain committed to continuous improvement and consistently look for opportunities to gain additional efficiencies in this competitive industry. For example, our business transformation project remains on tract with the objectives discussed at our investor day in December. We expect the improvements driven by this multi-year project will allow us to grow sales, reduce operating costs and more effectively utilize data in our decision making. Now, I’ll turn things over to Ken so he can provide further detail on this and other operational improvements and how we performed in the second quarter.
Kenneth Spitler: I’d like to start by thanking our operating companies for their hard work during the quarter. These results reflect their dedication to our customers and to helping our business succeed in challenging times. Our sales during the quarter were impacted by deflation of 3.5% which is measured as the estimated change in the cost of products we buy. Deflation from dairy and beef products had the largest impact with the balance spread across several categories. On a year over year basis, deflation pressures appear to be moderating from the highs we saw earlier in the quarter.  Our operating margin improved to 5.2% in the second quarter. While COLI contributed to this improvement we also significantly reduced payroll expenses and improved productivity in all aspects of our business. We have continued to manage head count in a manner consistent with the sales environment throughout the entire organization. Our head count is down 4% year over year and 10% over two years as we improve productivity throughout the company. Operationally, we continue to focus on productivity which is evident in many of our key operating metrics on a year over year basis, but the progress of our operating companies have made is even more clear on a two year basis. For example, in our U.S. Broadline companies, our diesel gallon usage is about flat with last year’s second quarter but is down more than 10% compared to the second quarter of 2008. Cases per trip increased 3% year over year and 4% versus two years ago. Warehouse cases per man hour improved 8% year over year and 15% versus two years ago and we improved our error frequency per cases shipped from an error rate of one out of 1,229 in the second quarter of 2008 to an error rate of one out of 1,799 this quarter. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $138 million. Looking ahead we still expect capital spending for the full year to be in the range of $600 million to $650 million as we continue to invest in our business. This spending includes maintenance items such as ongoing fleet replacement and facility repairs as well as growth items such as expansions of our current facilities, potential fold outs and technology. Technology spend includes capital related to our business transformation project. Now I’ll turn it over to Chris for a discussion of our financial results for the quarter.
Chris Kreidler: Thank you Ken. As previously discussed for the second quarter of fiscal 2010 sales were down 3% and estimated deflation was 3.5%. As Ken just mentioned, deflation appears to be moderating from highs we saw earlier in the quarter. Sales were also impacted by foreign exchange rates which increased sales by 1.2% and the impact of acquisitions which increased sales by .6%. While case volume remained negative early in the quarter, it turned positive towards the end of the period. Operating margin in the second quarter improved to 5.2% from 4.6% last year, a 60 basis point improvement. In addition, operating costs were lower in the second quarter by $96 million. Ken walked through the main drivers earlier and I’d like to give you the numbers in a little more detail now. The decline in operating cost is primarily due to a $37 million benefit from the year over year change in value related to the performance of COLI and a $25 million decline in payroll expense. Operating expenses also improved by $29 million due to lower fuel expenses. However, fuel surcharges which are reflected in gross margin were also lower during the period, offsetting most of the benefit from lower fuel expense. Net earnings for the second quarter increased 12.9% to $268 million. Similarly the EPS for the quarter increased 12.5% to $0.45 per share. The $0.45 per share includes a $0.01 favorable impact related to an increase in the cash render value of COLI compared to $0.40 in the prior year which included a $0.05 negative impact from COLI. Turning to a brief update on our business transformation initiative, you’ll recall that at our investor day in December, we shared with you our expectation that the incremental impact of this project would decrease diluted EPS in fiscal 2010 by an estimated $0.05 per share. The project remains on track and our expectations have not changed. Cash flow from operations for the first half of the fiscal year was $144 million compared to $562 million in the prior year period. Cash flow from operations was impacted by IRS settlement payment which totaled $422 million in the first half of the year. Additionally, cash flow in the first half of last year was impacted by the timing of certain other tax payments. Last year in the second quarter we were allowed to defer approximately $280 million in tax payments until the third quarter which was a benefit allowed the Houston area companies in the wake of Hurricane Ike. As you would expect this year we were not afforded the same deferral and the net effect causes our tax payments this year to appear significantly greater than last year. In closing, I would like to thank all our associates for their hard work during the second quarter and for your interest in Sysco. With that, we’ll take some questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from John Heinbockel – Goldman Sachs.
John Heinbockel – Goldman Sachs: What’s been the trend this quarter, last quarter in average drop size?
Kenneth Spitler: It’s declining slightly.
John Heinbockel – Goldman Sachs: That’s obviously deflation weighing on that. Do you think it’s not down as much as deflation because you’re seeing some weaker guys drop out and that’s raising the average?
Kenneth Spitler: I don’t know about the weaker guys part but I think it is pretty much deflation.
John Heinbockel – Goldman Sachs: So it might be down as much as the rate of deflation you’re seeing.
Kenneth Spitler: Yes.
William DeLaney: I think our guys are doing a good job. Our folks are doing a good job managing the pieces given there’s still a lot of pressure in the marketplace obviously.
John Heinbockel – Goldman Sachs: When you think about incremental profit margin on something like that as you go from 3% deflation to zero or a little bit positive, the incremental margin on that has got to be fairly high. Have you looked at what that might be? It’s got to be double digit I would imagine, maybe even higher than that.
William DeLaney: We really don’t look at it like that. What we look at is more along the lines of your first question. The key economic metric for us is gross profit dollars per stock and as long as we can manage that even through these difficult times when the penetration was off some and pieces were down, if we can somehow compete to minimize that loss of pieces, obviously price our products appropriately, that’s what we do and generally that usually ends up to get results for us.
John Heinbockel – Goldman Sachs: ERP costs or business transformation costs, what was that? Do you have that for the first half of the year that we can back into the second half?
Chris Kreidler: I’ll preview a little of what you’ll see in the 10-Q. As we’ve said in December, the total cost of the project was $900 million. We expect that the total spend in 2010, or we do expect now to be somewhere between $250 million and $275 million. The first half we spent approximately one-third of that and so the rest will be in the second half of the year. The capital portion of that $250 million to $275 million is estimated to be about $160 million to $175 million. So the incremental impact from business transformation we expect to be $40 million to $50 million which would be a reduction in operating income this year. That’s our $0.05 a share that we previewed in December.
John Heinbockel – Goldman Sachs: Would the OpEx part of that also be one-third/two-thirds split?
Chris Kreidler: It’s roughly correct, yes.
John Heinbockel – Goldman Sachs: What’s the environment right now? I imagine it hasn’t changed much since December, but the environment acquisition wise, is there much difference domestic versus international?
William DeLaney: The focus is more domestic right now. I would say to you we continue to try to develop relationships where that makes sense. I would say to your point that the environment is not much different. I would say also, our environment continues to be very proactive. We’re looking at as much as we can. We’re not waiting for the calls to come in. But I think it’s still, characterize it as an environment where if you don’t need to sell your business right now, you’re probably not going to be overly interested in doing that. But the problem is more quality of asset as opposed to price. Price was the problem in the past. That all comes together once you’re talking to people but I think right now folks, they’ve got earnings pressure. That’s not necessarily a great way to start negotiation in terms of applying a multiple. Maybe there’s just an element that everyone is so focused on running their business right now that they don’t really look at it that way, but I think it will pick up. We’ve been saying that for awhile. We’ve been disappointed that we haven’t seen more activity, but I can tell you internally, we’re tightening up our process and making sure that we are exploring things that make sense.
Operator: Your next question comes from John Ivankoe – J.P. Morgan.
John Ivankoe – J.P. Morgan: I was wondering if you could illuminate the comment that your case volumes have stabilized towards the end of the second quarter. On the casual dining at least on a reported basis, you stayed very weak, traffic down approaching 5%. QSR from what we understand got worse in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter. So if you could give us a little bit of a look through in terms of what types of accounts you have, restaurants or other business that’s doing really well from you and if you could also put that comment in terms of how much of the stabilization and sales trends is just from the fact that you’re taking much more share per account.
Kenneth Spitler: I think the question is how did the quarter look for us in terms of increasing our cases through our operation and sequentially it got better as we went along to the point of December was relative to the rest of the environment, pretty good month where we saw a nice little bump in cases. That hits the rest of the question which is how does it look in January and we’re still seeing positive cases, but it’s declined from the December numbers. So we’re still optimistic because it generally does that anyway, so it’s following kind of a standard pattern if you will. But the good news is it’s still positive. As far as there are still closures going on in the restaurant business? You’re still seeing certain parts of the industry that you know about that are declining in case sales.  Part of our business too is not related necessarily to the restaurant business which is health care is no pun intended, quite healthy and growing and of course our institutional business, the schools and those kinds of things have maintained their sales. The other part is, yes, I think we are taking share. It’s still one of those difficult questions to answer for you because it’s hard to sort out declining cases in certain customer bases and where you’re gaining share in other cases. So it’s really hard to sort out. It’s just that at the end of the day, the real measurement that we’ve got to us is we are increasing our cases, and the answer to that is yes. 
John Ivankoe – J.P. Morgan: If you wouldn’t mind, can you even look through a little bit more especially on your Boardlines business? Is there geography specifically that’s doing very well and is there a type of account within Broadlines perhaps in restaurants that’s doing particularly well, especially relative for example the first quarter?
Kenneth Spitler: We’re still continuing to have a rough go in the Midwest and in the Florida area and somewhat on the Southern West Coast, so that kind of remains the same. The Southwest is doing pretty good. The Northeast is holding its own. Northwest seems to be holding its own. Within the category of restaurants, it seems to us that the family style restaurant, the restaurant that is value driven is doing pretty well right now and the top end is still suffering, meaning $100 meal and up kind of places are still trailing pretty badly.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mark Wiltamuth – Morgan Stanley.
Mark Wiltamuth – Morgan Stanley: If you look at your head count reduction of about 4% how much of that do you think will hold when we start coming out of things and volumes really start picking up? It seems to me like you’re going to have to add back some bodies when the case volume starts picking up.
Kenneth Spitler: We’re already starting to add bodies in terms of the sales force. Sequentially we’re up, I was looking at the number, it’s about 75 to 100 we’ve added sequentially over the last few months. So yes, we’ve already started adding back sales people because we think that the environment is right for us to start continuing to leverage to grow sales. Then, it becomes a matter of, we have improved some productivity. We’re still improving productivity. It’s not going to be a one for one bring back, although it does have a lot to do with cases. To tell you I have that exactly in mind, but I can tell you this, that we will be a leaner organization as the sales start to grow because as we’ve been forced by the environment, we’ve gotten a lot more productive. When you have an error rate in our business of one in 1,800 and then you, just in the last some ’08 to ’09 to 10, we’ve gone from 695 cases to 701 to 722. Those are all the kind of things that you don’t back up on. You don’t need to back up on. Continuous improvement, your cases per man hours, those are big numbers to us and we’re getting improvement on those. Just because the economy gets better those numbers don’t go down. So we’ve really been in some ways forced to do, to get better faster, and we’ve still got a lot of initiatives out there that we talked about in December to really improve our productivity. So long story short, I rambled a little bit. I’m sorry but these improvements are sticking.
Mark Wiltamuth – Morgan Stanley:  If you could just give us a little snapshot, you talked a little bit about share and which segments are doing better or worse and parts of the country are doing better or worse, but how is the price competition out there right now and what are you seeing in that regard?
Kenneth Spitler: It’s tough. Very aggressive competitors on the price front. That’s not our first rodeo there of course. We’re used to being the market leader so we’re used to staving off price attacks. It’s been a lot more frequent and of course the customer base gets a little more upset, so we’ve had to be cautiously defensive about that but there’s definitely an uptick to it.
Mark Wiltamuth – Morgan Stanley: Have you generally been matching where you’ve been meeting competition?
Kenneth Spitler: I wouldn’t say we always match the price, but that’s a waterfall that you don’t want to go over but we’ve found ways to hang on to our business without destroying our margins which is no mean trick.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ajay Jain – Hapoalim Securities.
Ajay Jain – Hapoalim Securities: I wanted to back to the question about the improved case volume trends. If I understood correctly, it sounds like volume stabilized further in November and December relative to what you presented at the Analysts Day, so I’m wondering is there any read through for the Indiana RDC based on what you’re seeing right now? Are you close to a decision there?
Kenneth Spitler: We’re pretty close. What we’d like to see, as you know, our business, we make this quarter in March and if we continue to see good paced growth through March, we’ll feel very comfortable about going forward. We couldn’t put a shovel in the ground in Indiana right now anyway so I will feel comfortable after we see the March numbers and the quarter numbers. I feel pretty comfortable that we’re going to go forward with it, but we’d like to see those numbers stabilize. We need positive cases to make the RDC go around and we won’t build it until we see it.
William DeLaney: I just want to clarify something in terms of how you caveat that question. I would say to you that the volume trends we’ve seen since the Analysts Day are very consistent with what we talked about. We were starting to see that uptick in late November and December, very mild and modest, and that’s how it stands. But to Ken’s point, this is a unique quarter and until we get in March, it’s really hard to draw any conclusions.
Ajay Jain – Hapoalim Securities: On the improvement in comparisons for bad debt expense, my question is whether that improvement is a function of the operating environment just getting better or if there is something specific that you’re seeing with your customers in terms of their credit quality?
Kenneth Spitler: We manage the credit the same way we’ve managed it for 35 years, so we have just been very careful and cautious. I can’t really tell you whether it’s, I think we have good customer quality at Sysco and that’s one of the things that you’re seeing in our write offs is that our customers have managed their businesses pretty well too.
Chris Kreidler: I think if you look at least year you’ll see the third quarter we really took a pretty substantial hit by our standards so we go up against that this quarter. So again, our folks do a good job managing credit. We’ve been fortunate. Part of that is customer quality. We haven’t had any big hits and hopefully that will continue, but I would still tell you it’s still pretty fragile out there.
Ajay Jain – Hapoalim Securities: On the head count reduction, I wanted to clarify one thing. It sounded like you’re hiring more sales people so I’m just trying to reconcile the additional head count in marketing associates that Ken talked about with the decrease in payroll costs that you just reported. Should we infer that you’re adding more customer contact personnel but lowering head count in other areas of the company?
Kenneth Spitler: Not necessarily, no. It’s sequential first of all. We’re still down from over a year ago, but it’s strictly marketing associates that we’re adding.
Ajay Jain – Hapoalim Securities: I’m still trying to reconcile the delta. If your payroll costs are down year over year, you’re saying that’s all marketing associate driven?
William DeLaney: No, what we’re saying is we’re down year over year in head count including in sales, and down in payroll. And then what Ken was saying earlier is that as we’re managing the business going forward sequentially, we’re beginning to add sales people. But we’re still down in sales people year over year. So that’s consistent with the payroll number.
Operator: Your next question comes from Meredith Adler – Barclays Capital.
Meredith Adler – Barclays Capital: Could we talk a little bit first about fuel? I know that you had less fuel costs but also less fuel surcharge. The fuel prices are starting to go up again. Can you talk a little bit about how you think that plays out for the rest of the year?
Kenneth Spitler: We of course are very conservative about how it plays out the rest of the year. Everything that we’re seeing and reading and being coached on tells us that what we’re seeing about as a barrel price right now is about what we can expect the rest of the year so we’re not looking for any big increases.
William DeLaney: We still have some forward contracts out there, about a third.
Kenneth Spitler: We have about 40%. So we protected as much as we think we need to. So again, we’re not diesel experts, we’re just trying to make the year over year comparison flat. But again, who knows? So our prediction from our experts that we rely on next year is going to relatively flat.
Meredith Adler – Barclays Capital: And the fuel surcharges would come back into place if they needed to?
Kenneth Spitler: They could at a certain level. We don’t see that being triggered at this level.
Meredith Adler – Barclays Capital: We haven’t spoken about pension costs in a long time, but is there anything to comment on there? Is pension expense up meaningfully this year over last year?
Kenneth Spitler: In the K we detailed what pension expense would be for the year and we’re on track on that. We don’t have or foresee any significant multi-employer pension employments at this point, and as you recall we took a write off or write down on that last year I believe in the third quarter. It’s about $8 million to $9 million a quarter.
Meredith Adler – Barclays Capital: I’d like to go back to the question of the promotional environment. I’m just wondering whether the gross margin ended up being pretty much in line with what you had expected for the quarter. You did have a pretty good gross margin performance last quarter, but we’re about flat this quarter. Was there a surprise in that to you or was that in line with your expectation?
William DeLaney: I’d say it’s in line with our expectation given Ken’s characterization of the market which is extremely competitive out there. It remains that way and I think we’ll be fighting margins here for awhile.
Meredith Adler – Barclays Capital: Just to go back to what Chris was saying about the business transformation process, I think I’m a little thick this morning. The numbers that Chris, you talked about the $900 million and that’s both CapEx and operating expenses and then you gave specific numbers, and I was just trying to make sure the numbers are $250 million to 4275 million in the first half. Is that a combination of CapEx and operating expenses?
Kenneth Spitler: Let me go back through it just to make sure we’re clear. If you recall back in December, we said $900 million was the total cost of the project, both capital and operating expense. We also shared a bar chart that said that we expected 2010 to be about $275 million. We are now saying, you’ll see this in the Q, we expect that to be a range of $250 million to $275 million for the year. So that’s both operating expense and capital. The capital portion of that we expect to be $160 million to $175 million. That’s the full year number. And then we gave the breakout, we spent about one-third of that to date and roughly a third both on the capital side and the operating expense side, so the remainder will be in the back half of the year.
Operator: Your next question comes from Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets.
Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets: On the expenses with the SAP and the transformation project, $100 for you is roughly about $0.10 a share. Does that mean you had $0.05 in there last year? I’m also having a thickness issue with your numbers.
Kenneth Spitler: Again, not a thickness. It’s a new topic. We haven’t talked it about a lot so we know that there’s going to be some education process here. We use the term incremental not to mean year over year. As we discussed in December, we put a lot of folks that were already here at Sysco onto this project, I think 312 was the number that we talked about in December. So those people were in our run rates, our expense run rates last year. Those folks are now working on the project. So when we talk about a $900 million project, that’s the total cost including those people, but those people aren’t incremental expense. So when we talk about year over year, that was the number I gave earlier, we expect the expense year over year to be about $40 million to $50 million additional.
Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets: So there was already, let’s use $100 million as a round number. You’re already spending $50 million to $60 million.
Kenneth Spitler: Round numbers, that’s about right. We’re now looking at all the outside folks that we’ve had to hire to bring in to manage the projects.
Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets: The tax rate, is that swinging around just on the COLI? 
Chris Kreidler: Primarily COLI and the tax settlement if you’re looking at the first half. Tax settlement obviously affected the tax rate to the tune of I think 300 basis points, 320 basis points. And then COLI which is not deductible for income tax purposes affected it both this year and last year different directions.
Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets: On the consolidation side, I read a recent news story out of Michigan where this company up there, Clark Food Services apparently closing one of their DC’s. It looks like they’re doing an orderly liquidation and just sort of Sysco is coming in and servicing those customers. 
Kenneth Spitler: We were the white knight here. It was an orderly shut down at best.
Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets: You had referenced that, as an industry leader you have a certain responsibility and I understand that, but what I really want to know, I assume in the long run getting these customers is probably a good thing. Is this kind of liquidation something you think is a one off or is this something that if the environment doesn’t pick up that we might see some more of?
Kenneth Spitler: I think we’re going to see some more of it. They just run up to the post here and it’s over. They do care about their employees. They want a little help with their inventory. We can do all of that for them and are glad to do it. It’s good for us. It’s good for them.
Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets: So on consolidation, it kind of looks like if things don’t get better, this could happen and if things got better, Sysco might hit the bids on some improving businesses? Is that somewhat a realistic way to look at how consolidation could influence you?
William DeLaney: I’m not sure I understand that question.
Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets: If the environment gets better and these reluctant sellers, their EBITDA goes up, it would be easier to buy them.
William DeLaney: We certainly hope so, and like I say, we have antennae’s up and we’re doing what we can do but they’ve got to get to a point where they want to sell their business and negotiate in a reasonable way and as Ken said, sometimes these types of deals you’re talking about right now are sometimes they just ran out of shoes at the finish line. It’s not always protracted discussions.
Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets: On deflation, has it switched to inflation yet overall and can you give a little bit of a category flavor?
William DeLaney: It hasn’t switched. It continues to moderate and categories would be in terms of deflation, the ones that are driving up to this point, would be dairy, beef, that type of thing. Going forward, some of this what we’d like a lot of these numbers, you’ve got to wrap some numbers here pretty soon, so we would expect the dairy deflation pressure to ease and beef is probably a harder one to call. On the supply side there is not oversupply but the demand continues to be weak and that seems to be keeping those prices under pressure. So we’ll have to see there. So we’re hoping to see a continuation of the moderations if you will and at some point see some mild inflation. But it’s hard to call.
Kenneth Spitler: We’re not sure of the timing but from our merchandizing folks, them talking to the manufacturers, there is a feeling and a prediction of inflation to come and most significantly big areas of beef, pork, poultry, dairy. So that would be good news for us. I hope that’s right.
William DeLaney: Again when you start talking inflation, especially in this environment, the best scenario for us to two or three points. We certainly wouldn’t be saying to return to where we were a year and a half ago where it was six and eight points because our customers have enough challenges as it is without that.
Operator: Your next question comes from Gregory Badishkanian – Citi.
Gregory Badishkanian – Citi: Just a questions with respect to discounting by your customers, how has that changed versus last quarter? Any particular segment discounting either less or more heavily when you look at QSR versus casual dining chains versus independents?
Kenneth Spitler: It’s coming from all fronts. We even are getting some pressure on the chain business, so it’s everywhere.
Gregory Badishkanian – Citi: I’m thinking more your customers discounting to the end user.
Kenneth Spitler: I don’t think it’s any more or less than what we’ve seen in the past.
William DeLaney: I think our customers are getting smarter on the discounting; where it works in some form or fashion. There have been some other people out there that tried some things that they haven’t gotten a return for.
Gregory Badishkanian – Citi: You also spoke about productivity which you’ve done an amazing job over the last two years or so. Obviously you’re hiring a few more people back but what’s the real opportunity there to cut costs so that you can improve efficiencies further in 2010 calendar versus what you did in calendar 2009? Or have you basically taken up all the low hanging fruit?
Kenneth Spitler: Well none of it is low hanging. It all takes a lot of work and we still have plenty of room out there to improve and we’ve still got 10 initiatives prior to the installation of our first SAP that we want to finish that will give us another pretty significant boost in our productivity. Just to give you an example, we’re going to continue to run on our Swim’s platform which is our operating system in the warehouse as opposed to SAP’s so we have an initiative out there that is a best practices initiative. It’s all I call it switch driven, but doing certain things a certain way and all of our operating companies within three months are going to go best practices. So we’ll have that finalized in July. We should see a really nice uptick across the board for productivity. So again, we have 10 of those out there. That’s just one of them. So to say that we’re all done is not true. We’ve still got lots of room. We’ve still got lots of improvement. There are some definitive spots where we run up against, physically we’ll probably be able to get to about our 750 to 760 cases per truck and then you run out of room. But there are lots of other productivity measures that we continue to increase on and continue to have room to do.
William DeLaney: I think when you read the Q you’re going to see the tone on this issue is just what Ken said, we certainly see room for improvement. There’s a lot going on. The rate of improvement is not going to be what you’ve seen over the last 12 to 18 months. 
Kenneth Spitler: Keep in mind too that most of these are case driven and we’ve got cases going down. You get some case improvement you get some improvement just by the nature of the math. So we’ve got headwinds all over the place and still improving.
Operator: With that there are no other questions in the roster so we thank you for your participation in the Q&A session and for joining us today. That will conclude today’s conference call. Have a good day and thank you for joining.

Operator: Welcome to the Sysco Corporation First Quarter Fiscal 2010 Earnings. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Neil Russell, Vice President Investor Relations.

With that out of the way, I'll turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Bill DeLaney. 
William J. DeLaney III : Earlier this morning, Sysco reported net earnings of $326 million for the first fiscal quarter of the year. Sales continue to be under pressure declined by 8%, due to both lower volumes and the impact of food cost deflation. Despite these challenging conditions, we were able to improve our operating margins to 5.5% as a result of excellent cost control, as well as a benefit from COLI, both of which we will discuss in more detail in a few minutes.  At Sysco, we constantly strive for continuous improvement, by focusing on strengthening our customer relationships and improving productivity in all aspects of our business we've been able to compete effectively throughout this economic downturn. Most important, we believe we are well positioned for profitable growth when industry conditions begin to improve.  Regarding the economy, we are hopeful that some of the promising signs and sentiments that are beginning to materialize will soon result in increased consumer spending. That, together with the moderation of deflation, would be favorable developments for Sysco.  In the interim, we are encouraged by the fact that the rate of decline in our case volumes has stabilized in recent weeks. We will continue to closely monitor the macroeconomic outlook and will remain vigilant in our efforts to manage the business responsibly during this period of economic uncertainty.  Specifically, we remain committed to exceeding the expectations of our customers through our relentless commitment to product and service quality, investing in our business to improve productivity, enhance profitability and grow market share, and maintaining balance sheet strength through strong operating cash flow generation and sound asset management.  Before I turn the call over to Ken, I would like to recognize all of our associates and our management team for their outstanding contributions over the past year. I also want to welcome Chris Kreidler, our new CFO. Chris is an important addition to the team and brings with him extensive food industry and finance experience. You'll hear from Chris later in the call and you'll have an opportunity to get to know him better in the coming weeks and in particular at our Investor Day in December.  With that, Ken will now discuss our operating results for the quarter. 
Kenneth F. Spitler : Once again, I am pleased with the operational results we achieved during the quarter. Our operating company's did a great job managing the business during the quarter. Operating expenses were down $132 million or 9.5% compared to the prior year, mainly due to the lower payroll expenses. Our headcount is down 5% year-over-year and 9% over two years as we improve productivity throughout the company.  Expense levels also reflect our pay-for-performance culture as incentive-based compensation continues to be down from the prior year. As a result, our operating margin improved 0.4 points to 5.5%. These results achieved in a tough environment reflect the broad range of capabilities and commitment of our operating companies.  Our sales during the quarter were impacted by deflation of 3.4%, which has majored as an estimated change in the cost of products we buy. We weathered similar levels of deflation in the early 2000s and we believe we will manage through these challenges again by continuing to find ways to operate more efficiently. We continue to lead the industry in operational efficiency and I'm pleased with how our companies continue to perform. For example, in our U.S. Broadline company's year-over-year during the first quarter our diesel gallon usage decreased 2.3%, cases per trip increased 1% and warehouse cases per man hour improved 5%.  However, these numbers only tell part of the story as they each represent improvements on top of improved results from the prior year. For example, over the past two years, comparing the first quarter of 2010 to the first quarter of 2008, we improved our error frequency per cases shipped to an error rate of 1 out of 1,700 from an error rate of 1 out of 1,200 cases. Cases per trip increased 3.4% and total sales per employee increased 6%.  Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $109 million. Looking ahead, we still expect capital spending for the full year to be in the range of $600 million to $650 million as we continue to invest in our business. This spending includes maintenance items, such as ongoing fleet replacement and facility repairs and growth items, such as expansions of our current facilities and potential foldouts. Our capital spending also includes expenditures related to our ongoing ERP project.  As we discussed last quarter, the ERP project is about a lot more than technology. We are taking the opportunity to review many of our processes to find ways to further streamline our operations and grow our business. In the end, the technology is an enabler for what we are designing, which is a business transformation. We have largely completed the design work and will provide an update on the project in December. In closing, I'd like to thank all of our associates for their continued hard work to support our customers and improve our operations. Now I'll turn it over to Chris for a discussion of our financial results for the quarter.
Chris Kreidler:  Before I summarize the first quarter results, I'd like to say what a privilege it is to join Sysco. I recognize the long history Sysco has of delivering impressive financial results to all stakeholders. The balance sheet strength, responsible management of the business, continued innovation and focus on customer service and the quality of the associates at this company are unmatched and I look forward to being a part of this team. For the first quarter of fiscal 2010, sales were down 8.1% due primarily to lower volumes, estimated deflation of 3.4%, and the impact of foreign exchange rates which reduced sales by 0.5%. These items were partially offset by the impact of acquisitions which increased sales 5.6%. Net earnings for the quarter increased 17.8% to $326 million.  Similarly, EPS for the quarter increased 19.6% to $0.55 per share. The $0.55 per share includes a $0.05 after-tax income benefit related to the IRS settlement and a $0.04 favorable impact related to the increase during the quarter and the cash render value of corporate owned life insurance which we refer to as COLI. The $132 million reduction in operating costs that Ken discussed earlier was primarily due to lower payroll expense. The reduction also included a $44 million benefit from the year-over-year change in value related to the performance of COLI.  Income tax expense declined $65 million year-over-year including a $25 million benefit from the reversal of an accrual related to the IRS settlement, which the company announced on August 25, and a $17 million reduction in expense as a result of the change in value related to the performance of COLI. With regards to the tax settlement, we paid $316 million to the IRS during the quarter. The company will continue to make quarterly payments of $53 million through the fourth quarter of 2012. In spite of the $316 million payments to the IRS, cash flow from operations for the quarter was $46.5 million, a decrease of only $16.9 million from the prior year. The decline was primarily driven by the tax settlement payment partially offset by working capital improvements and lower incentive compensation payments in the current year versus prior year.  In closing, I'd like to thank everyone at Sysco for welcoming me to the team and I certainly look forward to interacting with the investment community as we move forward. With that, operator we will now take some questions. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Ajay Jaim – Hapoalim Securities.
Ajay Jaim – Hapoalim Securities USA: First on the tax rate, if I add that $29 million as the after-tax amount for the IRS adjustment, the implied tax rate is around 36%, which still seems lower than what I would have expected for normalized tax rate, is there anything else driving a lower tax rate apart from the IRS settlement that you can speak to? 
William J. DeLaney III :  Ajay, we're still in transition here so I'm going to fumble through some of this finance stuff here for one more quarter. Essentially, it's what you just said plus what Chris was alluding to was the COLI. COLI was favorable in same comment, but it's not taxable. So those are the two key things and if you adjust for those that'll bring you into that 38%, 39% range. 
Ajay Jaim – Hapoalim Securities USA: I also just wanted to confirm how much bad debt expense was actually recognized on the P&L last quarter. It looks like losses on sale of receivables or we're down year-over-year, is that correct? 
William J. DeLaney III : Yes, it's about $8.5 million. I think it's on the funds flow statement. That's in the earnings release. It's a little bit less than last year. We've had some recoveries and so far we continue to do a nice job managing credit, still kind of cautious in terms of the environment but it's a little bit less than last year. 
Ajay Jaim – Hapoalim Securities USA: So the cash flow and saving figure is consistent with what you accrued on the P&L? 
William J. DeLaney III : It's exactly what we accrued on the P&L.
Ajay Jaim – Hapoalim Securities USA: So do you think you're at an inflection point now where credit quality is improving or do you think it's still premature to make that assessment?
William J. DeLaney III : I think that one is a little early to call. We've pretty consistently said over the last couple of years that credit is more of a lagging indicator. And again, we're pleased with how we're managing it but I don't think we're out of the woods yet on credit. 
Ajay Jaim – Hapoalim Securities USA: I just had one final question on payroll expense. I think Ken confirmed the figure on the year-over-year decline in headcount, but can you just provide the figure for payroll expense was all the $130 million in lower operating expense from payroll? 
William J. DeLaney III : We're going to file the Q tomorrow and there's a number in there. I think it's –
Chris Kreidler: $68 million to $70 million which related to payroll I believe. 
William J. DeLaney III : So it's around $70 million and that's a combination of both wages, as well as incentive payments. 
Ajay Jaim – Hapoalim Securities USA: Do you have any feedback for just over the balance fee or how much room is there to go on the payroll side without the risk of hurting your street account relationships? 
Kenneth F. Spitler: Yes, actually Ajay there's still, again, we're shipping cases so a lot of our transportation and warehouse are 1 to 1. However we are beginning to build our sales force again, so last quarter we added marketing associates. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Jason Whitmer – Cleveland Research Company.
Jason Whitmer – Cleveland Research Company: Could you guys provide a little more color or clarity on the case improvement? Is that sequential volume improvement where you're actually seeing an increase in cases, you mentioned the rate of decline is changing at a comparison figure versus last year when maybe the business started to soften up a little bit and maybe just the outlook in general where you think some of the drivers to drive cases going forward might be? 
William J. DeLaney III : I'll start Jay, and then Ken will jump in here. We've struggled with the exact precision of the language and really all we're trying to say is the rate of the year-over-year decline is flat now and hopeful it will begin to start moving the other way here as the quarter goes along. We're somewhat encouraged. We're still in a very fragile stage of this recovery, if that's what we are in the middle here and beginning of right now. So all we're trying to say is our rate of decline has stabilized and we're hopeful that it's going to start to move forward, but it's still down year-over-year. 
Kenneth F. Spitler: We are seeing some positive movement sequentially and I would say good enough to start adding MA's again. 
Jason Whitmer – Cleveland Research Company: As far as drivers going forward I guess adding MA's it might be helpful, but I believe you've said a number of times in the last six months or so that you're trying to get a little bit back to some core sales and marketing initiatives. Could you talk a little bit further about some progress on that and whether that's inclusive of refining a business review or a business development process or if there is anything else? Ken, I think you mentioned last quarter about a stimulus program. Where are we at within your ability to drive volume going forward, proactively? 
William J. DeLaney III : Well, it's all the above. You just hit on it, Jay. Obviously, it would help I guess as I said in my words it would help to get the consumer back on their feet and where our customers are seeing a little bit more growth. But in the interim we're staying very close to our customers. We continue not just to do business reviews, but we think we're getting better at targeting the right customers and the quality reviews are better. The stimulus package was really more of an attempt that we talked about last quarter to create some enthusiasm out there with our sales force and with our customers and adding the salespeople. We're beginning to bring sales people back on over where we were a quarter or two ago is important as well, so those are all the basics that we do all the time. We're just hopeful that this is a better time to be employing those tactics. 
Jason Whitmer – Cleveland Research Company: Last question on your own brand, the Sysco brand, is there any return of a focus on that to drive that business again? Or to kind of continue to define that platform and anything that could change the mix shift or even the margin components of branded versus your own brand versus the national brands? 
Kenneth F. Spitler:  Jay, this is Ken. Yes, we've just begun a reemphasis of brand and brand sales, reemphasis in our sales force and in our sales meetings start driving those numbers back up. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Meredith Adler – Barclays Capital.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: I'd like to just go back to the last question about the stimulus package. There was some discussion on the last call about sort of general environment for discounting, which seemed to be a little hot or more aggressive than you'd seen in awhile. Could you maybe just comment on what you're seeing there and how you feel your response is positioned? Are you doing the right things? Are your customers pleased with it? 
Kenneth F. Spitler: Meredith, we certainly hope out customers are pleased with it. The stimulus package certainly was an answer to a lot of discounting that has gone on in our competitive landscape. It was well received by our marketing associates and well received by our customers.  It was in an effort to just stimulate, so to speak, our customers and help our customers in a lot of areas where it was commodity type items that drive a lot of their food costs. So it was well received. Yes, we think we're doing the right things. Our play book hasn't changed we've just got them all in play. 
Meredith Adler – Barclays Capital: I'd like to go back to the answer you just gave about private label and I wasn't sure, you said a reemphasis of brand and brand sales. Did you mean your own brand or did you mean national brands?
Kenneth F. Spitler: No, I meant our brand that we're reemphasizing it with our sales force and our customer base. 
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: Then maybe just a little bit more discussion of the ability to cut expenses. You've done absolutely an extraordinary job and I'll say again congratulations, but you're not yet seeing volumes stabilize. Is there a point here where you just really can't reasonably cut any more, and actually maybe I should ask the question differently? You've started adding marketing reps. You clearly have confidence that you are going to see a stabilization of volume. How much data do you have to tell you that this is the right timing to start adding the reps? 
Kenneth J. Spitler: Well, that's very good question. We are seeing some stabilization. There's a lot of conflicting industry reporting out there whether the certain segments of the restaurant business is up or down. And what we judge all this by is what's happening to our customer base. We feel like it is stable. We feel like that we have an opportunity to start being a little more aggressive in terms of taking more products, more customer share.  We manage that sales force down with the rest of our headcount. They're a big part of our headcount numbers. We feel good about the second half of the year, and we are getting ready to – as industry leader we think it's our turn to start exerting some pressure on our competitors being more aggressive. 
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: My final question would be about deflation. We're certainly going to be cycling the big drops in perishables like dairy and produce. What are you seeing in other parts of the products you sell, meat, any kind of deli or bakery items and what about the packaged stuff, the manufactured stuff you sell? What's happening with pricing in those areas? 
William J. DeLaney: Well, the meat is down currently and has been for a while. Poultry is up a little bit. Seafood is down. Grocery items are kind of up and down you might say, Meredith. So our numbers right now are being driven by the dairy primarily, a little bit by produce and meat. So to your point, we're going to wrap some of those numbers on a year-over-year basis. We've got Larry Pulliam here today. I'll let him speak a little bit to what he's seeing in some of the commodities. 
Larry Pulliam: Yes, Meredith, let me speak about it two different ways. One is as we look at the cost that we pay for goods, it's a lagging indicator. As we look at the commodity reports that we analyze on a weekly and monthly basis, we have seen some firming up on prices, especially in the month of October. We saw our commodity prices firming and we saw last year at this time prices began to fall fairly rapidly.  So our comparisons are better in the month of October. It remains to be seen. We've got to watch our cost of goods as relates to those commodity prices, but I think the sentiment around here is we feel pretty good about moderation of that inflation number over the next month or two. 
Operator: Your next question comes from John Heinbockel – Goldman Sachs. 
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: Bill, a year ago when did you guys see business begin to fall off a cliff? Was that about now or was that earlier? 
William J. DeLaney: It was about a week after Lehman went down, I think. It was last September and then it fell off and I'd say it the wall November, December, Ken? 
Kenneth F. Spitler: That's about right. 
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: Do you think as we cycle some of those worse months, do you think that naturally gives way to case improvement, or not necessarily that we may just stabilize at a lower level for a while? 
William J. DeLaney: Well, clearly the comparisons get a little bit easier as we get deeper into the second quarter and the second half of the year, so that should get us back toward that breakeven level. The only hesitancy you're going to hear in my voice is just, like I alluded to a few minutes ago John, it's still a fairly fragile environment out there. So some weeks are better than others.  But the pattern we have seen in recent weeks and the reason you hear a little more optimism in our words is this rate of decline has stabilized. We're hopeful that we're moving in the right direction. What's not clear is to what extent we're going to see growth in the second half of the year, how much. 
Kenneth F. Spitler: Yes, we think about mid-December, of course, we benefit from the good comparison from bad numbers. But, yes, we actually feel like with the work that we've done on expenses that we could do very well with flat cases. And we feel like that we can do enough to start moving the cases in a positive direction in the second half of the year. 
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: Do you have any good way of telling how much share you're picking up? Are you accelerating faster than or are you seeing cases stabilize faster than everybody else? 
Kenneth F. Spitler: Hard to say. 
William J. DeLaney: That's a hard one to call, John. We think we're competing very well as I've said, but we work of the [Technomus] number and we'll see where they come in for they year and they tend to revise their numbers, but we certainly think we're holding our own there. 
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: What's happening with drop size now? 
Kenneth F. Spitler: Drop size remains about where it has always been. 
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: So on the one hand restaurants would be ordering less, but you're probably cutting them back and some of them are dropping out. Some of the low volume ones are dropping out. So I guess is there stability? There seems to be stability in that metric. 
Kenneth F. Spitler: I think that's a good way to say it. 
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: Headcount, how did that compare to last quarter? Was it still down or are we seeing some increase or what? 
Kenneth F. Spitler: It's about the same. It's a little better. It's down a little bit. 
William J. DeLaney: Are you talking about the delta? 
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: Yes, I know it's down 5% year-over-year, but versus the end of the fourth quarter. 
William J. DeLaney: Yes, I think we were down five or six maybe in the fourth quarter. 
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: No, I meant the end of the fourth quarter versus the end of the first quarter. 
Kenneth F. Spitler: Small, it's still down. 
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: Finally, what are we seeing now on the acquisition front? You've talked about expectations were too high, has that finally fixed itself? 
William J. DeLaney: I can't say that. All I can tell you there, John, is we're still talking to some people. The pipeline is not as deep as we'd like to see. The expectation is case-by-case. So we had a situation over the last few days where it looks like one of our competitors may have gone out of business in one of the markets and we'll pick up some business there. So one way or another we're going after the business. We'd like to acquire them and hopefully they'll find us. Like I said, I think we've been saying this to you, we're becoming more proactive, but in the end it takes two people to make a deal work. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Mark Wiltamuth – Morgan Stanley. 
Mark Wiltamuth – Morgan Stanley: I wanted to focus in a little more on the expense line. You started to see some significant year-over-year cost savings on operating expenses in third quarter. I'm wondering what you're going to do when you start lapping out of those expense savings, specifically is the ERP program something that could help extend the cost cutting? 
William J. DeLaney: Well, we're going to talk more about the ERP program in December in terms of what the impact of that is short-term and longer term. As far as the comparisons second half of the year, they do become more challenging in the third and fourth quarters. I'll let Ken speak to the headcount and that type of thing, but there's still room for improvement. There's a law of dimension returns here at some point, but we still think we can make improvement on the expense side. 
Kenneth F. Spitler: Yes, it gets a little harder when we wrap around the next couple of quarters, but again, we're feeling positive about being able to exert some pressure on the competitors and move the cases forward. And at the expense level that we're at right now, we feel like we can do very well there. 
Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley: So it sounds like on a basis points situation, you could still do better on SG&A if the cases are moving. Is that fair? 
Kenneth F. Spitler: Yes. 
William J. DeLaney: To come at your question from both sides, we really need to see some case growth here the second half of the year to improve the expenses. 
Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley: I guess we'll hear more on ERP in December. 
William J. DeLaney: Yes, sir. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets. 
Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets: A follow up on the last question, you've done a great job of getting I think variable and fixed costs down pretty much at the same rate as volume. So I guess what you're talking about is the leverage, let's say volume is going to turn up at some point in the future and let's say that's somewhat sooner than later, whatever. Is the operating leverage you're talking about going to come from bringing down that you basically have a fixed cost structure, because I just can't imagine how you can't, in a sense, have to add back variable cost almost at the same rate that the volume would uptick? So would it be normal economics of leveraging the fixed cost that you've been able to bring down the cost structure?
William J. DeLaney: A lot of this, we get into these discussions on what's fixed and what's variable, so we'd love to have the problem where it comes back so radically that we're up 8%, 10% and all of a sudden now you're talking about hiring people. But I think what we're realistically hoping for is a modest level of growth, and again Ken can speak to this more than me, but the reality is if you get a little bit of a case pickup, we can handle that for the most part with the drivers that we have, with the warehouse people that we have, and certainly with the other sales support. We would like to see the sales the MA numbers start to pickup, but we can handle a moderate level of case growth with the folks we have out there today.
Kenneth F. Spitler: Yes, that's about the size of it. Actually, just a little pickup in cases really greases our system better. Our system works better with a little pressure on it.
Andrew Wolfe - BB&T Capital Markets: Gross margin, I don't think anyone's mentioned it yet, at least versus my expectations, and last quarter was really quite improved. So could you talk a little about that in light of, I think you continued the stimulus program in the quarter. Sysco brand penetration is down. EMA was down, not as much as in prior quarters, but what's driving that, because it's hard to see what is driving it based on those criteria.
William J. DeLaney: I don't think there's any one thing driving it. Hopefully what comes through in our conferences and these types of calls is we're managing the business very aggressively at the account level and certainly cost control is a big part of it, but we need to be competitive. The environment is extremely competitive out there right now, but our people know that they need to make a profit on the sales as well. So it's more of an account-by-account management opportunity, that type of thing.
Kenneth F. Spitler: I think our sales force is pretty good at managing and we've had, unfortunately, more experience than we want managing the deflationary times and inflationary times. And the stimulus was not big enough to knock a hole in our margins, but just big enough to kind of stimulate some sales activity. And again, we're just managing.  We spend a lot of time and have spent a lot of time for fear out of that when we started stimulating sales that we did not want margins to go over the waterfall, so to speak, so we spent an awful lot of time with our sales force managing how to manage those individual margins at the individual customers, and I think that's been very successful for us.
William J. DeLaney: The challenge with deflation is not so much the percentages obviously it's the dollars, so far we've been doing a nice job of continuing to create enough dollar growth to offset the expenses.
Andrew Wolfe - BB&T Capital Markets:
Kenneth F. Spitler: I don't think that's too optimistic. I think that some of our smaller competitors have been in this difficult time for some time now. It was a relatively small competitor that went out of business. You see that occasionally. And we participate in the right way in these orderly shutdowns where we try to help them salvage something out of their business. So we like to be on the front end of these, as we categorize them, orderly shutdowns so that kind of everybody survives in it, but we anticipate seeing really more of that and I think it's just a difficult time for some of these smaller guys. 
Operator: Your next question comes from John Ivankoe – JP Morgan. 
John Ivankoe - JP Morgan:
William J. DeLaney: Again, one of the points we try to make is, the answer is yes, but we do it account-by-account basis. So we've got 8,000 give or take commission salespeople out there today selling groceries, so where it makes sense, that's what we're doing. And where it's the right thing for the customer and the right things for Sysco, that's what we're doing. What we don't necessarily subscribe to, the stimulus thing was a good thing to create some excitement commodity items like Ken talked about.  It really wasn't so large that it was going to move the needle on gross profit one way or another. But my point is what we don't do is get into these wholesale promotion-type activities, which frankly our experience and I think even other people's experiences are that that's a very slippery slope to go down. So we certainly reinvest in our business and in our customers but on an account-by-account basis.
Kenneth F. Spitler: Basically we do that through the business review process where we know these customers. The real question is what's sticky, and we like to invest in the money or invest some of these savings that you say where we know it's going to have a long-term sticky effect. It's just been our experience over the years that when you kind of do it wholesale, it doesn't stick. 
John Ivankoe - JP Morgan: Unit development restaurant has proven over time to be a very lagging indicator. Are you seeing any change in the trend in restaurant closures and is that beginning to stabilize now as we head into November?
Kenneth F. Spitler: We don't know if it's stabilized or not. The numbers that we're hearing is around 15,000 to 18,000 closures so far.
William J. DeLaney: I think the one trend we can speak to is we're not seeing a lot of openings. It's still pretty tough out there.
Operator: Your next question comes from Greg Badishkanian – Citigroup.
Jeff Hans for Greg Badishkanian - Citigroup: This is Jeff Hans on for Greg. Just a quick question on the promotional environment in October, have you guys seen things intensify there versus kind of what you saw in the first quarter and the fourth quarter or is that stabilized in Q3?
William J. DeLaney: I think it's very intense. I don't know that it's any worse in October than it was in the summer and into September, but it's still very competitive out there.
Kenneth F. Spitler: But it hasn't intensified in any way.
Jeff Hans for Greg Badishkanian - Citigroup: Then I think last quarter you guys mentioned you'd make a decision on the RDC this September or a few months ago. Any update there? Are you going to go forward?
Kenneth F. Spitler: We're in the process of making that decision now and what I can tell you is we're fairly positive about it.
Operator: Your next question comes from Robert Cummins – Shields & Company. 
Robert Cummins - Shields & Company: All of my questions have been answered already, but I did have one that sort of ties in with comments that were made before. With your sales down 8%, is it possible to quantify how much of that 8% is simply customers closing up shop and going out of business that will never be seen again, and how much of it is reduced same-store volume for your customers?
William J. DeLaney: Most of it is reduced same-store volume, Bob. There's certainly some of what you mentioned there and there's more in lost business and people going out of business than what we've seen in years gone by. But in terms of what we look at, when you look at penetration, that's really where most of that lost business is, which is at our customer level.
Robert Cummins - Shields & Company: Which is positive because at some point people are going to go back to restaurants again.
Kenneth F. Spitler: Yes, exactly. We track that very closely and certainly the closures aren't off the charts for us.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ajay Jaim – Hapoalim Securities USA. 
Ajay Jaim - Hapoalim Securities USA :  I just had one final question. I was wondering if you can talk briefly about margin trends by segments since I don't think that's disclosed in the earnings release, specifically for the specialty business that are grouped together under the all other category? Last year I think margins were down pretty significantly for the all other bucket. Can you comment on what was driving that last year and whether or not there was any improvement in profitability for the specialty businesses in Q1?
William J. DeLaney: Are you talking about operating margins, Ajay?
Ajay Jaim - Hapoalim Securities USA: Yes.
William J. DeLaney: Again, we'll file the Q so it's not in this quarter earnings release that we're looking at today. What I can say is I think you'll see good operating leverage in the operating segments, but you're going to see sales declines.
Ajay Jaim - Hapoalim Securities USA: Any color on what was driving the decrease in EBIT margins last year? I think they were down 70 basis points for other. 
William J. DeLaney: Yes, I can tell you it was COLI. The way that falls out in the segments, a lot of the corporate expenses get dropped into that other area, I think. I'm going to ask you to follow-up with Neil later because I'm shooting from the hip here, but I think it had to be a corporate type of item that would have impacted it in that way.
Operator: At this time there are no further questions. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you very much and have a wonderful day.

Operator:  Please stand by. We’re about to begin. Good day, everyone, and welcome to today’s Sysco Corporation fourth quarter and year end 2009 earnings conference call. As a reminder, today’s call is being recorded.  At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Neil Russell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Neil A. Russell:   Thank you [Daryl], and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us for Sysco’s fourth quarter and fiscal year 2009 conference call. On today’s call you will hear from Bill DeLaney our Chief Executive Officer, and Ken Spitler our Vice Chairman, President and Chief Operating Officer. Before we begin, please note that statements made in the course of this presentation that state the company’s or management’s intentions, beliefs, expectations, or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results could differ in a material manner. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ in a material manner from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company’s SEC filings including, but not limited to, risk factors contained in the company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 28, 2008, and in the company’s press release issued earlier this morning.  Please understand that all comparisons given during the call refer to changes between the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, or between full year fiscal 2009 and the full year of fiscal 2008, unless otherwise noted. Also, all comments about earnings per share refer to diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. Lastly, we ask that you reserve December 14 through 15 on your calendars for a potential analysts day in New York. More information will be forthcoming from my office in the coming weeks. With that out of the way, I’ll turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Bill DeLaney.
William J. DeLaney III: Thank you, Neil, and good morning everyone. Earlier this morning Sysco reported net earnings of $315 million for the fourth quarter and nearly $1.1 billion for fiscal 2009. These results were generated through the consistent support of our customers and the dedicated efforts of our associates in the midst of the most difficult business environment that our industry has ever experienced. While financial performance in general does not reflect the type of year-over-year improvement that Sysco typically produces, we are pleased both with the absolute results and our operating company’s ability to compete successfully by providing excellent service and business solutions to their customers. We’re particularly encouraged by our ability to manage costs effectively throughout our organization in a year when revenues declined for the first time in Sysco’s history. Ken will address this aspect of our operating performance in more detail in just a minute. In addition to controlling costs well, we also generated strong cash flow from operations for the year and enhanced our liquidity by securing $500 million in long term financing. As a result, we were able to invest appropriately in capital projects, modestly increase our acquisition activity over the prior year, and return a large portion of our free cash flow to shareholders.  For now I’ll turn it over to Ken for a discussion on operational results, and then I’ll come back to provide further detail on our financial results. Ken?
Kenneth F. Spitler:  Thanks, Bill. Overall I’m pleased with the operational results we achieved during last year. For 2009 we sold $37 billion of product, generated $1.9 million of operating income, produced cash flow from operations of $1.6 billion and returned $1 billion of capital to our shareholders. Without question, 2009 represented the most challenging sales year we’ve had in Sysco’s 40 year history. However, as has always been Sysco’s focus, our dedicated associates remain committed to serving our customers. Our cost control efforts have not only helped support operating earnings, but have positioned us well for when the economy begins to recover. The key to our success has been improving operational efficiency, and I’m pleased with how our operations continue to perform. For example, in our broad line companies during 2009 our diesel gallon usage decreased 7% compared to a mileage decrease of 5%. Kilowatt hours decreased 7%. Cases per trip increased 2%. Warehouse cases per man hour improved 4% and total sales per employee increased approximately 5%. Capital expenditures for 2009 totaled $465 million. Looking ahead, we remain committed to continuing to invest in our business so as to leverage our leadership position and profitably gain market share. As a result, I expect capital spending for the next year to be in the range of $600 million to $650 million. This spending will be relatively balanced between maintenance items such as ongoing fleet replacement and facility repairs, and growth items such as expansions of current facilities and potential fold-outs.  Also included in this amount is technology, a significant portion of which is dedicated to our ongoing ERP project. With the ERP project, we are taking the opportunity to review many of our processes and finding ways to further streamline our operation. It’s important to note that this project is about a lot more than technology. In the end, the technology is an enabler for what we are designing, which is a business transformation. We have signed a contract with SAP and continue to make progress on the design of our new technology platform. We expect to have design work completed by the end of calendar year and will provide a comprehensive update on the project at the analysts’ day in December that Neil mentioned earlier. The results of 2009 are also representative of our commitment to managing costs across the organization. Our headcount is down approximately 6% year-over-year as we’ve improved productivity throughout the year. Expense levels also reflect our pay for performance culture, as bonuses and commissions were down substantially year-over-year. We are confident that the steps we’ve taken to date will better position us to fully participate to the extent economic recovery occurs during fiscal 2010. In closing, I’d like to thank all of our associates for their continued hard work to support our customers. Now I’ll turn it back over to Bill for a discussion of our financial results for the quarter and for the year.
William J. DeLaney III:   Thank you, Ken. The sales decline of 6.6% in the fourth quarter reflects an ongoing reduction in volume, as well as nearly three points less of inflation than what we experienced in the third quarter. We believe that the two year plus trend of approximately 6% annualized inflation has now reversed, and that we are currently experiencing modest levels of deflation in the early weeks of fiscal 2010. In addition, the impact of acquisitions increased sales by 0.6% in the fourth quarter while the weakening of the Canadian dollar reduced sales by 1.3% in the quarter. As Ken pointed out in his comments, we managed expenses very well throughout the year. However, we should note that the favorable performance of Cole investments contributed $0.03 per share to our fourth quarter results. Conversely for the year, unfavorable Cole investment performance reduced earnings per share by approximately $0.06 when compared to the prior year. Our working capital management improved modestly during fiscal 2009. We’re especially pleased with our ability to improve accounts receivable days outstanding from the prior year. Nevertheless, many of our customers were impacted by today’s cash flow pressures, which resulted in our bad debt expense more than doubling to $74 million for the year. While significantly higher than our expense levels in normal times, this represents just 0.2% of annualized sales. We expect credit management will remain a formidable challenge again in fiscal 2010. As we begin the new fiscal year, we are encouraged by the cautious optimism that appears to be building regarding the economy’s prospects for improvement in the coming months. With that said, the likely pace and extent of such improvement remains unclear. Sysco’s sales comparisons will be particularly challenging early in the fiscal year since we experienced 5% sales growth with 8% inflation in the first quarter of 2009. Sales trends should improve subsequent to the first quarter, assuming the anticipated gradual pickup in underlying economic conditions materializes. Supporting our customers and enhancing productivity in all aspects of our business will remain top priorities in fiscal 2010. While we are hopeful that market conditions will improve as we approach the new calendar year, we are also confident that our industry leadership position and financial strength will permit us to successfully navigate a less favorable economic scenario. Furthermore, we will continue to invest in our business so that we are well positioned to capitalize on those attractive market opportunities that present themselves in the years to come. With that, operator, we’ll now take questions.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley.
Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley:  I wanted to get a little more update on the operating environment heading into the first quarter here. If you look at the Navtrak trends, they were certainly worse for July than what we saw in the June quarter. Just talk about maybe the contrast between how the change you’re doing versus your street accounts.
William J. DeLaney III: Good morning, Mark. This is Bill. I’ll let Ken jump into this as well. I would say to you that in terms of what we’re seeing, just on pure volume, if you look at cases which we don’t specifically disclose the rate of decline in cases is about what it’s been the last quarter or so. It certainly didn’t pick up in July but I can tell you that it’s gotten a whole lot worse in terms of volume. But we are fighting the deflation more so now than we were in the fourth quarter, so in terms of top line there is more pressure there. Ken?
Kenneth F. Spitler: Yes, that’s about right. We’re seeing that things are, I guess calming down a bit. Probably as best as I can say it a little more optimistic at this point than I have been in the last few months.
Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley:  And maybe just to dovetail onto that, how do you think about the sustainability of the controlling the operating expenses throughout the year? Obviously halfway through the year you’ve still got an opportunity, but the second half you’ll start lapping some of the controls you’ve put in for 2009.
Kenneth F. Spitler:   Yes, we’ve still got room to keep maintaining that and our business in a lot of ways is a one-to-one ratio based on the cases crossing the docks. You know there reaches a point where that doesn’t become practical, but we haven’t reached that yet.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Simeon Gutman - Canaccord Adams.
Simeon Gutman - Canaccord Adams: Sales in the quarter were down about 6.5% and gross profit dollars were down a little bit worse, north of 7. And I think that spread was consistent with the third quarter. Can you just talk about what’s happening there? Is it just the less inflation and are there some mixed changes that are exacerbating it?
William J. DeLaney III: Well actually we’re kind of pleased with how we’re hanging in there on the gross profit, to be honest with you, Simeon. You don’t see all of this, but in the broad line business we’re pretty much holding our own on the margins. Some of the specialty companies, you know, SYGMA, you know had a nice year and a nice quarter so their margins are off a little bit but their profits are up substantially. So all in all I think we’re holding margins pretty well. The customer mix with the change growing somewhat faster than the street does put some pressure on the margin as well as you point out, but, Ken, do you want to add anything to that?
Kenneth F. Spitler: Yes. We are pretty happy with holding onto the margins as we have. You know some of this is also, there’s some pretty large deflationary in some areas that are affecting those margins also.
Simeon Gutman - Canaccord Adams:  And I guess related to that, you know we talked about last quarter the idea of being or getting more aggressive on pricing, maybe to accelerate market share gain. And I think you expressed, you know, not going to do that, that’s not really the philosophy of the business. And I was curious if there ever comes a point where that does make sense, if real growth just stays negative for an extended period of time? And then secondarily are you seeing any of your competitors starting to do that?
Kenneth F. Spitler:   Yes, we are. There is a lot of competitive pressure out there based on price, and we’d be willing to do that if it worked. Unfortunately, lowering your price doesn’t always equal a gain in market share. Now we have, that’s not to say that we haven’t taken a competitive posture. We have. We really have taken a posture that we will not lose any business based on the competitive pressures from price. But again, that’s not our offensive posture because producing the lowest price doesn’t guarantee market share. At some point would we ever let loose on all the cannons? It’d have to get pretty tough for us to do that.
William J. DeLaney III: Again, Simeon, I think the key to look at this in terms of how our folks run their businesses out there is at the customer level. So to Ken’s point, it’s very, very competitive out there right now, as much as it’s ever been. And certainly where there’s risk of losing significant business or deteriorating a relationship we’re going to make sure that we’re as competitive as anyone out there. With that said, you know, what we’ve tried to say over the last couple of years is just to take a broad brush approach to reducing price. You know as the industry leader we don’t think that’s particularly good for us or for the industry.
Simeon Gutman - Canaccord Adams:  And then lastly, you know, on that topic of expenses in terms of maybe having some more room to cut if need be, just kind of flip that around for a second. You know if demand does start to pick up here, you know, have you had any thoughts and I guess maybe it is on the pace of a pickup, you know, how quickly in this environment then you would sort of, you know, rehire and reflex the model upwards? I’m just curious on how kind of the leverage will work on the other side. You know is there a bigger opportunity now maybe to hire at a faster rate and take more share given the unprecedented decline in demand? Or is it sort of the normal curve out of this cycle?
Kenneth F. Spitler: Well, I’m not sure what you’re asking there, but I’ll answer it as best I can. I think that hiring right now is, we are making an effort to maintain our marketing associate positioning so that we are positioned to take advantage of any economic upturn. What we’d need to do would be to hire operational employees which are predominantly warehouse and transportation people. We’re finding that relatively easy to do today, so we could ramp up very fast. And of course we still have plenty of capacity in our ability with the marketing associates to take on more sales. So you know one of the things that we’ve done in this economic downturn is continue to be prepared for the eventual turnaround. And we’re ready for that to happen right now, by the way.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research Company.
Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research Company:  I know you guys aren’t giving guidance and I don’t expect that, but I’m just curious what broader financial targets you guys are holding yourselves accountable to, either over the medium term or over the long term.
William J. DeLaney III: Well, Jay, it’s Bill. As you said we’re not giving long term guidance at this point in time, and I still think that that’s probably an appropriate stance to take. We’ve got a lot of things that we’re working on here right now, so obviously in the short term as we said, you know, we’re out there staying close to our customers, sweating it out and trying to perform as best we can and make sure our customers are well positioned to A, survive and B, grow from there. As Ken alluded to his comments this ERP project is a more medium term oriented opportunity for us and we’re going to talk to you a lot more about that toward the tail end of the calendar year when we’ve had a chance to go through the design phase and share our thoughts with our board and all that type of thing. So you know I think I’d like to defer any longer term projections or guidance until A, we see a little more stability in the economy and B, and we’ve had a chance to continue to develop our thoughts.  But in the short term, you know, we’re looking at this year. By the way, just as an administrative point, this is a 53 week year for us. But if you look at it 52 to 52 I’m talking about 2010. We have a very modest plan for growth this year and it’s going to have to be somewhat back end loaded. We’re going to have to see some improvement in the economy and to Ken’s point in terms of our tack that we’re taking on headcount, we’re going to continue to examine all the work that we do, all the activities that we perform and adjust headcount accordingly as we go through this and manage our expenses. With that said, on the sales and marketing side we’re going to be a little bit more focused on maintaining and potentially growing those numbers as well. Because you do require some lead time there. So we’re hoping to put up some [high] stroke numbers for the new year, but again it’s going to be somewhat of a function of how the economy performs. But we’ll continue to manage expenses well.
Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research Company:  Do you have any specific initiatives and/or targets within your sales and marketing initiatives that are different this year versus last year to try to drive those cases?
Kenneth F. Spitler: Yes. We have our own stimulus package working right now, and it’s directed at moving really commodity type cases across our dock. So, you know in an effort to help our customers and an effort to help ourselves.
Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research Company:  The economy aside and any variations there, what do you think changes the most in the next 12 months particularly within the controllables of your business?
Kenneth F. Spitler: Could you say that again?
Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research Company:  Take the economy variations aside, you know, what do you think could change the most within the next 12 months within the core part of your business, especially on the controllables?
Kenneth F. Spitler: What could change?
William J. DeLaney III: I don’t think a lot, Jay. That’s a huge caveat. I think really the economy, and specifically what its impact is on the consumer and their confidence level and willingness to spend. Our belief continues to be, you know, like it’s been for years and even though we’re seeing some slowing and growth rates within our industry which you know are well documented. We’ve certainly talked about, you know, going out to eat is still a fairly low price ticket or low cost item for most American families. So while we’re certainly participating in this situation right now, we do think that as the economy improves and as people get more comfortable with that they’ve got a job and they’re going to, you know, not have their pay cut too much next year, you know, going back out to eat. And the margin is a lot less expensive than buying a car, buying a house, or those types of things. That is a meaningful swing factor for us as we go through the year. And to Ken’s earlier point, if we get just a little bit of a pick up we’re very well positioned right now to leverage that.
Kenneth F. Spitler:
 : Jay, he one thing that we don’t want to see escalate is [audio impairment] the fuel price. It has a bad effect on our customers and a bad effect on us. So we’d love to see the fuel, diesel, gasoline prices down a bit more and stabilize there.
Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research Company:  Right before I sign off, any update on the CFO search?
William J. DeLaney III: Yes, we’re searching. Jay, we’re obviously taking it very serious and we’re fortunate to have some strong people we’re looking at both internally and externally. And I expect it would take several months and we’re still in the midst of it, but we’ll hopefully have an announcement for you in the next couple of months.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital:   You were talking just now about fuel costs. Can you comment at all about what happened with fuel expense this quarter? The actual expense on the income statement versus the prior year?
William J. DeLaney III: Yes we can, and I’m going to start with round numbers and we can go from there, Meredith. We’ll have all that for you in the K but the fuel expense actually was down, you know, for the quarter as we projected it would be. But then we didn’t have the fuel surcharges last year that we had so if you were to net the two together, you know, the net fuel impact probably hurt us a little bit, maybe by about $0.01. But in terms of pure expense it was down.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital:  And then maybe you could just talk a little bit about CapEx. It was pretty low this year, certainly lower than you had anticipated. Could you just talk a little bit about how you invested it this year? And is there any chance of getting buckets for next year? Did you say it’s about 50-50 for maintenance type items and then other stuff? Is that the right way to think of the coming year?
Kenneth F. Spitler: Yes. You know this year and next year look about the same. We continue to purchase and take old trucks out of our fleet and bringing on new trucks. So that’s just, we have guidelines there, certain years and certain amount of mileages when we move those trucks on. So every year those kind of costs are about the same. And every year you want to continue to do that or there’s a bubble year that’s bad for you. So that expense remains the same. Usually when you see these fluctuations, it’s in the timing of how we’ve spent money in terms of new facilities or in construction, meaningful construction on existing facilities. So sometimes those dollars run from one year to the next. So the big fluctuation between what we spent this year, which was down mostly because we did not, almost all of it was in a building that we were going to build and then we did not like the location and the cost of getting the ground ready. So we stopped that and moved the location which, for your information, was Philadelphia and it was going to cost us too much to get the land ready so we moved it. So that fluctuation that you see this year and caused a great deal of the cost to go down.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital:  What about the RDCs? What’s the plan for that?
Kenneth F. Spitler: Well we’re looking. Of course the RDCs as we’ve said many times depend on you know a certain amount of cases going across that. And right now the lower case movement does not dictate for us to go forward with the one in the Midwest. However, we’ll be taking a close look at that in September. That’s our decision month for that. If we see some positive signs in the economy, the design is ready, then we go out to bid the contract. We’re still prepared to do that, but again we need positive cases to make that work the way we want it.
William J. DeLaney III:   [Inaudible] Meredith and we’re tap dancing here a little bit with you. I know the last couple of years we haven’t spent what we thought, and Ken took you through examples of why that happens. We’re more optimistic I guess, if that’s the right word, that we will spend the $600 million this year because I’m not going to get into buckets with you today, but a meaningful piece of that number would be on the technology side. It’s just we’re kind of in an awkward situation now where we’re still going through the design phase and obviously there’s an internal approval process. So I do think as we get deeper into the year we might be able to give you a little bit more color commentary on the components of the CapEx.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital:  And then my final question, with the bad debt number that you mentioned clearly there are closures of restaurants. Do you have any insight into whether there is a reduction in the capacity on the distribution side? Are the distributors, smaller distributors going out of business at a faster pace than in the past?
Kenneth F. Spitler: No we haven’t seen that. Really we’re pretty up to speed on all of those closures and there’s only been a couple. I can’t say what this year will bring, but certainly as in the past that has not occurred.
Operator:  Your next question comes from John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs.
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs:  It sounds like you do think when we round the horn on the consumer hitting the wall that we’ll see some type of growth in real volume cases, probably as we get towards year end. Is that fair?
William J. DeLaney III: Well we’re certainly hopeful, John. I mean we’ve crafted this presentation today in a very balanced way so, you know we’ve got some tough comparisons here in the fourth quarter that we just completed and the first. We need a little bit of a pick up to see that, but certainly our plan is predicated on the conditions improving as we get toward the calendar year.
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs:  Because this is uncharted territory for everybody, what happens if you get, if you cycle those kind of mid single digit declines in cases, I don’t think you’re going to decline additionally off that but let’s say, you know, volumes are instead kind of flat and they end up being flat for a little while. What do you do if anything? And is there, I guess there’s room on the cost side to cut a little more if you had to to offset that. Is that fair?
Kenneth F. Spitler: That’s fair. That’s about right.
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs:  How do you sort of? I mean it’s got to be very difficult to put a budget together in this environment because its’ not clear whether there’s going to be 2% growth or 4 or 0, right, when you cycle October and November of this year.
William J. DeLaney III: Yes. No, it’s difficult. The good news, John, is we have a lot of practice at putting together aggressive budgets and then, you know, managing if things don’t go quite as well as what we would like. So this year was different. We took a more deliberate approach. We got more people involved, not just at the [outco] but even here in terms of, you know, [sani] checks and running different scenarios. And so you’re always balancing in terms of the internal part of this wanting to maximize what you can do with the reality that, you know, you don’t control all of the factors either. So the spirit of our budget is we’re going to go out and try to make a number. And we’ve got to get a little bit of growth and a little bit of help to do that.  As we said a couple of times now, if we get just a little bit of case growth as the year goes along we’re well positioned. There’s some of these unusual items that we speak to, it might be a good time for me to just remind you where we are in some of that. So you know you want to make sure you understand. Obviously we have that table we put in each earnings period just to kind of identify the items that we think are somewhat volatile and in the short term items that we don’t really control or have the ability to impact that much. So the Cole clearly hurt us this year. If the markets were to be flat even that would help us next year. With that said, pension probably will be up about $40 million and we’ll have a more fine tuned number for you as we draft the K. Stock comp could be up a little bit, $5 to $10 million you know because we’ve got a restricted stock plan that’s going in. That type of thing.  The multi-employer number, you know if we don’t have any more situations like we’ve had the last couple of years that could help us by about $10 million or so. So that and the Cole are hard to predict. We’ve got some headwinds on pension, in particular. Fuel should help us, in particular the second half of the year, a couple pennies, maybe three. The net in the first half shouldn’t be that significant. So that’s a long way of saying, John, you know bad debt we think will be tough again this year. I don’t know that it’ll be any worse but, you know we took a big hit this year. And the long way of saying that a lot of that stuff for now in terms of the plan, you know we documented it. We’re going to kind of presume that it roughly offsets, and we’ve got to go out and grow some cases this year goes along.
Kenneth F. Spitler: Well, keep in mind too, John, that we produced a weekly P&L through last year and to plan. So I mean we run our business very tightly and we run it on a weekly basis. Whenever we see trends that are favorable or unfavorable, we’re on a week-to-week basis to be able to react to it.
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs:  Your CapEx number does not include any acquisitions I assume.
Kenneth F. Spitler: No.
William J. DeLaney III: Correct.
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs:  I mean there’s no bucket in there for, just kind of the place holders, so that would be incremental.
Kenneth F. Spitler: Yes.
William J. DeLaney III: Right.
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs:  What’s the thought on use of free cash now? Because it looks like, you know, build cash on the balance sheet, use it for acquisitions, you know and maybe get ready to pay down some debt down the road. But what’s the thought process on using the cash that you have?
William J. DeLaney III: Well I think admittedly, you know, over the last eight to ten months we’ve certainly wanted to make sure that we had enough cash and more than ample access to debt, if conditions continued to deteriorate or some contingency manifest itself that we needed to deal with. So we’ve been I guess erring if you will on the side of conservatism here. And we feel like that certainly has been the right approach. So at this point we’re hoping to continue to see some opportunities in acquisitions. We’re not seeing a lot as we speak, but we’re certainly being as proactive as we can there. Like we said earlier, the CapEx budget I think will probably approach the $600 million, maybe a little bit more this year.  And then you’ve seen us pull back on the share repurchase program. I don’t think you’ll see us be real active there in the next couple of quarters anyway, John, you know until we see how things kind of settle out in the economy. And then obviously later in the year we’ll be talking with our board about the dividend.
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs:  Do you think we finally get the IRS thing settled this fiscal year or no?
William J. DeLaney III: We’re working really hard at it and we’re having some productive discussions. And I’ll tell you, John, as soon as we know, we’ll be happy to tell you about it. I feel better about the progress than I did a year ago.
Operator:  Your next question comes from [Alvin] for Greg Badishkanian – Citigroup.
[Alvin] for Greg Badishkanian – Citigroup: Just a question on market share. Do you think you’re gaining share on a unit basis or is it sort of hard to [inaudible]?
William J. DeLaney III: Are we gaining share? Is that the question, Al? 
[Alvin] for Greg Badishkanian – Citigroup: That’s right. 
William J. DeLaney III: Yes. I think maybe the honest answer is any time in the short term it’s hard to tell. We certainly think we’re holding our own out there. It’s a slippery slope right now. There’s some business out there that isn’t necessarily great business. It brings with it higher risk and our folks are pretty good at sorting through that. So we certainly feel we’re holding our own and we’ll probably be better able to tell you more about that as the year goes along and we see some more updated industry numbers. But I think the industry conditions right now are a little bit tougher than what some of the early projections were, you know, coming out of Technomic and people like that.
[Alvin] for Greg Badishkanian – Citigroup: And then just a follow up on the competitive environment, you know, has it become more promotional this quarter versus last quarter? And also have there been any changes in July?
William J. DeLaney III:
 : Yes. We are increasing our promotional. We have our own stimulus package going on for our operating companies that’s a little bit different than July.
[Alvin] for Greg Badishkanian – Citigroup: And then assuming there’s no change in the cost of commodities, would you expect the inflation trends you saw this quarter to continue [inaudible]?
William J. DeLaney III:
 : The what trends?
[Alvin] for Greg Badishkanian – Citigroup: Inflation.
William J. DeLaney III:
 : Inflation? Yes, that’s a harder call. Like I said in my comments, you know we’re seeing some modest deflation right now, in particular in the dairy category. I mean it’s down almost 20% from what we’re looking at right now. So we would, we think that will subside to some extent and that would help us a little bit. But I’d say for now we expect to see some pricing pressure.
Kenneth F. Spitler: That’s what we’re hearing from the industry.
Operator:  Your next question comes from John Ivankoe - J.P. Morgan.
John Ivankoe - J.P. Morgan:  If you could comment with what you’re seeing in terms of rate of openings and rate of closures in the industry, you know if the current quarter is static relative to what it was in the last quarter? I mean where they’re actually seeing an acceleration in closures? Whatever you’re seeing on the local level.
Kenneth F. Spitler: Yes, that’s really pretty difficult to answer. You know I wouldn’t say that we are having some restaurant openings that we haven’t seen in probably the past three months, but really that’s incidental. I would say that I feel better about the industry than I did three months ago and that we’re seeing positive signs. And I want to qualify that by saying maybe I’m just looking for positive signs, but I am feeling much better about that, the industry as a whole.
William J. DeLaney III: I think that, just to add on that, I mean we’ve said this before and I don’t mean to be trite but you know we are somewhat encouraged right now that more and more people are encouraged. And you know a lot of this is somewhat psychological in terms of the consumer as well as the restaurateurs and the feedback we’re getting is people are increasingly optimistic generally. At the same time some of the restaurateurs are still struggling with volume and that type of thing. So anything we would give you on openings and closings, I think would be somewhat anecdotal right now. But the underlying sentiment seems to be a little bit more favorable right now.
John Ivankoe - J.P. Morgan:  And maybe it’s an observation but it’s also a question. I think the questions people have been asking on this call has been related to restaurant trends even over the last six weeks. Because so much of what we’ve been hearing coming out of the casual dining companies, the quick service companies is actually a pretty marked slowdown from May to June and July. But broadly across your businesses I mean is that something you’re just not seeing? Because I mean a lot of us are trying to struggle in terms of if its happening in the chains, why that wouldn’t be happening with independents?
William J. DeLaney III: No, I mean we’re seeing it. I think what we’re saying is I don’t know that our filtering process is that good from one month to the next. And we’ve been seeing quite a bit of it since March, April and May. And I think all we’re saying is June and July we certainly didn’t see a rebound, but I can’t sit here and tell you that the falloff was any worse in July than it was in June, if you look at cases. The challenge is the pricing. And the other thing obviously to keep in mind here, John, is our business mix which is about 63, 65% restaurants. And a good portion of it is healthcare and colleges and universities. So maybe that’s buffering it for us a little bit right now.
John Ivankoe - J.P. Morgan:  And finally, and I’m sorry if this point just got over me, what stimulus package that you have for your operating companies? I mean, can you go with me? What exactly is that?
Kenneth F. Spitler: It’s just something that we named that and we named it The Stimulus Package. It’s just promotion. We’re just promoting some products on a regular basis throughout the [Opco’s] driving it from here.
William J. DeLaney III: We didn’t get any TARP money or anything.
John Ivankoe - J.P. Morgan:  You’re offering products at lower prices than what you normally would is your [inaudible].
Kenneth F. Spitler: Yes. That’s the size of it. I don’t mean to give you the impression that it’s a really big deal. It’s just something a little different. We just are trying to stimulate some sales growth and took off on our President.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Robert Cummins - Shields & Company.
Robert Cummins - Shields & Company:  It seems to me that undoubtedly you’re doing a lot better currently despite the difficult conditions than most of your smaller competitors around the country. And you mentioned very briefly a little while ago acquisitions. I’d like to just follow up on that and see if you’re taking a more proactive view toward buying people up in this environment? Or are you leery about doing that for fear of problems you might find? What’s your general approach there at a time when it would seem there must be a lot of distribution businesses for sale?
William J. DeLaney III: Morning, Bob. Proactive is the right word and certainly we are being proactive. It’s a mixed bag right now. We get a lot of calls and we work through all of them. And we’re calling people where it makes sense and that type of thing. The reality is, at least from my take, is we’re not seeing I guess what I would call realistic expectations as much as what we might like to see. And generally, you know, there’s two types of sellers. One is a seller that if they get the right price and they run a really good business, then they’re open to selling. The other is the type that has some catalyst that’s bringing them to the table, either a family situation or a capital structure situation, that type of thing. So where the folks have capital structure issues, there’s a little more interest there and part of our challenge there is to get to them before they do go out of business. And the other folks where they’re running good businesses, this probably isn’t the best environment to be selling a business. So it’s somewhat of a mixed bag, but I can assure you we’re being very proactive. Ken?
Kenneth F. Spitler: Bob, we’ll continue to run our traps. There’s just not much in them.
Robert Cummins - Shields & Company:  Just a quick follow up. Was there any contribution from acquisitions, either in your quarter or fiscal year numbers?
Kenneth F. Spitler: Small.
William J. DeLaney III: . Yes, a little bit for the quarter. The 0.06% on the sales line. It was negligible for the year.
Operator:  That concludes the question-and-answer session for today. I’d like to thank everyone for joining us. You may now disconnect.

Operator:  Good morning, everyone. I would like to welcome everyone to today’s Sysco Corporation Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2009 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder today’s call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Neil Russell, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Neil Russell: Thank you, Patrick, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us for Sysco’s Third Quarter 2009 Conference Call. On today’s call you will hear from Bill DeLaney our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and Ken Spitler our Vice Chairman, President, and Chief Operating. Before we begin, please not that statements made in the course of this presentation that state the Company’s or managements intentions, beliefs, expectations, or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results could differ in a material manner. Additional information concerning factor’s that could cause actual results to differ in a material manner from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the Company’s SEC filings including, but not limited to, risk factors contained in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 28, 2008 and in the Company’s press release issued earlier this morning.  Please understand that all comparisons given during the call refer to changes between the third quarter of fiscal 2009 and the third quarter of fiscal 2008 unless otherwise noted. Also, all comments about earnings per share refer to diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. With that out of the way, I will turn it over to our Chief Executive Officer Bill DeLaney.
Bill DeLaney: Thank you, Neil. This morning Sysco reported third quarter operating income of $405 million. Year-to-date operating income was $1.3 billion, a 1% increase compared to last year.  Sales for the quarter were down 4.5% and our flat for the year-to-date period. Diluted earnings per share were $0.38 for the third quarter and $1.24 for the year-to-date period, a 1.6% decrease for the first three quarters of our fiscal year.  These results reflect the ability of our operating companies to produce quality earnings in the midst of severe market conditions. While creating operating leverage in a declining sales environment is becoming more challenging, we remain steadfast in providing value to our customers and relentlessly managing our cost structure throughout the Sysco organization. During today’s call Ken and I will provide additional details of our third quarter and year-to-date results and update you on our plans for the business. For now I will turn it over to Ken for a discussion of our operational results. 
Ken Spitler: Okay, thanks Bill. Overall I am pleased with our ability to continue to support our customers and control expenses in what continues to be a difficult business environment. Providing excellent customer service and giving our associates the tools they need to perform the job remains priority #1 for Sysco. By focusing on the broad line business we continue to distance ourselves from the competition and expand our market leadership position. Also, the SYGMA segment continues to improve performance as evidenced by increased sales and operating income.  Without question, the key to our success in this environment is continuing to improve operational efficiency, and I am pleased with how our operations have responded. For example, for our Broadline companies during the first nine months of 2009 compared to the same period last year, our diesel gallon usage was down 7.5% compared to a mileage decrease of 5.7%; Kilowatt hours were down 8%; cases per trip were up 2%, cases per man hour have improved 5%; and sales per employee have increased 6%. Inflation as measured by our product cost increases was 3.3% during the third quarter. Inflation for the year-to-date period was 6.2%.  We experienced a steady decline of inflation through out the quarter in various categories. We are experiencing further moderation of inflation in the current quarter as input costs continue to decrease. Historically inflation of 2% to 3% has proven to be a manageable level for both Sysco and our customers. During the quarter we entered into additional forward purchase agreements for diesel. Currently we have contracts in place for approximately 70% of planned consumption through the fourth quarter and approximately 40% of planned consumption for the next 39 weeks of next year. We continually manage enterprise wide headcount in a manner consistent with the sales environment. At the end of the third quarter our head count was approximately 47,000, down 6% year-over-year. We remain persistent in finding ways to increase productivity through out our business and expect these improvements to extend beyond the current environment. As the macro environment improves we expect to be well positioned for the long-term as a result of these changes. We have progressed further in the design phase of our enterprise resource planning or ERP project and expect to be in a position to share costs and benefit estimates by the end of the calendar year. This technology enhancement is the enabler for the future refinement of our core business model. Our focus is to implement an integrated software system that will enhance our productivity and make it easier for customers to do business with Sysco. We have begun to experience a moderate increase in acquisition related discussions in recent weeks. We are hopeful that this trend will result in more tangible opportunities in the future. With that said, we recently completed the purchase of Palace Foods, the leading food service distributor in Ireland with approximately $200 million in annual sale. With Palace we believe we have partnered with a great Sysco type company, one known for its outstanding customer service and consistent financial performance which will extend our experience in the international marketplace. In closing, I would like to take this opportunity to thank our associates for their ongoing commitment to support our customers and improve productivity in all aspects of our business. With that I will turn it over to Bill for a discussion of our financial results.
Bill DeLaney: Thank you, Ken. There are a few additional items I would like to address regarding our third quarter and fiscal year-to-date results. As previously mentioned, sales of $28 billion for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2009 were essentially flat compared to the prior year. Looking forward we believe we will continue to experience a difficult economic environment for the remainder of fiscal 2009 and therefore expect our recent sales trends will not improve during the fourth quarter. This will likely place corresponding pressure on operating earnings during the fourth quarter of ’09. Earnings per share of $1.24 for the first nine months decreased 1.6% compared to the same period last year. Excluding the $0.11 per share negative impact of COLI in the first nine months of fiscal 2009 and the $0.02 per share negative impact of COLI in the first nine months of fiscal 2008 diluted EPS increased 5% for the first nine months of fiscal 2009 as compared to the prior year period. We believe this comparison, which removes the impact of unrealized losses resulting from financial market volatility better reflects our operating performance. Similar to previous quarters our effective tax rate during the third quarter was unusually high at 40.6%, approximately 1 ½ to 2 percentage points higher than our typical run rate. The $8.7 million COLI loss for the quarter, which is not deductible for income tax purposes, contributed to this higher tax rate. For the third quarter operating expenses were $85 million lower than the previous year. The decrease in operating expenses was driven by lower payroll expense of $90 million which was a result of decreased headcount and reduced incentive compensation. This reduction in operating expenses was partially offset by increased bad debt expense of $20 million for the third quarter. We remain committed to effectively managing our credit exposure as evidenced by the fact that our accounts receivable days outstanding are comparable to that of the prior year. Nevertheless, our customers are not immune to today’s cash flow pressures, as we have experienced a $36 million increase in bad debt expense to $62 million for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2009. While significantly higher than our experience in normal times, this represents just 0.22% of year-to-date sales. We expect a trend of increased year-over-year bad debt expense to continue in the fourth quarter. Year-to-date cash flow from operations of $985 million remains strong through the third quarter, essentially flat with the prior year. Given both the challenges and opportunities inherent in the current market, we continually review our capital allocation priorities. As such, we have completed our stock repurchase program for this fiscal year and we will develop next year’s program in the coming months. We also have further reduced our CapEx spending plan for fiscal 2009 from approximately $600 million to about $525 million. During the quarter we further enhanced our liquidity by issuing $500 million of unsecured notes. The bond offering was successfully executed with attractive pricing that demonstrated the investment community’s continued confidence in our financial structure. This transaction also allowed us to secure funds at historically low long-term interest rates. In summary, we are encouraged by our overall operating performance thus far this year. Although our industry continues to experience dynamic changes, we remain focused both on contributing to the ongoing success of our customers and achieving Sysco’s long-term financial objectives.  With that operator, we will now take questions. 
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Simi Bhaumik with Cannacord Adams. 
Simi Bhaumik - Cannacord Adams: My question is on the demand environment. It looks like the real growth is somewhat stable or is that too early to call given that you’re going into some important months coming up ahead?
Bill DeLaney: Well Simi, we chose our words carefully in this news release. Obviously we saw a bigger decline here in the third quarter than what we have seen in the later part of the second quarter and it is unclear at this point. We are certainly encouraged by some of what we’re reading, some of what we’re hearing, where people seem more optimistic, but at this point I can’t really tell you that we’ve necessarily hit a bottom. 
Simi Bhaumik - Cannacord Adams: Got it and then the distribution of your sales the other business I realize is not big, but that business seems to be more sensitive to the economy, is that fair? Is that because of the nature of what it sells?
Ken Spitler: Are you referring to SYGMA or are you referring to the specialty companies?
Simi Bhaumik - Cannacord Adams: I guess the specialty, the produce, and the meat?
Ken Spitler: Yes they are particularly sensitive to the economy particularly like [Geth] Supply deals mostly with the hotel business which is significantly off. Of course what drives our meat companies is the high-end steak which we’re seeing a decline there that is greater than the market in general.
Simi Bhaumik - Cannacord Adams: Okay and a question on the expense side and I think you also alluded to this in the comments with expense dollar growth down almost 7% or so in the quarter. It does sound like you are starting to get up to sort of a feeling in terms of how much costs can be taken out absent sort of the variable changes in the business?
Ken Spitler: I am not sure what you are asking.
Simi Bhaumik - Cannacord Adams: Well I mean how much more can the cost structure be lowered without sort of, I am talking more on the fixed side, if you take the variable stuff out of the equation. Meaning, how much more flex can you go if the top line environment weakens by another couple hundred basis points?
Ken Spitler: Fortunately we are in the business that our expenses predominately are in personnel, driven pretty much by a case of productivity around moving that case in and out. So, we’ve still got room to go, but to your point we’re not significantly there yet, but there is a point where that becomes a problem.
Bill DeLaney: I think, Simi, one of the things we tried to bring out in the comments this morning is we remain very, very focused on managing our expenses and our headcount and all of that type of thing. With that said, when you get into a declining sales environment creating operating leverage does become more challenging. To Ken’s point, there is some room there, but it is getting more difficult.
Simi Bhaumik - Cannacord Adams: Then lastly along those lines about the environment, the acquisition criteria doesn’t change, but do size differences become, more manageable meaning deals that are on the smaller side that may not necessarily move the dial, but there are very contiguous distribution centers where you can leverage off the expense base a bit. Does that become more in play?
Ken Spitler: Yes. I think I understand your question. We typically don’t announce those, but in our world they are called fold-ins and the smaller distribution centers may be general broadliners, may be specific paper or something like that. Yes we are seeing a little more activity around that.
Simi Bhaumik - Cannacord Adams: And, do you think potential deals are more tilted in that regard or it is hard to say?
Ken Spitler: It is hard to say right now. 
Bill DeLaney: I think right now what we’re seeing is more on the smaller side, but again over time that could change. 
Simi Bhaumik - Cannacord Adams: I got it, thanks.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Meredith Adler with Barclays Capital.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital:  I would like to start with a number you gave us last quarter and I’m not sure if you gave it this quarter, which is what happened to case volume?
Bill DeLaney: I don’t recall giving a case volume number last quarter.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: I thought you said it was down 4%?
Bill DeLaney: No. I am not sure. I know our sales were down about 1%, I think, last quarter Meredith. We go through our inflation methodology with you, so we had I don’t remember the exact numbers right now. I don’t have them in front of me, but we don’t disclose case line actually.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital:  Oh, okay, because I am just trying to distinguish between trading down which is going to be visible in sales, as well as actual declines in volume, but we can move on that is not really a big deal.  I was wondering about, you obviously have bad debt. Do you feel like there is some kind of a noticeable change in the number of restaurants that are out there and then the same question for distributors? I did hear from somebody about a couple of slightly larger distributors who went out of business recently, one in San Fran and one on the East Coast, but I was just wondering what you guys are seeing.
Bill DeLaney: What we are seeing in terms of the number of restaurants or the number of distributors?
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: Both.
Ken Spitler: Distributors are a significant pick up and the number that have gone out as of recent times and we anticipate that continue.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: Okay. I had also heard that there was some fragmentation of purchases that restaurants were chasing deals and were willing to sort of go anywhere to get those deals. Are you seeing anything like that?
Ken Spitler:  I think that is anecdotal information. We’re not feeling it, if you’re asking that question. Typically when people are kind of scrambling that kind of anecdotal information flows up, but I am sure there are folks out there doing that, but they’ve always been doing it. 
Bill DeLaney: I think on the restaurant side, Meredith, we’ve talked for awhile now that most people that follow this industry feel that there is a fair amount of over capacity in the industry and we are seeing that in certainly closures. I don’t know exactly that we have a number here for you, but we don’t necessarily see that as a bad thing. In other words, I don’t see that as an additional problem to what’s going on in the market, it is more or less the market adjusting to the volume that is out there today. As that connects with bad debt expense, some of issues with bad debt expense are with people that are going out of business, some aren’t. It just depends. So it is not a total correlation there as far as the bad debt and the restaurant closings go. A lot of these folks are going through some type of restructuring. 
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: Got it and then my final question is about your own capacity. You have pretty efficient distribution centers, but if you got to the point where you couldn’t cut costs more, would it ever make sense to close any facilities?
Ken Spitler:  At this point we just recently closed one in Jamestown, New York, but it was more of really just geographically not suitable. We could look at that, but we are a long ways from looking at that.
Bill DeLaney: We have very few facilities that don’t provide a very good return on investments. I think you would see us continue to do what we’re doing, which is to manage our headcount and manage our productivity as best we can. Those facilities are geographically for the most part, I am talking about our Broadline business, but for the most part those facilities are in markets that we need to be in to service customers.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Jason Whitmer with Cleveland Research Company. 
Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research Company : Bill, you have had a few months maybe to take a step back and think about the business from a different perspective. I am curious, after you have talked to more of your employees, more of your customers, more suppliers, what some of your primary take away been, and maybe what some of the top focal points you see as you look out into fiscal 2010?
Bill DeLaney:  I am doing my Ronal Reagen impersonation here, Jason! No, I would say it is similar to what you and I have talked about in the past, that even though we’ve got a transition going on here in terms of my role, the biggest thing we’re really dealing with in the Company is more of the market and what’s happened here in the last six to nine months. So, from that perspective, I don’t think a whole lot has changed. Our primary focus continues to be staying as close as we an to our customers and working with those folks to, if not grow their business, at least help them stay competitive in their respective marketplaces, and along the way to do the things we were talking about already this morning, which is to manage our costs.  That is a long way of saying that we are committed to slugging it out here in the near term and then over time, as Ken alluded to in his comments, there are some things we are working on, our technology side, to help us in other areas to improve our productivity and take some of the complexity out of this business. So, we are in the early stages of design there. That is a potentially big opportunity for us and we will talk to you more about that as time goes along. Thirdly, as things hopefully stabilize here at some point over the next year or so, we are going to continue to look for opportunities to grow this business whether it be primarily, hopefully, through acquisitions. Initially, in our core business we really do believe just like there is pressure on the restaurant side that on the competitors side that there will and should be more opportunities. We’re having discussions and that has picked up a little bit, as we mentioned in the comments this morning. It hasn’t picked up dramatically. Quite honestly, a lot of our conversations don’t always lead to a result, because not every transaction is one that we can get done. Longer term we would hope to be able to grow through acquisitions and identify additional markets. 
Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research Company : I am curious if there has been any change in the impact of your business reviews plus or minus, or if they are just more of the same, or anything else you can add to that platform. Or, just your general sales and marketing initiatives in general to help try to drive more volume even though the market remains depressed.
Ken Spitler: The business is always evolving and improving, at least we hope so. We have concentrated more on the menu itself, on the profitability of the menu. When customers are struggling a bit that becomes increasingly more important, so our focus is and continues to be on the profitability of that individual units menu.
Bill DeLaney: The other thing we have been pretty consistent in explaining to people is on these business reviews. When you get into an environment like we’re in today it just reemphasizes, or doubly emphasizes the importance of continuing to develop those relationships with the customers that we do have, so certainly lost business. When we talk about lost business that is basically when you lose an account that a year ago you were selling, the business reviews are very, very impactful there and we continue to see very little lost business on the accounts that we review in an effective manner.
Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research Company : Any quick examples of how when you talk about technology transformation initiatives you have on the plate, how that will make it easier for your customers? Is there any sort of user interface that they can be approached with, or better transparency on thing? Are there any one or two items that you think can really stand out as opportunities to really penetrate your customers?
Bill DeLaney: Just generally the user interface both for our sales people as well as for the customers order direct at would be a significant one. Then hopefully over time providing better tools for the customers as well to help them manage their business, manage their purchasing, that type of thing. 
Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research Company : Great, thank you very much.
 :
Operator:  Your next question comes from John Heinbockel with Goldman Sachs. 
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs : So Bill it sounds like you have not yet seen, what you can say is, a bottoming in volumes or tonnage? We may not have hit the bottom yet, or can you just not tell yet. 
Bill DeLaney: I think what we are saying is, is that we are not ready to make that call yet at this point. I think we need to see a little bit more here over the next two or three months and hear a little more about what’s going on in some of the other parts of the economy. So, I guess at some point we’ll be able to look back and say when we saw it, but right now looking forward it’s not clear.
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs : If you look at the restaurant business it looked like January and February were clearly better than December and then March slipped a little bit from January to February. Did you see something similar or you are behaving a little bit differently than that?
Bill DeLaney: I guess we are different. We didn’t see that at all. We saw January, February, March all being off. 
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs :  On a unit basis?
Bill DeLaney: Yes.
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs : Do you think you are gaining share, maybe on a unit basis in this environment, or is it hard to tell?
Bill DeLaney: I think it is hard to tell, probably, at this point. The numbers are not that accurate in the shorter term. Historically certainly we feel we gained share. I am hesitating a little bit on the answer, because I don’t even know that that’s the most critical thing right now. The market is down. We are off a little bit. One of the things we have to do, and it kind of comes back to Meredith’s question, is you have to be a little careful you don’t gain too much share in this type of environment, because there is business out there that is potentially not the best from a credit standpoint. Our folks are doing a good job out there balancing going after new business as well as making sure that we don’t take on undue risk.
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs : Some of the cost cutting that you guys have done, has that contributed to any weakness in sales, or were you pretty careful to avoid that the last couple of months?
Ken Spitler: John, we are very careful with that. I can say, in fact, that that is not the case.
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs : All right and it looks like we probably will go to some level of deflation at least temporarily. Will that have a positive impact on units and menu prices, or probably not?
Bill DeLaney: First of all, we are not clear that we will go to deflation. We are seeing it in the diary category right now. We’re seeing kind of break even pricing in a lot of categories, but canned, dried, frozen are still up and you probably have a better handle on that John. But, clearly some of these manufacturers are not passing along the decreases for their own reasons. So, it is not clear, but what is clear is we are seeing moderating inflation.  To the second part of your question, I don’t see deflation as a good thing. What we would continue to tell you is that a relatively low-level inflation at 2% to 3% has served us well over the years and generally is pretty good for our customers. 
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs :  Inflation dropped off in this quarter. We didn’t see an improvement in unit volume. We eventually should see that. Is that going to be driven more by, I guess it will be more by the economy and less by disinflation?
Bill DeLaney: Yes, I think that is fair, John. These are not the normal times that we would go back and look at trends off of deflation and inflation and I think whether it is economy or peoples perception of their future income stream, I think that probably is going to drive it more than anything else. 
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs : All right, then finally if you look at gross margin going forward how do you think about passing along price decreases to your customers? And, what is going to be the primary driver going forward of gross? Is it getting customer mix or the level of inflation?
Ken Spitler: Normal price declines we pass through. If you are talking about margins as a way of gaining business, then frankly we haven’t found that to be as powerful a tool as you might think.
Bill DeLaney: It is a pretty slippery slope, John, as you well know. What we really try to do is to work with our customers where we can identify, let’s say, some share savings opportunities, then we will work with them there. But, across the board price reductions where we don’t have cost savings to go with it has never been a good thing for Sysco and we don’t think it’s a good thing for the industry.
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs : Okay, thanks. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from Gregory Badishkanian from Citigroup.
Gregory Badishkanian - Citigroup :   You made an initial comment that you haven’t seen an improvement in sale really and you could see some pressure on operating profits in the fourth quarter. So I am just wondering if it is going to be the same kind of pressure that we saw in the third quarter, or is it going to be a little bit less, or maybe a little bit more as we go forward?
Bill DeLaney: All of the above, but really Greg, we don’t know. What we are trying to tell you there is we are early in the quarter. We haven’t seen the bottom as we said. At least we can’t tell you that we’ve seen the bottom and we’re just trying to acknowledge that when you get into this level of sales decline; were it to get a little worse, it is more challenging to create any operating leverage. So, we have got still two months to go in this quarter. Even if we were to give guidance, which we don’t, it would be pretty difficult to predict.
Gregory Badishkanian - Citigroup :  That is helpful and it is good to see that you are not chasing around accounts that might be distressed.
Bill DeLaney: We just try to make good business decisions.
Gregory Badishkanian - Citigroup : Absolutely and obviously bad debt expense has risen third quarter. Would you expect that to kind of stabilize over the next few quarters, or does it just get worse as the environment and the cash cushion that a lot of these restaurants, the small independent owners have dwindled, to see more and more bankruptcies? How do you see that playing out?
Bill DeLaney: I am going to default to my lagging indicator assessment here that we have been using for several quarters. I think the bad debt phenomenon could be with us for a good while.
Gregory Badishkanian - Citigroup : Yes, okay great. Thank you very much.
Operator:  Your next question comes from John Ivankoe with J.P. Morgan.
John Ivankoe - J.P. Morgan : I was wondering if you could shed some light on your gross margin in the third quarter. It looks like it’s been lower than it has been for some time. Was there anything unusual there that I should focus on, whether it is your customers demanding lower prices, what have you? Was there some one-time type of things? Just continuing on with that, do you think it goes back to the 80.9 type of level 81 flat type of level where it has been over the last looks like 8 or 10 quarters?
Bill DeLaney: Just looking at the quarter you are right, we are off a little bit in margin. We have had a fuel surcharge employed out there that is indexed now for our street customers and so we fell below the index early in the quarter. We didn’t have that in the margin this quarter, so that was certainly part of it. Clearly, in an environment like this you are competing very hard on the price line every day, so there is always good price pressure. I would say the fuel surcharge would be the only tangible thing I can think of.
John Ivankoe - J.P. Morgan : Is that worth 10, 20, 30 basis points?
Bill DeLaney: We will give you come disclosure, I think, in the Q, when we file that here in a day or two, that will quantify that to some extent. I don’t have that with me right this morning, but I don’t believe it is 20 basis points, no.
John Ivankoe - J.P. Morgan : In terms of the total number of restaurants that are out there, are you seeing an increase in the number of closures? Are you seeing stability in the number of closures? In other words, were you seeing an accelerated rate of closures over the last six months or were you at a steady state level in terms of what you see in the broad industry?
Bill DeLaney: We don’t have great data on that. I would say that we’re seeing a slowly increasing level of closures. But, again, as I said earlier, and I am not trying to minimize it, that is not necessarily a bad thing for the industry. There are too many restaurants out there and so we try to partner up with the folks that are committed to the industry and so the fact that some people are falling by the wayside is unfortunate, but it is not a bad thing for the industry.
John Ivankoe - J.P. Morgan : Understood and agreed. Thanks, that is it for me. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from Andy Wolf with BB & T Capital Markets. 
Andy Wolf - BB & T Capital Markets : In regards to Broadline, can you discuss a little bit of the slowing in the sale by mix, differentiating between independents and the other half of the business which is small chains and institutional? I guess what I am getting at are the independents, did the independents sales slow much faster than the rest of the Broadline business?
Bill DeLaney: We don’t really give a lot of detail on that, Andy, but I think just generally we would acknowledge that you can tell from the disclosures we do in terms of the MH sure sales that the street sales are off a little bit more than the program sales.  
Andy Wolf - BB & T Capital Markets : Fair enough. So, at least for us outside the Company we could look to that statistic as, I guess, a coincidence indicator?
Bill DeLaney: It is a good proxy.
Andy Wolf - BB & T Capital Markets : Okay and on the gross margin, I know you have a lot of your fuel, at least at this quarter, hedged at higher costs and the surcharge came off. Is that sort of what we’re talking about? So, if that weren’t the case, you know the gross margin would have been improved by what’s not in the adverse hedge?
Bill DeLaney: No, let me be clear. What I was trying to say is in answer to why the margins were off somewhat for the quarter, I would say the one tangible thing we can look at is the fuel surcharge. There will be some additional disclosure on that in the Q. That is part of it, but that is not all of it. I would attribute a lot of the rest of it just to competitive pressures. 
Andy Wolf - BB & T Capital Markets : Okay, I’m sorry; I sort of misspoke a little. It would have been improved by some amount and we will read about it in your Q, if you were just flat and not hedged.
Bill DeLaney: Correct.
Andy Wolf - BB & T Capital Markets :
 : Lastly, on the bad debt accrual, was there an event or two in there that really you had to catch up on with some bankruptcies? I hear it is going to be at a higher level than you have ever seen, but was there something you had to catch up in there? Or, big events that you just think are going to continue? Or, is it just generally looking across the business and getting more conservative about where things are going?
Ken Spitler: It is across the business, Andy. 
Andy Wolf - BB & T Capital Markets :
 : Okay that’s it for me. Thank you. 
Operator:  Your next question is a follow up question from Meredith Adler from Barclays Capital.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: On the gross margin would inflation of deflation in some categories, like dairy, have an impact on the gross margin?
Ken Spitler: Yes they would.
Bill DeLaney: They would in different ways to be honest with you. Meredith, we are in kind of this awkward period where we’ve got insulation in some categories and deflation in some others, so it is hard to isolate all of that for you. Generally inflation there is pressure on your downward gross margin percentages, whereas in deflation the percentages conceivably can go up a little bit. But, with that said the pressure on deflation is on your cost side, because your operating costs aren’t necessarily going down.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: Okay and then a follow up to Andy’s question. I believe you put the fuel surcharge in gross margin, but the fuel expense goes in SG&A or do I have that wrong?
Bill DeLaney: No, you have that exactly right. The surcharge is in margin and the expenses in delivery expense were in SG&A, as you call it.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: Then could you comment on, I know you have hedged your fuel, but just some idea for the fuel that you’re buying spot. I am trying to get a sense of what the environment looks like now. Are prices down year-over-year?
Ken Spitler: Oh yes, significantly. 
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: And we will see that for a few months?
Ken Spitler: Yes.
Bill DeLaney: We haven’t seen a major increase in our net expense because even though we are hedged out there on a good part of our volume at higher rates, the spot prices are down considerably from last year.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: My final question is about the money that you raised the $500million. Have you said anything about what you’re going to do with the proceeds? I am having trouble figuring out what you need the money for.
Bill DeLaney: I think our thoughts there were, as we said in the comments that generally you want to borrow money when you can borrow money. From a liquidity standpoint certainly we are in pretty unusual times here from a business standpoint, so we just thought it was a good time to go out and create some liquidity. Certainly the interest rates by any historical standard were very attractive as well.  With that said, I would think you would expect us over time to spend the money as we always do: invest in our business, hopefully we will have some acquisitions, and that type of thing. 
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: Great, thank you very much.
Operator:  There are no further questions in the queue. That concludes today’s question and answer session and it also concludes today’s conference. We thank everyone for their participation.

Executives: Neal Russell – Vice President, Investor Relations Richard Schnieders – Chief Executive Officer  Kenneth F. Spitler – President and Chief Operating Officer William J. DeLaney –Chief Financial Officer Larry G. Pulliam – Executive Vice President, Global Sourcing & Supply Chain
Analysts: Meredith Adler – Barclays Capital Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs Greg Badishkanian – Citigroup John Ivankoe – JP Morgan Alec Patterson – RCM Capital Management
Operator: Welcome to today’s Sysco Corporation’s second quarter fiscal year 2009 earnings conference call. As a reminder, today’s call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions I’d like to turn the call over to Mr. Neal Russell, Vice President Investor Relations. 
Neal Russell: Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us for Sysco’s second quarter 2009 conference call. On today’s call you will hear from Rich Schnieders, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ken Spitler, our President and Chief Operating Officer and Bill DeLaney, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  Before we begin please note that statements made in the course of this presentation that state the company’s or management’s intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Actual results could differ in a material manner. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ in a material manner from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company’s SEC filings including, but not limited to, risk factors contained in the company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 28, 2008 and in the company’s press release issued earlier this morning.  Please understand that all comparisons given during the call refer to changes between the second quarter of fiscal 2009 and the second quarter of fiscal 2008 unless otherwise noted. Also, all comments about earnings per share refer to diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted.  Also you will notice a slight format change in the financial presentation portion of our press release issued earlier this morning. Although there are no substantial changes to the information displayed, we believe the format more closely aligns with our quarterly SEC filings and makes it easier to identify the relevant financial information. With that out of the way, I’ll turn it over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Richard Schnieders.
Richard Schnieders: Let me comment on my retirement first of all and as disclosed on the announcement of January 20, I will retire in June from Sysco, stepping down as CEO at the end of March. Ken Spitler has been named Vice Chairman and Bill DeLaney will become CEO on March 31. Beth and I look forward to this next phase of our lives, and particularly working on issues related to childhood hunger. I remain steadfast in support of Sysco and there is a great team in place. The Board is confident that Ken and Bill together will lead effectively and continue the tremendous record of success that Sysco has enjoyed over the years. Now on to the financial highlights for the second quarter and the first six months of fiscal 2009. This morning Sysco reported second quarter sales of $9.1 billion, a 1% decrease compared to last year. And for the first six months of fiscal 2009 sales grew 2% to $19.0 billion. For the second quarter operating income was $422.0 million and operating income increased 2.5% to $927.0 million for the first half. And diluted earnings per share were $0.40 for the second quarter and $0.86 for the first six months of the year. We are very pleased with the performance of the broad-line companies in a difficult environment and we remain confident about Sysco’s long-term position in this industry. Ken and Bill will provide additional details of our second quarter and first half of 2009 results and I will be back to facilitate our Q&A session.
Kenneth F. Spitler: Overall, despite the difficult business environment, I am pleased with our ability to continue to support our customers while controlling expenses. For the second quarter operating income was $422.0 million and for the first six months of 2009 operating income was $927.0 million. Our 2% sales growth for the first half of 2009 was leveraged by 0.5% to 2.5% operating income growth.  Excluding the $54.0 million impact of COLI our 2% sales growth for the first half of 2009 was leveraged by 7 points to 9% operating income growth. Bill will provide more details on the overall financial performance and the implications of COLI in a few minutes. Without question, the key to our success in this environment is to continue to improve operational efficiency and I am pleased with how our operations have responded thus far. Examples, our diesel gallon usage for the second quarter was down 7.3% compared to a mileage decrease of 6.2%.  For the first half of 2009, as compared to the first half of 2008, kilowatt hours are down nearly 11%. Cases per trip are up 1.6%, cases per man hour have improved 5.6% in the broad-line warehouses and sales per employee have increased 6.1%. In addition, sales per employee have increased approximately 20% compared to the end of 2005. Inflation, as measured by our product cost increases, for the second quarter was 7%. Although still relatively high, this represents a sequential decrease of 1.3% from the first quarter. We experienced this trend throughout the quarter and the decline in inflation has continued thus far in January. We expect to see inflation moderate over the long term as input costs continue to decrease. Clearly, the economic environment presents challenging circumstances for our customers. As such, we expect to experience a further decline in sales over the balance of the physical year.  We continue to manage headcount in a manner consistent with the sales environment throughout the entire organization and at the end of the second quarter we have approximately 48,000 associates, down approximately 4%, or over 2,000 associates across the organization year-over-year. We must continue to find ways to strengthen our core business and further enhance our supply chain capabilities.  Although I am pleased with our performance to date, we remain committed to continue improving as a company by looking for ways to gain additional efficiencies in this competitive business. As a result, we have begun to design an enterprise-wide platform to implement an integrated software system that will provide our operations with the necessary tools to make it easier for our customers to do business with us and to further enhance our productivity. We expect to complete the design process by the end of this calendar year and for the entire project to take place over the course of several years. I am confident that this is an appropriate time to evaluate our technology platform and improve the efficiencies of our system. I would like to thank our associates for their diligent work to support our customers and improve productivity in all aspects of our business. And with that, I will turn it over to Bill for discussion of our financial results for the quarter.
William J. DeLaney: There are a few items I would like to address regarding our second quarter and fiscal year-to-date results. As Rick mentioned, our operating income was $422.0 million for the quarter and $927.0 million for the first half of the year. Excluding the $31.0 million impact of COLI in the second quarter and $54.0 million impact of COLI for the first half of fiscal 2009, our operating income was $453.0 million for the quarter and $981.0 million for the first half. This resulted in an operating leverage of 7 points for the first half of fiscal 2009.  Diluted EPS for the first half of fiscal 2009 remained flat at $0.86. Excluding the $0.09 per share impact of COLI, diluted EPS increased 12% in the first half of fiscal 2009 over the first half of fiscal 2008. We believe this comparison, without the impact of unrealized losses resulting from high volatility experienced in the financial markets during the last several months better reflects the operating performance of the company. Similar to the first quarter, COLI had the impact of increasing our effective tax rate, which during the second quarter was unusually high, at 40.4%, approximately 1.5% to 2% higher than our recent run rate. As reflected in our cash flow statement, our provision for losses and receivables for the first two fiscal quarters increased $15.0 million year-over-year. W have consistently communicated that credit tends to be a lagging economic indicator for Sysco and we certainly are not immune to the challenges our customers are facing in this business environment. However, as has always been the case at Sysco, we continue to have stringent credit policies limiting our exposure. This requires an important balance with supporting our customers, something we remain focused on. Capital expenditures for the first half of fiscal 2009 were $180.0 million. In consideration of the current business environment we have Re-evaluated our capital expenditures and are lowering our projected full year capex from approximately $700.0 million to about $600.0 million and will continue to review our spending priorities. Before I close I would like to add my comments on the succession plan as well. First, allow me to thank both Rick and Ken for the tremendous support they have shown me over the 20 years I have spent at Sysco. I am grateful for their support and excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. I realize some of you may have questions about the CFO’s succession so let me just say that it is one of my top priorities and work has already begun to identify the best candidate for that position. Once we have identified the appropriate person we will inform you accordingly. In closing, as Rick said in his quote this morning, these are difficult times, times that require us to focus in all aspects of our business. It will require us to do things differently than we have in the past, to execute better, and at times to makes difficult decisions. That said, we have a very strong balance sheet and cash flow. We are one of only 40 U.S. companies with a corporate issuer rating of double-A minus or better. We have a foundation of strength from which to build upon and we look forward to taking full advantage of the opportunities that present themselves to Sysco. Before we go to the Q&A let me turn it back over to Rick.
Richard Schnieders: Thank everyone on the call for joining us today and for your support of Sysco over the years. This is my last earnings call and let me tell you, it has been a privilege to speak with you about this great company. I look forward to continuing to being an ambassador of Sysco in the future. We will now take questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Meredith Adler – Barclays Capital.
Meredith Adler – Barclays Capital: You mentioned a little bit about credit but I would like to talk about it a little bit more and I know that when you gave guidance on the sales in the middle of December you did talk about some customers who were going out of business. Could you talk a little bit more about what kind of closures you are seeing and how you think that will play out for the remainder of your fiscal year?
Kenneth F. Spitler: We have had more closures than what we have traditionally have been seeing. What I can you is the restaurant industry is predicting a closure rate in the mid-teens. We are not seeing that quite yet but we are seeing more than normal.
Richard Schnieders: The mid-teens being 15,000 to 17,000 restaurants. Again, that’s a prediction. So it’s anybody’s guess at this point but it is challenging out there.
Meredith Adler – Barclays Capital: And do you think that your independent customers are better positioned or worse positioned within that?
Richard Schnieders: Better positioned than our competitors’ independents or better positioned than the chains?
Meredith Adler – Barclays Capital: Than the chains.
Richard Schnieders: I think it’s probably about equal. I think, depending on the operators, it’s going to be a challenging environment. Those that are strong and have a good business model, whether they’re independents or chains, will get through this tough period and be better as we come out the other end.
William J. DeLaney: I don’t want to minimize the credit issue, but in the context of closures, not every restaurant that closes is a credit problem. Sometimes people are just taking a hard look at the economy and making a business decision. So we are clearly working through more situations than we have in the past but it’s not quite as bad as the closure number.
Meredith Adler – Barclays Capital: And I noticed a very big decline in accounts payable. Is that a typo?
William J. DeLaney: No, it’s right. I guess on the positive side I think as business declines the way it did throughout the quarter and even more so in December, we’re pleased with the way we were able to manage the DSO and the inventory and receivables. On payables, a couple of things going on. Obviously as your business falls off, payables is more tied to recent purchases and that caught up on us. The holidays fell a little different, and quite frankly, we have got some work to do there in terms of tightening up some things on the payables side. So it’s a combination of things but it’s not a typo. It’s an opportunity.
Meredith Adler – Barclays Capital: Because your inventory did not go down anywhere near as much. In fact, inventory was up.
William J. DeLaney: It didn’t go down but when you look at the DSO, when business falls off like this it’s very difficult to manage your inventory. To have relatively flat DSO, I think is pretty good when business is falling off.
Meredith Adler – Barclays Capital: This new technology, maybe you could explain how does it change your interaction with customers and does it actually allow you to manage those relationships with fewer people? Does it replace some of the customer-facing folks? What’s the benefit in doing this?
Kenneth F. Spitler: It’s an ERP system, first of all. And the answer to that question is we certainly wouldn’t be doing this if we didn’t expect a huge benefit to the organization in terms of really two things. One is expense reduction, more shared services on the revenue side enable us to approach our customer base perhaps with a different facing.
William J. DeLaney: If I could just add, this is something we didn’t just roll out of bed in December and say sales were off, we need to do something different. We have been looking at our business pretty hard in the context of the plateauing of growth in the industry. The growth has plateaued for the last four to five years so I would say over the last year and a half we have done a very exhaustive internal assessment of how we can, as Ken says, take some of the complexity out of this business for our customers that would presumably lead to a better opportunity for growth. But also we are constantly asked about how can we continue to show areas of improvement and productivity and we think this is something that could facilitate that. So we are talking about it here today because we have begun some internal, what is called blueprinting or assessment work, we’ve got people working on it. We have purchased some software. With that said, we are in the very early stages and it’s going to be one of those situations where, we will keep everyone up to date as we get through it, but as Ken pointed out, it’s going to be several months before we’re really through the blueprinting phase to get into a real granular discussion on cost and benefits and all those types of things.
Operator: Your next question comes from Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets.
Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets: Rick, we will miss you and congratulations on your strategies for really being forthright is seeing the slowdown in restaurants coming and positioning the company to perform as well as it is against such a headwind. If things got worse during the quarter and you put out a release to that effect, and the government numbers that I track suggest that as well, as you were doing minus 8 for the whole quarter, how much worse is December versus the quarter number and how is the business looking in January?
Richard Schnieders: That minus 8 number, you’ve taken the inflation out?
Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets: I’m just calling that real. It may not be a pure volume number but it’s a proxy. You can use any number you want but I’m really trying to get to where is the trend today versus December, which was certainly worse than the quarter.
William J. DeLaney: To your question, we saw some very modest growth in the first part of the quarter and then it started to flatten out and then it did go negative on us in late November and December. So I am going to use nominal just because that’s what we report. And there is a little bit of a play going on between the way we calculate real and pieces but your point is fair, so I would say it fell off more so in December and it has continued to fall off a little further in January and hence Ken’s comments that we would expect to see sales for the last six months to be down year-over-year.
Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets: So a little worse in January but maybe not as steep a continuing decline. In terms of the rate of decline you think December was the worst?
William J. DeLaney: It’s fallen off some. It’s not a dramatic fall off in January. And really, we want to be a little careful here and try not to go into too many of these types of sayings or Sysco clichés, but this particular quarter, January is a relatively small percentage of the total sales, as is February, and March is disproportionately high compared to other quarters.  So we are continuing to see softness, it’s a little bit worse than what you saw for the quarter but March is really going to be the key when we look at our numbers for the quarter.
Richard Schnieders: And if you will permit us just a little bit of whining here, the weather, too, this year, late December and in January, and there’s no way to quantify this, but the weather has been worse than it’s been in the last several years and it’s certainly been broader. If you look at those winter storm systems that have gone across the Midwest all the way into the Northeast, it has been really brutal. And it continues on to a certain extent. So the weather itself has certainly been a contributor here in January.
Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets: On the 4% reduction so far in the headcount, versus let’s call it an 8% real, big volume decline, how much of that is variable and it’s just going to down in terms of maybe you need less sales people, less warehouse people, less drivers, and is just going to vary with the sales increase or decrease? And how much of that is more on the overhead side so that we can try to model the variable contribution rates or get a little more precise on that?
Richard Schnieders: I don’t know if we have a number in terms of the percentage of that that’s variable, but there is certainly a fairly large percentage. You can kind of do the math. By far most of the folks are out in the operating companies and most of the folks that are associates that are out there are associated with the movement of cases. So drivers and warehouse folks, it’s a variable expense directly related to the piece count. 
Kenneth F. Spitler: Typically that’s the way we manage our business all the time and we don’t have big layoffs. By the time we make a decision to have a lay off and get it into place, it sometimes does more damage than it does good. We manage our business like this every month, really to the case count. How many cases are going across that dock is how we run the company every month. So as those cases decline so have our employees. So we haven’t had a call from here to say take your employee count down. Our operating companies do that as routine business.
Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets: So from those two answers I would think it’s more skewed to its variable costs and it can continue to vary either way.
Kenneth F. Spitler: I would say that’s right.
Operator: Your next question comes from John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs.
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: Can you talk about the dynamic, as your input costs come down, as inflation moderates, and your input costs come down, how does that get passed along to your customers and how elastic is demand? Is the price in driving demand, so as inflation comes down, do you think this time around demand will go up or maybe not this time?
Richard Schnieders: We have done a little bit of work on that. Again, I wouldn’t say that it’s real scientific but we have seen some correlation as the prices come down, the real volume picks up. Now we’ve never been in an environment like we’re in today but I think there is some elasticity. It’s almost like the question before, I don’t know what percentage that is, but there is some elasticity in terms of the rate of inflation declining.
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: You get a reduction in your input costs, how quickly are you going to pass that along to your end customer? Obviously the delay would create a gross margin benefit.
Richard Schnieders: Again, these aren’t reductions. We’re talking about a slower rate of increase so on our contract business, generally that gets passed along within 30 days, and on our street business, if we’re managing well, which we have been for the better part of two years here, that can get passed along within a week.
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: You really don’t think there are going to be any actual list price rollbacks?
Richard Schnieders: I don’t think we’re saying that. I think it’s mixed. We’re certainly seeing some pressure in certain intermediate categories and that type of thing. But the other thing we’re seeing is even though we’re hearing this and we’re feeling it, a lot of the manufacturers are not necessarily experiencing it in terms of how they trade with us. So to this point we’re seeing some diminishing rates of inflation, not as much as we have thought a few months ago, but there is deflation in some categories and when that happens we manage that pretty quickly as well. But overall, we’re not seeing deflation at this point.
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: If you take out COLI, so your SG&A was down 1.5% or better, is there a limit as to how well you can do on that, on that front, i.e. if sales were down 3% or 4% in nominal terms, do we hit a point of where you can’t avoid negative leverage? Or do you have a pretty long runway there?
Richard Schnieders: You do. I’m looking at Ken here because operationally really, as he said, is how this happens but just mathematically, and we’ve obviously had this question quite a bit over the last three to six months, is you get to flat sales growth in nominal terms and then to negative sales growth you clearly hit a point where the ability to leverage is very challenging. But deleveraging, we’ll have to see.  Fortunately we haven’t been in this situation before so clearly you do. It comes back to the question of the variable versus the overhead. You do get to a point where it’s more and more difficult to leverage but we’re going to have to continue to assess that and communicate that with you as we see it.
Kenneth F. Spitler: It’s very difficult to stay ahead of when it occurs fairly rapidly.
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: I thought you would do a worse job this quarter because it happened rapidly during the quarter. In theory you should do better going forward because now you are prepared for it, or no?
Kenneth F. Spitler: I would hope so. I think we certainly have a different mindset today than we had a quarter ago.
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: And you’re not seeing, as you cut headcount here, as you measure service levels to your customers, are you seeing any diminution in service?
Kenneth F. Spitler: Definitely not. We wouldn’t do that.
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: There’s not a risk here that cutting back will exacerbate the sales weakness?
Kenneth F. Spitler: No, absolutely not.
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: What’s the update on the IRS tax case?
William J. DeLaney: Not a lot of update. In recent weeks we had a couple of meetings with them in late fall and we have another one scheduled here in the next couple of weeks. We’re having good conversations but it’s still moving relatively slowly.
Operator: Your next question comes from Greg Badishkanian – Citigroup.
Greg Badishkanian – Citigroup: A question on food inflation. Assuming no change in the current cost of commodities, they stay constant at a dollar level where they’re at now, when would you expect inflation to be flat?
Larry G. Pulliam: There are so many different dynamics that affect the class of goods. For example, we have seen incredible increases in steel prices resulting in the tins for canned goods going up. I think by estimate it was over 180% increase in tin prices over the last 18 months. So that is a considerable factor in the inflationary factors for canned goods, which is a very large commodity for us. So it’s very difficult for us to kind of establish what we think is going to happen in the future. I would say the other thing is, and I think Bill and Ken mentioned this, we have lots of different commodities and they fluctuate at different times of the year. Produce right now is high inflationary times, just because of the change of the seasons in the procurement areas. We have other categories that are not so. So very hard to anticipate what it’s going to look like in the future and so our plan is to manage it, manage it best we can in terms of not letting it affect our costs and margins and earnings and our customers.
Greg Badishkanian – Citigroup: And as you look out at your real sales growth or if you want to look at nominal sales growth, how are you comparing relative to the industry right now? Your distribution competitors?
Kenneth F. Spitler: What we’re hearing from the industry is that we’re doing better than our competitors. It’s not factual. Some of the two biggest competitors we have, we don’t have visibility to their numbers. But based on the number of smaller distributors that are now interested in talking to us about folding in, I would say that we’re doing better than the general industry.
Greg Badishkanian – Citigroup: On that point, do you have any interest in making acquisitions at this point?
Kenneth F. Spitler: Yes, we do.
Greg Badishkanian – Citigroup: And also, just in terms of the price increases to your customers, passing on the food inflation, as you look at your smaller customers, street business, you look at your chains, any differences in terms of how they are in turn passing that on to their end user?
William J. DeLaney: I think there is probably a real variation in how that happens. We feel one of our responsibilities is to help our customers to understand what their costs are and what the pricing should be, so the business review process continues to be a very robust part of our go-to-market strategy and we are working daily with customers to help them understand what the appropriate price points should be on their menu. So that’s our responsibility, to help our customers, because we see the marketplace so broadly.
Operator: Your next question comes from John Ivankoe – JP Morgan.
John Ivankoe – JP Morgan: Can you discuss the $100.0 million reduction in capex a bit more specifically for 2009, what that was? Whether that was a deferral of 2009 capex to 2010 or whether 2010 could in fact be the same or even lower than 2009 given current business conditions.
William J. DeLaney: Let me start with 2010. I don’t think we’re in a position today to really talk about 2010. So 2009 is just a couple of things. One is what we said, which is in times like this you go through and you reprioritize everything you’re doing and there is some capex there that was probably a little more subjective, if you will, or elective, and we have just chosen to defer that. In other situations we are a little behind on building in one particular market and then some of the original plan involved some land transactions that to this point haven’t come to fruition. So there’s not one thing, it’s just taking a hard look at the numbers, adjusting for the current environment in terms of piece growth and prioritizing things. But with the work that Ken alluded to in terms of the technology platform, I don’t know that I would say that 2010 would fall off at all.
Kenneth F. Spitler: Typically we’re out ahead on the land and right now land prices are falling pretty good. We actually backed up on a couple of properties that we think we are going to be able to get significantly cheaper.
John Ivankoe – JP Morgan: If you could remind me where you are in your fuel purchases? Any hedges that may be out there relative to market and when the current diesel and fuel price environment may actually turn to be more of a positive for you?
William J. DeLaney: We’re filing our Q tomorrow and it will have very robust disclosure there for you. But essentially we are locked in through August, I think we’ve talked in terms of $134.0 million of fuel, which is about 75% of our usage through the end of the fiscal year in August. So we are locked in there. The other thing I will say is you assume that the spot prices remain relatively where they are today, which is obviously not what we would have thought six months ago, even though that locked in price is higher than last year and higher than current market because of the stock prices falling so much and that other 25% or so that we’re purchasing, that may result in us not really seeing much of an increase at all in fuel expense. So that’s our situation. We do have a forward or a couple of contracts. But overall, if you factor in the fuel surcharge, the fuel wasn’t really a meaningful effect on our results for the first half. And sitting here today, in the current environment, we don’t think it will be in the second half of the year.
Operator: Your next question is a follow-up from Meredith Adler – Barclays Capital.
Meredith Adler – Barclays Capital: You talked about the natural process of reducing the number of people at the operating companies as tonnage goes down. What about the marketing reps? Has there been any efforts to reduce the number of sales people?
Kenneth F. Spitler: It has been in relationship to the rest of the organization. We have reduced some of the numbers of marketing associates to tie in the conjunction with the fall off of sales about like we have in other areas because they are directly related to that sales number.
Meredith Adler – Barclays Capital: There was a one-time cost for exiting a pension plan but also you continue to have to add to your pension. Should we expect that you will continue to have higher pension expense for the remainder of this year?
William J. DeLaney: The one charge that we took this quarter was for a multi-employer plan where we had the opportunity to exit that plan and when you do that you have to true-up your liability exposure. So we did that. It was about a $10.0 million hit.  Coincidentally, if you look at the 26 weeks, we had a similar situation last year. So for 26 weeks, those are pretty much offsetting. Pension expense for this year is essentially locked in and as we have disclosed, we would for the year to be up about $20.0 million in pension expense, but we would also expect our stock comp expense to be lower by approximately about the same amounts. So if you put those two together, it’s really not much of an impact for this fiscal year. Looking forward, as you go into 2010, clearly with what’s been on in the marketplace and both in terms of the equity markets as well as how discount rates will be set and that type of thing, we would be looking at a very significant increase for next year. But that isn’t really valued until the end of this fiscal year and there may be other things that we’re looking at as well. But to be straight in answer to your question, I think like most companies, we would be looking at an increase next year.
Meredith Adler – Barclays Capital: Some percentage of your sales is to what I call institutional feeders, schools, hospitals. Are you seeing any slowdown in sales to those customers because I think people perceive that as being exceptionally stable.
Kenneth F. Spitler: In health care we are not seeing any decline. Depending on where the institutional feeder is, we are seeing some decline, but it’s not substantial. But health care is doing very well.
Operator: Your final question comes from Alec Patterson – RCM Capital Management.
Alec Patterson – RCM Capital Management: On the sales line, there wasn’t any M&A, and was there any foreign exchange impact?
William J. DeLaney: There was no M&A to speak of. Foreign exchange, there was. I don’t have that number right in front of me, but with our Canadian sales it did hurt us somewhat in the quarter. And I would also tell you it has helped us in other quarters, so not overly meaningful but it did hurt us a little bit.
Alec Patterson – RCM Capital Management: That’s around 10% of sales, Canada?
William J. DeLaney: Close enough, yeah.
Alec Patterson – RCM Capital Management: So 10% times the exchange rate, basically?
William J. DeLaney: Yes.
Alec Patterson – RCM Capital Management: The cases per man hour up 5.6% for the first half of the year, do I translate the so-to-speak real sales figure down a percentage as roughly what the case trends, or case changes, were for the quarter? Is that a fair comparable?
Kenneth F. Spitler: It’s fairly close but case count is worse than the sales number.
William J. DeLaney: It’s worse than a nominal sales number. It’s actually a little better than the 8% though, I think. Right?
Kenneth F. Spitler: Yes.
William J. DeLaney: One of the things that happens here is when things are moving around this rapidly, in inflation, sometimes you do get a gap in terms of internal calculations that we use because those are done throughout the quarter and then the pieces can vary a little bit. 
Alec Patterson – RCM Capital Management: On the tax rate, backing out the COLI, I come out with a rough underlying number of 35%, 36%. Is that right?
William J. DeLaney: No. I wish it were. But I would say we would be in a 38% to 39% area without the COLI and a couple of other things. We also had an increase to our reserve in the first quarter for some adjustments we made filing a recent IRS audit. I would say the run rate is in that 38%, 39% area.
Alec Patterson – RCM Capital Management: On the cash flow area, you’re cutting back capex, you’re talking about looking at some potential deals out there, how should we think about share repurchase going forward?
William J. DeLaney: We’ve been very aggressive in recent months and as you will see, or have seen, in the funds flow, we have purchased a lot of shares so far. I would say at this point that I would expect to see that activity scale back over the remainder of this year pretty significantly. I think it’s something we have pretty much bought what we would normally buy for the year. We bought it at pretty attractive levels. And I think in this environment it’s prudent for us to keep our powder dry a little bit for these opportunities should they come along.
Operator: There are no further questions in the queue.
Richard Schnieders: Let me just say again, it’s been a pleasure working with everyone on the phone here today over the years. And I will just reiterate one thing I have said over the years and that this is a great industry and continues to be a great industry. Thank you for your continuing interest in this great company called Sysco. 
Operator: This concludes today’s conference call.

===== 2009 Q1  (2008-11-03 08:30:00) =====
Executives: Neal Russell – Vice President, Investor Relations Richard Schnieders – Chief Executive Officer  Ken Spitler – President and Chief Operating Officer Bill DeLaney – Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Analysts: Greg Badishkanian – Citigroup Jason Whitmer – Cleveland Research  Meredith Adler – Barclays Capital Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets Alec Patterson – RCM Capital Management Bob Cummins – Shields and Co.  Analyst for John Heinbockel – Goldman Sachs 
Operator: Welcome to today’s SYSCO Corporation’s first quarter fiscal year 2009 earnings conference call. As a reminder, today’s call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions I’d like to turn the call over to Mr. Neal Russell, Vice President Investor Relations. Please go ahead Sir. 
Neal Russell: Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us for SYSCO’s first quarter 2009 conference call. On today’s call you will hear from Richard Schnieders, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ken Spitler, our President and Chief Operating Officer and Bill DeLaney, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  Before we begin please note that statements made in the course of this presentation that state the company’s or management’s intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Actual results could differ in a material manner. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ in a material manner from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company’s SEC filings including, but not limited to, risk factors contained in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10K for the year ended June 28, 2008 and in the company’s press release issued earlier this morning.  Please understand that all comparisons given during the call refer to changes between the first quarter of fiscal 2009 and the first quarter of fiscal 2008 unless otherwise noted. Also all comments about earnings per share refer to diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted.  With that out of the way, I’ll turn it over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Richard Schnieders.
Richard Schnieders: Here are the headlines. This morning’s fiscal reported record first quarter operating earnings of $5.5 billion, an increase of over 11% compared to last year. Sales grew more than $400 million to $9.9 billion. We also reported record first quarter diluted earnings per share of $0.46, up 7% year-over-year. I am pleased with these results as SYSCO continues to grow share and increased operating leverage despite a difficult operating environment. Ken and Bill will provide additional details of our first quarter results and I will be back to facilitate our Q&A session.  Ken? 
Ken Spitler:  Thanks Rick. Good morning to all of you. Our operating companies produced exceptional operating leverage in a very soft sales environment. Obviously these are difficult economic times not just for us but for our customers too. Therefore, improving productivity and controlling expenses are very important.  During the first quarter SYSCO’s U.S. broad line companies performed particularly well as evidenced by a 6% year-over-year improvement in cases per man-hour, a 3% increase in cases per trip and an 8% reduction in diesel gallon usage.  Performing quality business reviews with our best customers remains a top priority as it is increasingly important for us to strengthen those relationships by supporting our customer’s efforts to provide value added offerings to their patrons. We continue to improve the quality of these business reviews with the business review process through better preparation, increased focus on the goals of each review and timely and thorough follow-up subsequent to each review.  Also we are encouraged by the progress we see in our supply chain initiative. Productivity has steadily improved in our Front Royal, Virginia RDC and we remain on target for the ramp up timeline for our Alachua, Florida RDC. Our national transportation management system continues to enhance our overall performance as well. Simply stated, we continue to find ways to be more efficient in the near-term which we believe will continue to pay dividends in the long-term.  Inflation, as measured by our product cost increases, for the quarter was an extraordinarily high 8.3%. While we have managed the inflationary environment successfully for several quarters, we are keenly sensitive to the difficulties that this unprecedented period of high food prices present to our customers. We hope to see inflation moderate over the long-term and input costs have recently declined. An example of the outstanding execution required to produce these kinds of results is evident in how well our company responded to four named hurricanes across our system during the quarter including hurricane Ike which impacted us right here in Houston.  Within hours of the eye of the storm passing over the city our Houston operating company, assisted by associates from several other surrounding companies, was delivering to our customers. We are proud to have worked alongside organizations like the Red Cross, FEMA, numerous hospitals, nursing homes, care shelters to assist those in need. SYSCO was not only early to respond to the relief efforts but importantly was first to be back out on the road working with our customers within a day of the storm.  I expect SYSCO to emerge from the business cycle stronger and much more efficient.  With that I’ll turn it over to Bill for a discussion of our financial results for the quarter. 
Bill DeLaney:  Good morning everyone. I am assuringly pleased with the quality of the earnings we reported earlier this morning. As Rick and Ken have previously noted the ongoing economic slow down and turbulent markets in general certainly contributed to our modest sales growth. With that said, our ability to produce 7% diluted earnings per share growth despite an unusually high tax rate and a $30 million unfavorable COLI comparison highlights the quality of the first quarter earnings.  One area that warrants further discussion is the first quarter tax rate which was impacted by two main components. First, the loss of $22.9 million recorded to adjust the carrying value of corporate-owned life insurance to the cash render value is nondeductible for income tax purposes. As a reminder, the COLI value will continue to fluctuate each quarter as the underlying securities are tied to market performance.  Second, the company recorded a tax adjustment for a previously unidentified tax contingency arising from a recent tax audit. I should not that this adjustment is not related to the ongoing appeals process with the IRS regarding our cooperative structure. Notwithstanding the current financial markets, our balance sheet is a tremendous competitive advantage for SYSCO. We continue to manage our assets and capital effectively as evidenced by our trailing 12-month 21% return on total capital and 33% return on equity.  Our A1+ P1 commercial paper rating has proved beneficial to us in the past, present and we expect it to continue to benefit us in the future. Although our borrowing requirements during the first quarter were modest, we believe we will continue to access the capital markets effectively.  In summary, SYSCO can and will continue to reinvest in our business. Our investment priorities in order are capital expenditures, pursuit of acquisitions, growing a dividend commensurate with earnings and repurchasing our common shares.  Before we go to the Q&A let me turn it back over to Rick. 
Richard Schnieders:  As you have heard, we are pleased with our first quarter results. It is a tough environment but the quality of earnings is impressive. Our operating companies have done an outstanding job. Our trucks have more cases on them. We are driving fewer miles per route and our customer service continues to lead the industry. As we speak, 8,000 marketing associates are taking orders up to 5 p.m. today. Those orders will ship tomorrow to more than 400,000 customers with premier service levels.  I want to say again, however, this is a very challenging environment. In the second quarter we continue to see a softening of sales growth. We will continue to focus on supporting our customers while improving productivity and managing expenses. SYSCO is well positioned to weather the storm and well positioned for the long-term.  Operator, we will now take questions. 
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Greg Badishkanian – Citigroup. 
Greg Badishkanian – Citigroup: First, food inflation was around 8.3% in the quarter so that is higher than it has been around the 6% range and I’m just wondering how you think that is going to trend over the next few quarters? When do you think declining commodity costs will start to lead to that inflation moderating? Just because I know you have a lot of contracts I’m wondering about the timing of that. 
Richard Schnieders:  As Ken indicated in his comments, some of our input costs are beginning to decline now. We see some sub categories of product now that certainly the rate of inflation is slowing, a couple of sub categories where we are actually seeing some deflation. At the same time we have some categories that have fairly high inflation. As we suggested, we would hope to see some moderation in the inflation rate here pretty shortly within this quarter or the next one. 
Greg Badishkanian – Citigroup: Also, as you kind of look at your real sales it was down a few points about 3% or so based on my calculations yet you were able to bring down your SG&A and operating expenses as a percentage of sales. I’m just wondering if you could give us some color in terms of the different initiatives and how much of that was due to cutting miles or just different buckets where you have been able to really keep a lid on expenses. 
Richard Schnieders:  We have got fairly high variable costs so we are able to scale the business appropriately both ways. Certainly the initiatives going back, just to point to one and you can’t just point to one but I’ll use it as an example, XY routing Ken mentioned we are driving 8% fewer miles right now than we were a year ago…I’m sorry, gallons. Our miles are down also. It is those kinds of paying attention to literally hundreds of opportunities within those operating companies that are paying results. We feel very good again about the quarter and the operating companies’ ability to manage a rough environment. 
Greg Badishkanian – Citigroup: Just from what we see in the industry looking at the major public companies, etc. it seems like the industry is doing a lot worse than you have. I’m assuming you have picked up some share. Is that what you see based on your data or based on talking to people in the field? What kind of color do you have in terms of market share? 
Richard Schnieders:  That is something we have been very proud of and in fact as we have said on many occasions we tend to do better in tougher times in relation to the rest of the industry because of our financial strength and the overall management of the company. We are pleased, again, with our ability to at the operating company level particularly be able to make it work in a challenging environment. 
Greg Badishkanian – Citigroup: If you are taking a little bit of share are you hearing anything about some of your competitors? I know you have a lot of them across the country but anyone you think over the next few quarters that if this condition continues with the economy could you see some of those major players go out of business or exit the industry? 
Richard Schnieders:  It would be pure speculation. I think the challenges right now are for many competitors who have to go to the bank and borrow money to grow their business to get additional inventory, buy new fleet, buy or expand their warehousing, that is very, very difficult as you know in this environment. That is where, in the mid term, it gets pretty tough for some of our competitors. We’re not wishing any bad luck on anybody. I just think the realities are that again with the financial strength that Bill highlighted in his comments I think go to the bottom line again we are well positioned visa vie all our competitors out there and visa vie the industry. 
Operator:  The next question comes from Jason Whitmer – Cleveland Research.
Jason Whitmer – Cleveland Research : Can you provide a little more color, there seems to be end market, particularly restaurants and traffic flow as well as maybe further closures out there and maybe not just restaurants but also touch on institutional and how that has been trending? 
Ken Spitler:  It is definitely that we are seeing traffic slow down. It is a very tough environment for our customers. We haven’t seen a lot of closures yet. We are really not anticipating…the closer you get to the holidays I think everybody even if you are close with difficulties you are going to try and get through the holidays and those typically are good times for our restaurants. I don’t want to make that sound like there are not problems. They have traffic problems. 
Richard Schnieders:  The second piece of that on the institutional side of the business which would include schools, colleges, hospitals and nursing homes and as you point out 63% of our revenues come from restaurants, the rest come from obviously non-restaurant businesses. That does tend to be a little bit more stable in this environment. So the schools, colleges and healthcare in general that business continues to go along well. In fact our healthcare business today is very robust. 
Jason Whitmer – Cleveland Research : Do you have any thoughts on elasticity with food inflation potentially coming down over the next couple of quarters; do you think that we will revert in some of the case volume deterioration you have seen in some of the last 6-9 months? I can remember at the analyst meeting awhile back you were looking for high single digit long-term sales growth whether food inflation was driving more of that or case line was driving more of that as food inflation was more normalized. Any update on where that could trend on the elasticity if people were to start buying more cases if prices come down? 
Richard Schnieders:  We haven’t done any scientific studies. We have gone back and looked at some historical data which does tend to support that as inflation comes down the case growth will improve. I can’t give you the exact numbers in relationship there but yes, we would anticipate that. That food inflation moderating is going to make it significantly better for our customers out there to manage their business. 
Jason Whitmer – Cleveland Research : Along the process of doing business review and really getting closer to customers in this environment it sounds like you have been doing some deeper customer analytics. What have you really learned there either with your share of the customer or the share of some of the things you don’t have? How do you continue to gain share or extend your share lead in this environment coming out of the environment? What are some of the things you have learned so far in doing some of those deeper dives? 
Richard Schnieders:  One of the things we have learned is that there seems to be no end to the opportunity. First of all the distributor is great relationship building. I think we have said this before but one of the things we found is that our lost sales related to customers that go through a business review go to virtually zero. That is very powerful and we continue to see customers that run to multiple business reviews we continue to see good growth in those customers. So we have lots of opportunity there.  
Ken Spitler:  I think part of that question was what are we learning from it. We continue to be focused on the menu itself and how that drives traffic and profitable traffic through their business which is very important of course to them. We still focus on the menu with our customers and that drives their business. What drives their business drives our business. 
Richard Schnieders:  We found too that during these more difficult times the recent activity of customers and non-customers alike to business reviews has been very high. We don’t have any lack of customers coming into the operating companies for business review. 
Operator:  The next question comes from Meredith Adler – Barclays Capital. 
Meredith Adler – Barclays Capital: I’d like to just go back to the question about inflation. We have definitely seen a decline in some commodities, especially for the grain, but I’ve heard from some sources that meat prices and all proteins are likely to go up. I think that is the [SEA] forecast as well. Is that something that you have factored into your thinking? Are you seeing any of that? 
Richard Schnieders:  As usual, if you kind of look at the averages it is a bit deceiving. What we find today are the middle meats, those meats that are used to cut steaks. So the strip loins, rib eyes and tenderloins are actually fairly significant lower than they were a year ago. On the other hand you’ve got the end cuts, the chucks and rounds that are higher. Part of the reason for that is a lot of that gets ground into hamburger and the demand for hamburger right now and ground beef is fairly high. It is obviously a lower cost item on the menu. That is where it becomes tricky talking about inflation in general or inflation in a category. In this case you have to look deeper than the category. You have to look at the sub-category. All of that kind of depends. I think it is safe to say because of demand we won’t see upward pressure on the middle meats, the steak cuts, for awhile unless we have a foreign country that jumps in and buys a bunch of boneless rib eyes and boneless rib steaks. That could change that. There are just so many moving parts to the question and the answer. 
Meredith Adler – Barclays Capital: Even with supply being down, which it has come down especially for beef? 
Richard Schnieders:  I still think you see middle meats not having a lot of upward pressure for awhile; those steak cuts. Probably, and again I don’t know what will happen to hamburger, chucks and rounds. 
Meredith Adler – Barclays Capital: Another question would be you are taking share. I was wondering though if you are gaining new customers. How does the profitability of a new customer compare with wooing sales with an existing customer which obviously you are doing some of that too because of business reviews. Maybe you can give us a sense of how the real growth you got this quarter balanced between new and existing customers and then what the profit difference is. 
Ken Spitler:  Of course the most profitable thing we can do is to increase business in an already profitable customer. That is the best thing that happens. In terms of new customers, what we watch very carefully is the ratio of new customers to lost customers to customer penetration which is growing the business in the customer base. You need a balance of that to continue to be profitable in the distribution business so you have got to keep having new customers on board. We are actually seeing a higher rate than normal coming on but commercially we are also seeing there is a bit of moderation in the penetration so as yet that hasn’t been big enough to affect our profitability but it is something we watch every week. 
Meredith Adler – Barclays Capital: Fuel costs and fuel surcharges. I think there was a time when it was really only the contracted business that had fuel surcharges but in this recent environment fuel surcharges became more common for all kinds of restaurants. Is that still the case? How did that compare to your cost? Are they successful at covering most of your fuel costs? 
Ken Spitler:  It moderates I think currently and it changes of course with how you are hedged, but currently moderated about 70% of that cost. Right now we do have a fuel surcharge on everyone. The difference between a blanket charge or per delivery charge on the non-contracted business and then generally speaking it is a sliding scale for the contracted customers. It is still markedly over last year, of course down sequentially from last month. It is one of those things that is very sensitive so we are constantly looking to see if there should be one and what it should be. There is a lot of factors of course in that. What everybody looks at is the price at the pump and sometimes that doesn’t have any direct relationship to what we are doing. 
Bill DeLaney:  We are filing our Q tomorrow and there will be a little bit more detail. What we are projecting right now for the first six months, obviously we have got four months behind us and three that we have reported. We would expect, and this factors in the forwards we have in place as well as today’s price at the pump, we would expect our fuel cost gross to be up $40-50 million for the first six months and we would expect to recover the bulk of that through fuel surcharges assuming no changes in spot prices and assuming no changes in fuel surcharges. Going forward for the rest of the year we are about 2/3 of our volume is locked in on forwards and about 1/3 of it we will be buying spot. So we are, as Ken alluded to, locked into some higher prices right now on the buy because of the forwards and we will continue to evaluate the fuel surcharges as well. 
Meredith Adler – Barclays Capital: There is not much chance you will see the fuel surcharges be a profit to you right now? 
Ken Spitler:  We have no design to make a profit on fuel surcharges. As you have heard we are not covering those costs. 
Bill DeLaney:  We are just trying to cover the incremental year-over-year costs. 
Operator:  The next question comes from Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets. 
Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets: Let me start with the fuel surcharge and a follow-up. Just doing some quick calculating, tell me if I am way off, it looks like the fuel surcharge this year is about 25 [bips] roughly run rate per quarter and what I’m trying to get to and I’ll just ask it directly is with the gross margin has been reported the 6 [bips] of expansion if not for the fuel surcharge, or would it have been flattish or slightly down? 
Richard Schnieders:  It would have been down a little bit. I’m not too good at [bips] but again what you will see in the Q tomorrow is $28 million roughly increase in gross fuel expense and about a $23 million increase in fuel surcharges. 
Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets: The other similar type of question for granularity is Ken reported the 6% increase in cases per man-hour. Can you give a little commentary on that? What kind of class of employees are in the denominator? Is it just warehouse workers or is it workers, all the employees at an operating company? 
Ken Spitler:  We measure it all the ways but what I was referring to there typically when we talk about productivity we talk about how we get a case out of the warehouse and transport it to a customer. So it would be the people that are directly involved in that which would be occupancy, transportation and warehouse. Is that clear?
Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets: So is that systems driven or are you actually using robotics or substituting capital for labor? How is that productivity increase being driven? 
Ken Spitler:  It actually has been several initiatives we have had out. One we have talked about many times, going from double jacks to triple jacks which simply means that when we pass through the warehouse we have three pallet positions on a piece of equipment where we had two. That allows us less travel time. When you are talking about warehouse productivity there are several things you are looking at. The big thing is and a big area we have been watching is just the travel time. So if you can cut a trip through the warehouse to select orders, cut several minutes off of that and start multiplying those minutes times thousands times hundreds of thousands times millions it starts to really make a big difference. Of course, when you reduce the number miles that you drive you have got more time at the customer’s back door; your productivity goes up there also. So this is all operationally driven if that is the question. 
Richard Schnieders:  It is not a new computer system. It is really a new process so they are systems but they are human systems. They are new processes within the warehouse and transportation. 
Ken Spitler:  Part of it goes back to 5-6 years ago we started redesigning our warehouses strictly to be more productive. It has everything to do with how many times you let product down for the percent to the order selector and the distance they travel, how many stops that driver has, it is strictly operational. 
Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets: I know this is ongoing and one of the great attributes of the company is new things keep getting developed. Just in terms of the double to triple jacks and it sounds like maybe you are changing how you pick to be more efficient, in terms of the whole U.S. system or include Canada, whatever, where are you at in that so we can get a sense of there are three more quarters of productivity here or are we at the end or barely scratched the surface? On the things you just identified in particular. 
Ken Spitler:  I think we are beyond barely scratching the surface here but we certainly…you don’t just go out and change out all your equipment overnight from doubles to triples because that is a fairly significant capital expenditure so we have been doing it over time. I don’t have a number but I would argue if I said 50% in the warehouse we are probably comfortable saying that but that is a very guess at that point. 
Richard Schnieders:  I think what isn’t a guess but is somewhat open ended is that we have years left for productivity improvements we can make. Some of that will require systems changes. Some of that will require process changes. We still recognize lots of opportunities that we will get to over a period of time and do that appropriately and within the culture of SYSCO. 
Ken Spitler:  We live this way and we have people dedicated just to finding new and better ways of doing things. We are currently looking for some big bang stuff. Some things we can do that are industry changing. I don’t have that in my pocket by the way but we are looking and as an industry leader we think we have the ability to do it. 
Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets: Rick, on this theme of driving down your cost structure, a few years ago you laid this out as pretty much your top priority as you saw the way the industry might go with family formations, the end of the big spike in dual income households and so on. So I guess my question is it seems to be working quite well frankly on reducing your cost structure through some of the things we have been discussing but if I recall there was an idea you might use price as a lever to gain market share. Perhaps you are doing that. Could you just speak to that and whether you think…are you doing it somewhat and do you think the environment for that type of an approach where you actually could see if you led with price more so than SYSCO has in the past then you could get some of the customers you have been wanting to get for awhile. 
Richard Schnieders:  I think the answer is that it is more surgical than broad based. I think we still stand by that. In fact we are working hard on pricing and understanding the elasticity where it is related to a customer or related to a product. We have some opportunities there but we still have some learning to do. Your initial thought though is right. Our biggest opportunity is still in terms of cost control. We have been very pleased with our ability and again I’ll take my hat off to the operating companies, our ability to manage those gross margins. But we have also said in the past there is a lot of stickiness in this business. You can’t just go out and wholesale reduce a bunch of prices and expect to gain five points of market share. It is, as I said before, very surgical. So we have to be careful and we have to be smart about it. It is not going to drive 5% market share gains in a short period of time. So, it is just kind of paying attention to the many things we have to pay attention to in a business that appears to be pretty straightforward but in the end has a great deal of complexity to it. 
Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets: On the industry consolidation and acquisition environment do you think that multiple expectations of sellers are unrealistic or heading towards realistic? Can you give us a sense of that? This cycle obviously down cycles are good times for a company like SYSCO for acquisition opportunities but how do you think the credit crunch might play into that as well? 
Bill DeLaney:  I think we are beginning to see the impact of the credit crunch and the cumulative economic challenges out there a lot of folks are dealing with. It is mixed and it is kind of like what Rick was saying on pricing. It is going to be somewhat tactical or opportunistic in terms of individual people’s situation. I’m not going to sit here and say we have got a huge backlog of deals but we are working on more deals today than we were a year ago. I feel like we will see more of that just because of the reality of what I think we alluded to earlier in the call. It is a very difficult environment to borrow money in. First of all to grow your business and second of all if you are highly levered folks are going to run into some challenges. We thought we’d see this quite honestly a year ago when things turned in the markets and what has been going on here in the last two months I think is different and deeper and we would expect to see more opportunities going forward. 
Operator:  The next question comes from Alec Patterson – RCM Capital Management. 
Alec Patterson – RCM Capital Management: I wanted to turn around the question on inflation impact and try and see if it creates an issue if we were to suddenly fall into a deflationary situation. You guys have done a lot to mitigate the rising costs and the real sales impact has not been as much to offset what you have gotten on a gross profit dollar per unit basis. So, I’m just curious in this environment if suddenly we fell into a deflationary situation where prices were flat to down how do you think that would play out on a gross profit dollar per unit and gross profit dollar growth basis? 
Richard Schnieders:  I think first of all we have been in deflationary periods before and I would say that we have done a very good job. We have got a lot of experience. In fact we already have a heads up to our operating companies in terms of reminding them what to do when you have a category or sub-category of products that is deflationary. So they are very tuned in to it and I think very experienced. What will happen, or what has happened in the past, is we will see a little bit on a percentage basis you will see a little more pressure in the expense line but we will pick up on the gross margin line. Those are pretty much in balance if you will. If you look at inflation or deflation, we don’t give ourselves anything for picking up at the gross margin line or expense line now. What we do give ourselves credit for, as Ken talked about a minute ago, is being able to improve our productivity in any environment. That is where we are getting our real leverage. We are not counting on it from inflation or deflation. 
Ken Spitler:  This is just a matter of opinion, but I think our systems are better at handling deflation than they are inflation. 
Alec Patterson – RCM Capital Management: Clearly it is working to your advantage. Your systems and scale advantage and RDC’s, etc. I guess I’m just trying to get a handle on the current environment we are in where traffic through away from home consumption is so depressed right now and you guys are at an advantage taking share and what have you. I hate to paint a negative picture, but if inflation is actually giving you guys an opportunity in terms of sourcing or what have you to take share because you are able to out price or under price as need be, is there an issue with deflation coupled with potentially a negative traffic scenario for the industry where there is a gross profit dollar issue. 
Bill DeLaney:  That is one of those great questions where probably there is not one answer to it. I think the way you initially posed the question you used the word suddenly. I think if there was a sudden, deflationary spiral that would create highly unusual pressures that I don’t know if we have ever seen in this industry from where we are at right now. With that said, what would be a better environment for our customers and us would be a lessening of inflation and we would expect that would be a more likely scenario. The challenge in this market, I guess from what I see, and I don’t have quite as many years as Rick and Ken do in the business, but I saw some other earnings releases over the last week or two if we were just in a recession right now that would be one thing but what is going on in the environment is much broader than that. It is very psychological. The financial markets are weighing on people. So I don’t know if you can just talk about inflation and deflation or a recession in isolation. I think you have to look at it in terms of other ramifications. So if there was a significant lessening of inflation and that somehow got the consumer to feel better about their pocketbook then that might be some offsetting positives for that. With respect to return to traffic at our customers and I’ll end where I started. I think the pace of this would be pretty important. If it happened gradually I think that would be a better scenario. 
Richard Schnieders:  I think the other thing to keep in mind is that we again in comparison to our competition think we are much better positioned than our competition to deal with the swings in pricing. I would also go back to, because I think you suggested that inflation was helping us with share gain, and I’m not sure that is what we are hanging our hat on in terms of share gain. Our share gain, we believe, is primarily coming from more fundamental activities and initiatives we have out there. Specifically again, business reviews. Business reviews and our go to market strategy unrelated, uncoupled to inflation is really the way we grow share. Again, we are not counting on inflation or deflation to help us in any particular way. 
Alec Patterson – RCM Capital Management: On that point, the sourcing program, I was wondering if I could get an update what phase we are in or where we are in the phase. What changes in the goals for that in the next 12-18 months? 
Richard Schnieders:  Our sourcing continues. We had a very robust first quarter. I don’t know what phase we are in anymore. It is just part of our business now. We continue to learn from it and I guess I would have to say we are pleased with our ability to buy better than we were buying in the past. We still have lots of things to learn. It is a small percentage of our total spend and we will continue to adjust and experiment and learn as we go forward. 
Alec Patterson – RCM Capital Management: So no real change then? 
Richard Schnieders:  No. 
Alec Patterson – RCM Capital Management: Lastly, Bill you were making a comment about the first 6 months fuel cost impact of $40-60 million if I heard that correctly. 
Bill DeLaney:  $40-50 million. 
Alec Patterson – RCM Capital Management: Is part of that reflecting, I thought there was a hedge in place in last year’s first part of the year. Is that being captured in this increase? 
Bill DeLaney:  Yes. We had a favorable hedge last year compared to what spot prices were at the time and today we have people looking…we have favorable forward contracts in place. Last year this time period compared to spot prices. Currently, as I mentioned, we have several forward contracts that are higher than the current spot levels. So that is a big part of it. We talked about it a little bit at the end of the last quarter and actually at that time we estimated an increase for the six months of $55-65 million. So we have brought that down primarily because as I said we are still buying about 1/3 of it spot and obviously prices have come off a lot. We think when the six months is over $40-50 million is a pretty good ballpark. We expect to recover most of that on the fuel surcharges. Then hopefully things will stabilize a little bit in the economy. We’ll have some better thoughts for you in the second half of the year at that time. 
Operator:  The next question comes from Bob Cummins – Shields and Co. 
Bob Cummins – Shields and Co. : One large company that I follow that also generates a lot of excess cash has publicly announced that they don’t intend to buy back any more shares for the near term in view of the turmoil of the financial markets and wanted to conserve funds. I’m just wondering what your policy will be? I see your share repurchase expenditures were down a little from a year ago in this quarter. Your stock seems awfully appealing at $25 a share. Kind of fill us in on what your strategy will be going forward. 
Richard Schnieders:  I think you would see us continue with the strategy you have seen in the last few years. We will continue to buy shares back. The only reason it was off a little in the first quarter is we were in a blackout in the early part of the quarter. We are actively buying today. As I mentioned in my comments, we look at share repurchase as a legitimate way to provide return of capital to our shareholders but in terms of priority we certainly are looking at capEx, acquisitions and the dividends first. So it is somewhat of a residual but unless there was a significant pop in capEx or acquisition opportunity of a larger scale came along I think you would see us continue the pattern we are at right now. We would agree with you especially now that we see the shares as very attractive. 
Operator:  The next question comes from John Heinbockel – Goldman Sachs. 
Analyst for John Heinbockel – Goldman Sachs: Can you clarify, did you mentioned what Q2 sales to date were rising? 
Richard Schnieders:  No, we do not do that. We do not give that kind of guidance. 
Analyst for John Heinbockel – Goldman Sachs: If this environment where supermarkets seemingly could take share just based on food at home and food away from home numbers, if it continues for an extended period of time, how can you help your customers combat it? 
Richard Schnieders:  One way, there might be several answers to this question, but certainly one way is to help our customers understand the take out market, if you will. If you look at the restaurant business and slice and dice it a bit, you see take out business increasing at the restaurants at fairly nice rates. I saw a number the other day and I wouldn’t bank on this but 20% increase in take out. I think some of that is being fueled by the reality that the major retailers, major and a good regional grocery retailers, have done a nice job over the last few years at improving their take out offerings. Now having said that, we are not abdicating that space. We have a good program with a number of regional players out there and larger players where we provide them ingredients for their take out business. The ingredients, packaging and that sort of thing. Going back to the restaurants for a second, it is crucial that they have a comprehensive take out program so they have to have the right packaging. They have to have the ability for the customer to enter their order via the Internet and all those components. They have to have the marketing program. So we help the customer with all of those to give them a strong take out program. So that is one example. I’m sure there are others. 
Analyst for John Heinbockel – Goldman Sachs: There are a lot of moving parts to this but in the back half of next year if gas prices remain where they are, diesel should certainly be at a tail end. Is it as simple as just taking that as a percent of your costs and figuring how much or do you guys have an idea of that? 
Richard Schnieders:  When you say back half of next year are you talking about calendar year next year? 
Analyst for John Heinbockel – Goldman Sachs: Calendar or even a little bit into your fiscal. 
Richard Schnieders:  I would say again, as far as where we are at right now we are locked into these forwards for 2/3 of our purchases. So it will not be a tailwind this year. We will update you in terms of the second half of the year as we have better information when we release earnings for the second quarter. The forward is pretty much expired through next summer and early fall I think. Then at that point we will just have to see where the spot prices are and that type of thing. 
Bill DeLaney:  It is also important to note that we are not trying to beat the oil market. We have enough trouble just in the food market. We are not trying to beat the market or be smarter than anybody else in oil. What we are trying to do is ultimately take the volatility out of that component of our costs. 
Analyst for John Heinbockel – Goldman Sachs: A couple of things on financial items, the COLI, the multi-state employer and the company-owned pension, the run rates that were accrued I guess beginning in this quarter should those continue to stand based on assumptions or does the COLI still fluctuate with the market but the pensions still continue at the same run rate? 
Bill DeLaney:  Let me go easiest to hardest here. The pension quarterly performance you saw for the pension you can pretty much annualize that comparison to last year in terms of the company’s qualified pension plan. So the pension hurt us $4-5 million. The stock comp helped us by a comparable amount. That is going to be pretty accurate as well. We still do need to tweak that a little bit here as we issue options here later in November and December. So that is not quite as hard a number but it should be pretty close. The multi-employer plan will fluctuate. What you saw this quarter was we didn’t have any situations where we needed to set up provisions for multi-employer plan liabilities. A year ago we did. As we have noted in all of our ongoing disclosures we have other situations out there that could bring that to bear again and we’ll just have to update you as that goes along. The COLI, as I mentioned in my comments, a large part of those investments are tied to marketable securities. There is a lot of unfavorable volatility in the first quarter and there has been comparable unfavorable volatility so far this quarter. So as we sit here today you should expect to see similar results. If the market were to bounce back then that would mitigate that. 
Analyst for John Heinbockel – Goldman Sachs: Back on the company-owned pension, the assumptions I believe are set at the beginning of the fiscal year for you which was in the summer time. This year you continue to accrue at whatever rate was set. Does that have implications as you go into next year as far as under funded status? I think the markets are considerably changed a little bit since the middle of the summer, or does it totally depend on what you use for the assumptions of the following year? 
Bill DeLaney:  To your point we are fiscal year so we, if you will, trued up our funding position at the end of June and that impacted our expense and to a lesser extent our funding. We actually pre-funded that a little bit this year because we were in a good cash situation. So if you fast forward we will true all that up here again in June of this year for the following year and there is a lot of things that impact it but certainly you are right on point. I know there have been some articles on there that what has been going on in the markets today, when the markets are down 30-35% that would have an unfavorable effect on our funding position. We think we are still relatively fully funded as we sit here today but in terms of the expense that would hurt us for next year. However, there are other variables such as the discount rate that we would need to address at that time as well. So to the extent that corporate rates have risen, and they have, one thing we did get some misfortune on was our bond financing yield back in February. We locked in at 4-5% and those rates are 2-2.5 points higher today. So that would offset it. Cutting through it all, I think net it would be unfavorable but that is a long ways from now and a lot of other things could impact it. 
Analyst for John Heinbockel – Goldman Sachs: Finally, the last update on the IRS tax case I think characterized the discussion as being constructive. If you could provide any color on that? 
Richard Schnieders:  Really constructive. They are better. Like I said they are better than they were a year ago this time in that we are having dialogues. They are constructive. We feel our facts are strong. I wish I could give you more. It is just one of those processes that is going to take some time to work through it appropriately. It is moving in the right direction. It is going to take some more time. We feel very good with our position. 
Operator:  The final question is a follow-up question from Meredith Adler – Barclays Capital. 
Meredith Adler – Barclays Capital: Back to the COLI situation, have you guys thought about eliminating or finding some other way to do this? I know other companies that had COLI and it created unnecessary volatility in earnings. 
Richard Schnieders:  Yes every day we think about it. It is very volatile right now. In a certain way we have addressed it in terms of the plans that particular investment underwrites or supports, even though it technically doesn’t support it on the accounting side, but those contracts are out there to support supplemental retirement benefits for our senior leadership. We have actually cut back on the formula in those plans and we have also pared back the future eligibility for those plans. So over the longer term we have done some things. In the shorter term there is still some pretty viable tax reasons to fund it the way we do and unfortunately the accounting requires you to essentially mark it mark to market which probably isn’t technically right but essentially the same. So, it is a trade off between the volatility and the tax benefits and as much as we would like to lessen the volatility at this point we are planning on staying the course. 
Meredith Adler – Barclays Capital: I have a question about labor costs. You improved productivity, management did take a pay cut I think starting July 1. Were there cuts in other employee pay? Did commissions for marketing reps go down? 
Bill DeLaney:  No. 
Richard Schnieders:  I think the only thing we did there was obviously when you have the kind of inflation we have seen I think our folks have looked at their commission programs and make sure they are appropriate but there have been no direct cuts. 
Meredith Adler – Barclays Capital: About credit, I know you haven’t seen a lot of restaurants go out of business but do you feel comfortable with the way the operating companies are dealing with their credit customers? 
Richard Schnieders:  Comfortable and credit aren’t two words you usually use together a lot in our business but yes, we would reiterate what we have said all along. We feel we do a good job managing credit and obviously most of that is done at a local level as all of our business tends to be local to a large extent. So we feel good about how we are managing it but clearly these economic times are providing challenges and there are situations where people are going out of business. There are situations where we are having to work with folks on payment plans and so we have said from the beginning we would expect credit to be more of a lagging indicator and I would stand by that. We definitely feel we are managing it well. 
Operator:  At this time for closing remarks I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Richard Schnieders. 
Richard Schnieders:  I would just like to go back and reinforce again we believe that SYSCO is better positioned than any food service distributor to thrive in the years to come. Secondly, I will make a political comment. We want to encourage everyone to go out and vote tomorrow and after you vote please take a friend or loved one out to dinner. All the poll workers, if possible, but please enjoy a good meal out as soon as possible. Thank you all. 
Operator:  Ladies and gentlemen we thank you for your participation in today’s call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to today’s SYSCO Corporation fourth quarter and year end fiscal year 2008 earnings conference call. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Neal Russell, Assistance Vice President Investor Relations.
Neal Russell: Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us for SYSCO’s fourth quarter and fiscal year 2008 conference call. On today’s call you will hear from Richard Schnieders, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Ken Spitler, our President and Chief Operating Officer and Bill DeLaney, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  Before we begin please note that statements made in the course of this presentation that state the company’s or management’s intentions, hopes, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find the reconciliation of those non-GAAP measures on our Investor Relations website at www.sisco.com. Please understand that all comparisons given during the call refer to changes between the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 or between the full year of 2008 and the full year 2007 unless otherwise noted. Also all comments about earnings per share refer to diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted.  I’ll turn it over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Richard Schnieders.
Richard Schnieders: Thanks Neal, welcome and thank you for joining us this morning and thank you for your interest in SYSCO. Here are the headlines; 5.4% sales growth for the quarter and 7.1% sales growth for the year. What’s important to note are the results coming from the operating companies where they were able to leverage the 7% growth in sales to three points of leverage to 10% operating income.  And in total we leveraged to 13% EPS growth for fiscal 2008 consistent with our long-term objectives. In addition we returned 90% of our earnings to shareholders in the form of dividends and repurchases. Now I’d like to turn it over to Ken for details on how all of this was achieved and I’ll be back for the Q&A. 
Ken Spitler: Thanks Richard, and good morning to everyone. As Richard just said, 2008 was a solid year. For the full year sales grew $2.5 billion to $37.5 billion. Further operating income grew 10% to $1.9 billion. Net earnings grew by more than $100 million to $1.1 billion. Earnings per share grew 13%, return on total capital grew by one point to 21%, return on equity exceeded 33%, and we returned over $1 billion to our shareholders in the forms of dividends and share repurchases. These results reflect the diligent efforts of our 50,000 associates to support our customers and improve productivity in all aspects of our business. Physical 2008 certainly presented us with obstacles to overcome including ever increasing fuel prices, persistent inflation and a challenging demand environment, each of which impacted our results. However, our relentless focus on supporting our customers and improving our operational capabilities resulted in strong earnings during this challenging time. Our sales growth in the fourth quarter was indicative of the overall market environment. In the midst of declining demand we focused on efforts on stringent expense control resulting in strong operating leverage. For the full year SYSCO sales growth of 7.1% continued to outpace the industry growth as we consistently gained market share. Unmistakably operating leverage was a driving force of our success during the year. We implemented several initiatives over time that have positioned SYSCO as the leader in the industry.  They included programs such as activity-based pay, which aligns the compensation of certain associates with work completed rather than time on the job to improved productivity and cost controls. Also we continue to manage increased fuel costs by reducing the number of stops, increasing cases per truck, reducing idling time and placing governors on portions of our fleet that prevent trucks from exceeding 60 miles per hour, which not only helps save fuel but improves safety. We moved forward with out centralized sourcing program in 2008, leveraging the power of the entire corporation to reduce costs while streamlining our inventory. We also continued to manage miles; an ongoing process for SYSCO. We used our transportation management system to streamline inbound freight while our XY routing process minimized miles driven on outbound shipments.  Combined these two initiatives helped reduce our costs, solidify our competitive position and importantly, reduce negative environmental impact. Food inflation as measured by our internal measure of product cost inflations has been consistent averaging about 6.2% for the fourth quarter and 6% for the full year.  The product categories of canned and dry and dairy have had the largest impacts for the year. The balance of inflation costs were spread across several categories. Although we don’t forecast inflation, we anticipate product costs to increase for the foreseeable future.  As the industry leader, we will continue to invest back in our business to maintain and grow our competitive advantages. We expanded the Broadline business by opening one additional facility in Knoxville, Tennessee during fiscal 2008 and expect to open another in East Texas in physical 2009. We are encouraged with the progress we made during fiscal 2008 and remain confident that the successful execution of our business plan will position us well to participate in the growth and success of our customers in the future. Looking back on the momentum the company gained during physical 2007 and built upon in 2008, I am confident we have the right people and the right plan to deliver in fiscal 2009. In summary we had another solid year from an operational and financial standpoint. I’d like to thank the entire SYSCO team for their leadership and hard work. Now Bill will review some additional financial details for the fourth quarter and total year. 
Bill DeLaney: Thanks Ken and good morning everyone. As Richard and Ken just said we are pleased with our financial results for 2008. There are a few items regarding the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2008 financial results that I would like to briefly discuss. First operating expenses for the quarter included a negative year-over-year comparison of approximately $8.4 million related to our investment in company owned life insurance or COLI. Also during the quarter we incurred charges totaling $12.9 million related to multi-employer pension plans. Separately we had favorable comparisons of $2.7 million related to stock-based compensation and of $2.2 million related to company-sponsored pension plan expense. For the quarter these items resulted in a net $16.4 million unfavorable impact on operating income growth. For the full year we had an unfavorable comparison of $24.2 million for these same items. Clearly the ability of the company to not only offset these cost pressures but continue to leverage sales growth is indicative of the high level of execution taking place at our operating companies. Notwithstanding the favorable impact of the initiatives discussed by Ken, higher fuel prices negatively impacted SYSCO’s operating expenses by $16 million during the fourth quarter and $34 million during the fiscal year. Approximately 75% of the $34 million increase in fuel expense for the year was recovered through incremental fuel surcharges. Looking forward we expect that increases in fuel costs will negatively impact the year-over-year cost comparisons by approximately $60 million to $70 million for the first six months of fiscal 2009. We expect to recover approximately half of those additional fuel costs during the first six months of fiscal 2009 through increased fuel surcharges. These estimates include the impact of forward purchase contracts for approximately 30% of our fuel needs through the mid point of the second quarter that we’ve already committed to and assume the remainder of our fuel needs are purchased at current spot price levels.  Our cash flows and balance sheet remained strong in 2008 and are a competitive advantage for SYSCO. going forward we expect capital spending of fiscal 2009 to be in the range of approximately $675 million to $725 million primarily for land and facilities in our core business. We also continue to look for acquisitions in conjunction with our strategic business goals and we expect to continue to return capital to our shareholders by repurchasing shares and growing the dividend commensurate with our earnings growth. As we begin fiscal 2009 we remain committed to the success of our customers. We are pleased with our overall performance for fiscal 2008 but realize significant challenges lie ahead. Today’s difficult market environment demands that we further improve our productivity in all aspects of our business so that we remain well positioned to sustain profitable sales growth for the foreseeable future.  And with that, we’ll now take questions. 
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian – Citigroup
Greg Badishkanian – Citigroup: Your margins were greater then what I was and I’m assuming the street modeled out, in order of magnitude what were the drivers leading to only 4% operating expense growth this quarter in an inflationary environment?
Richard Schnieders: There were probably a number of things that took place and Ken alluded to a couple of them, but certainly the more efficient routing of our trucks, the fact that we’re putting more cases on the trucks, we’re getting more productivity in the warehouses. Frankly we’re getting more productivity throughout the organization. Our productivity in the total organization continues to improve.  So broadly its just in good tight expense control and in awareness that the operating companies in all levels of the business that that is a focus for us and we’ve talked to everyone that has any influence at all that this is going to be the next 12 to 18 months at least in our mind, that we have to be very, very sharp at the expense line. 
Greg Badishkanian – Citigroup: Do you feel that there’s more opportunity over the coming quarters to continue to cut out expenses or have you, do you think you’ve maximized those initiatives?
Richard Schnieders: No I think that we all recognize there are other opportunities for us to continue to get more efficient and more productive in the ways we work. 
Greg Badishkanian – Citigroup: Looking at, you had mentioned that SYSCO had gained share in the quarter, or at least in the full year, can you talk a bit about in the quarter maybe what you think the industry was growing at and if you gained share, what types of customers. Was it your customers growing faster, were you gaining share of new customers?
Richard Schnieders: I think we gained, without having our data right now, but I think we gained share in the fourth quarter at the same rate that we gained share throughout the year and I would once again, point to the success we’ve had with the business review process. I think that the companies continue to execute extremely well in the business reviews. And we had another good year of business reviews in 2008 and we’re starting off 2009 on a similar trajectory.  So the one thing that I would point to would certainly be, in terms of gaining share, would be the business review process. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler – Lehman Brothers
Meredith Adler – Lehman Brothers: Are you still seeing growth from new customers, that the MAs out in the field are they still winning new business? 
Richard Schnieders: We are certainly picking up new customers. We had a good year of picking up new customers. At the same time our penetration continues to improve but, yes, I think we’re focused on new customers. Having said that I would also say that today, and we’ve said this before, we’re doing a better job in terms of qualifying customers to make sure that they indeed fit our system and our strategy. So yes, we’re definitely picking up new customers; probably the biggest contributor to overall sales growth right now. 
Meredith Adler – Lehman Brothers: Drilling down a little bit on the gross margin line, I think we were a little bit surprised to see it, basically flat, we thought it might be down just given inflation and the way some of the math works on your contracted business where you have a fixed fee. Can you talk about what’s going on there? Is it really just about making sure you pass through the inflation or are there some productivity improvements within the gross margin line that are helping that stay flat?
Bill DeLaney: There’s always a lot going on on the gross margin line and frankly that’s why we try to steer people toward the operating margin line because there’s so many things going on in a given quarter between customers and products and inflation. The one thing I will say to you here is the fuel surcharges that we alluded to in terms of the year and kind of our best guess going forward for the next six months, we did ramp that initiative up significantly in the fourth quarter and the accounting for that is such that fuel expense hits the cost line or the expense line and these fuel surcharges hit the revenue line so that did help a little bit, more so in the fourth quarter then earlier in the year. But in addition to that, its just a lot of what Richard just talked about and what we speak about in the release and in the script that we just went through, which is its just managing at the customer level as best as you can day in and day out so that you’re responding to what the customers’ needs are but also trying to do what we need to do from shareholder perspective. 
Meredith Adler – Lehman Brothers: On inflation, you mentioned a few different product categories where you experienced higher then the average inflation, as we look out we’ve been hearing that protein, the center of the plate items might be experiencing more inflation here I guess in the second half of the calendar year, is there a difference in the way that the center of the plate items are priced that might result in some differences in what you’re experiencing things on the gross margin line? 
Richard Schnieders: Well I think first of all, we have not seen the protein, the center of the plate protein, items to be the main contributor to the inflation at least in the most recent past. In fact there are four categories that are contributing most of the inflation right now. Three of those are related to vegetables and fruits and the other one is dairy. Meat proteins have not been the biggest contributor to inflation so it’s a little bit hard to predict what’s going to happen going forward. However, having said that the big contributor is sort of on the grains and the vegetables and the fruits, those categories, those products mostly come to harvest starting about right now for the next couple, three months.  So we think that based on what we know right now the supplies are going to be pretty good. So frankly it’s anybody’s guess. This has been a very, very volatile market for the last couple of years. If the dollar continues to strengthen I think that we will continue to see the oil prices come down and we track commodities, corn and soy beans specifically against oil, and they’re tailing down now also as the dollar has gotten stronger.  If anybody can predict all of those various components, frankly they’re better then we are. It would be just a guess at this point, but we’re operating as if we’re going to have some inflation for the next while yet. 
Ken Spitler: To answer your question on the pricing side of it, center of the plate is generally priced weekly or at the time of sale. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel – Goldman Sachs
John Heinbockel – Goldman Sachs: Can you talk to sales progression and did you see kind of a constant softening trend during the quarter and has that continued in to the new year? Do we have any sense whether we’ve hit bottom or not yet? 
Richard Schnieders: That’s another one of those sorts of prognostications that’s difficult to address. Obviously we’re in difficult macroeconomic environment. We did see declining sequential sales growth through the fiscal year not necessarily through the quarter. What we’ve been encouraged about is our ability to continue by working with our customers to take share in this marketplace and we’re going to continue to focus on our ability to control costs and live by our commitment to leverage up our top line sales growth into the operating line and into the EPS.  At this point, I guess, we would all hope that fuel at the pump is going to continue to come down. Obviously that’s a contributor to the overall macro environment and to the restaurant business in general so again, we’re going to manage the business as tough as we’ve been managing it for the last year going forward. 
John Heinbockel – Goldman Sachs: But if you look at the last month or two, you wouldn’t necessarily be below that 5.4 for the quarter? [inaudible] the assumption that you’re running below that today? 
Richard Schnieders: No. 
John Heinbockel – Goldman Sachs: It would be fault or it wouldn’t be? 
Richard Schnieders: It would not--
Bill DeLaney: Obviously we don’t give a lot of forward looking commentary on sales growth. We’re running about where we were running for the quarter. We’re only four or five weeks into the new quarter.
John Heinbockel – Goldman Sachs: If you look at MA growth in terms of positions, where did we end up in 2008 percent growth and what do you think we end up in 2009?
Ken Spitler: We’re flat for 2008 but we increased our business review people. 
John Heinbockel – Goldman Sachs: So flat in terms of total number of positions? 
Ken Spitler: MAs. 
John Heinbockel – Goldman Sachs: And what about 2009 do you think?
Ken Spitler: I don’t anticipate that we’re going to grow them more than probably about 2%. We’re still adding business review people. 
Richard Schnieders: Let me be clear about that and make the distinction again that Ken is making and that is that our marketing associate growth in 2008 was flat but we did add business review folks and business development folks. So I just wanted to make that distinction. 
John Heinbockel – Goldman Sachs: In terms of centralized purchasing where are we now in terms of number of categories and amount of volume impacted? Where do you think we go over the next 12 months? 
Richard Schnieders: I think there were some comments made in the script that we continue to be very favorable toward our overall sourcing program and the total company has really gotten behind it. So we’re just continuing on as we have been. We’re going to continue to add more categories; I don’t even have a number today in terms of what we’re going to add. But we feel good about that program and we’re going to continue to add products and categories throughout 2009.
John Heinbockel – Goldman Sachs: Wasn’t the last wave something like $4 billion or $5 billion of sales or no? 
Richard Schnieders : Four or $5 billion? No. 
Bill DeLaney: The last wave would have got us to $3 billion. 
John Heinbockel – Goldman Sachs: And are we into the next wave yet, or no? Or are we still in the $3 billion wave?
Bill DeLaney: We’re in the next wave. Obviously now we do renewals on the earlier waves of products and we add new categories as well. 
Richard Schnieders: The $3 billion is a cumulative number. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets
Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets: Was there any—can you explain why this quarter there was no share buyback activity?
Bill DeLaney: Let me be as straightforward and as oblique as I can be here, but we, as we got into the quarter we were assessing a potential opportunity that we felt that if it did develop further could be significant and so we chose not to buy shares. Since that time the opportunity has not developed and we’ve moved on. So you will see us come back into the market here once our blackout period is lifted. 
Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets: Onto this multi-employer pension liability that cost you a lot of money the last couple of quarters, in the Q for the third quarter there’s some commentary suggesting—is there any update on that? Have you got a better feel for what that could turn out to be for the company?
Bill DeLaney: Are you talking about aggregate exposure or are you talking about specific commentary on any given one plan that we be in? 
Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets: It’s the multi-employer pension plan liability this quarter; it hit you by $22 million in the last couple of quarters.
Bill DeLaney: It is for $22 million for the year and about $13 million I think for the quarter, right. And so the quarter was a combination of a couple of different plans that we participate in and I think we have given disclosure in the past Ks and I guess Qs that theoretically there’s a number out there in the $135 million to $140 million range that, its not the most current number in the world, we do the best we can to get that data so. Of that, say its $140 million, we’ve affectively provided for about $20 million of it at this point. 
Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets: So did that mean that could be an ongoing expense in the ballpark of what we’ve seen in the last couple of quarters? 
Bill DeLaney: It’s really hard to predict. I’ll give you a little commentary on this one. The $140 million number that I spoke to is that’s our exposure theoretically in all of our plans. What you’ve seen this year is one plan in particular that was in a little more critical situation where we had to address some funding and potential withdraw liability issues so that one has its own situation if you will. And we also had actually another situation where we decertified in a small union and that created a need to put up a withdraw liability provision. It’s kind of case by case. And where we have opportunities to decertify and those aren’t frequent we tend to take advantage of them so, I can’t give you a real clear answer in terms of the future other than the bulk of this $22 million is one plan. It’s a very unique situation and we’ll just have to play it quarter by quarter at this point. 
Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets: In the past you’ve given a sense of what the company’s sponsored pensions, what kind of change to or swing in earnings that might occur. This year you picked up a little bit on that in earnings, and perhaps stock compensation expense, do you clarity on that?
Bill DeLaney: We’ve got developing clarity and as you notice in the release we basically just went ahead and put this stuff in a table, some of these items which—I can’t call them non-recurring but they’re hard to predict but the two that I think we can speak to somewhat today and I think with more clarity when we file the K and even more so after the first quarter are the two that you mentioned. So the pension helped us this year by about $9 million, this is the company-sponsored pension. And the stock comp helped us I think by $17 million or $18 million.  Looking forward on the pension, that’s going to go the other way in 2009. That’s probably going to hurt us some where’s around $20 million give or take. We’ll tighten that up as we file the K. That’s being largely driven by just what you would expect which is what’s been going on in the financial markets and certainly our investments have participated in that.  And then on the stock comp, that’s a little trickier but our best judgment today would be that that would be favorable next year by about $20 million. So the two would roughly offset, my only caveat on the stock comp, is a significant amount of that number is stock options which are approved by our Board of Directors an that won’t happen until we get into the fall. So that number is not really a firm number but out best judgment today is that those two numbers will roughly offset in 2009.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Neil Currie – UBS
Neil Currie – UBS: I just wanted to ask about the health of the independents out there. We’ve seen a number of bankruptcies out there amongst restaurants and I was wondering what color you might be able to give. Obviously you’re taking market share but I imagine there are also some of your accounts that may be struggling due to the overall environment. What are you seeing in terms of an increase or a decrease in those sorts of trends?
Richard Schnieders: I think its definitely, there’s no question, we’ve said in a couple of different ways I guess, that it’s a very challenging environment out there and of course everyone read about [Bennington’s] and Steak and Ale, but I would have to say too, and this is something we’ve said before, that generally our customer base tends to be a very high quality customer base. Our customers have been in business for a long time. We anticipate that they will weather this storm.  Now having said that I think its definitely a challenging time for then and again the business reviews are where we go in and try to help them with their operational issues and their menus and what we’ve found most recently over the past couple of quarters has been, in this difficult environment our customers are coming to us to ask for business reviews, to ask for more information, to ask them to help them get through this difficult time.  So it is tough but I think that our customers generally are doing well and we’re doing everything we can to help them in their business. 
Neil Currie – UBS: In terms of helping them in order to do that, do you think in the next six months or so, let’s assume that inflation stays at these sorts of levels, do you think it may—you’ve been very successful in being able to pass through fuel surcharges and inflated costs, do you think your ability to do that will—and hold onto the level of sales that you have and retain the health of your customer base, can continue and you can continue to push through those costs or do you think that it may get more difficult to do that? 
Richard Schnieders: I’m confident that we can continue to do that. I would say that over the last few months we’ve learned better how to communicate with our customers, even those that don’t go through a business review. One of the key activities or key things that a restaurant has to do today is make sure they keep up with their pricing, their cost on their menu prices. And that’s what we’ve been, I think very good at, I think the customers in turn have responded well to the suggestions that we’ve made.  In the past we’ve had customers that haven’t changed their menu pricing for seven or eight years and in this environment that’s absolutely deadly. So I think that our companies have done a terrific job in terms of helping with that particular item and others but making sure that our customers are keeping up with the menu pricing. 
Neil Currie – UBS: Has there been any change in your allowance for bad debts or any update on how that looks? 
Bill DeLaney: Nothing significant. When you’ll see the K you’ll find that the ratios for bad debt and write-offs are pretty comparable to what they’ve been running. 
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Alec Patterson – RCM
Alec Patterson – RCM: Just wanted to clarity, there wasn’t any mention of M&A in the sales number, that’s correct, right?
Bill DeLaney: That’s correct. 
Alec Patterson – RCM: I guess I’m just trying to back into the traditional real growth number, it’s slightly negative, and that’s just the way to put it? 
Bill DeLaney: That’s correct also. 
Alec Patterson – RCM: And part of the overall sales looks like the other segment soft again, can you sort of speak to what’s going on there if anything? As far as other. 
Richard Schnieders: I think that we’ve had a challenging year particularly in the meat business early on with the high cost of raw materials in beef and pork to a certain extent, lesser in poultry but I think that’s been a tough business for us and for others. It’s been a challenging year. 
Ken Spitler: And predominantly the softness you see there is in the meat companies. [inaudible] had a pretty good year and the produce companies had a pretty good year but they’ve had kind of a perfect storm of bad circumstances. 
Alec Patterson – RCM: Are you saying that it’s a tough year because people are eating less of that product line or the inflation trend, or—not quite clear on that? 
Richard Schnieders: I think what’s happened in a lot of cases is we’ve seen trading down so we’ve seen trading down from tenderloins down to flatiron steaks, from strip steaks down to any number of things. I think there’s been a lot of substituting going on, although the pounds are not off as much as the dollars are, it’s because of the shifting mix. 
Operator:  This concludes the question-and-answer session for today’s conference; Mr. Schneiders I would like to turn the conference back over to you for any closing remarks. 
Richard Schnieders: Once again I’d like to add my thanks to our 50,000 associates out there for an excellent year in a very challenging environment. And I know that we can count on them again in fiscal 2009. So thank you all for participating this morning. We appreciate your interest.

Operator:  Good day everyone and welcome to today’s SYSCO Corporation third quarter fiscal year 2008 earnings conference call. As a reminder today’s call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to your moderator for today, Mr. Neal Russell, Assistance Vice President Investor Relations, please go ahead sir.
Neal Russell:  Thank you Anthony and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us for SYSCO’s third quarter fiscal 2008 conference call. On today’s call you will hear from Rick Schnieders, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Ken Spitler, our President and Chief Operating Officer and Bill DeLaney, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, please note that statements made in the course of this presentation that state the company’s or management’s intentions, hopes, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Actual results could differ in a material manner. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ in a material manner from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company’s SEC filings including but not limited to risk factors contained in the company’s annual report on form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2007 and in the company’s press release issued earlier this morning.  Please understand that all comparisons given during the call refer to changes between the third quarter of fiscal 2008 and the third quarter of fiscal 2007 unless otherwise noted. Also, all comments about earnings per share refer to diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. With that out of the way, I’ll turn it over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rick Schnieders.
Rick Schnieders:  Thanks Neal. Earlier this morning SYSCO announced sales growth of 6.7% for the third quarter and earnings per share growth of 14.3%. These results represent our seventh quarter in a row of double digit earnings per share growth. Considering the challenging economic environment, I’m once again pleased with our results, particularly with our ability to continue to leverage our sales growth and to improve earnings per share. The financial results this quarter reflect the ability of our Broadline companies to leverage effectively in a difficult sales and operating environment.  Our continued success is the result of our commitment to satisfying the needs of our customers. I’d like to take this opportunity to thank all of my fellow SYSCO colleagues for their ongoing support of our customer’s success. Without question, the current operating environment is challenging for SYSCO and our customers. But I’m pleased to report that SYSCO is responding well to those challenges as our results published this morning demonstrate.  We are executing at a high level as we continue to invest in our business. SYSCO is not only the leader in our industry today, but we believe our continued investment in people, fleet, facilities and technology positions us to build upon our leadership for years to come. The third quarter is one in which we normally experience some seasonality as March represents a disproportionate amount of sales and profits for the quarter.  This year on a comparable basis, March was not as strong due in part to the early Easter holiday which created some headwind as people departed their winter or spring holidays and returned home earlier than in the prior year. Additionally, difficult weather in the Northeast and Midwest provided a significant operating challenge during the quarter. Ken will elaborate on more specific regional data in his comments.  Difficult economic times have always provided opportunities for SYSCO to further differentiate ourselves in the marketplace because our customers increasingly look to us for support and business solutions. As the industry leader, we have a unique ability and responsibility to leverage our size and scale to benefit our customers. Furthermore, we’ve continued to stratify our customer base over the past few years resulting in quality relationships with superior customers.  Our business covers the full spectrum of food service facilities, from independent white table cloth establishments to quick service restaurants and everything in between. We continue to see the benefits of having a diversified geography and a diversified customer base as well as a wide breadth of products. For the past several months our industry has experienced various macroeconomic pressures, such as high food inflation and fuel costs that continue to restrict growth.  However, our more than 50,000 dedicated associates are focused on helping our customers success which we are confident will contribute to our long term success. Looking forward, our key long term goals continue to be: first, 7-9% long term sales growth. Second, lever that up to low to mid teens EPS growth. And third, maintaining strong return on equity and return on capital ratios over the long term. Now I’ll turn things over to Ken so he can review in further detail our operational results for the quarter.
Ken Spitler:  Thanks Rick. Our performance in the third quarter met our expectations and our sales growth of 6.7 continued to outpace industry growth. More importantly, once again we demonstrated our ability to leverage, in particular, at the Broadline companies, resulting in our earnings per share growth of 14.3%. The ability of our Broadline companies, our core business, to manage expenses and expand operating margins in this environment reflects the talent and work ethic of SYSCO associates across our network.  One of the ways in which we are managing expenses is through productivity improvement. An example of improved productivity is that on average, our trucks carry at least 15% more cases per load than they did in 2001. Food inflation as measured by our internal measure of product cost inflation remained high, averaging about 6.2% for the quarter. The product categories of dairy, canned and dry goods have had the largest impact for this quarter. The balance of inflation costs were spread across several categories.  Although we don’t forecast inflation, we anticipate product costs to remain high for the foreseeable future. However, as evidenced in our financial results, we are doing a good job of managing these product cost increases. Our operating companies manage their business well, with gross profit dollars growing faster than expenses, in spite of the impact of certain items that Bill will discuss later. Additionally, we continue to manage margins effectively in a high inflationary environment.  On a regional basis, sales growth during the third quarter was strong in the Southwest, which was offset by a relative weakness in Florida. The slower growth was a result of the early Easter holiday and the impact of a more concentrated housing crisis in that region. Business reviews and hiring additional customer contact personnel continued to be very effective in allowing us to help customers improve their business.  We continue to see benefits from customers who go through a business review and as we said before, conducting quality business reviews is imbedded in how we go to market. Regarding our cost management, we made additional progress during the quarter in ruling out our productivity enhancing initiatives that should further contribute to increased profitability as they become fully implemented.  Designated delivery days and XY routing initiatives that were designed to reduce miles driven improved productivity and helped offset a general cost measures that we cannot control, such as higher fuel prices, which were approximately 30% higher in the third quarter. We continue to make good progress on managing miles driven, fuel expenses will unfavorably impact our financial results for next quarter.  Fuel expense was about $12 million higher in the third quarter compared to the prior year. We expect fuel costs will negatively impact year over year earnings by approximately $20-$25 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. Our estimate is based upon both current spot prices for diesel and the cost basis of our forward contracts we have in place for approximately 40% of our total fuel needs through June.  Also I am pleased to report that our second RDC in Alachua, Florida has opened on schedule and is now shipping product to five operating companies. While we expect the ramp up of this facility to be substantially faster than our first RDC in Virginia, we will see some startup cost pressures in the short term. In summary, we had another solid quarter from our operational and financial standpoint. I’d like to thank the entire SYSCO team for their leadership and hard work. Now Bill will review our financial results for the third quarter and year to date.
Bill DeLaney:  Thank you Ken. As Rick and Ken just said, we had a good third quarter and I’m pleased with our year to date results as well. In the third quarter, sales grew 6.7%, operating income leveraged 2 points to approximately 9% and earnings per share grew by 14%. For the nine month period, sales grew 7.7%, operating income grew 10.2% and earnings per share grew 13.5%.  These results reflect our ability to grow gross profit dollars faster than operating expenses. Our solid growth and profitability was primarily the result of disciplined execution at our operating companies. There are a few items regarding our third quarter financial results that I would like to briefly discuss. First, operating expenses for the quarter include a negative year over year comparison of approximately $18 million related to our investments in company owned life insurance.  The underlying value of these policies will continue to be impacted by any volatility in the financial markets. Additionally, we have favorable comparisons related to stock based compensation of $4 million and pension expense of $2 million that helped to offset some of the shortfall from the life insurance policies. For the quarter, these items resulted in a net $12 million unfavorable comparison.  During the quarter we issued $750 million of senior unsecured notes, using the proceeds to pay down commercial paper. The bond offering was successfully executed with attractive pricing that demonstrated the investment community’s confidence in our financial structure. This transaction allowed us to secure historically low long term interest rates on these bonds which comprised 35-40% of our long term debt. Capital expenditures totaled approximately $400 million for the first three quarters of our fiscal year, slightly below plan.  As a result, we have lowered our fiscal year 2008 capital expenditure estimate to a range of $550 million to $575 million. Our return on average total capital, return on total capital, calculated as net earnings divided by average equity plus long term debt continues to be strong. For the rolling 12 months ended March 31, our return was approximately 20%. We believe that this was an important financial measure and we will provide regular updates in the future.  As we begin the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 and look forward into 2009, we remain committed to the success of our customers. In summary, we are pleased with our overall performance for the third quarter and for the first nine months of fiscal 2008. Looking forward, we see significant opportunities both to grow our share of market and improve productivity in all areas of our business. While we are fully cognizant of today’s difficult market environment, we are committed to achieving our long term business objectives. Now I’ll turn it back over to Rick.
Rick Schnieders:  Thanks Bill. As you’ve heard form Ken, Bill and me this morning, we are pleased with our overall results for the third quarter and the nine months to date. SYSCO has a long history of performing well, not only during good economic cycles but in difficult ones. We’ve been steadily taking share from our competitors and I expect us to continue to do so in the future.  We now have time for Q&A, but before we begin, let me note that I’ll be here for the initial portion of the Q&A and then we’ll need to depart at about 10:45 Eastern Time for a financial conference in New York, so Ken and Bill will moderate the Q&A after that. With that operator, we’ll now take questions.
Operator:  (Operator instructions) And we will take our first question from John Heinbockel at Goldman Sachs.
John Heinbockel – Goldman Sachs: A couple of things, you talked about March being tough, have you seen a bounce back in April and along with that, do you think or how do you get your arms around the possible benefit you’ll get from the tax checks flowing through your customers to you. So I mean are we sort of in a period here where things are going to get better for a while and then maybe double dip, or what’s your take on top line?
Rick Schnieders:  Good morning John, well the first thing I would say is it’s probably too early to be confident about what the fourth quarter looks like. You know I’m just going to kind of reiterate it, we’re comfortable with our long term financial objectives. In regard to the tax checks, I mean it’s sort of absolute speculation, anybody’s guess at that point. We would be happy to see a bump in the marketplace. But probably difficult to determine what $500-$600 will mean to the average.
John Heinbockel – Goldman Sachs: As you guys look at your information, do you think, because obviously there’s been sort of a downward trend on what appears to be real growth or unit growth and I know there’s a lot of things in there. But have we seen any clear signs there, any stabilization, things getting better or it’s still too tough to tell?
Rick Schnieders:  I don’t think we have any clear signs of that right now John. You know this is a very volatile environment. But again I guess that I would just say again that we’re confident about our position in the marketplace. We do well during difficult times and you know we’re just so well positioned in the way the company is organized and the way it’s performing today that we’re good with whatever comes down the pike at us.
John Heinbockel – Goldman Sachs: Secondly, you know you guys have done a very good job on the expense side, maybe talk a little bit about what you can do differently going into the new year to maybe lower the rate of growth in SG&A dollars further, if that can be done. Just on the case that maybe gross profit dollars do come down a little further.
Rick Schnieders:  I’ll start and then I’ll ask Ken to jump in, or Bill or anyone else to jump in. But you know I guess broadly what I would say is that we are carefully watching every nickel that we spend. And we’re just being very diligent about anything that, paperclips to trucks at this point, so I think that message has gone through the entire organization, I think if you’ve gone to the operating companies and we have one of the proper planning process right now, you see a real heightened awareness in terms of where we are, where we are in a macroeconomic environment and what they need to do to control their expenses.
Ken Spitler:  John, this is Ken, our process kind of remains the same. We go through, and our first level of management of expenses are those things that we feel that don’t affect our people. We have yet to get deep into the personnel side, so those things that we’ve reduced so far have been areas that we felt were a little fluffy if you will, things like conferences and those kind of costs. So that was our first wave. Second wave begins to be if we still see weakness and still see a gross profit dollar slip would be in the area of headcount.
John Heinbockel – Goldman Sachs: Alright then finally inventories look to be up about 10% or so, was any of that forward buy product and if so do you think that increases going forward?
Bill DeLaney:  I’ll take that one John, its Bill, inventories were up about, with sales growth, we didn’t, I don’t think we reduced inventory days, I don’t think they were up materially this quarter. We’ve got some work to do there, I wouldn’t overplay any forward buy side of it.  I think the bottom line is we’ve got a lot of investment in some of these initiatives and we’re continuing to learn as we go and to Ken’s point, that’s all part of this process we’re going through right now, both here at corporate and on the operating companies that we’re taking a hard look at all of our asset management opportunities and inventory is at the top of that list. Actually, receivables came down a couple tenths of a day I think, year over year, so we made some decent strides there in what’s a fairly tough market.
John Heinbockel – Goldman Sachs: Okay, thanks.
Operator:  We’ll take our next question from Meredith Adler at Lehman Brothers.
Meredith Adler – Lehman Brothers: Hey guys. A couple of questions. Could you talk a little bit about fuel surcharges and obviously you have surcharges in most of your contracts, but are you able to pass any of that along to the independent customer or I don’t know if you’re even trying very hard to do that.
Rick Schnieders:  Yeah, we certainly for years have had surcharges on, or the ability to put surcharges on for our contract customers. We do have modest fuel surcharges for independent customers across the system today and we review that on a regular basis as the fuel costs go up, the fuel surcharges go up. As the fuel costs come down, fuel surcharges come down also. And that’s both in the case of independents and contract customers.
Meredith Adler – Lehman Brothers: And what are you seeing in terms of the competition, are they also pushing through fuel surcharges and do you think they’re also pushing hard on the cost of product?
Rick Schnieders:  Sure, absolutely. We do know that many of our competitors, if not most of our competitors have fuel surcharges across the board. So you know we think that it’s just the right thing to do in this environment. If we can convince our customers to buy more product from us, and that’s certainly our goal, then we lower that cost per case related to that fuel surcharge. So our kind of sales story there and it’s the right one is that the more cases you buy from us, the lower the cost per chase related to that fuel surcharge.
Meredith Adler – Lehman Brothers: Got it. And then I was wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit about what you’re seeing in terms of the regional wholesale competitors. Is there any sense that they are looking to sellout, more actively than they were a couple years ago?
Rick Schnieders:  Well it depends on how you would define the regionals. There are some very large regionals, three or four very large regionals, we have no indication of their interest. However, again more broadly, we have a lot of activity going on related to potential acquisitions. As we’ve talked about it’s very, very difficult out there right now and an individual independent distributor’s ability to sort of leverage the costs the way we do across the system, it’s just very difficult and I think that there’s a willingness now on the part of some of owners to monetize their business.
Meredith Adler – Lehman Brothers: And my final question is just about receivables. I noticed that bad debt as a percentage of total receivables went up a little bit. Is that, I know you guys talk about not taking credits or offering credit I should say. Are you seeing any issues in terms of your customer’s ability to pay you?
Rick Schnieders:  Meredith, no, we’ll take a closer look at that. I don’t actually think our write offs or anything like that are up at all as a percent of sales, but we’ll look at that a little bit closer. Where I would characterize where we are in receivables right now is pretty much where we are in terms of the business climate. I mean it’s a little early to fully evaluate that. When you have large customers, you know you always have situations that you have to deal with. But just form a cultural standpoint, we manage credit locally at our op co’s as well as here at corporate on the large accounts.  And to the best of our ability, we don’t sell credit, so we will work with customers obviously, when you get into situations and we know them well and we have some parameters around whatever might be the work out agreement or something like that. But so far we haven’t seen any major problems but we are keenly watching that and managing that at all levels because clearly in times like this, there will be some situations that we’ll have to deal with.
Meredith Adler – Lehman Brothers: Great, I did look at it as a percentage of the receivable balance, not as a percentage of sales. Thanks.
Rick Schnieders:  Okay, alright, because actually I think our days are down a couple tenths of a day and so we’re actually pleased with that.
Meredith Adler – Lehman Brothers: Great, thank you very much.
Operator:  And we’ll take our next question from Greg Badishkanian at Citigroup.
Greg Badishkanian – Citigroup: Yeah, great, thanks. In terms of looking at food inflation, would you say that that had probably a net neutral impact on EBIT dollars and then also you know just looking at your independent customers, how have they fared in terms of passing those prices onto their customers?
Rick Schnieders:  In terms of inflation, I think that we would say that it’s pretty well a net. So it helps us on the expense line and hurts us on the gross profit line. Any benefit that we see on the expense line is sheer productivity improvement thanks to the great work of our operating companies. And your question about the independents Greg?
Greg Badishkanian – Citigroup: Yeah, when you look at those, have they been doing a better or worse job lately in terms of passing on the price increases you’re sending to them, to their end customers?
Rick Schnieders:  I think in general they do a pretty good job of changing their menus and one of our responsibilities, at least as we see it, is to make sure that either through business reviews or communication directly from marketing associates that they’re adjusting the prices on their menus. And I feel quite good that that’s happening.
Ken Spitler:  Plus the fact that they’ve been in an inflationary period for a while, they’ve had to get better at it.
Bill DeLaney:  Greg, one thing, you’ll see in our release and as we speak here with the call that we talked a lot about growing gross profit dollars faster than expenses. Now that’s not exactly rocket science type of statements. The reason we do that is because, it’s really almost, it’s impossible to evaluate on each line the impact of inflation. To Rick’s point, we generally know it puts pressure on the gross profit line and it makes the expenses look a little better than they probably are.  So our focus here is on growing cases and managing our cost per case and really as long as we can grow that operating profit faster than our sales growth, we feel like we’re doing a pretty good job with the inflationary environment, which, as we’ve spoken to, has been with us now for a year.
Greg Badishkanian – Citigroup: You did a nice job on that this quarter. And looking at the pricing environment, you know you’ve got US food service, you’ve got performance food group, have you noticed any changes coming out in terms of some of the bigger players?
Ken Spitler:  No, really we haven’t. It’s just kind of business as usual. And PFG has yet to go through the process, I think the process is about to finish but it hasn’t finished yet.
Greg Badishkanian – Citigroup: Good, thank you, very helpful.
Operator:  And we’ll take our next question from Steve Chick at J.P. Morgan.
Steve Chick – J.P. Morgan: Hi, thanks. I guess first off, just wanted to follow up on the question kind of about sales trends. You know I guess post quarter end and how we should think about things? You mentioned Easter and the early Easter had an impact on March, you know have you see kind of a give back of that impact as your kind of post quarter end here?  And then related to that, your 7-9% organic sales growth guidance, you know given kind of the nominal top line comparisons are a little tough, should we kind of think about maybe being at the low end or below that in the short term and maybe gaining back into that range as we head into next year?
Rick Schnieders:  Well Steve, you know of course that we don’t give guidance. I will tell you however we’re glad to see the sunshine around most of the country. It was a pretty tough quarter in terms of the weather. So by and large, you know, I would say we feel comfortable about our ability to operate in this environment as well as more positive environments. And you know, too early to tell about the quarter as we’ve said earlier, but we think that those operating companies will respond appropriately and we stick by our longer term projections.
Steve Chick – J.P. Morgan: Okay, alright well that’s helpful. And then maybe for Bill, I know we’ll get the segment profit data when you file the Q, but obviously your operating expenses were pretty extraordinarily good this quarter, in fact they were down sequentially even with your coaly and your fuel hit, once we get the Q, I mean did you see segment margins that were up, for instance within the Broadline segment? Can you speak to that a little bit?
Bill DeLaney:  Steve, actually Ken alluded to it in his comments, so yeah on the Broadline sector in particular we saw some good operating leverage and we are pleased with that.
Steve Chick – J.P. Morgan: Okay and so these costs, the cost control initiatives, it sounds like you’re pretty comfortable if things remain tough. I mean growing SG&A well south of sales and even maybe lower than gross is sustainable at this point?
Ken Spitler:  Yes we can Steve.
Rick Schnieders:  That’s our total focus right now here Steve is to make the best out of the market that we’re in and grow the boxes and manage that cost per case.
Steve Chick – J.P. Morgan: Okay, alright, thanks. Two last ones if I could, one I wanted to confirm, Bill is FY09, is that a 53 week year?
Bill DeLaney:  I hope so.
Ken Spitler:  Or it’s a 54.
Steve Chick – J.P. Morgan: Okay.
Bill DeLaney:  Steve, it’s 52.
Steve Chick – J.P. Morgan: And then second related to your buyback, if I look at your share count and your buyback activity, it does look like for the quarter a lot of the buyback was completed in the first month through January with a lot less so done in the last two months, can you just remind me where your authorization is with your buyback and kind of what your view is on that as we go forward here.
Bill DeLaney:  Yeah we’ve got about 7 million [overlay] still authorized, so we’ve got plenty that’s authorized to take us through the balance of the fiscal year. And you’re right, if you look at the year we bought in a little heavier first part of the year and then last year you’ve got to be a little careful because we bought in heavy in the fourth quarter last year. So we’ll continue to evaluate that going forward.
Steve Chick – J.P. Morgan: Okay, good quarter guys, thanks.
Operator:  And we’ll take our next question from Jason Whitmer at Cleveland Research.
Jason Whitmer – Cleveland Research: Good morning. Rick can you give us a little update on what you’re thinking, independents versus chains, versus kind of the peer set out there and whether that’s unit growth, because it seems like the entire market is slowing down in unit growth or just overall performance within those existing four walls.  It does seem like the MA base sales mix is coming down a bit recently, I don’t know if that’s fully due to new customer wins or if there’s something else going on. You know some of the recent thoughts in terms of the health of the independent would be helpful.
Rick Schnieders:  Yeah I mean some of what you see right now is we do have as we’ve talked about before, you get the corporate multi-unit business in big chunks and we have been good enough, thanks to our sales efforts, to acquire some very substantial business over the last 12 months. On the other hand, I really feel, although as we’ve said probably enough at this point, it’s a very difficult environment. I feel that in general our independents are doing well.  It’s easier for them to make adjustments, obviously they don’t have to go through some corporate office bureaucracy to get price changes done. They can do that on the fly virtually, we see a lot of that taking place right now. We’re helping our customers with substitution of items on their menus, with redoing their menus, doing that by the hundreds, literally. So you know, again, I hate to say it again, it’s a difficult environment. In that environment I think the independents, most of the independents are doing quite well.
Jason Whitmer – Cleveland Research: And you mentioned earlier that you’re steadily taking share, certainly it’s visible in this environment, but how would you prioritize your objectives to take share in a faster clip as you look out over the next five year’s whether it’s pushing through this environment or coming up with other, getting some more payback from your initiatives, what is your thought process on how you can really go to market in a little stronger fashion and take share at a better clip?
Rick Schnieders:  Well I mean it’s a delicate balance. We are going to protect our earnings but you know we’re looking at more granularly at every marketplace, every customer to see where we can gain share, whether that’s share of wallet in an individual customer, whether that’s a broader market share. So we’re very focused on that and everything that we’re doing, I mean frankly, is focused on the customer and our ability to better serve those customers. So you know, we’re confident we will continue to take share at increasing rates.
Jason Whitmer – Cleveland Research: And do you think the core top line catalysts of today, the business reviews or even just adding sales reps, maybe Bill you can provide an update on where we’re at with that, do you think that’s going to move into, the actual traction of that in this environment is it accelerated as maybe peers can’t keep pace with that?
Ken Spitler:  I don’t know what our peers are doing, but we actually have a concentrated effort on increasing our business review at this point going into next year as we see it is again integral in the way that we go to market. And you know we’re actually increasing those folks faster than we increase our marketing associates because, in particular in this environment, we see that as helpful to our customers. And when it’s helpful to our customers, it’s good for us.
Jason Whitmer – Cleveland Research: Great, that’s helpful, thank you.
Operator:  We’ll take our next question from Ajay Jain with UBS.
Ajay Jain – UBS: Hi, thanks, most of my questions have been asked already. You know I remember last year around this time you guys had some comment about the outlook for bonus accruals which get paid out in the fourth quarter. And I know there was some specific metrics that were used in determination for the yearend bonus payments, but is there anything of significance in terms of how favorable or unfavorable things are shaping up as you look at the year over year comparisons on bonuses specifically.
Rick Schnieders:  No, Ajay, there’s nothing meaningful there or we’d be telling you about it. Last year was an unusual situation where the year before we hadn’t paid out bonuses, so we’re going from zero to a much larger number, so that’s not a big issue looking forward.
Ajay Jain – UBS: Okay and in relation to Ken’s prepared comments earlier on the second RDC coming on line and now that it’s partly operational and shipping to five op co’s, is it possible to quantify the startup costs? And maybe any additional depreciation expense for that facility? I’m just trying to figure out if the incremental impact on the P&L is going to be significant over the next couple of quarters.
Bill DeLaney: I’ll comment on Ken’s comments. No, we’re not going to be able to quantify for you the impact, but what we were trying to tell you there, which I’m sure you already understand is anytime you startup something of that magnitude, there will be some short term cost pressures and that will have some impact on our earnings, but nothing overly significant, so just trying to balance the message here looking forward.  So we’ve got a lot of good things going on, we’re excited about what we’re doing in Florida, it’s coming on faster than the other one, but just trying to manage expectations here a little bit and really over time just trying to get folks to understand that the way we manage our business, we don’t do weekly reviews of every SBI, we do weekly reviews of how well we’re running the business and that’s one of the many things that we’re managing right now.
Ken Spitler:  Of course we have to ramp the people up before we ramp the cases up and therein lies the cost.
Ajay Jain – UBS: Okay but relative to your internal budgeting, have there been any cost overruns?
Ken Spitler:  No.
Ajay Jain – UBS: Okay.
Rick Schnieders:  Frankly Ajay it’s going very well, very smooth and we’re shipping groceries.
Ajay Jain – UBS: Okay and just one last question, with last week’s news on Wendy’s, can you confirm whether you’ve had any kind of conversations with the new owners and if you think there are any implications for your Wendy’s and SYGMA business in general?
Ken Spitler:  The new owners are our customer also. So we do business with Triac, with the Arby’s business in several locations. So we have what we feel like is a pretty good relationship with them. So we don’t see any changes coming there.
Ajay Jain – UBS: Okay, great, thank you.
Operator:  And we’ll take our next question from Bob Cummins at Shields & Co.
Bob Cummins – Shields & Co.: Great, thank you, good morning everybody. Looking at your numbers, your sales growth was 6.7% and your food inflation was 6.2%, so it’s clear that real volume growth was on the minimal side. But I’m just wondering if you have a sense for how much, I assume that your industry in general is probably down from last year in real terms, but I wondered if you have a sense for how much the restaurant and food service industry in general, how it might be comparing with prior year results?
Rick Schnieders:  Bob, depends on what you look at. But we’re estimating by triangulating some of the data that we get, maybe a little over 2% negative right now.
Bob Cummins – Shields & Co.: In real terms?
Ken Spitler:  Yeah, that’s the number that we’re using.
Bob Cummins – Shields & Co.: Okay, great, that’s very helpful, thank you.
Operator:  And we’ll go next to Westcott Rochette at Bear Stearns.
Westcott Rochette – Bear Stearns:  Thanks guys. Just looking at your segment results, looking at first SYGMA. SYGMA seemed to accelerate a little bit which would be inconsistent with Wendy’s performance which is one of your bigger customers there. Was anything going on in that division in terms of contract wins that would help explain the pickup in that segment?
Ken Spitler:  Yeah I can answer that. We have been working really hard in there, we had a couple of operating units that were negative. We’ve turned one of those north and we’re working hard on the other one in a positive way. We are getting a new customer, we’re not ready to announce, that will help. But you know we’re bouncing off the bottom there.
Westcott Rochette – Bear Stearns:  Okay. And then moving down looking at the other line which has moved relatively flat, would part of that be just due to economic pressures of your customers kind of pulling back on some of the specialty meats and trying to maybe trade down in terms of their product. I know your Broadline is not buying as much.
Ken Spitler:  We’re having some difficulties in the meat companies. Some of that is market generated, meaning the price of beef. We’re seeing some improvements in that now but it’s been a very difficult quarter for us in the meat companies.
Westcott Rochette – Bear Stearns:  Has there been any evidence of your restaurants trading down to lower priced meats, trying to do what they can to bring their menu costs down?
Ken Spitler:  Yeah, we’re seeing some of that, but that’s not our issue there.
Westcott Rochette – Bear Stearns:  Okay.
Ken Spitler:  Performance. 
Westcott Rochette – Bear Stearns:  Alright and then lastly, thinking about your cost initiatives with your vendors in terms of your purchase initiatives, with vendors getting kind of squeezed by inflation themselves, have they been more or less receptive to your continued consolidation in terms of better pricing for you and your supply chain initiative and your purchase initiatives?
Ken Spitler:  I’ll let Mr. Pulliam answer that, he’s here with us.
Larry Pulliam:  I would say we’ve seen a little change there. You know our initiatives are actually committing volume to those suppliers and helping them to take costs out of their system which you know provides us with a lower cost. So generally have a good feel about where we’re going with sourcing.
Westcott Rochette – Bear Stearns:  Can you just give broad up data of where you’re progressing on that or where you are? In terms of, have you rolled out [overlay].
Larry Pulliam:  We’re [overlay].
Westcott Rochette – Bear Stearns:  Okay. Well good quarter, thanks guys.
Operator:  (Operator instructions) We’ll go next to Andrew Wolf at BB&T Capital Markets.
Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets: Hi, good morning. Congratulations for managing so well in this environment. A few follow ups, some of the things that were said. Ken when you said the Southwest was doing well, it could be anywhere from California to Texas, is it that broad or is it more traditional Southwest, Arizona.
Ken Spitler:  It’s more traditional Southwest. You know California has traditionally been like, really powerful for us but it’s not as good as it has been. So the strength is really in the traditional Southwest.
Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets: And on Florida and the weakness there, I always thought that with Easter came families, vacationing and spring break. And there’s obviously a regional issue with housing, but are you saying that what happened really was folks actually went east and cut their winter breaks short? Can you just sort of help me understand that?
Ken Spitler:  Yup, left early.
Bill DeLaney:  The season ended early.
Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets: And that more than offset any benefit that might have happened from the other way around.
Ken Spitler:  There’s just weakness there anyway and then compounded by the fact that they left early created a not good situation in Florida for us.
Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets: Okay on the RDC, I understand you don’t want to be that specific in the guidance but I mean I think it’s fair to say it’s not going to be anything close to what Front Royal was.
Ken Spitler:  No. Not at all.
Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets: And would you say in terms of how long it, not just in quantity, dollars, but also in terms of how long, length of time, the drag work would occur.
Ken Spitler:  That’s going to be a lot faster. We’re already seeing that.
Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets: And you also mentioned you know that the dollar expense swing from fuel is going to double from $12 million to $20-$25 million, now is that a gross number before you can recoup some of that or is that just net of?
Ken Spitler:  It is a gross number.
Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets: Okay and what’s been the experience in terms of how much you can recoup when it goes up that quickly?
Bill DeLaney:  It’s been relatively modest so far. I mean as was pointed out earlier, we’ve got contracts with our larger customers but it’s, we’ll update you in the Q as that becomes a more meaningful number.
Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets: Okay. And your business in Canada, you said the business is running down 2%, is that sort of the US or is that kind of North America, including Canada? And also the exchange rate in Canada has been very favorable, could you help us quantify in any way how that might have affected your quarter.
Ken Spitler:  The rate or the business?
Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets: Well that was a two part question, one business and one financial.
Ken Spitler:  The business is about the same in the US as it is in Canada. The rate I believe is neutral, isn’t it? Favorable?
Bill DeLaney:  It’s not a big number, it’s slightly favorable.
Rick Schnieders:  It’s not material but it is slightly favorable. I just want to be clear, just so we’re clear, the 2% down is kind of our view of what the overall US market for food service, for our business is right now.
Ken Spitler:  We’re seeing about the same in Canada.
Rick Schnieders:  I think the only difference we’re seeing in Canada is the inflation is not quite as high in Canada as what we’re seeing here.
Bill DeLaney:  And Canada is doing very well, I mean they’re operating very well.
Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets: And lastly, Rick, I’m glad you’re still there, on the market share side, kind of sounds to me as if given what’s going on in the market, you guys can win through attrition and just letting a lot of the capacity go away either through acquisition or just outright failure, more so than having to be proactive by adding, going to price or something, is that sort of the game plan if you will?
Rick Schnieders:  Yeah, I think that’s right and I think acquisition and attrition in the marketplace is a good strategy for us rather than to sacrifice price in any big way.
Bill DeLaney:  I think it’d be fair to say, we’re a lot more focused on our customers than worrying about what the competitors are doing right now. If we can keep our customers moving forward or at least holding ground in this type of environment then we’re going to be in good shape.
Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets: Thank you.
Rick Schnieders:  Andy you said you’re glad I’m here, I’m not glad I’m here, my flights been delayed.
Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets: I guess that’s another function of the weather or the airline industry, anyway, thanks and congrats on the quarter.
Operator:  And we’ll take our next question from Alec Patterson at RCM.
Alec Patterson – RCM: Good morning. I may have missed it, did you guys have any M&A impact on sales?
Bill DeLaney:  Nothing significant.
Alec Patterson – RCM: Okay. And also just the COGS inflation number you guys put out, I forget, is that inclusive or exclusive of the sourcing program. In other words, is that unique to you or is that kind of an industry trend across your product categories?
Bill DeLaney:  It’s our best measure of our product cost and it would include sourcing which is relatively de minimus right now in the overall mathematical part of it.
Alec Patterson – RCM: Okay I thought you were running close to about 5% of COGS that was under the program.
Bill DeLaney:  I say de minimus, that means 95% of it isn’t. So it’s not really driving the number I guess what I’m trying to say.
Rick Schnieders:  It may be contributing but not driving the number.
Alec Patterson – RCM: Okay, fair enough. And then on the shipping and handling trends for the year, excluding fuel, I know you’ve got the mileage programs and other things going, how is that trending maybe as a percent of sales or any sort of indicator that we could get on that.
Rick Schnieders:  Alec are you talking about the kind of XY routing and how we’re getting efficient routing of trucks?
Alec Patterson – RCM: Yeah in terms of how it boils down to that shipping and handling number excluding the fuel component.
Rick Schnieders:  Just broadly if you took the fuel out, the shipping and handling, our warehousing and delivery would be showing slight improvements. You know we’re very pleased with the productivity improvements that we’re seeing in the warehouse and delivery.
Bill DeLaney:  Miles are down. And to Rick’s point, we’re doing a nice job in warehouse right now.
Alec Patterson – RCM: So if your real growth is just a little bit more than flat, then I would assume shipping and handling ex fuel is flat to down?
Ken Spitler:  It’s down.
Alec Patterson – RCM: It’s down. With a capital D?
Rick Schnieders:  D-O-W-N, how’s that work?
Alec Patterson – RCM: Okay, fair enough, thanks very much.
Operator:  Our next question is a follow up from Meredith Adler at Lehman Brothers.
Meredith Adler – Lehman Brothers: Thanks. I think we’ve asked questions about the ability of your customers to pass along the higher costs. But are you, I mean you kind of answered the question that the industry volume is down about 2%. Is the message coming from customers that there is a fair amount of pushback from their consumers in terms of the higher prices or just because of the economy and fuel prices?
Rick Schnieders:  I think it’s more, I don’t know that it’s a factor of pricing going up on menus, I think it’s more a factor of the cost of fuel and disposable income.
Meredith Adler – Lehman Brothers: Okay and then I just want to follow up on the question about the RDC, I understand you don’t want to quantify the cost, I think you said it’s not huge, will it continue into the fourth quarter and then actually you said you had five op co’s up and running, what is the, for that region, how many op co’s will you get to eventually?
Rick Schnieders:  Five is the number for that RDC. We’re shipping them all, we’re shipping them all everyday right now.
Ken Spitler:  And that’s really just different from the way we ramped the other one where we started with one op co and one product zone and then the next zone and the next op co. So we just ramped everybody up at the same time.
Meredith Adler – Lehman Brothers: Okay and the costs will continue in the fourth quarter?
Rick Schnieders:  That’s what we were speaking to Meredith, our fourth quarter and probably even a little in the first quarter of the new year.
Meredith Adler – Lehman Brothers: Okay and then just along with that, you should be working on the next RDC, is that right, can you give us an update?
Ken Spitler:  Yeah but we have it designed, it’s done. We haven’t decided when we’re going to start it up yet.
Meredith Adler – Lehman Brothers: Okay and do you have a location though, is that right?
Ken Spitler:  Yes we do in Indiana.
Meredith Adler – Lehman Brothers: Okay, great, but you haven’t started construction yet?
Ken Spitler:  No.
Meredith Adler – Lehman Brothers: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator:  And we will take our final question as a follow up from Steve Chick from J.P. Morgan.
Steve Chick – J.P. Morgan: Thanks. Just on the targeted increase in your sales contact personnel, Ken sometimes you give us the number on what it was for the quarter. And if you kind of still are on track for a 4% increase or if actually that might be a place where maybe you could save some costs?
Ken Spitler:  Well we’re not looking to save any costs there, that’s not our program. Again we’ve had more, it’s flat right now, third quarter, typically in the fourth quarter is where we start brining on the marketing associate training classes. But right now we’re behind pace on that 4%, not as a, lay up on our business review folks.
Steve Chick – J.P. Morgan: Okay and I’m sorry when you said it was flat for the quarter, is that kind of, flat year over year?
Ken Spitler:  Uh huh.
Steve Chick – J.P. Morgan: Okay and it was up if I remember 4.5% in the first half [overlay]?
Ken Spitler:  [Unintelligible].
Steve Chick – J.P. Morgan: Okay, thank you.
Operator:  And with no further [overlay].
Ken Spitler:  But we’re up on total contact, we’re just flat on MAs, just a clarification.
Rick Schnieders:  Steve one of the reasons we kind of backed off on that level of disclosures, you know to Ken’s point, it’ll move around from quarter to quarter, it’s very much market specific. I mean what you’re going to do in a Carolina type of market and what you might do in the Midwest in terms of the rate of growth would be different. So we understand the importance of growing our customer contact people and we’ll continue to do that.
Steve Chick – J.P. Morgan: Okay, thanks.
Operator:  And with no further questions left in the queue I’d like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Schnieders for any additional or closing remarks.
Rick Schnieders:  Yeah I’m pleased to still be here and to be able to say thank you to all of our operating company folks out there. We’re pleased with our performance and we could not obviously have done that without great follow through at the operating companies and all of our 50,000 associates. So thanks to them and thanks to all of you who have participated in the call today. Have a good day.
Operator:  This does conclude today’s presentation, we thank everyone for their participation, you may disconnect your lines at any time.

Operator: Good day everyone, and welcome to today’s Sysco Corporation’s second quarter fiscal 2008 earnings conference call. As a reminder, today’s call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Neal Russell, Assistant Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Neal Russell: Thank you, Tony, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for Sysco’s second quarter fiscal 2008 conference call. On today’s call you will hear from Rick Schnieders, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Ken Spitler, our President and Chief Operating Officer, and Bill DeLaney, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  Before we begin, please note that statements made in the course of this presentation that state the company’s or management’s intentions, hopes, beliefs, expectations, or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and actual results could differ in a material manner. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ in a material manner from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company’s SEC filings including but not limited to risk factors contained in the company’s annual report on form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2007 and the company’s press release issued this morning. Please understand that all comparisons given during the call refer to changes between the second quarter of fiscal 2008 and the second quarter of fiscal 2007 unless otherwise noted. Also, all comments about earnings per share refer to diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. With that out of the way, I’ll turn it over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rick Schnieders.
Richard J. Schnieders: Thank you, Neal. Overall I’m once again pleased with our results. Growing sales by nearly 8% and earnings per share by approximately 10% in the second quarter. Notwithstanding the challenging economic conditions we continue to gain market share by helping our customers achieve their business objectives and improve our profitability b y leveraging our sales growth. We are executing well and re-investing in our business. Challenging times have always provided opportunities for Sysco to further differentiate ourselves in the marketplace because our customers increasingly look to us for support and business solutions. As the industry leader, we have an unsurpassed ability to leverage our size and scale to benefit our customers. Over the past few years we’ve continued to stratify our customer base resulting in quality relationships with superior customers. The diversification and quality of our customers allow Sysco to participate in a full range of business by limiting exposure to any given segment. Specifically, one-third of our business comes from outside the restaurant industry, such as hospitals, nursing homes, and schools, that are not directly core related to discretionary consumer spending.  For the past several months, our industry has experienced various macroeconomic pressures such as high inflation and fuel costs that restrict growth; however, we have dedicated associates focused on helping our customers succeed which we expect will continue to benefit us over the long term. Sysco continues to grow faster than the industry and our pursuit of productivity gains should allow us to mitigate the impact of some of these pressures over time. Now I’ll turn things over to Ken so he can explain how we execute this plan and how we performed in the second quarter.
Kenneth F. Spitler: Thanks, Rick. Our performance in the second quarter met our expectations as sales grew nearly 8% and as Rick stated continued to outpace industry growth, demonstrating our ability to gain market share. In addition, we were able to grow earnings per share about 10% in the quarter. Inflation as measured by our internal measure of product cost inflation remained high, averaging about 5.9 for the quarter. Inflation from dairy products had the largest impact, with the balance spread across several categories. Although we don’t forecast inflation, we anticipate product costs to remain high over the balance of the fiscal year. Our operating companies manage their business well with gross profit dollars growing faster than expenses excluding the impact of two items that Bill will discuss later. Business reviews in hiring additional customer contact personnel continue to be very effective in allowing us to help our customers manage their business. Business reviews, for example, can help our customers succeed in a market that isn’t growing by, among other things, exposing them to Sysco’s broad range of product and service offerings. As part of the review, we typically identify opportunities for the customer to improve their profitability which strengthens our relationship further. Business reviews also allow us to attract new business and importantly avoid lost sales.  As we said before, conducting quality business reviews is embedded in how we go to market. Regarding cost management, we made additional progress during the quarter in rolling out productivity-enhancing initiatives that contribute to increased profitability as they become fully implemented. In certain instances such as designated delivery days and XY routing initiatives which are designed to reduce miles driven, improved productivity helps offset external cost pressures that we cannot control such as higher fuel prices.  While we are making good progress on managing miles driven, fuel expenses will unfavorably impact our financial results over the balance of the year. We estimate fuel costs will negatively impact year-over-year earnings by approximately $0.03 to $0.04 in the final two quarters of physical 2008. Our estimate is based upon both current spot prices for diesel and the cost of a forward contract we recently entered into for about 35% to 40% of our total fuel needs through June. Fuel expense was about $0.01 in the first half of the physical year compared to the prior year. As we’ve benefited from a forward purchase expired in December. In summary, we had another solid quarter from an operational and financial standpoint. I’d like to thank the entire Sysco team for their leadership and hard work. Now Bill will review the financial results. 
William J. DeLaney, III: Thanks, Ken. As Rick and Ken just said, we had a solid second quarter. There are a few items regarding our second quarter financial results, however, that merit further clarification and which I would like to discuss. First, from our improved governance, and as we communicated last quarter, we moved to [grant eight] for incentive stock options to the second quarter this year, resulting in approximately $5.6 million of incremental expense in the second quarter. Second, operating expenses for the quarter include an unfavorable year-over-year comparison of $11.9 million related to our investments and company-owned life insurance. The underlying value of these policies will continue to be impacted by any volatility in our financial markets.  For the first half of fiscal 2008, sales grew 8%, operating income leveraged nearly 3 points to 11%, and earnings per share grew 13%. These results reflect our ability to grow gross profit dollars faster than operating expenses. Our financial results do include some significant fluctuations in both the first and second quarter on certain expense items including share-based compensation, company-owned life insurance, and multi-employer pension plans; however, these fluctuations in the aggregate offset any year to date basis. The key point that I’d like to make here is that our solid growth and profitability is primarily a result of disciplined execution at our operating companies. As we begin the second half of fiscal 2008m, we are focused on continuing to increase our market share and improving productivity throughout the company by executing best business practices and carrying our strategic business initiatives. Prevailing economic and market conditions require such focus if we are to achieve our business objectives.  In summary, we are pleased with our overall performance for the first half of fiscal 2008. Looking forward we see significant opportunities both to grow our share of market and improve productivity. While we do not underestimate the challenges that lie ahead, we have tremendous talent throughout Sysco and we are committed to achieving our business objectives.  With that, the Operator will now take questions.
Operator:   Today’s question and answer session is held electronically. (Operator Instructions) We will go first to Steve Chick at J.P. Morgan.
Steve Chick - J.P. Morgan : I guess a couple questions. Rick, I was wondering if you could comment on how sales trended during the quarter. It looks like it slowed a little from last quarter. That might have been in the Sigma segment more than anything else. If you could, given the environment, I was hoping you could comment on kind of what you’ve seen post quarter end now that you have a month or so under your belt.
Richard J. Schnieders: Sure thing, Steve. In fact, we saw pretty even results in the quarter. If there was anything that impacted the quarter, and this is not to whine, but we did have some weather-related impact in the second quarter. We had broad snow and storms across Oklahoma and the Midwest and the Northeast so I think that’s probably, if there was any slight degradation in the rate of sales growth, it was mostly related to that. I will tell you that for the first three weeks of the year that we’ve seen, the first three weeks of the calendar year, the first three weeks of the third quarter, that we’ve seen very similar sales trends. We don’t see any reason to suspect that the sales rates will get slower so right now it is important to remember that March makes our quarter but on a comparison basis January and February are our slowest two months of the year but again on a comparative basis, we feel pretty good about what we see right now. 
William J. DeLaney, III : Steve, this is Bill, just to confirm what you alluded there, the broad line sales growth was pretty much the same both in the first and second quarter. 
Steve Chick - J.P. Morgan : Great. Thanks, that’s helpful commentary. Second, I was wondering if you could comment on the landscape a little bit, I guess in terms of competition and maybe specifically what you’re seeing out of US food service. I think the last call you had mentioned some activity in Cincinnati and closing of maybe one of their operating companies there. Any updates on what you’re seeing out of them?
Kenneth F. Spitler : Steve, this is Ken. We’ve had some rumors of some two more closings. Right at this moment I can’t remember which ones they were but as far as activity, the same report as last time, really no change. 
Steve Chick - J.P. Morgan : Okay and separately, in your announcement of Rick, a new board member addition I think within the last month or so, you had some specific language mentioned about your focus on international opportunities and how that would help and it seems to me like you guys progressively get just a little more open minded about expanding internationally and I was actually wondering if you could just speak to that a little bit.
Richard J. Schnieders : We’ve never been accused of being open-minded herein the food business here, Steve, but we’re definitely kind of exploring the landscape outside the US and Canada. We feel good about the opportunities, particularly in certain parts of the globe, the growth opportunities, and we think that that’s long term a huge opportunity for us. Having said that, we, as we have in the past, would be very cautious and move with care but we are definitely exploring the landscape out there as you said. We’re pleased to have Dr. Koerber on the board, I’ve known him for about 10 years. He’s a terrific executive and will provide a level of strategic insights that will be beneficial to the entire board and to Sysco.
Steve Chick - J.P. Morgan : Okay, thanks and just last, Ken, the $0.03 to $0.04 of additional fuel costs in the second half, are we okay in thinking about that kind of evenly in the third quarter and the fourth?
Kenneth F. Spitler : Yes. 
Steve Chick - J.P. Morgan : Okay, thank you.
Operator: We’ll go next to John Heinbockel with Goldman Sachs.
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs : Rick, a couple of things. Business reviews, what type of lift are you getting in this environment compared to maybe a year ago or 18months ago? Same kind of lift, better, worse? Where do we stand with that? 
Richard J. Schnieders : I think it’s about the same. I mean, it continues to drive lots of sales growth for us. The relationships we build with the customers that go through business reviews is superb. As we’ve mentioned before, one of the ancillary benefits although important benefits is that our [churn] of those customers that have gone through a business review is very, very low, so it’s a relationship building opportunity for us. So we continue to do more and more of them. The operating companies are very committed to business reviews. Many operating companies today have two kitchens, two businesses, so there’s a real commitment on the part of our operating companies and it is producing significant results for us.
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs : Secondly, bring us up to date on centralized procurement, where we are in terms of items, categories, dollars, and how that’ll play out as we head towards fiscal ’09?
Richard J. Schnieders : I don’t know that we have any projections in fiscal ’09 but right now in terms of our categories and the dollars that we have targeted, we are right on track to have that done by the end of fiscal ’08 and then moving into ’09, but we don’t have the next phase 3 or 4. I don’t know what the specific numbers are but we’re on track, John.
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs : What’s the timing for phase 3?
Richard J. Schnieders : This fiscal year.
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs : The next phase then. Is that a fiscal ’09 initiative?
Richard J. Schnieders : Sure.
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs : And are we seeing in your gross margin numbers today, we are seeing a very clear benefit from centralized procurement that’s offsetting inflation or we’re not seeing that much yet?
Richard J. Schnieders : Again with our business, there’s so many moving parts that it’s very difficult to determine where it’s showing up and I guess that I for one at least am comfortable that it’s helping mitigate some of the impacts of inflation, but to draw one on one bead on it, to say that this particular item has helped us this much would be very difficult to do, John.
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs : Okay. Then finally, is there any update on the IRS situation or that’s just kind of out there, likely to be resolved later this year?
Kenneth F. Spitler : John, we’re still in that early phase I guess you’d call it of the appeals process. We do have some meetings coming up later in the quarter and I think probably the next time we’ll talk on this call we’ll have a better handle on the timeline but I still think we’re looking at about a 12 month period minimum to resolve this.
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs : 12 months from now?
Kenneth F. Spitler : Give or take. Yeah, I think we will have a little better information next time we talk.
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs : Okay, thanks.
Operator: We will go next to Greg Badishkanian at Citigroup.
Gregory Badishkanian - Citigroup : Great, thank you. First question is when you look at your real sales growth and overall sales growth, how do you think that compares to the industry and you mentioned that January seemed to be kind of consistent with the last quarter that you just reported so why do you think you’re able to kind of have pretty steady decent type of real sales growth in what seems like a pretty tough macro environment?
Richard J. Schnieders : I think it is a tough macro environment, Greg, and the broader numbers that we look at for instance, I think you nailed it, we look at [Net Trac] and we see a pretty challenging environment at least in those public casual chains, so we use that as a proxy for the industry. We feel good about our ability to outgrow the industry. We’re continuing to take share from our competition. So again without being exuberant about our enthusiasm or being too enthusiastic we feel good about the direction we’re headed and our ability to take business and I’ll let Ken kind of pick up on that.
Kenneth F. Spitler : We kind of manage our sales growth in a particular way that we’ve put in place about 4 years ago and that is that we try to gain a certain percentage of new sales and we do that by every year growing our sales force which we have by argument’s sake I guess twice the size of our next biggest competitor and we manage lost sales and penetration and we do both of those through our business review, business development process where we control the amount of business that we lose on an annual basis and we continue to grow and measure that growth in our customers. So years back we put in this sales management concept that we think is paying off for us today in a very tough environment and will continue to pay off for us as we go forward.
Gregory Badishkanian - Citigroup : Do you feel that you’re getting greater penetration with your customers or would it be that your customers look at the last quarter or two are just taking share versus their respective competitors?
Kenneth F. Spitler : By measurement we’re gaining in penetration. We measure each and every one of our customers so we know we’re gaining.
Gregory Badishkanian - Citigroup : Thank you very much.
Operator: We go next to Ajay Jain at UBS.
Ajay Jain - UBS Securities LLC : I just had one quick question for Bill DeLaney on operating expenses. For stock compensation I know that you had some calendar shifts based on the change on the grant date from Q1 to the second quarter but it seems like for the first half of the year overall the comparisons on options expense were still pretty favorable by about $11 million if I’m not mistaken so I’m just wondering how do you see the outlook for stock compensation in the back half of the year now that the comparisons seem to be a little more normalized? Is that something you feel like you have enough visibility on right now?
Richard J. Schnieders : Yeah, Ajay, I think we do. I think the point I was trying to make in my comments on the first half of the year is that you can see there on the funds flow statement that the stock comp is favorable as you pointed out by about $11 million I guess it is. There were other things offsetting that though, so when you look at our first 26 week numbers and you put aside some of the gains on property sales last year and the [call weed] thing this year which was favorable the first quarter a little bit unfavorable the second and then the stock comp bounced back and forth, if you just clear the deck with all that, pretty much the 26 weeks I think is a really good barometer for where we’re at. Now with that said, as we look at the second half of the year, the stock comp should be modestly favorable probably in the ballpark of what we saw the first half of the year. There’s still things that could impact that but that would be my best judgment right now and there’s a lot of moving parts as you can appreciate that can impact earnings a penny here or a penny there but that particular line we would expect that to be modest.
Ajay Jain - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, so the $10 million to $11 million for the first half that should be broadly representative?
Richard J. Schnieders : Yes.
Ajay Jain - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. 
Operator: We’ll go next to Meredith Adler at Lehman Brothers. 
Meredith Adler - Lehman Brothers : Hey guys. Couple of questions. It sounds like you’re beginning to be very active in managing your fuel costs but do you see any change in the outlook for having your customers pay you surcharges? Obviously some do already but is that becoming more common?
Richard J. Schnieders : I think it is becoming more common and we are certainly reviewing all of our options in terms of reflecting what’s going on in the fuel market today so fuel surcharges, we want to make sure we’re up to date on those, making sure we route those trucks more effectively than we ever have and we’re the operating companies are doing a terrific job in terms of getting more efficient at routing the trucks and putting more pieces on so we will absolutely continue to pursue all opportunities and options to mitigate that fuel cost.
Meredith Adler - Lehman Brothers : Okay and then could you talk a little bit about what you see happening with your customers with this very high food inflation? Are you seeing significant changes in their behavior? Are you hearing anecdotally the traffic is down because the cost of a meal has gone up a lot?
Richard J. Schnieders : I think we’re hearing that it’s soft out there. It’s very hard to translate anecdotal information. Again, one of the strongest proxies we get is the [Net Trac] we think is one of the strongest proxies so we use that as kind of a guide in terms of how well we’re doing versus the marketplace, but yes, there’s no question it’s a challenging environment out there and we feel very good about our performance in the second quarter and we feel good about our opportunity to continue to execute on business reviews and the other initiatives we’ve got out there and to achieve our midterm and longer term goals.
Meredith Adler - Lehman Brothers : Then I have a final question for Bill DeLaney. You mentioned multi-employer pension liabilities as being volatile in the first half. Could you just talk about what it did in the second quarter and also the first quarter?
William J. DeLaney, III : It really wasn’t a factor in the second quarter. We had a small gain last year and the plan wasn’t that material that we’re going against it but the bigger point I was trying to make, Meredith, is in the first quarter we had an unfavorable impact that we took a charge for a situation with one of our plans and I think it was about $9.5 million so basically it was more of a first quarter impact on the unfavorable side and slightly favorable second quarter so it’s just one of those line items that we’ve talked about here and there, but my point I really want to leave you with today is we’ll keep you posted on that, we’ll speak to it as it’s appropriate in the Q but when you put it all together for 26 weeks, that stuff all pretty much washes out.
Meredith Adler - Lehman Brothers : I assume it’s very difficult from what I know about multi-employer pension liabilities, it’s very difficult to forecast where they’re going to go.
William J. DeLaney, III : It is. We have several of them and some are in better shape than others in terms of funding so I can tell you we’re very acutely aware of where they are and we’re working through those as best we can. The bigger challenge is it’s very difficult as the participating employer a lot of the time to have much of an impact on decisions that get made in terms of how those plans are administered so it’s something that we have to deal with and we’re very focused on it.
Meredith Adler - Lehman Brothers : And I just have one final question back to Rick. I’ve been trying to understand what kind of behavior a restaurant would have as they see their sales flowing. Would it be fair to say that there would be a lag between the time that they would start to see traffic slow and when they would purchase less, because clearly they don’t want to be “out of stock” in any sort of important item that’s on their menu. Have you seen that with customers?
Richard J. Schnieders : Meredith, it would be a very short lag time. Their inventories are very slim. If you look down the supply chain, the greatest inventories are at the suppliers and that at the distributor level at Sysco and then finally at the customer end. It’s very short inventories, just a few days, so anything that happens in that restaurant is going to happen very, very quickly versus what’s going on in terms of their business itself, the patrons that they have coming through the door. 
Meredith Adler - Lehman Brothers : Okay, so if they’re seeing a slow down --
Kenneth F. Spitler : Meredith, we see them make immediate adjustments to their inventory almost on a daily basis so any lag you would see immediately.
Meredith Adler - Lehman Brothers : Okay. That’s very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Next to Westcott Rochette at Bear Stearns.
Westcott Rochette - Bear Stearns : Thanks a lot guys. If I could just have a moment to kind of talk about the balance sheet landscape for a lot of the independents in terms of how you manage your receivables as if we move into more of an economic slow down, whether you see an increase in restaurants running into some difficulties paying their bills, how you balance that extending credit versus not and just maybe reference back to maybe ’01 is not the best time frame but maybe even going back to ’90 or’91, how the pick up in potential bankruptcies or closings might have adjusted and how you managed through that.
Richard J. Schnieders : I will start Westcott and I guess the one comment I would make is kind of going back to the script and that is where we talked about the quality of our customer base today having improved over the years partly because of the way we segment them and stratify them and some of the difficult decisions we made in regard to not-so-profitable customers several years ago so we feel good about the quality of customers that we have as an organization and I guess the other thing that makes me feel good and I’m sure the rest of us here is that we have 8,000 or 9,000 marketing associates on the street every day sort of managing those restaurants and helping them with our receivables, helping them in helping us, and making sure that we keep those customers as current as possible so at this point in time I don’t think we would raise a red flag about deteriorating conditions or deteriorating pay rates.
William J. DeLaney, III : It’s very hard for us to tell in January as you typically see a little bit of slowing of payment but it’s been significant and I think your real question is how do we manage it if they start paying slower and we have very stringent credit policies that we maintain in almost any environment. It’s very difficult to make up once you write off a customer of that profit and so in a low margin business you have to be very tough on credit. We don’t sell credit, never have sold credit, never going to sell credit. 
Westcott Rochette - Bear Stearns : All right, thanks a lot guys.
Operator: We will go next to Andrew Wolf at BB&T.
Andrew Wolf - BB & T Capital Markets : Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the fuel question. Those numbers you gave first for the first half $0.01 and the expectation for the second half, those are gross, right, before any ability to pass it through?
William J. DeLaney, III : Yes, that’s our fuel expense number, Andy.
Andrew Wolf - BB & T Capital Markets : And I know Meredith asked this but let me just parse it a little bit. What percent of the contracts or what percent of that is sort of contractually you can pass through with a bit of a lag?
Kenneth F. Spitler : With the customers that we have agreements with, I would say 90% of them have some sort of agreement written in that we can pass on some fuel charge based on generally speaking a sliding scale of diesel price. We have no agreements on the street side. Not every one of our CMU customers have that agreement so I hope that answers your question. 
Andrew Wolf - BB & T Capital Markets : It’s pretty close, better than it was. I wanted to ask you first of all in the quarter was there any help from acquisitions or have you anniversaried any acquisitions that would have evaded the top line? It was like 0.2% last quarter.
William J. DeLaney, III : I think it’s similar this quarter, even less, 0.1 maybe, I think. It’s about $30 million I think.
Andrew Wolf - BB & T Capital Markets : Okay, so fairly de minimus and lastly on the acquisition environment, Performance Food Group before they decided to sell had said that the environment from an acquirer’s point of view had gotten a little easier and that expectations were down and more people might be interested. Do you have any comment in that regard?
William J. DeLaney, III : I guess they were right.
Andrew Wolf - BB & T Capital Markets : I think they were talking about the rest of the... Although maybe that’s what they were talking about. Assuming they were talking about the rest of the universe of potential acquirees, that’s what I’m... 
William J. DeLaney, III : I think there’s going to be some adjustment in terms of people’s thinking regarding the multiples. Some of the multiples we sell even in our industry, you might say were a cause of the ultimate consulting problems that we’ve quit in terms of the credit market, et cetera, so anybody’s guess, but I think the expectations are going to be lower in the future.
Kenneth F. Spitler : Andy, what we see a lot of the smaller family businesses that are looking to exit the business and those are what we typically fold into our bigger operating companies. So generally speaking their expectations have been lowered recently.
William J. DeLaney, III : I think Andy the only thing I would add is that with all that said, as you can appreciate, in some of these larger deals, what’s happened with the private equity market is it’s harder to get financing for any large deals for financial sponsor type of transactions so that’s the other dynamic that’s out there right now. 
Andrew Wolf - BB & T Capital Markets : Okay. Thanks a lot.
Operator: We’ll go next to Jason Whitmer at Cleveland Research Company. 
Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research Company : Hi, good morning. Rick, are you seeing any change to the competitive sets specifically surrounding pricing or anybody trying to chase some business in this environment considering how much softer the market demand is? It kind of goes back to what Ken said earlier when the question was asked about our largest competitor and we really don’t although as we’ve said in the past, we see some erratic behavior on the part of some customers in certain markets, kind of an irrational pricing if you will. It’s not across the board, and that hasn’t changed. We still see a little of that here and there but broadly speaking we’re not seeing any change in pricing practices by our competitors. 
Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research Company : And Ken is the second RDC on schedule and any kind of progress report on how you’d expect that to ramp versus the first one?
Kenneth F. Spitler : It’s on schedule for shifting or ramping up in April. We anticipate the ramp to go much faster this time because we have 90 coming and so all’s well at this point.
Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research Company : Will there be a visible impact though on the P&L? Obviously there was a material impact the last go round. Will it be modest at best this time? Will it be incremental on the cost on the ramp?
William J. DeLaney, III : I think it would be incrementally modest. There’s a ramp up and we’ve kind of tried to allude to this, it’s hard to project because we don’t know exactly when we’re going to start shipping there, but I would think there will be a little bit of a negative impact if you will.
Richard J. Schnieders : At the very end of our fiscal year.
William J. DeLaney, III : In our fourth quarter, yes.
Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research Company : Ken, can you provide any context to transportation savings overall? I think you mentioned routing and designated delivery days. When you throw in the RDC into that all the other components you’ve got working on it on the back end, can you just provide some color as to how quickly that’s moving or maybe just some relative perspective versus last year versus two years ago because obviously you’re seeing some good success there?
William J. DeLaney, III : Our miles are down this year although our sales are up so that’s a positive impact of really all the things that we’re doing. They all kind of go together and it’s an ongoing process. I think we characterize it as a routing initiative as if we could do it once and we’re done. Actually it means that we’re kind of viewing our transportation network in a different way today and that is every week, every day we’re looking at reducing those miles to say that we’re going to be able to mitigate the cost of diesel as it is. I don’t think that is probably feasible, but we are attacking it as best we can and trying to mitigate those expenses again and what we have control over and it’s working very well for us.
Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research Company : And lastly Rick I wanted to come back to an acquisition question. Is there a way you can look at not just broad line businesses but other ways to grow the broad line business because I’ve seen in the past it’s largely just been pure acquisition of these businesses, but any tools you can acquire, I think a couple yeas ago you’d actually mentioned that there are other core competencies that Sysco has that you could use to build upon that could actually also be market [inaudible]. Any thoughts on that?
Richard J. Schnieders : Yeah, without being specific we would still stand by that. We think that there are, I’ll use this term roughly, but adjacencies that make sense for us, taking advantage of the competencies we’ve built over the years so absolutely it is in the scope of the options we’re looking at.
Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research Company : Great, thank you.
Operator: We’ll go next to Chris Ruth at Piper Jaffray. 
Chris Ruth - Piper Jaffray : Hi, good morning. When we look at market share gain opportunities, the opportunities you’ve been talking about, on the balance of the year do you see greater opportunity in chains or independent business absent any major acquisitions?
Richard J. Schnieders : I don’t mean to be wishy-washy but it depends. Obviously the larger customers, the larger chain customers come in on a lumpy way and the independents on the other hand, they’re kind of coming in, they’re very small businesses, they’re incrementally very small, so this year we’ve had nice business, nice chain growth, but our street sales continue to growth very evenly too, so it’s a hard question to answer but again keep in mind that when we bring in a big customer, it’s a lot of business right now an the independent business just comes in gradually over a period of time.
Chris Ruth - Piper Jaffray : Okay and then finally I would assume you have some food inflation assumptions built into your sales outlook on the year. I know it’s hard to forecast but do you at least contemplate or normalize inflation rate of 2% to 3% or something closer to recent levels of 5% to 6%? Can you provide any color on that?
William J. DeLaney, III : Not really. I think it would be premature to think that inflation is going to come down to historic levels. I think we’re going to continue to be a little higher than the 2% to 3% that you referenced and again it moves all the time. If we get bad weather in California, the produce markets spike very, very quickly. Dairy prices can change on a dime so it ‘s one of those unknown factors so again going back to almost everything that we’ve said, what we have to make sure of is that we have any operating companies and at the corporate office the ability to move quickly when things change on us, whether it’s fuel prices, inflation on food, or whatever, and that’s really our goal, to be able to respond quickly and appropriately when the market changes.
Chris Ruth - Piper Jaffray : Okay, very good. Thanks. 
William J. DeLaney, III : I think I’ll just add there quickly, I think everyone knows this, we are getting close to wrapping around some of the beginnings of these high inflation numbers as we get deeper in the third quarter, so as Ken pointed out and Rick now, we would expect it to still be relatively high but there may be a mass aspect to this and at some point it would start to subside.  
Operator: We will go next to Bob Cummins at Shields and Company.
Bob Cummins - Shields and Company: Thank you. Actually my question was basically on acquisitions and you talked about that a good deal. I guess I won’t try to follow up further. But anyway, appreciate the call. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) We will go next to Alec Patterson at RCM.
Alec Patterson - RCM: I just wanted to confirm the guidance you’ve given on the options outlook because I thought on the end of the first quarter call you described the change in the program where it would also impact the back half of the year, seeing an increase in options expense and now I think in response to Ajay’s question you suggested it actually be down quite a bit.
William J. DeLaney, III : Let me start and if I’m not answering, straighten me out here. I think what we said on the last call was we’d be in a better position by now to give you a flavor for the second half of the year and so to put this in some type of context, the first quarter was favorable I think to the tune of $215 million or $216 million primarily because of the timing business. This quarter was unfavorable $5 million t o $6 million primarily a timing difference so it’s been favorable to about $10 million or $11 million and my best judgment sitting here today is that we would see another favorable variance the second half of the year for about $10 million. Again, it could be off, different things effect this as we go through the cycle, but I would expect for the year it would be favorable.
Alec Patterson - RCM: So then for the year roughly speaking around $20 million favorable.
William J. DeLaney, III : Correct.
Alec Patterson - RCM: Okay. I just want to get that clear. On the inflation that you’re passing through a similar rate as the first quarter though if you look at some of the PPI numbers for the food industry you see what seems to have been a step up, especially with the most recent numbers, and certainly things haven’t gotten any better across a variety of food commodities, so I’m just wondering to what degree do you discern an incremental benefit from the procurement program against the inflation head wind? Are we seeing incremental like you’re shaving a point off of that right now versus maybe half a point before? I’m using numbers but just trend wise is what I’m trying to get at.
Richard J. Schnieders : I’m going to back to our answer earlier Alec and say that it’s very, very difficult to determine what that number might be. We’re encouraged by our progress. I think the number now is somewhere around the end of the year we’ll be purchasing $3 billion but even that $3 billion purchasing centrally is not going to move that number significantly and then our ability to measure it frankly is very difficult because of all of the other moving parts but overall I’d just again say that we’re on track in terms of goals that we’ve set and we feel good about it.
Alec Patterson - RCM: Maybe a different way of asking that is at least at this point given the levels of inflation and what seems to be accelerating inflation in the industry, are you finding the procurement providing you with a competitive weapon at this point or is it still too de minimus to make a difference on the overall [cogs] outlook for your company versus competition?
Richard J. Schnieders : I think it’s too de minimus at this point. Anecdotally I’d say that I think we feel pretty good about it but the numbers are still too small and there are so many moving parts to it that it’s difficult to determine the actual impact.
Alec Patterson - RCM: Fair enough on that and then just lastly, what sort of experience are you guys having with credit, the availability of it, finding working capital if need be, et cetera? I know you’ve got a nice free cash flow story but just generally speaking to the degree you need it?
William J. DeLaney, III : Again we touched on this earlier. Obviously when you get in times like this there’s a sanity check that we all go through both the operating company and here in corporate so we’re going through and looking at our larger customers and as the earlier --
Kenneth F. Spitler : I think he’s asking about our borrowing --
Alec Patterson - RCM: Your ability as a highly rated --
William J. DeLaney, III : Our ability to borrow?
Alec Patterson - RCM: Yes.
William J. DeLaney, III : It’s probably never been better, I think. I mean right now the financial markets are very favorable for high quality borrowers of corporate debt so we’re looking at that and obviously [spreads of light] but treasuries will come down quite a bit so interest rates are pretty favorable right now long term.
Alec Patterson - RCM: Are you looking at refinancing potentially?
William J. DeLaney, III : We’re looking at it. We’re always looking at it. 
Alec Patterson - RCM: You may be taking on more debt potentially?
William J. DeLaney, III : That’s something that we talked about before obviously and we certainly have the capacity to do it. We just want to make sure as we do it that our priorities are straight in terms of what are opportunities are, whether they be more transactional or share repurchase, that type of thing. So we’re still evaluation that part of it.
Alec Patterson - RCM: Okay, understood. Thank you. 
Operator: We will go next to Steve Chick at J.P. Morgan
Steve Chick - J.P. Morgan : Hi, thanks. Just a follow up. I was wondering what the increase in customer contact personnel was in the quarter and if you’re still on track for a 4% rate of growth for the year?
Richard J. Schnieders : Steve, actually we’re at 4.5% through the first two quarters and I think we’ll stay steady and around 4%.
Steve Chick - J.P. Morgan : Okay and then second, I guess for Bill, maybe I missed it, but your other income was up a little bit year-over-year for the quarter. I don’t think that has to do with [coaling] or anything. It looks like about $8.3 million versus $3.3 million a year ago? 
William J. DeLaney, III : Yeah, [coaling] you’re right is in the operating expenses. The bulk of that is the sale of a, I guess I’d describe it as a little technology investment that we had that they restructure their business and we took that opportunity to sell our interest in it so that gave us a gain of I think about $3.5 million and that’s one of the things, Steve, I was alluding to earlier. Some of these aren’t big enough to really get into specific disclosure, but in the first quarter we were going against the game from the prior year on a land sale. That was unfavorable. This one’s favorable so again a 26 week, most of it washes out which is nice. 
Steve Chick - J.P. Morgan : Okay, so $3.5 million.
Richard J. Schnieders : Correct.
Steve Chick - J.P. Morgan : That’s helpful. Thank you.
Operator: We will take our final question from Meredith Adler at Lehman Brothers.
Meredith Adler - Lehman Brothers : I don’t know whether you’re going to answer this question, but there is going to be a process where performance food looks for other buyers before this transaction is completed with Blackstone. Do you have any interest in any pieces of performance food? They’re what they call the customized business has a very strong reputation. 
William J. DeLaney, III : You’re right, Meredith, we’re going to be very cautious about that, but I’ll just tell you, we continue to look at acquisitions of all kinds that make sense for us and all sizes and that’s as much as we would say at this point.
Meredith Adler - Lehman Brothers : Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: This does conclude our question and answer session today. I’d like to turn the conference back to Mr. Rick Schnieders for any closing remarks. 
Richard J. Schnieders : Thank you, operator. I want to thank everybody for joining us this morning. We very much appreciate your interest in Sysco. I would like to just highlight one thing and that is that as we’ve said several times on the call, that it was in the press release too that the 26 weeks is really because of all the pluses and minuses is the way we’re looking at our business and our performance and then the bottom line is we feel very good about the 26 weeks and we think that it’s right in line with our overall financial objectives. So with that I would again thank you all and please eat out often and if you have any questions in regard to the call or in regard to the press release, please call Neal Russell here in Houston. Thank you. Operator This does conclude today’s conference. We do thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.

Operator: Welcome to today's SYSCO Corporation first quarter fiscalyear 2008 earnings conference call. As a reminder, today's call is beingrecorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like toturn the call over to Mr. Rick Schnieders, SYSCO's Chairman and Chief ExecutiveOfficer. Please go ahead, sir.
Rick Schnieders:  Thank you, operatorand good morning to everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss SYSCO's firstquarter fiscal 2008 financial results. With me in Houstonand speaking on today's call are Ken Spitler, President and Chief OperatingOfficer; and Bill Delaney, Chief Financial Officer. But first, let me turn it over to our newly appointedAssistant Vice President of Investor Relations, Neil Russell.
Neil Russell:  Thanks Rick, and goodmorning everyone. Before we being, please note that statements made in thecourse of this presentation that state the company's or management'sintentions, hopes, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future areforward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private SecuritiesLitigation Reform Act of 1995, and actual results could differ in a materialmanner. Additional information concerning factors that could causeactual results to differ in a material manner from those in the forward-lookingstatements is contained in the company's SEC filings, including, but notlimited to risk factors contained in the company's annual report on Form 10-Kfor the year ended June 30, 2007 and in the company's press release issuedearlier this morning. I want to point out a couple of changes to our reporting.The income statement and the press release include a couple of additional lineitems. First, we added a line item to show gross margin dollars. Second, weadded a line item to show operating income. Although both measure can becalculated from our previous reports, we decided to formally shown the lineitems going forward. Please understand that all comparisons given during thecall refer to changes between the first quarter of fiscal 2008 and the firstquarter of fiscal 2007, unless otherwise noted. Also, all comments about earningsper share refer to diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. With that out of the way, I will turn it back over to ourChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rick Schnieders.
Rick Schnieders:  Thank you, Neil. Letme start by saying we had another solid quarter, delivering sales growth of8.5%, and leveraging that into 16.2% earnings per share growth. We areencouraged by the fact that this is the fourth consecutive quarter whereearnings per share growth has exceeded 15%. We are pleased with how the new fiscal year has begun. Wecontinue to take share in a difficult business environment, with high inflationcontinuing throughout the second quarter. We are executing our strategicbusiness initiatives, and we are gaining traction from these initiatives acrossour operations. As we have communicated in the past, our initiatives are long termin nature, and take time to fully implement.  A key component of our strategy is to invest in our future,to find better and more efficient ways to serve our customers and driveprofitable growth. We are always trying to help our customers grow, whichpositions us to participate in their success. Now I would like to turn the call over to Ken, who will talkabout how our operations performed in the first quarter.
Ken Spitler: Thanks, Rick. Overall I am pleased with our performance inthe quarter. Sales growth was in line with our expectations, and operatingincome increased by about 16%. Our operating companies performed well. Similarto last quarter, our internal measure of product cost inflation remained higherthan normal, averaging just under 6%. Our operating companies continued tomanage their business very well in that challenging environment. Our ability togrow gross profit dollars faster than operating expenses was key to ourresults. Something I said last quarter still holds true: while ouroperating companies performed well under the current conditions, we believe amodest inflationary environment over time is best for SYSCO and our customers.We experienced low gross margins as a percent of sales this quarter, which isnot unusual during times of high inflation and inversely, inflation favorablyimpacted operating expenses as a percent of sales. This combined with effectivecost management by our operating companies helped drive our growth in operatingincome. Last quarter I shared a few metrics that helped drive thebusiness. This quarter, I will expand on one of those topics: miles driven. Weare continually managing the miles driven in order to provide quality serviceto our customers and to minimize fuel expense. As a result of increasinglyimpactful initiatives such as XY routing and designated delivery days, thenumber of miles driven increased only about 1% in the quarter.  In summary, I am pleased with our operating results, and weare committed to continuous improvement going forward. Now Bill will review thefinancial results.
Bill DeLaney: Thank you, Ken. As Rick and Ken have just discussed, ourfirst quarter financial results were strong. Earnings per share grewapproximately 16% in the quarter, primarily driven by sales growth of 8.5%, andoperating margin expansion of 31 basis points. Gross margin dollars grew 7.3%,while operating expenses increased only 4.7%.  These results include a $16 million decrease in share-basedcompensation year over year. We moved the grant date for incentive stockoptions from the first quarter to the second quarter of the fiscal year, and weexpect the benefit created by this timing change to be partially reversedduring the second quarter. The first quarter results however, were negatively impactedby a $9.4 million charge for an anticipated accelerated future contribution toone of the company's multi-employer pension plans.  Cash flow from operations increased about $19 million, orapproximately 11% in the first quarter to $192 million, primarily driven by ourgrowth in net earnings. As we noted in the press release, capital expenditureswere $132 million during the first quarter, which is in line with our businessplan. Such investment even in challenging times is necessary if we are toachieve our long-term goals. My last point of discussion will be the income tax rate. Theeffective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 was 38.1%, a decreaseof about 60 basis points from the same time last year. The decrease in theeffective tax rate was primarily due to the net tax benefit resulting from thecombination of two items.  We recorded a tax benefit for a net operating losscarryforward related to state taxes, which was partially offset by a taxprovision for a foreign tax contingency. The net impact of these two items wasa net benefit of about $5 million, which reduced the overall effective taxrate. While difficult to predict, we do not foresee this favorable variancecontinuing over the balance of the year.  In summary, we are pleased with our financial results forthe quarter, and encouraged by our overall performance for the past year. Weremain focused both on contributing to the ongoing success for our customers,and achieving SYSCO's long term financial objectives. With that operator, we will now take questions.
Operator:  Your first question comes from John Heinbockel - GoldmanSachs.
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: Rick, can you talk about the macro environment a little bit?Are you seeing any real tangible sign of a purchasing slowdown by yourcustomers? Or is that happening and you are simply picking up enough share tooffset that? Secondly, do you see your customers consolidating vendors orsuppliers at a faster rate here than they were six months ago or a year ago?
Rick Schnieders:  Thanks for thequestion, John and in fact, I think it is fair to say while not having terrificindustry numbers, we don't see a lot of growth out there. However to your pointexactly, we are watching the pieces, the new items that we are sellingcustomers out there, and we feel very good about that.  To the second part of your question about consolidation, itis pretty hard for us to determine whether there is any consolidation, otherthan whether they are using fewer distributors; other than the fact that we aregaining share in this challenging marketplace.
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs:  How much is drop sizegrowing roughly, this quarter or last quarter? Do you have a sense of that?
Rick Schnieders:  Yes, average dropsize, those numbers we have shared before are running about where they havebeen the last three years, which is in the range of 3% to 4% in the averagedrop size.
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs:  That has been fairlyconsistent. There hasn't been a pickup or a slowdown really of late, say thelast couple quarters?
Rick Schnieders:  No, and as Kenalluded to last quarter and this quarter, we continue to work with ourcustomers to get those additional items, but also to make sure that we arerouting our trucks properly, getting the right number of cases on the truck andwhere we can, to do some consolidation to get our average pieces up. That is franklyworking very well.
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: Finally, the gross margin impact from inflation looked to bea little lighter this quarter versus last. Is that more a timing of passthroughof your costs? Is it more that? Or is the centralized procurement benefitpicking up sequentially?
Rick Schnieders:  John, we haven't doneany sort of statistical analysis on that difference. I think the difference isnot significant, the difference between the impact of inflation on grossmargins last quarter and this quarter. We are still, as Ken alluded to in hiscomments, we are still pressure on gross margins related to the inflation. Onthe other hand, we are picking that up at the expense line, but even more thanthat, I think an indication of those operating companies and how hard they areworking to control their costs, we are seeing the real pickup at the expenseline, which is exactly where we expected and where we have to see it.
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs:  The procurementbenefits are picking up gradually, correct? There hasn't been any big step-upof late?
Rick Schnieders:  That is right. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Ajay Jain - UBS.
Ajay Jain - UBS: I think there have been a couple of instances, I think itwas last year and also in fiscal '06 as well where you had some calendar shiftsfor accruals related to pension expense, and I was just wondering if you couldtalk about what the basis is for these timing adjustments on your actuarialassumptions?
Bill DeLaney:  The change we aretalking about this morning is on our stock comp expense, not on the pension. Inthe past, I believe the issues on pension have been more or less annually,year-over-year, and a lot of that is driven by the discount rate that we arerequired to use to discount back the projected benefit obligations. The changewe are talking about today is on stock comp.  That was a conscious decision. We didn't put it all in therelease because it is kind of cumbersome. The long and the short of it is it isprimarily for administrative reasons, it just was becoming increasinglydifficult to process the options, get them in front of our comp committee, andfind a time that we could issue them outside of a black-out period, that wouldwork for everyone. In the interest of being more accurate and optimizing thetime window, we pushed the grant date back from September to November. In fact, we will be going to the comp committee with ourrecommendations this week, and there will be a final meeting next week, andthose grants will be approved as deemed by the committee next week. So that isreally all it is. It is more of administrative change. As I have said here, wewould expect a good portion at least of that benefit to reverse in the secondquarter.
Ajay Jain - UBS:  As relates to thestock compensation, you did mention that some of that, based on the change inthe grant date, that benefit will reverse itself this quarter. Can you give anymore specificity and quantify how you see the comparisons in Q2, and also whatyour outlook is on an annualized basis for options expense for the full year?
Bill DeLaney:  It is one of thosegreat questions that you would need to be a soothsayer to give you a preciseanswer. We haven't even gotten them approved yet. It is dependent on how manyare approved and the mix of the people that are involved in that package and alot of other things. So I think as far as I will go with you today is we wouldexpect a portion of it to partially reverse in the second quarter, and I thinkwe'd be in a better position by the end of the second quarter, perhaps when werelease earnings, to give you a little better view going forward.  But I will tell you this, in the Q as we're drafting ittoday, we don't really expect this year-over-year change to be material.
Ajay Jain - UBS: I seem to recall last year that the share repurchaseactivity was a little bit front end loaded. I was just wondering if you couldconfirm what the level of share buybacks were in the latest quarter?
Bill DeLaney: It was back end loaded I believe last year. It is just thereverse this year. We picked it up quite a bit, and Kirk is sitting right here.Do you have a number, Kirk?
Kirk Drummond:  Actually, we evenedit out a little bit for the first quarter. I want to say it is about 187million, I think, in the first quarter.
Bill DeLaney:  So we have beenpretty aggressive buying back this quarter.
Ajay Jain - UBS: Can you confirm the number?
Bill DeLaney:  It is roughly 190million this quarter, versus about 65 million for the first quarter last year.
Operator: Your next question comes from Meredith Adler with LehmanBrothers.
Meredith Adler - Lehman Brothers:  I would like to goback a little bit to just Ajay's question about pension, because I didn'treally understand what was in the press release about something about potentialacceleration. What exactly have you done, and what do you anticipate needing todo?
Bill DeLaney: As we have disclosed, I think pretty consistently, weparticipate in several different multi-employer pension plans, which areessentially plans that our union employees are participants in and wecontribute to those plans. We have one such plan that in fact, in the past wedisclosed that there is some underfunding issues in the aggregate; not in eachof those plans but in the aggregate. One of those plans, we have become more aware of in recenttimes, and in particular in the last month, that their underfunding situationis much more acute. In fact, even though we haven't been directly notified, wehave reason to believe through third parties that we will probably need to makean accelerated contribution here at some point in the relatively near future.So with that information, we went ahead with the best information available tous, and took a charge for about $10 million.
Meredith Adler - Lehman Brothers: I would like to go back a little bit to the first set ofquestions about the macro environment. If you look at the public restaurantchains, they are clearly suffering tremendously. It is unclear whether that isall because of food inflation but a lot of that seems to be just about theconsumer economy. I was wondering whether you have any commentary onindependent private restaurants, whether you are seeing similar kinds of issues?You said that growth has not been very strong. Do you see slowdowns in newunits? Do you see people closing down?  I think some people are very gloomy about the restaurantbusiness, and I was wondering if you could comment. And then also, to whatextent is higher food inflation cause either consumers or restaurants to buyless product?
Rick Schnieders:  Meredith, I willstart and say that I think that the consumer confidence is not good at thispoint, causing this lack of real growth in the industry overall. You see it inthe retail sectors in general, I believe.  In terms of specific numbers, new operations opening,restaurants closing, independent restaurants closing, that information would lag us, butanecdotally, we don't see restaurants closing en masse. I would point out to you that over the last few years, asyou know, we have done a better job of stratifying customers and understandingour customer base better and I would also say today that based on that, we havea stronger core group of customers, and those customers tend to be in businessfor very long periods of time; ten years,15 years, 20 years. That is kind of the heart of our business, and even, theyhave been through tough times before, 1990, 1991, we'll all go through toughtimes together in the future. Fortunately, our base of customers tends to be those thatare going to hang on, they understand the restaurant business well, and we seeless churn in our customers today than we did three, four, five years ago,because we were diligent about identifying that stratified customer group thatwe have out there.
Meredith Adler - Lehman Brothers: Do you have any perspective on where food inflation will gofor the remainder of this calendar year, and maybe into the first quarter ofnext year?
Rick Schnieders:  Well, again, we wouldhave to be calling on the soothsayers. We are beginning to see just recently alittle bit of softening in some categories; dairy, for instance which reallyneeded to soften up. I am sure you have followed that Argentinahas been out of the wheat market here for the last ten months or so, and onFriday they announced they were coming back into the market. Wheat prices atcommodity level are down just a bit month over month. So we don't want to gettoo far out in front of ourselves here, but we think there may be a little bitof softening of inflation over the next few months now.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jason Whitmer - ClevelandResearch.
 Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research:  Rick, I know youtalked a lot about anecdotal impact of business reviews. I was curious if youguys have done any quantitative impact on the impact you have had onindependent restaurant profitability, something where you are really helpingthem drive either better top line sales, or more importantly, help theirprofitability with their menu development, or things of that nature, if youhave really been trying to track that as a big success point for your business?
Rick Schnieders:  I think at somelevel, a certain number of customers will share their profitability with ouroperating companies and with our marketing associates. Again, very anecdotally,we do get positive feedback from our customers, and I have got some storiesthat I could tell, and I am sure most of the folks in this room have stories,where we have had a particularly strong relationship with a customer, we havehelped them enormously and their business has grown. So you know, absolutely, I think that is happening outthere. We have operating companies where we have done a number of businessreviews with the same customer and at some point, the only way we are going tocontinue to grow with that customer is to help them grow their business.  I think anecdotally, you know, we don't have any statisticson this, but anecdotally we do have customers where we have providedsignificant assistance to them and their business as a result has grown, andthey would honor that. I think they would say that that is true.
 Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research: I think when we met a little over a month ago in Boston,there was a sourcing summit that you guys held internally to try to reallyreconfigure or reset the bar on sourcing. What are some of the best wins andchanges coming out of that over the six weeks or so?
Ken Spitler:  Yes. That was just areset meeting to make sure that we were doing the best we could. Some of thelearnings that we had out of that were how we rolled it out to the operatingcompanies. We were a little slow getting that out to them, so we have refined thatprocess, and we are quicker to market with the rollout. That was probably themost significant learning that we had out of it. There was a lot of just thatsort of thing that we did.
 Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research: Last question, Rick, there was a chart a couple years ago, Iremember seeing it very frequently, in terms of the number of operatingcompanies that had an operating margin above 6%, above 7%, something to thateffect. I think if I recall, almost two-thirds of them were above 6%. Has thatchanged materially over the last couple years, into something like sourcing orRDC, or whatever else you have in your strategic road map does that change theearnings power potential of any of the operating companies?
Rick Schnieders:  Well, I think itdoes, Jason, but maybe even more important that that is it is all those thingstogether, but it's also just the ability of that management team or thosemanagement teams that were not at 7%, that were at 2% or 3%, their ability overtime to kind of get their arms around the business, and manage the net marginsof the business upwards. I think it has changed, but as you will also recall, Iam sure, is that those operating companies that were toward the lower end ofthat graph generally tended to be the newer operating companies, because theywere acquisitioned.  Time is really a big factor for all of us. We talk about howit is taking time for us to institute and install these initiatives. That isabsolutely true. Same thing with an operating company. It just takes time toget your arms around all the moving parts to drive your earnings higher. Thatchart in terms of the shape of it would not be significantly different. Thenewer companies we have today are toward the lower end, and those that are moremature generally tend to be better, at the higher end of the chart.
Operator:  For our next questionwe will go to Greg Badishkanian - Citigroup.
GregBadishkanian - Citigroup: Following up on food inflation, it sounds like it is sort ofa neutral impact to your bottom line, in terms of EBIT dollars, is that right?
Rick Schnieders:  I think that isright. I think that is absolutely right. The bigger concern that we have andBill has said this for a while, is that as high inflation goes on for too long,the real impact is to our customers' business, and consumer confidence level andcausing the consumer rather than eating out three or four times a week, to eatout two or three times a week. That is by far the biggest impact to ourbusiness.
Greg Badishkanian - Citigroup: When you look at your independent customers, are they doinga better or worse job relative to the large chains, in terms of passing onthose price increases to their end user?
Rick Schnieders:  Well, I think thetruth of the matter is that some are doing better, and some are not doing sowell. We don't have any real statistics on that. But I will also say that wehave worked hard in business reviews, and more broadly to help our customersunderstand the importance of adjusting their pricing in this market. I think we put out a marketing piece a monthago, Ken, to kind of emphasize that very point.
Ken Spitler:  We do see that ourindependent customers are a little more nimble with the ability to change theirmenu, and change their menu pricing than the chains are.
Bill DeLaney: With that said, it you are a pizzeria and your dairy costsgo up 25% or 50%, it is kind of hard to pass along real quick.
GregBadishkanian - Citigroup: Moving over to acquisitions, are you seeing multiples comingdown and companies looking to sell?
Rick Schnieders:  Well, it is abifurcated market out there. I think you have seen the big public deals, andthe extravagant multiples that they have been able to command. On the otherhand, we today continue to work the largest list of smaller acquisitions thatwe have ever had an opportunity to work. I think as in anything, there areopportunities, there will be opportunities at the larger end, the largeracquisitions. I think that the multiples will get more realistic over time. Butwe continue to look at every possible new partnership that we possibly can. Weare still very actively engaged in assessing the acquisition market.
GregBadishkanian - Citigroup: Sometimes it takes time for the sellers to reconcile that, thetake out multiples have come down, and so have you seen that over the past fewmonths, or do you think it will take a little more time for the take outmultiples to come down some?
Ken Spitler:  What we are seeing,there is still a fairly high expectation out there that we think will take alittle while longer to mitigate itself.
Bill DeLaney:  I think the otherthing is some of these folks have to decide whether they are really sellers ornot. There's being a seller, at a multiple of 12, 13 and there is being aseller at a lower multiple. I am sure within their own organizations they'rehaving those discussions.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mark Husson - HSBC.
Mark Husson - HSBC:  I want to ask aquestion about gas prices, and about the overall structure of your distribution system. Whenyou think about regional distribution centers, what kind of stress testing didyou do in thinking about $3 a gallon, $4 a gallon, $5 a gallon, and does an RDChave a much better gallon burn profile, if you like, than the previous sort ofstructure in the Northeast?
Rick Schnieders:  Well, I think wherewe see it is when you look at sort of the piece number. You want to look at itright down to the case level Mark, and so absolutely, and the RDCs allow us tokeep the trucks fuller. The inbound trucks fuller into the RDC, the outboundtrucks to the operating companies. So there is a huge benefit there,particularly longer term, as we move more and more inbound freight throughthose RDCs. It is a big environmental positive environmental impact, and a bigimpact in terms of the cost. The other thing that is happening that we feel very goodabout is that we are shipping more product by rail into the RDCs than weanticipated. As you might expect, I mean, on a per case basis, the rail isabout one-half what truck is. So there are a number of opportunities, in termsof optimizing the costs, the fuel costs if you will, as well as theenvironmental impact that we have. So we are going to have a smaller carbon footprintgoing forward.
Mark Husson - HSBC:  I am assuming the [inaudible]do the same thing.
Rick Schnieders:  Absolutely, becausewe are closer to the customer, no question.
Mark Husson - HSBC:  You are closer to thecustomer, but then the inbound freight doesn't look quite as good, presumably.
Rick Schnieders:  No actually, the realimportant thing on the inbound freight is making sure that those inboundtrucks, whether they are coming into an RDC or coming into an operatingcompany, making sure that those trucks are full. When you open that back door,it is stacked to the ceiling.
Mark Husson - HSBC:  To push it a littlebit further, if you had some catastrophe in Venezuelaor something and you had to deal with $5 a gallon and you are having a meetingright now, what would be top of the agenda to discuss?
Rick Schnieders:  I think we would haveto look at expanding fuel surcharges for sure. But the other thing, silverlining in this whole thing, is that we are closer to our customers than ourcompetitors. We do do a better job of routing those inbound trucks, so we areall going to pay essentially the same price for fuel. We just do a better jobon a per case basis on moving that product.
Ken Spitler:  I can add to that bysaying that on the outbound side, we would be looking at reducing miles, andreducing the number of deliveries that we currently make. If you are getting three,then we would go two, if you are getting two, we would go one, that sort ofthing. It is all about miles.
Rick Schnieders:  And in ourdiscussions so far, because we have been in a fairly high fuel environment herefor a while, our discussions with our customers as we have gone to betterrouting has been quite positive. You know, they understand. They are just likethe rest of us. They pull up and fill their cars up. They read the newspapers.So our customers appreciate the spot that we are all in, not just thedistributors.
Mark Husson - HSBC: Switching gears, if I could please, just on U.S. Foodservices,this any sort of update, any announcements coming out of that business, anyreorganization or any change in behavior?
Rick Schnieders:  They are closing onefacility in Cincinnati. That is theonly public information we've seen so far. We have not seen any strategic moveon their part.
Ken Spitler:  There are still a lotof rumors, Mark, but we can't put a finger on anything.
Mark Husson - HSBC: The deferred tax benefit, any update on whether or not youare going to be allowed to keep it?
Rick Schnieders:  Well, we certainlythink we are. We are still in the process Mark, and essentially where we are atnow, I don't think it has changed much since we were in Boston,or even since we drafted the K. We have obviously taken a position, the IRS haspushed back, and we are in the appeals process now. I think the next step isprobably to get an appeals officer and that is moving along at a fairlydeliberate pace. I don't think we're going to have a whole lot more news, atleast from what I understand, until the spring, and perhaps later than that.  We could still be a year away from this thing, running itscourse one way or another. We certainly continue to believe our facts arestrong. Obviously at the same time we are now in an appeals process. So we willplay it out. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Steve Chick – JP Morgan.
 Steve Chick - JP Morgan: Are you still on track to increase your sales force by 4% to5% this year? And do you have the, what the increase was for the currentquarter?
Ken Spitler:  I do. It is 5.1% onthe customer contact people. We are really looking at 4% this year, which isreally would make me happy if we could stay in the 4% range. Right now we areat 5.1%.
 Steve Chick - JP Morgan: So you are at 5.1%, but you think you might come in at thelower end.
Ken Spitler:  I would be happy with4%.
 Steve Chick - JP Morgan: As it relates to that, your sales target of 7% to 9%, I knowit is a long-term target; you didn't have it in the press release today. Giventhe volatility of what's around us and some of the comments on macro, can youconfirm post your quarter end that you are still pretty happy with how salesare trending and that the 7% to 9% figure is a pretty good range to continue tothink about for this year?
Ken Spitler:  Yes, sir.
 Steve Chick - JP Morgan: If you could give us an update on the Floridaredistribution center and when you expect it to be in operation? As it relates to that, I had a tough time estimating yourdepreciation and amortization, which comes in a little below what I wouldestimate, and I don't know when the RDC comes into play if the D&A startsto kick in on that facility, so if you could speak to that a little bit?
Ken Spitler:  I will answer thefirst part of that as we are right on schedule with it. We are to start rampingup in April as planned.
Bill DeLaney: The way I would look at the other, Steve, is just look at inthe context of our overall capital expenditures. We are at the higher end ofour range, if you will, in terms of percent of sales. One of the reasons isbecause of the ramp-up in the Florida RDC. So I don't know that I want tospecifically comment on depreciation as it relates to that construction, but Ithink you should continue to expect us to be in that 625, give or take, zonefor CapEx for this year.
 Steve Chick - JP Morgan: Well what I am looking at because you're at the high end ofthe CapEx plan but in the last two quarters the depreciation expense has beengrowing. It was year over year I think 0.4% this quarter. I have a feeling thatsome of that might be, in April, does the depreciation start to kick in on the Floridafacility when it goes into operation in April?
Bill DeLaney:  Yes it is capitalizeduntil it goes in, and then it starts to kick in.
 Steve Chick - JP Morgan: Bill, a little bit in the weeds but just on the breakout of your sales, intersegment saleslooked like they were flat year over year. We could talk about it offline ifyou want. Do you have any sense of why that is, or is that impactful?
Bill DeLaney:  Can you defineintersegment for me, just so I am answering the right question?
Ken Spitler:  Intercompany?
 Steve Chick - JP Morgan:  Intercompany, yes, Iam sorry. Your intercompany sales were kind of flat year over year and itusually grows a little higher than that. I don't know if it's the mix of yourcustomer base? We could certainly take it offline. 
Bill DeLaney:  We might go offlineon that one. I don't have an answer on that one. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Alec Patterson - RCM.
Alec Patterson - RCM: The sales growth in the other specialty segment hascontinued to decelerate. I am just wondering how much of a food inflation ordeflation may be appearing in that number, maybe just a general comment aboutit?
Ken Spitler:  We got hurt on theproduce side and the meat side, on both of those.
Alec Patterson - RCM:  Hurt means deflation,or hurt means lost sales?
Rick Schnieders: I think we had lost sales on the meat side, some lost salesdue to high prices, so customers somewhat trading down. On the produce side,produce is the most volatile category that we have, so the inflation/deflationswings in produce are so dramatic, that I think what we're seeing in theproduce is some deflation, but not universally in other categories of product.So we are still, going back to we are still seeing overall pretty highinflation generally.
Alec Patterson - RCM: Regarding the inflation number, essentially you could readit as if you had the right base numbers, flat sequentially? Is it fair to saythat the rate of inflation, the second derivative here is decelerating, anddoes that allow you to capture more passthrough?
Rick Schnieders:  I think if it is kindof a delta question, yes, I certainly think that we have seen a slowing in therate of inflation. In fact, if you look at the just numbers quarter to quarter,a slight decline in inflation. So going back to our earlier conversation, wemight see, based on early information about wheat, dairy, cheese particularly,we might see a softening of that inflation number. But I wouldn't think aboutit in terms of going back to our normal 2% to 2.5%, or 2.5% to 3% inflationlevels.
Bill DeLaney:  Not to be negativehere. That is a good question and that is a fair answer, obviously, but I thinkyou have got to balance, a very, very slight maybe slowing in deceleration twoquarters in a row for our customers, where their costs are up substantially. Iwould describe our market environment right now as quite challenging as itrelates to price.
Alec Patterson - RCM:  In other words, theremay be a greater capacity for passthrough to be recognized in your gross margintrend, but don't immediately translate lower inflation into acceleratedvolumes?
Bill DeLaney:  I wouldn't translateit into either, that is obviously a prerogative. All I am trying to say here isit's still 6% inflation, or 5.9% or whatever. I don't know that our statisticsare that precise, that I would draw a huge conclusion on deceleration. I thinkit's a very tough environment, we are certainly hopeful that it will start todecelerate. I wouldn't bank on that one right now as we sit here today.
Alec Patterson - RCM: The debt structure, any further thoughts on how you arelooking at it going forward? I see in this quarter where basically sharerepurchase and debt taken on, kind of one for one almost. Is there a fresh setof thinking, maybe a rating agency's point of view on debt structureformulating amongst you all?
Bill DeLaney: We are certainly cognizant and staying in close touch withthe rating agencies, and folks that we do our banking with and that type ofthing. We continue to review our capital structure. Don't take this the wrongway, the way, I don't think that is one of our primary issues right nowinternally in terms of that. We are comfortable with where we are. We do seeopportunities to take our leverage up but with everything that has been goingon with the financial markets the last few months, we are going to take ourtime here and evaluate what makes sense for us.
Alec Patterson - RCM: I am talking strategically, capital structure-wise, the wayyou look at it. My understanding is that way you look at your debt capacity iskind of an arcane way of looking at it. I was understanding that maybe it wasevolving. Has there been evolving of it?
Bill DeLaney:  I didn't know if itwas arcane. 1980s approach it has been described as. We continue to look at itstrategically if you will and we do think we could take on more leverage, andrun the company very, very well. All I was trying to address, at this point intime, it is not a number one priority for us.
Operator: Your next question comes from Andrew Wolf - BB&T CapitalMarkets.
Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets: To try to get to your real sales growth in broad line,should we just use the overall product cost inflation, or do you have a morespecific number you could share with us?
Bill DeLaney:  I would do the mathon what we have given you, and you will be in the ballpark.
Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets:  The other thing onthe broad line is I noticed that the growth there is good, it's outpacing thecorporate growth, but this quarter at least a slight downtick in the MA servedsales as a percent of broad line. In a non-inflationary environment it wouldpretty easy to say, yes the market share is down a little bit internally, orthe chains are up. But given that it might be easier to passthrough inflationto chains, and so on, on a case basis, or on a volume basis, could we reach thesame conclusion that inside broad line the chain business is doing a littlebetter, growing a little faster than the independent, or is inflation skewingthat?
Rick Schnieders:  No. I think whatyou're seeing is we started up a new large customer during the first quarter,and they ramped up pretty rapidly, ramped up very well. It is not a differencein inflation at the chain rate versus the independent rate. It is just the newcustomer. As we talked about it so many times, Andy, you know those bigcustomers come on in chunks, and the growth in the independent market comes onjust in very small increments, so that is all that is.
Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets: Returning to the fuel side, now that diesel is back up, andsome people are predicting it is going to start heading up a lot, I have justdone some back of the envelope and I want to run this by you. About 2 to 3 bipsof exposure for every $0.10 year-over-year increase in diesel? That isunhedged, using some numbers you guys have put out in the past. Is that in theballpark? I don't know if you want to comment on it. Secondly, also, if you have hedged at all when prices werelower, what your hedge ratio might be at this point?
Rick Schnieders:  The first part ofthat I think is we would like to maybe take that offline, have you call Neiland we will just verify that. Frankly, I don't think we have that number.
Neil Russell:  We haven't reallycalculated that way, Andy, so we need to look at that.
Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets:  Have you hedged outany of your fuel exposure at this point?
Ken Spitler:  Beyond the end of theyear, December, not beyond that.
Rick Schnieders: So we have been hedged through this calendar year but thosecontracts run out at the end of the December, so we have some exposure as we gointo the second half of the year.
Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets: At the current inflation, can you say how much you've hedgedout currently that we could sort of subtract out of your exposure?
Neil Russell: It is about two-thirds. 
Rick Schnieders: Technically, we don't hedge, we just have contracts forwardon things. 
Neil Russell: For the accountants in the room.
Operator: Your next question comes from Bill Leech - Neuberger Berman.
Bill Leach - Neuberger Berman: I was a little bit confused about your option guidance. Itwas $0.15 a share last year, should we just plug in $0.15 this year, just topick a number?
Rick Schnieders:  The option guidancewas for the second quarter. We would expect the benefit from the first quarterto reverse partially. 
Bill Leach - Neuberger Berman:  Annual forecast,should we just assume it's the same as last year?
Rick Schnieders:  Assume it's notmaterial, it might be slightly less. It's not material.
Bill Leach - Neuberger Berman:  Second quarter lastyear it was $0.04 a share, which was pretty material, about 10% of yourreported earnings.
Rick Schnieders:  When I say it's notmaterial, I am talking about the change year over year.
Bill Leach - Neuberger Berman:  This year should weput $0.05 or $0.06 in? I know it is a just non-cash item, but it does affectyour reported earnings quite a lot.
Rick Schnieders:  Whatever expense youused for last year, if you use the same expense for this year, I think you willbe within a penny or two.
Bill DeLaney:  For the entire year.
Bill Leach - Neuberger Berman:  But in the secondquarter --
Rick Schnieders: I think it will be on the favorable side. There is a lot ofvariables we don't have our arms around until these options are granted.
Bill Leach - Neuberger Berman:  When you say you aregoing to have part of the benefit in the first quarter reversed in the secondquarter. Does that mean we are going to have a $0.06 charge in the secondquarter?
Rick Schnieders:  No. It means youmight see half of the benefit, $16 million, I will let you guys do the math, itwas about a $0.015 at $16 million. I don’t want to use pennies. Let's just usedollars because the taxes get a little interesting here.  Let me take a minute, that is a good question. Let me frameit up a little bit. The reason you have that kind of volatility or one of thereasons from quarter to quarter, in terms of when the grant date is designatedis because of the makeup of the folks who get the options. The way theaccounting works, I am going to keep this pretty high level, but to the extentthat you've got folks that are toward the end of their tenure, and they arevested in our retirement plans and able to retire, the way the accountingventure works, is you have to expense the full amount of value of those optionsfor those folks who tend to be some of your higher paid people, at the timethat the grant is given. That is why you see the skewing from one quarter tothe next and again, it is unfortunate in terms of the communication side but wejust thought administratively it was better to put the grant date out toNovember this year.
Bill Leach - Neuberger Berman:  For the tax rate,should we use 38.3%?
Rick Schnieders:  No. I would look atlast year's tax rate. I wouldn't use any lower than that. We will keep youposted. This was kind of a one-time benefit here or net benefit as we talkedabout that the accounting requires you to take that benefit in the quarter, andthen it becomes realized. The gross part of this benefit was a state tax lawchange, so we took it all here in the first quarter. I would look at lastyear's tax rate. It could be a little bit higher, or a little bit lower.
Operator: Your next question comes from Christopher Routhe - Piper Jaffray.
Christopher Routhe - Piper Jaffray: On the inflation issue again, I don't mean to belabor thepoint, I know you guys don't like to focus on it, you have been getting a lotof questions on this issue, but I know that 2% to 2.5% is really your sweetspot, that is an inflation level that is probably actually good for yourcustomers. At 6% today, we are obviously a long ways away from that. If youcould help frame it for me. If 2% is a positive, 6% is a negative, what is aneutral level? How do you look at that? Do you see us reaching that at sometime this year? Thanks.
Bill DeLaney:  I think a neutrallevel is in the 3% range, probably not north of 3%. Again, we would have tohave a shaman or soothsayer in here to get us to a good prognostication of whatis going to happen. We just don't know.
Rick Schnieders:  To your point, wedon't like talking a lot about it but we understand these questions are all onpoint. This is not a normal environment. We understand that we need to speak toit. Frankly, it is something that we try to speak to with as much clarity as wecan in terms of how much it impactssales, gross profit margins and expenses. It is a hard thing to get your armsaround. It clearly helps you on your expenses, and it clearly hurts you on yourGP percent, and we can debate the sales side of it philosophically. At the endof the day, we are talking about it because it has had an impact on the lastcouple quarters.
Operator: Your next question comes from Meredith Adler - LehmanBrothers. 
Meredith Adler - Lehman Brothers: Back to the question about inflation. Obviously, it has theimpact it does, gross profit dollars and expense percent, because you have afee per case and you pass along the cost of the products. What percentage ofyour revenues are you passing along the cost and just getting a fee?
Rick Schnieders:  Meredith, we haven'treally disclosed that in the past. Keep in mind, we have fee per case business,but we also have a large of percentage markup basis. We have both types ofpricing. That is our challenge even internally, it is not obvious how itimpacts you in terms of the percentages. We have both types of business outthere. That is a number we haven't shared in the past.
Meredith Adler - Lehman Brothers:  Another question Ihave for you. I know that the procurement opportunity is still just getting offthe ground. But what are your plans in terms of sharing that benefit and wouldit be your anticipation that we would actually be able to see the benefitourselves in looking at the gross margin, or would the majority of it be passedalong?
Rick Schnieders: Well we are still working through to understand how this isall going to shake out, frankly, Meredith. So the answer is we don't know andthe other complication is that sourcing is now integrated with everything elsethat we do. So just identifying a benefit, specifically from sourcing, is very,very difficult to do. We're wrapping all this together, RDC, supply chain workthat we are doing, sourcing and other work that we are doing in terms of ourstrategic initiatives, and to pinpoint where the benefit might show up is very,very difficult at this point in time.
Bill DeLaney:  I think to bestraight with you, Meredith, I don't think you will be able to see the benefitin terms of our public financial statements, we will continue to account theway we account. As we get deeper into this, through the use of our metrics,also just by having more products, items in the game, if you will, we should beable to better speak and even before we start speaking, to better evaluateinternally the progress that we are making on these initiatives.  The summit meeting that Ken was asking about, a lot of thatdiscussion in those meetings was just to make sure internally we're doing asgood as we can in terms of execution. We are still very early on. I know we got into this in theconference up in Boston and there was some confusion or maybe disappointment inour lack of direction, but it is real difficult to sit here today and talkabout gross profit expansion when you have got the kind of markets that we'reworking in right now.  We will continue to look at it internally with some of ourmetrics, and as we see things and if we think they are appropriate and materialand relevant, we will share them with you.
Meredith Adler - Lehman Brothers:  Just a couple ofclarifications. You mentioned about U.S. Foodservice, that they were closing afacility in Cincinnati. Is that ayour market where they have been competing with themselves, so that will sortof open the market up, or is that just something else they are doing?
Ken Spitler:  I think it'ssomething else. I don't think that's a market that they have two units in.
Meredith Adler - Lehman Brothers: You talked about you had a very long acquisitions list. AndI wasn't sure whether that meant just your own list of opportunities that youare focused on, or is that where you have some reason to believe that the owneris interested in selling, or might be interested in selling?
Rick Schnieders:  That is where we havefairly solid information that the owner at least at some level is interested intalking about selling the business. However to Bill's point, sometimes thereare those psychological hurdles. Initially they say they want to sell, and thenlater on they think twice about it and change their mind. Right now we have got a very active list. Honestly most ofthose are relatively small. But it is good consolidation, a lot of them will befold-ins, those are particularly profitable to us. We fold them into anexisting facility. So it is a good pipeline out there right now. But they tendto be the smaller opportunities.
Bill DeLaney:  The only thing Iwould add to that is just that what has been going on in these financialmarkets, I think we are getting more calls from the smaller businesses thatmight be looking to sell. I think that is somewhat predictable with theuncertainty in the markets. That tends to be somewhat of a reality check forfolks. The larger people, I think they have to go back to thedrawing board and strategically look at their businesses, and what they want todo. We wouldn't expect to be seeing a whole lot right there now, and we arenot.
Rick Schnieders:  As we suggestedearlier, two things like government regulation and high fuel prices can be particularlychallenging for somebody that is in a small segment of the business. They run alot of miles. They don't have a broad base of product to put on those trucks.So this is a challenging environment, as you know, and I think that causes someof these folks to think about monetizing what they have built over the years.
Meredith Adler - Lehman Brothers:  I have one morequestion. Have you noticed any marked difference in the business by geography?
Ken Spitler:  The Midwestis a little bit softer right now. 
Operator: Your final question comes from Steve Chick – JP Morgan.
 Steve Chick - JP Morgan: You mentioned a large customer win, I think, within thequarter. Did that start off at the beginning of the quarter, and is that acustomer that you won from U.S. Foodservice?
Ken Spitler:  It started actuallyin the fourth quarter, Steve. It has ramped up all the way in the first quarterhere. It came from a variety of sources. The business was spread out.
 Steve Chick - JP Morgan: Obviously when your Q gets filed, we end up seeing a littlemore of the profits by segment. I don't know if we have to wait until then orBill, can you speak to maybe where the profits were? You had a pretty goodlevel of margin expansion this quarter, in operating margin. Once we get the Q,do you have what the corporate overhead pieces might be, just broadly? Wherethe margin expansion came from by segment, or do we have to wait until thefiling?
Bill DeLaney:  We are going to fileon Thursday. We have spoken to a lot the corporate benefit in terms of thestock comp, and you'll see there is a modest benefit from COLI and pension, andthat type of thing. There is some good benefit there and then there is modestleverage at the operating line.
Operator:  That does conclude today'squestion-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. RickSchnieders for closing remarks.
Rick Schnieders:  I want to thankeverybody for participating in the call today, and I also want to thank you foryour continuing interest in SYSCO. As you can probably hear from our calltoday, we are pleased with our current performance and we are also pleased withour direction for the future.  Have a good day, and remember, eat out often at one of yourfavorite restaurants. Thanks. Bye.

Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to today's Sysco Corporation Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2007 earnings release conference call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Rich Schnieders, Sysco's Chief Executive Officer and Chairman. Please go ahead sir. 
Rick Schnieders: Thank you, Dana. And I would like to welcome everyone joining us this morning. We appreciate you taking the time to be part of our conference call. Let me start by saying I am pleased with our performances in the fourth quarter. We delivered solid sales growth of 8.5% and leveraged that into 19.5% earnings per share growth for the quarter.  As you may recall, in February we announced an organizational restructuring that took effect at the beginning of the new fiscal year. The intent of the restructuring was to support our goal of growing the business. Ken Spitler now manages all operations as President and Chief Operating Officer. Supply chain and sourcing now roll up under Larry Pulliam who reports to Ken.  I expect these changes to further align our different business segments and to improve productivity within the organization as we continue to grow sales and to progress with our business initiatives.  Our fiscal 2007 and 2008 are transition years, where we are in various stages of implementing our initiatives. We are pleased with the progress we’ve made and expect to continue to build on fiscal 2008.  We will start things off with Kirk Drummond taking care of a few administrative items.   After that, Ken will talk about how the business earned during the quarter. Bill DeLaney, our recently appointed CFO, will update you on our financial results for the year, and I’ll wrap things up with a few closing remarks and then open up the call for your questions.  With that said, I will turn things over to Kirk. 
Kirk Drummond: Thanks, Rick. First we have emailed invitations for our 2007 Analyst Day to be held in Boston on September 20th and 21st. Please contact us if you have not received an invitation. In addition, on September 5th, Rick and Bill will address the Goldman Sachs Global Retailing Conference in New York. We’ll be delighted to see you there.  Now I’ll read our Safe Harbor language. Statements made in the course of this presentation that state the Company's or management's intentions, hopes, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and actual results could differ materially.  Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the Company’s SEC filings, including, but not limited to the risk factors contained in the Company’s quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2007 and in the Company’s press release issued this morning. Please understand that all comparisons given during the call refer to changes between the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, unless otherwise noted.  The net impact of EITF 04-13 will only be discussed from a year-to-date perspective because beginning with the fourth quarter we were comparable year-over-year as this standard was adopted in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. We were not comparable during the first three quarters of fiscal 2007. As a reminder, this accounting pronouncement involves revenue recognition or repurchase product from a customer and then later resell the product to the same customer.  The result of this change in accounting principal reduced our reported full-year sales growth by 7/10th of a percent from 8.1% on a non-GAAP basis to 7.4% during fiscal 2007. The lower sales increased our reported gross margins for the year by 12 basis points and it increased our operating expense ratio by nine basis points.  With that out of the way, I will turn it over to Ken to talk about how our operations drove the financial results in the fourth quarter. 
Ken Spitler: Thank you, Kirk. Overall, I am pleased with our performance for the quarter. Total sales growth was in line with our expectations and we increased pre-tax earnings by approximately 19%. While growing earnings at twice the rate of sales is likely not practical over the long term, it is gratifying that our operating companies delivered such a strong performance. I prefer not to focus on inflation, but the 6% inflation we experienced during the quarter was higher than normal and much higher than that of the previous three quarters.  Our operating companies managed their business very well in that challenging environment. I am particularly encouraged by our ability to grow gross profit dollars faster than we increased operating expenses during the quarter. In other words, our operating companies worked with their customers to effectively pass along higher product cost while doing an excellent job managing expenses. While our operating companies performed well under the current conditions, we believe a more modest inflationary environment over time is best for us and our customers.  With that said, I'd like to spend some time talking about how we managed the business to increase sales, control expenses, and grow earnings. On the sales side, we look at the number of business reviews we've done, the number of customer-contact people we've added and the level of lost sales we've experienced.  Our business reviews have become a core part of how we operate. We focused these sessions on helping our customers grow, so that we can grow along with them. Over time we've seen significant improvements in the sales from these customers that have participated in our business review process. While we expected this growth we are also encouraged that reviews are significantly improving customer attention, in other words growing of sales.  The most effective way to impact sales growth is to reduce lost sales. These business reviews are a real competitive advantage for us. The scope and scale of what we do cannot easily be duplicated by our competitors. In addition, we increased our customer contact group by 5% in fiscal 2007 and expect to add another 4% to 5% in fiscal 2008.  On the expense side, I'll review a number of important metrics that are vital to leveraging sales growth. In the past years, we saw a real opportunity to control our transportation cost by increasing the number of cases delivered per truck. We have been very effective in improving this by moving from approximately 585 cases per trip in the year 2000 to approximately 695 cases in 2007.  We are now also focused on managing the number of miles driven. We are working on a number of initiatives to reduce our miles driven per route.  Two other numbers I'll look at -- our errors per 1000 cases shift, and injuries per 100 employees. Errors create customer dissatisfaction and increase our cost of handling, because we essentially handle a case multiple times to correct the error.  In the past, we used to make about three handling errors per 1000 cases delivered. Today we make less than one. Safety is of the utmost importance, primarily from a quality of life perspective for our employees, but also from a workers' comp expense perspective.  We have reduced our annual injuries per 100 employees from nearly 10 to less than six over the past several years. Although these metrics that I have reviewed with you are a small subset of the ones we look at, we have hundreds of operational metrics. They are intended to give you an idea of the level of detail we use to improve our productivity and grow our business.  Now, Bill will review the financial results. Bill? 
Bill DeLaney: Thanks Ken, and good morning everyone. As Rick and Ken have just discussed, our fourth quarter financial results were particularly strong. Our operating companies manage our businesses effectively, and the spike in food cost inflation contributed to the significant expansion in our operating profit margins as well.  Turning to our financial performance of fiscal 2007; sales surpassed $35 billion, pre-tax earnings grew 16% and diluted earnings per share increased by 18%. Sales grew 7.4% including the impact of EITF 04-13, which reduced our reported sales growth by 0.7%.  The operating leverage that accompanied our sales growth is encouraging, and these results are especially gratifying since we were rebounding from a challenging year in 2006.  Free cash flow defined as cash flow provided by operating activities of $1.4 billion, less capital expenditures of $603 million, approximated $800 million for the year, a significant improvement over the prior year. We expect our capital spending to range between $625 million and $650 million in the New Year.  Acquisition activity was modest in fiscal 2007. In addition, we returned nearly $1 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.  I also want to provide some perspective on the earnings impact of several unrelated but significant items this past year. Specifically, the favorable impact of reduced pension expense and stock compensation expense, together with comparatively higher gains related to our company-owned life insurance, was largely offset by incremental incentive accruals and expenses incurred related to our strategic business initiatives.  Looking forward to 2008 and acknowledging that, with the exception of pension expense, these items cannot be projected with certainty. We now expect the aggregate impact of the change in these items to materially impact our fiscal 2008 financial results.  I'd also like to share some additional perspective on income tax expense for the year. Our tax rate in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 was comparable to the fourth quarter of '06. The overall annual rate declined from 39.35% in 2006 to 38.25% in 2007. This decrease is primarily attributed to a lower stock compensation expense and greater company-owned life insurance gains I mentioned a moment ago. While difficult to predict, we do not foresee a significant change in our tax rate for fiscal 2008.  In summary, we are pleased with our financial results. We understand that one quarter is not a trend maker. We've always focused on producing solid, sustainable operating results and will continue to do so. More recently, we've begun to develop processes and metrics in conjunction with our strategic initiatives. These tools will further sharpen our focus and enhance our ability to accomplish our long-term goals.  With that, Rick will share his closing remarks. 
Rick Schnieders: Thank you, Bill. As mentioned before we had a strong fourth quarter and fiscal year, with solid sales growth and exceptional expenses leverage. By the end of 2007 we moved strategy from the formative stage to the implementation stage. It was particularly gratifying to achieve a major milestone of $1 billion in net earnings for the first time in our company's history. I am optimistic as we begin fiscal 2008. I feel strongly that we have the right initiatives and people in place to executive these initiatives.  We got back on the growth record in fiscal 2007 and I believe we will continue to build on our momentum. We are beginning to see some of the benefits of our initiatives, but keep in mind it's early. We have a ways to go and the benefits will come over time. We are the largest player in the competitive industry. We continually invest backend of the business to allow us to maintain and grow our competitive advantages, which we expect will enable us to continue growing the business into the future. We hold the strong position in the industry and we are working on continually improving it.  Throughout Sysco's history, our growth has consistently outpaced that of the foodservice industry. We are encouraged with the progress of our business initiatives to date and remain confident that the successful execution of these initiatives will position us well to participate in the growth and success of our customers for years to come. Therefore, although the industry growth has moderated somewhat in recent years, we are targeting 7% to 9% annual nominal sales growth going forward. This target excludes the impact of major acquisitions, which to the extent they are completed will produce additional sales growth.  We expect to continue to improve our operating leverage, which should allow us to convert this sales growth into low-to mid-double digit annualized earnings growth.  Operator, we'll now take questions. 
Operator: (Operator Instruction) And we'll take our first question today from Jason Whitmer of Cleveland Research Company. 
Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research Company: Hi good morning, good quarter. 
Rick Schnieders: Good morning, thank you. 
Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research Company: Rick, can you help us with maybe a review of your 45 strategic initiatives -- you obviously referred to them multiple times, or maybe with where you’re at within your own progress report, where you expect to be maybe within the next 12 months, 12 to 24 months? Maybe one of the most important leverage for your company going forward? Thanks 
Rick Schnieders: Yeah, thank you Jason. In regard, and I will ask my colleagues to help me here, but in regard to the major initiatives, we certainly are pleased with the progress we have made with the RDC. We are at full ramp to the North East and operations there are going very well.  The construction in Alachua, Florida is also going along very well. So, we are pleased with the RDC and two other important parts of the National supply chain. Our DPR -- the Demand, Planning, Replenishment system which is been rolled out independently RDC to other operating companies -- that's going well.  And we are particularly pleased with the third piece of the national supply chain and that's TMS, the Transportation Management System, which is now in place for all operating companies across the system.  The second major initiative would be sourcing, and sourcing is going along very well. We are completing the second tranche, we had our first small kind of pilot in sourcing that represented about six product categories and $300 million of spent. We are now in the second tranche and we are very pleased with the progress we are making there. Still lots of work to do, we are still adjusted at the very beginning in that process also.  Integrated delivery, really kind of code name for optimizing our warehouse and delivery operations Ken alluded in his comments to the effort to reduce our miles driven, and that took a lot of work, but is going very well in the initial stages.  And finally, I would mention our demand, the work we are doing in demand around the customer and understanding better what our customers needs are and making sure that we have the service offerings that match up to those needs. So those are the major initiatives Jason. 
Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research Company: And when you look specifically at your sales drivers, is there anything beyond the core business reviews and the customer contact reps, things that you could identify over the medium-term or over the long-term that you are looking to really try to drive our performance versus the industry that can be tangible for us to measure you on? 
Rick Schnieders: Well I think mostly it’s more of the same -- so the business reviews, business development, making sure we are following through our nose, but every one of these initiatives that I just mentioned are directly designed to grow our sales. So I would say that all of them will contribute to sales growth in to the short terms and in to the longer term. Ken, do you want to add anything? 
Ken Spitler: No, I think that covers it, Rick. I think we are just beginning in the demand side to do some pricing work. It’s in the very early stages, but we are very excited about it at this point. Not ready to talk about it yet, but in some tests. 
Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research Company: Good. Thank you. 
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Mark Husson of HSBC. 
Mark Husson - HSBC: Yeah. Good morning. I just wanted to know if you could be a little bit more granular on some of the costs that are sort of floating around. I think you mentioned pension costs, but also bonus accruals in the past, and in the fourth quarter last year you told us what the bonuses were and how that swung year-over-year. It also mentioned fuel costs year, and maybe you could just talk about trends there and also pension costs for the coming year? And finally depreciation which seems to be growing rather slowly, can you just talk about why? 
Rick Schnieders: Sure, and Mark, I will turn it over to Bill DeLaney to respond to your question. 
Bill DeLaney: Okay, Mark, let me break it down a little bit. I think as far as the fuel costs, we have higher fuel cost this year than last year. A good portion of that, but it's not overly significant, it’s pretty much in line with our increases and some of that is pricing. We did buy in last year, which today we are pretty happy with that decision. We have a contract in place through the end of December. So our costs are up, but they are not up dramatically. There is little bit of mileage increase there as well, but overall we still imagine the fuel costs pretty low at this point.  What I am going to try to do is connect maybe the other, some of the other items that you mentioned here in two different ways. I mentioned in my comments that if you bundled these items, there are five major items that we’ve spoken to at various points throughout the year. Pension Stock comp, the company-owned life insurance cash funds and value gains, and then offsetting that to some extent, those have been primarily favorable, and some of those have been fairly large favorable swings.  And we also brought our constituents or investors up to speed throughout the year in terms of the investments that we have made in both strategy initiatives and also acknowledge the fact that last year, in the year where the company didn’t perform to its historical standards, we didn’t pay out bonuses here in at the corporate offices. We’ve got a big swing there, so what I was trying to put across there my comments -- suppose if you put all that and net it all out, and when I am saying you should have saved, but you were prone to do that they essentially offset for both quarter and for the year.  Now, in the third quarter we did give you a little selective guidance there because we were looking at a very large unfavorable swing on the bonus accrual side which was more than what it had been earlier in the first three quarters of the year. So I can tell you that the bonus accruals came in pretty much in the range that we discussed in the call last quarter and in the 10-Q. The one thing that came little more favorable than we would have been able to project, because you can’t project these things was the -- obviously the stock market was very strong and that resulted in some favorable gains in our cash undervalue with the company in the life insurance. So, we've come through it all. We probably picked about a penny versus where we thought we would have been, when we were talking about a quarter ago. 
Mark Husson - HSBC: Penny for the quarter? 
Bill DeLaney: Penny for the quarter. Not over last year, but versus where our mindset was when we were talking to you at the end of the third quarter. 
Mark Husson - HSBC: Okay. Since you are going to sort of -- if this businesses was normal than fiscal '08 and also could you just talk about depreciation which only grew at 5%? 
Rick Schnieders: Yeah, I think that’s really -- the major point we are trying to make here is that we expect going in to the New Year that the pension expenses really the only one I consider today, and tell you with any certainty and that that will be very modestly favorable, we believe in '08.  The stock comp, that'll vary somewhat; our options will be to the end of this year or later in the year, so we may have some quarterly fluctuation of a modest amount. But generally and not knowing what the market is going to do, we don’t really attribute much of our outlook in terms of what's going to happen in those lines.  Certainly, we would expect even [Santa Claus] to be much closer in magnitude with '08 versus '07. And quite frankly on the strategy, as we operationalize more of it and put more if it in to our various corporate departments and we are really not in a position to track that, where we have in the past, and it’s pretty much become more of our corporate overhead, as well as what we are trying to do operationally.  Depreciation Mark, I may have to do a little more work on that. We’ll come back to you and talk about it in the K and at the Analyst Meeting, but we have spent aggressively over the last couple of years on several very good projects in the CapEx line and I think at this point we just haven't seen the acceleration that’s come from that. I don’t have any particular insights, Kirk do you have anything you want to add on deprecation? 
Kirk Drummond: No. I really don't. The only thing I could say is that we are making longer-term investments. That the assets are going to be longer-term, which would lower your depreciation. 
Mark Husson - HSBC: Yeah. Because some of the early spending on the RDC was software writing, which presumably was written off very aggressively, very early. 
Kirk Drummond: Yes. But then the others, a fair amount is buildings and then the buildings as we go forward with that facility expansion pulled out things like that. Those have got much longer lives. 
Mark Husson - HSBC: Thank you very much. 
Rick Schnieders: Thank you, Mark. 
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Meredith Adler of Lehman Brothers. 
Sean Roberts - Lehman Brothers: It’s actually Sean Roberts for Meredith today. I am just looking at your real sales growth line over the past several quarters. How do you feel with that indexes versus the industry? And I guess what in particular gives you comfort that that can accelerate next year? 
Rick Schnieders: Well again I'll ask my colleagues to pitch in here, but in terms of real sales growth, when we look at what's going on in the industry today we feel comfortable that we continue to outpace the industry and take share from our competitors. So we are very comfortable with that.  The other thing that we have talked about for a number of quarters now, is sort of that illusory number of inflation and frankly it's one that moves around, it can move around very, very rapidly, so we are focusing on nominal, topline sales growth, ex-major acquisitions and just making sure that we leverage that nominal -- that top-line growth. 
Kirk Drummond: Yes. I think Sean the only other thing is that, as Ken pointed out in his comments, the inflation environment is a difficult environment to operate in when it gets to 6% and that's challenging for our customer as well as our operating company management team. So I think it's difficult to see the strong real sales growth when you have customers whose purchasing budgets are being impacted by your higher costs. We feel we are doing a pretty good job managing, so there is always going to be some interplay, as Rick points out, between your real growth and when you have higher inflation. 
Rick Schnieders: And then what Ken pointed out was the ability of those operating companies, which was absolutely terrific to be able to manage through that. I am sure we took some amount of hit on the gross profit line, but the opening companies did a terrific job managing their expenses beyond any positive impact we may have gotten from the higher inflation. So, we are seeing the operating companies leverage their business very effectively. They are going to continue to leverage their business, and I would expect most of that to come at the expense line. 
Sean Roberts - Lehman Brothers: Can you maybe describe that process of passing through the higher cost to customers, and how that might differ between independent versus the chain versus the institutional customers? 
Rick Schnieders: Sure, I mean half of our business roughly is a contract basis, half of it is independent side. And on the independent side of our business, we are just working with the customers on a daily basis, sort of negotiating on an item-by-item basis. And so it's a real-time activity that takes place. And so as new pricing, higher or lower comes into play, it takes some amount of time to get that price change into our customer base and into independent customer base. On the contract side of our business, it's pretty cut and dry. For most items, the non-commodity items, prices would change on a monthly basis. For commodity type items, those who are going to generate a bulk of the revenues and the bulk of the purchases, those change on a weekly basis. So, that's kind of on a [real high level], that's the way the mechanism works. 
Sean Roberts - Lehman Brothers: And they have full transparency into your cost on the contract business or…? 
Rick Schnieders: Well, sure, because they know what their markets are as they are fee structure, so they see the cost, sure. 
Operator: And we'll take our next questions from Steve Chick of J.P. Morgan. 
Steve Chick - J.P. Morgan: Hi, thanks. Good quarter. 
Rick Schnieders: Thank you. 
Steve Chick - J.P. Morgan: Bill, I don't know if you have this handy, but your prepaid expenses jumped a bit in this quarter. In fact, it looks like by most of what I've seen -- looking back in the past I think it doubled what it was in the third quarter. Do you happen to know why that is? 
Rick Schnieders: Yes, I do. We'll talk more about it in the K Steve, but we do have a litigation accrual out there that we are involved in a product liability claim that we believe we are very, very well insured for, but it's progressed to the point when we set up both in accrued expense and a prepaid for roughly the same amount, and that's the proper accounting. So basically, we've added close to about $50 million to the accrued expenses and $50 million to the prepaid, another line to account for that, but there is no P&L impact. 
Steve Chick - J.P. Morgan: Great, okay. Good. There is no cash impact, I guess. 
Rick Schnieders: Correct. This is totally non-cash, non-P&L at this point. 
Steve Chick - J.P. Morgan: Okay, great. And then to clarify, now I understand you want to get at the unusual -- the operating expense items or so forth. Did you say that the net favorable impact was a penny for all of the items or was that just for the quarter? 
Rick Schnieders: Okay. Let me be real clear on this. What we said is on the year-over-year that they largely offset if you look at all of the items. Going back to the third quarter when we gave some selective guidance on the bonuses, we did that because it was much larger now than it had been and to be honest with you, probably at that time if we were to have provided this, which we wouldn't and didn't, we probably would have thought that we would have a hard time for it to be breakeven in the fourth quarter. With the stock market being strong, it turned out that the cash surrender value came in much better than what we thought, which allowed it to basically offset for the fourth quarter. So, I don't mind the COLI gave us about a penny for the quarter. 
Steve Chick - J.P. Morgan: Okay. 
Rick Schnieders: Versus a year ago. 
Kirk Drummond: But Steve, the total of those major items did a balance off for the quarter. 
Rick Schnieders: Yeah, it is important as they are roughly offsetting for the quarter and for the year, it's just add -- if you go back 90 days. I don't know that we would have thought that we'd have offset. But again, we're only talking a penny. But since you're asking that's the situation. 
Steve Chick - J.P. Morgan: Okay, that's helpful. And then last, for the business reviews, did you say what you did complete for the year and down and how many you plan going into 2008? 
Kirk Drummond: No, we didn't. I haven't collected that data as of yet, but I'm sure it's in the 40,000 and we expect that to go slightly going to 2008. 
Rick Schnieders: I think one of the underlying things we've seen there Steve, is that this is, we've been doing this long enough now. That's truly become pretty much -- and accepted best business practices that's what we do and we'll continue to track them internally, but we're probably not going to talk quite as much about the aggregate numbers going forward. 
Steve Chick - J.P. Morgan: Okay, alright, thank you. 
Rick Schnieders: Thank you, Steve. 
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Ajay Jain of UBS. 
Ajay Jain - UBS: Rick, I know you've got a policy of not commenting on the beyond going financial impacts from the RDC but with the second facility coming on stream this year. How do you feel about the year-over-year comparisons? Or the benefits that you're seeing now for the North East, RDC now have to offset the depreciation expense and pre-opening expense that you are going to expect to hit the P&L from the second distribution center in Florida? 
Rick Schnieders: Yeah, Ajay thank you, the real -- going back now for a year for four quarters because, we already see a stuff so now inter-twined with the business itself, the operating companies, we're not commenting partly because again it becomes very difficult as most of the benefits accrue at the operating companies. So, we don't comment on the specifics of the RDC itself. However, I'll just go back to what I did say earlier and that is that we are at, full ramp, the operation is running very, very smoothly, we are very pleased with it and we are going forward with the forward RDC at this point and it's on schedule, it's going very, very well. 
Ajay Jain - UBS: Okay. And can you also confirm what the increase was in headcount for marketing associates and customer contact personnel both for the quarter and for the year? 
Kirk Drummond: 5% for the year. 
Ajay Jain - UBS: Okay. And for the quarter? 
Rick Schnieders: I don't think we know that number, we could get it, but it's a little early to collect all that data from the operating companies. But if it is 5% and it's probably a good number for next year. 
Ajay Jain - UBS: Okay, great, thank you very much. 
Rick Schnieders: Thank you, Ajay. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) And we'll go next to John Heinbockel of Goldman Sachs. 
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: A couple of things, for long-term goals what's the time table for that, is that five years or something different? 
Rick Schnieders: Well, I don't know, we've talked about specifics, but I would say it's three to five years but it kind of ongoing, we are thinking about it as ongoing, but yeah, three or five years. 
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: There will be the seven to nine normalize inflation is probably what around three? 
Rick Schnieders: We think in terms of two and half. 
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: Okay. You’re sort of thinking 4% to 6% real growth on average over that time period? 
Rick Schnieders: Sure, however the numbers workout, but yeah, we were really focusing on that nominal, that topline nominal growth excluding major acquisitions. 
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: How would that -- does that tie in roughly to, I know we’ve talked about this in the past, and how much of the strategic initiative savings get reinvested, and how much go to the bottom line? Does that sort of tie in to a 50:50 splitter or something different? 
Rick Schnieders: Well, we really haven't talked about those numbers, and I will tell you that I don’t know that we know those numbers yet. There is still work to be done, but we are going to share some of those strategically, share some of those savings strategically to help our customers grow our business, grow particular categories and some will come to the bottom line. 
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: Alright, and on gross for the quarter, you know, I thought the number was very good considering inflation and also the drop in corporate brand penetration? Are you seeing now a fairly, I don’t know, if you have a number, but from the strategic sourcing initiative, does that now ramping up -- in dollar terms at a fairly good rate. Was it much better than the third quarter ramping up at that level or not quite? 
Rick Schnieders: Well I think it is ramping up, John. We don’t have any numbers at this point in terms of the overall impact, but the first spend, the first pilot project, six categories was $300 million, the second tranche is about $1.3 billion. We are doing some initial work on the third tranche, and so, again, if we add the $300 million and the $1.3 billion you are still at a fairly small number versus in comparison to the total purchases. 
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: But you guys, do have a -- can you track every quarter the amounts you are saving on sourcing, a dollar amount? 
Rick Schnieders: Okay, we can do, we track it. 
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: Okay, and it sort of increasing pretty consistently on a sequential basis or are we seeing some do we see a jump in the fourth versus the third or not really? 
Rick Schnieders: No, I mean, I wouldn’t want to get into that level of detail, John and leave the extraordinary. I think that, frankly at this point we don't know and the numbers we really don’t want to get into. 
Bill DeLaney: John, this is Bill, I mean, as Ken mentioned, these hundreds of metrics we look at, many of those are along these lines and it’s very detailed and they move around and it’s a process as we’ve described from the beginning. So it’s not quite as scientific as something I want it to be. 
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: Alright, and then finally, I guess, it sounds like you are not in demand for your customers, we are not seeing any real weakening there in light of what's happening with inflation and the economy in general, that’s held up pretty well? 
Rick Schnieders: Yeah, I think the demand is at most customer type. It is very, very level and we don’t see a significant change at this point. 
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Thanks. 
Rick Schnieders: Thank you, John. 
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Alex Patterson of RPM. 
Alex Patterson - RPM: Yes, thank you. Just following up on John's questions about the nominal sales target implicit about a 5% to 6% real growth rate, is that comfort level sort of inflation ignorance, I mean, in other words are you really expecting real growth to re-accelerate to that, or do you really need to get inflation down to the 2% to 3% level to attain that? 
Rick Schnieders: Well, again our target is for nominal which would include the inflation and the real sales growth, and as we've said several times over the past year or two is that, because of all the things that move within those numbers, we are really focusing less on inflation at this point and looking at the nominal sales growth, because ultimately that's what we have to leverage to grow those earnings. 
Bill DeLaney: I think again it's important to impress upon everyone and I think John just asked his question. These are goals that we've targeted for ourselves over the longer-term whether you say three to five years as Rick pointed out. So one of the things we are trying not to do is to get into a quarterly component of each delta here. Because they move around we've gone back and as I'm sure you all having look at the growth in the industry over the last several years and we looked what Sysco has done in those environments. And based on industry history and in our performance in different environments, we thought that this would be a more realistic goal to set over the next three to four years. 
Alex Patterson - RPM: I mean I asked you because really the metric is more important than the nominal sales number as your gross profit dollar growth, as the vehicle to leveraging your operating expense and hitting your bottom-line targets. So I guess what I’m wondering is, are these nominal sales growth targets, really sort of getting towards a gross profit dollars growth target, in sort of a backhanded way? 
Bill DeLaney: I don't think so and I think that the thing that we learn every year and every day in this business is, if there is gross profit, there is expense and we believe that these are realistic growth goals for us to manage the business around. For example, if you take a look at this quarter, if we just look at it kind of line-by-line we would say, well our margins were up but our expenses were unusually low versus the prior year.  So, which is the most relevant? Well, I think the most relevant is in an inflationary environment, our operating margins improved by about four times of the point, and even that's a little bit more than what we would ask you to expect going forward, but I don't know that I would necessarily agree that the gross profit is the defining line. I think the way we are looking at it, as you got sales line, then you've got operating margin line, and when you get to that operating margin line, we expect to expand that over time to leverage those earnings, and a lot of things that are into this product mix, customer mix, and then these types of environment that we are working in today. 
Rick Schnieders: But we do expect most of their gain as we've suggested previously. Most of the gain will come at the expense line and we are working hard to make sure that we are -- our systems are in place to drive our expense ratios down. 
Alex Patterson - RPM: Yes, okay. Well okay. Thanks. The shipping and handling for the year was that up or less than the rate of sales? 
Rick Schnieders: Yes. 
Ken Spitler: Yes. 
Bill DeLaney: Yes. But in comparison it absolutely was. 
Alex Patterson - RPM: Okay, great, thank you. 
Rick Schnieders: Thank you. 
Operator: We will take our next question from Andrew Wolf of BB&T. 
Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets: Good morning, congratulations on a nice quarter. And obviously in the quarter for everything you are saying in the numbers, how they flushed out to the bottom-line, you manage in the quarter nicely against inflation and obviously in the systems and everything like that. But Rick, I mean, let me just speak out what my view of the world is and I would like you to answer that, if this inflation stays high it's just can't be anything but tougher for your customers, and vice versa.  I mean if [Gerry] stops inflating 20% and comes back down, that will be good and if it stays up at 20%, I just don’t frankly see how it helps them. Either their bottom-line gets contracted or they try to pass it through and restaurant prices go up. Could you just sort of -- I mean you folks have a view internally on how you're looking forward -- your sort of, what's sweet spot for inflation and as what investors should think about in that regard? 
Rick Schnieders: I think a sweet spot for inflation is roughly that 2% to 2.5% number, that is kind of the traditional number. We operate better in that environment. We think that our customers do also. But I will tell you Andy that we work very, very hard with our customers to help them manage through this difficult time. So things like -- we will help them do pricing on their menus to make sure they are staying up with the cost that they are experiencing, that they are putting that into their menu costing. We help them find alternative products to introduce to their patrons, is either a special item or on their menus.  We have fairly sophisticated menu printing and reprinting services that we provide for our customers also. And so I think the other things is, when you start talking about the industry as a whole, it's kind of like averages and it becomes very difficult. We have many, many operators who are terrific in managing in these difficult times. They up their promotional spending. They draw customers into their restaurant. They manage their menu appropriately and they manage their menu pricing appropriately. So, I think there is a core of customers, they are here today and will be here in ten years who will go through these more difficult times and be very, very successful going through them. So, what we can help is that we just help those customers, help our customers in these more difficult times. 
Ken Spitler: But as I said, Andy, this is Ken. As I said in my opening comments, we don't think that level of inflation is good for our customers or us. We would like to see it less than that six down in the 2, 2.5 to 3. 
Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets: Thanks. And Rick just last to follow-on, because the way you spoke about, obviously certain operators being much more adept, is there -- could you, averages sort of being if not misleading less than FIFO. Is there any, would you classify or draw any distinctions you have how independent operators, let's say stronger independent operators, which Sysco was I think very well penetrated with, versus your typical chain. Do you think a strong independent had this, is that what you are talking about the independents have? 
Rick Schnieders: Yeah, in general, because they have greater flexibility, they can move more quickly than chains can. But frankly chains are pretty good at moving pricing also. So, there are various student management teams in those major chains. But the independents are certainly more fleeted foot, they have got one operation or two operations or five operations and they can kind of adjust to the circumstances that present themselves. 
Ken Spitler: We find that the independents are able to move from product to product a lot easier in terms of menuing. So, I think that's an advantage for them. They can roll it out pretty quickly. 
Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets: Thank you. 
Operator: We will take our next question from Rick Lodewick of Searock Capital. 
Rick Lodewick - Searock Capital: Hi, how are you? 
Rick Schnieders: Fine, good morning. 
Rick Lodewick - Searock Capital: I just had a couple of quick housekeeping questions. With respect to the tax situation with the government, do you guys have any update on that? 
Bill DeLaney: Rick, Bill here. No, we are still in the fairly early stages of the appeal process. We have written our protest, respond to their letter and we have written ours and we are going to work through this thing and probably we will take the better part of the year before we have some type of stronger conclusion on what is going to play out. But we feel very good with our position as we said all along. 
Rick Lodewick - Searock Capital: Perfect. And just a quick question. If you disclose or can you disclose the allowance for bad debt that was associated with other receivables. Is that change meaningfully as the percentage of the receivables year-over-year? 
Rick Schnieders: Sure, our bad debt numbers this year were very close to last year. We set a record last year, it's a very small percentage of our revenues. 
Ken Spitler: We had a good year in terms of what we call right also in this year and now we'll have more detail for you and that in the filings. 
Rick Lodewick - Searock Capital: Okay. When is the filing expected to come out? 
Ken Spitler: I think it's the 29th of August. 
Rick Lodewick - Searock Capital: 29th August, okay. And you guys have changed the accounting for the COLI last year and now it's starting to cooperate through it sort of creating this volatile income stream or unpredictable income stream that I think the change was intended to avoid, I mean, if you have any thoughts to going back to the old method of accounting here or what are your thoughts on that? 
Ken Spitler: Yeah, I have been thinking about two weeks, the answer is given in this call. And also this is – Rick, the thing is that we misinterpreted an accounting proclamation when we changed to beginning of fiscal 2007. We thought we could go to the cost method which frankly will be a lot easier and we'd make it simpler for you to understand as well.  And it turned out we misunderstood that, so then at the end of the third quarter we went back and restated the impact was not material for the year. It's not even material for the quarter but to your point again, it does create a little bit of volatility more of your attempt than anything else I think as far as of our communication.  So, it's not a big deal which is something smaller scale like pension expenses. So something is going to be volatile and in this case it's going to -- one thing, I think, I can tell you is when you see the equity markets performed well, we should do -- we should get a little bit of benefit and when they don't perform well, we will get hurt a little bit and but the accounting we are using today is the appropriate accounting. 
Rick Lodewick - Searock Capital: Thanks. 
Ken Spitler: And the only accounting we can use. 
Rick Lodewick - Searock Capital: Right, I think I got it. Thank you. 
Rick Schnieders: Operator, we will take two more questions, okay. 
Operator: Thank you Sir. We will go next to Mark Husson of HSBC. 
Mark Husson - HSBC: Yeah, a bit of follow-up here just one on the general competitive environment. U.S. Foodservice kind of -- just to catch your attention -- has disappeared into the more of some interested private equity people but the EBITDA interest coverage is not much better than one. What do you think that goes to a competitive environment and what is it look like right now, do you see anything upfront? 
Kirk Drummond: Well, we have seen much changed it all, a lot of rumors flying around but no real change. 
Mark Husson - HSBC: I guess the second question would be, if we are right and the low EBIT margin is something to do if they have some large chunks upon profitable business and is there any conversations happening that you can talk about, about you might like some of those businesses or no? 
Kirk Drummond: We like all their business, but no there are no conversations going on which we can share with you. 
Mark Husson - HSBC: Okay. I like that last bit. And then, final question is, you had mentioned, I think, in the last analyst meeting that as food retailers are increasingly selling good food and prepared food, there may be some opportunities in that market and maybe also in an Asian cuisine and things like that, would you think look at to try and boost your growth rate or are there some other up-markets out there that you are starting to work with? 
Rick Schnieders: I think that's a big one, Mark. The other one that we continually work with, it's a smaller segment. Certainly today it’s this meal assembly business, which is best characterized perhaps by the company Dream Dinners, I don't see [a analog], which is a really good operation and a great customer of ours where consumers can go in and prepare meals for the next two weeks or month or whatever at very reasonable prices, good menus, good ingredients.  So, I think that’s one small sort of trend out there that’s an opportunity for us that we are taking advantage of. But frankly we need to do a better job with the retailer, so I think have gotten better with take-out food and more aggressive with take-out food. We are focusing more heavily into that market. 
Mark Husson - HSBC: Okay. Great. Thank you. 
Rick Schnieders: Thank you. 
Operator: And we’ll take our final question today from Westcott Rochette of Bear Stearns. 
Westcott Rochette - Bear Stearns: Thank you very much. Just a question on kind of where you see the inflation environment right now, kind of how we peaked and kind of what your outlook or built in to your outlook, say over the next 6 to 12 months? 
Rick Schnieders: Westcott, I would tell you that we are not smart enough to figure out what's going on in the inflation area over the next even few months. As you know, there is a lot of pressure certainly in the corn markets. There was the largest corn crop in history, I believe, plan of this year, but it’s a really difficult thing to predict. So I don’t know, I’ll ask Larry maybe, Larry Pulliam was with us this morning. Larry can give us some updates in regard to what he is seeing in the product categories himself. 
Larry Pulliam: Yeah, Rick I would have to agree with you, your assessment on it. Westcott, we track commodity cost in just about every category from all the grains, very last top, fuel packaging and we measure it on ongoing basis. We measure it on year-over-year, and clearly and now you have seen some of these things as well, this last quarter it was just unbelievable. Corn prices, grain, soybean and we really don’t have a good feel of where it’s going to go.  We track it very closely, we monitor it, we see the impact it has on our food products, and as Ken said, we have the capability of having the penetration with our territory sweet customers and MA sub customers, so we can help them to move to certain other products, but we ask, we don't know where it is going to go. We have no idea or don't have a good feeling that it's going to be less in the near future. 
Westcott Rochette - Bear Stearns: Thanks. And then…. 
Ken Spitler: And it seems to be a lot of different things at play, political, some droughts, the field situation. It's a little more complex than I think we’ve faced before, but we are prepared for it and we are prepared the leverage whatever comes at us. 
Westcott Rochette - Bear Stearns: And just, in general, I know you guys talked about how different customers are dealing with the inflation. Are you seeing in working with your customers generally increasing product menu in order to deal with it or just kind of absorbing it for the near-term and kind of piecing of where we are in that cycle? 
Kirk Drummond: I mean I guess this wouldn't be just a temporary price increase by all accounts. Inflation is kind of on a relatively higher sustained level. So, can you just comment? 
Rick Schnieders: We want to work with our customers on a regular basis because these kinds of changes, as we have suggested here this morning, can happen often. They can be pretty volatile, they can go high very quickly. They can go -- the pricing can go lower very quickly.  So what's important for us with those 8,000 sales people that are on the streets is making sure that they have the ability to communicate with those customers, and when they see changes in particular product category, that they help their customers make the appropriate price changes on their menus. It’s the only way they are going to survive. So it's part of the way we work. 
Westcott Rochette - Bear Stearns: Okay. Thank you very much guys. 
Rick Schnieders: Thank you. And I would like to thank everybody who has been on the call with us this morning. We feel very, very good about the quarter, as you probably heard in the comments today, and we feel very, very good about 2008 and beyond. So again, thank you for your interest, thank you for participating in the call today, and have a good day. 
Operator: And that does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.
