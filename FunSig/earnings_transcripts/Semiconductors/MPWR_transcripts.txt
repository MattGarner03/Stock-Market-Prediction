===== 2025 Q1  (2025-05-01 17:00:00) =====
Genevieve Cunningham: Welcome, everyone, to the MPS First Quarter 2025 Earnings Webinar. My name is Genevieve Cunningham, and I will be the moderator for this webinar. Joining me today are Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS; Bernie Blegen, EVP and CFO; and Tony Balow, Vice President of Finance. Earlier today, along with our earnings announcement, MPS released a written commentary on the results of our operations. Both documents can be found on our website. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone, that in the course of today's presentation, we may make forward-looking statements and projections within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that involve risks and uncertainty. Risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ from these forward-looking statements are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q1 2025 earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K, which can be found on our website. Our statements are made as of today and we assume no obligation to update this information. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bernie Blegen.
Bernie Blegen: Thanks, Gen. Good afternoon, and welcome to our Q1 2025 earnings call. In Q1, MPS achieved record quarterly revenue of $637.6 million, slightly higher than the fourth quarter of 2024 and 39.2% higher than Q1 2024. This performance reflected the ongoing strength of our diversified market strategy, consistent execution, continued innovation and strong customer focus. Let me call out a few highlights from the first quarter. At our March 20 Investor Day, we showcased MPS innovation across a range of areas, including new opportunities in robotics, automotive, data center, building automation, medical and audio. In Q1, storage and computing segment revenue increased 38% quarter-over-quarter on strong demand for both memory and notebook solutions. We continue to win designs across all major enterprise data customers with revenue ramps expected in the second half of this year. Finally, Q1 2025 automotive revenue increased 13% from Q4 2024, the third consecutive quarter of sequential double-digit growth. MPS continues to focus on innovation, solving our customers' most challenging problems and maintaining the highest level of quality. We continue to invest in new technology, expand into new markets and to diversify our end market applications and global supply chain. This will allow us to capture future growth opportunities, maintain supply stability and swiftly adapt to market changes as they occur. Our proven long-term growth strategy remains intact as we continue our transformation from being a chip-only semiconductor supplier to a full-service silicon-based solutions provider. I will now open the webinar up for questions.
A - Genevieve Cunningham: Thank you, Bernie. Analysts, I would now like to begin our Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Tore, your line is now open.
Tore Svanberg: Yes. Thank you, Gen. And congratulations on a strong quarter, especially during this environment and especially the cash flows. First question is on enterprise data. So it did come in line with expectations, but you talked about some second half design wins ramping. Should we infer by that, that this is sort of the low point for enterprise data this year?
Michael Hsing: Yes. At this time, we feel, of course, when we're close to the second half of the year, so we feel a lot better. And overall numbers can be better. But at this time, we're not forecasting and how good is good, okay. And so we have a lot more confidence than at the beginning of the year.
Tore Svanberg: Great. Yes, go ahead, Bernie.
Bernie Blegen: I think it's important to say that we're engaged with many different programs, either that we have the design wins or the qualification. So it's very broad-based. It is Michael says, while our visibility is improving, clearly, the improvement is second half weighted.
Michael Hsing: Yes. That's a good comment. There is a – we do win many design – we have many design wins and customers design it in, and we're just waiting for the ramp.
Tore Svanberg: Great. Can I ask a follow-up?
Michael Hsing: Yes. Go ahead.
Tore Svanberg: Yes. So as my follow-up, Michael, I know over the last decade or so, you've been working really hard to diversify globally, whether it's R&D centers, manufacturing partners and so on and so forth. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about those efforts, especially given the current tariff environment. And how are those efforts really impacting your position right now?
Michael Hsing: Yes. That's a good question. Started 10 years ago, we start to emphasize, you have a local manufacturing for local customers. And the U.S. was out of China, started – particularly started in the last couple of years. And right after pandemic, I mean the volumes and we almost double – more than double our volumes and that we need to expand the fab capacities and the serendipities, and we all expanded outside of China. And at that time, the inside of China was full. And so now they give us a very good position for outside of China for supplying the U.S. side and as well as the inside China so now that we're in a much better position now.
Tore Svanberg: Great. Thank you for that. Congrats again.
Tony Balow: Tore, the only thing I'd add, right, from addition to the supply chain, right, the diversification approach has really been on the front end as well around R&D. So we've been looking both the design and the supply, that's really been a hallmark of the strategy over the long haul here.
Michael Hsing: Yes.
Tore Svanberg: Great. Thank you.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham. Quinn, your line is now open.
Quinn Bolton: Thank you. And I'll offer my congratulations as well on the strong results and outlook. I guess, Bernie, Michael, maybe a follow-up on Tore's question just on enterprise data. I think you came into the year thinking enterprise data could be anywhere from flat plus or minus 20%. It sounds like you feel a little better about the business now. Wondering if you might be able to sort of tighten up that range on enterprise data. And then specifically, one of your large customers sounds like there may have been a platform change. And I think some investors are concerned that, that platform change on their next-generation GPU could have an impact on your share. I'm wondering if you might be able to address just your thoughts about how you're positioned in share as you come into the second half of the year.
Michael Hsing: We were told by many customers, we offer a breadth of product that meets our customer needs. We don't comment on specific customers. And we don't – and also the matter of fact is we don't know which our customers projects are going to ramp, or they changing as you said, and changing the schedules, these are our concern and we don't know and their decision, but we have enough product, we can meet the demand. And we're winning – we feel better is because our customers recently qualified many of our products from the IC levels or to module levels. They passed many rigorous testings and they feel good about it and we see so we feel good about it, we expect it to have a ramp. So at this time, we are not going to forecast what's the half year, in the past, we said – last year, we said that this year could be a flattish in our numbers. Let's see, let us deliver numbers hopefully, it's better than we expected.
Bernie Blegen: Yes. And I think that Michael is right that we have increased visibility because of design win and the qualification processes down the road in another month. But still, as far as when the actual product ramps occur is outside of our control. So while I think that we feel more confident overall, the timing as far as the plus/minus against the range, let's leave it wide open for right now.
Quinn Bolton: Got it. And then maybe a follow-up question just Bernie on the second quarter guidance. It looks like gross margin ticks down by about 20 basis points at the midpoint. I wondered if you could just sort of address that. Is that just sort of mix shift within the product groups? Are you starting to see either tariff costs and/or pricing pressure? What accounts for the slight drop in gross margin in the second quarter? Thank you.
Bernie Blegen: Sure. There's not a specific event that we're pointing to. We're just saying that there's a mix of different things that may or may not be inside of our control. And so we're just being basically 20 basis points more conservative.
Michael Hsing: Yes. Overall, all the new products that we released will have higher margins, the higher volumes, the margins is lowered. But we're not going to intend to operate much below our corporate average. That's our goal.
Bernie Blegen: Yes. We stay within the range.
Michael Hsing: Yes. We stay with our model.
Quinn Bolton: Perfect. Thank you.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Ross, your line is now open.
Ross Seymore: Hi, guys. Congrats on the results and guide. Thanks for asking the question. Bernie, in the first quarter, you had a very wide and divergent performance by segment to get you still to upside overall. Just wondering if there's any large segment moves in your second quarter guide, any kind of big divergent moves that you'd like to highlight?
Bernie Blegen: No. Actually, the range of variance for all of the groups is plus/minus 5 percentage points. So actually, we're seeing a very narrow change sequentially. And it's worth commenting there that I believe that if we were heavily influenced by pull-ins, for example, that we might have seen a more dramatic falloff in a particular market segment. But when we look against particularly year-over-year, our strength is fairly broad-based with enterprise data, as we've talked about, still looking for the ramp in the second half of the year.
Ross Seymore: Got it. And I guess that leads to my second question, which was going to be something you kind of just touched on, which is the tariff side of things. I know you talked earlier about diversifying your manufacturing and Tony mentioned about diversifying the R&D side of things. But as far as the pull-ins, push-outs, any sort of different behavior from your customers, I've been surprised how little of that has been admitted to or has actually occurred by some of the other analog companies. And so I just wondered what you guys are seeing.
Michael Hsing: If it happens, there's some pushing and pull out and pulling a pull out and a push out. And those are numbers small enough we don't clearly understand it, okay? And the overall numbers is very consistent. As you see it, Bernie mentioned the Q1 the computing segments grow the revenue growth, so that's also as expected from last – the previous quarters. We have a lot of design win in those areas, and we turn into our revenues.
Tony Balow: And Ross, like in that area, for sure, right, there's a lot of other business factors beyond just potential tariff-related pull-ins because there's AI PC, there's the end of Win 10 support, there's gaming. There's a lot of things that are driving the good business there as well.
Michael Hsing: Yes. The key is the diversification. And the best thing I can't – I can look at the numbers, I can't have any target number that I want to analyze, okay? Everything looks very smooth.
Ross Seymore: Got it. Well, let's hope it stays that way. Thanks, guys.
Michael Hsing: Yes. Okay.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer. Rick, your line is now open.
Rick Schafer: Thanks, Gen, and congrats guys on the solid quarter. I guess my first question, if I could, is really on data center or server power, rack power to be specific. You talked about your 400-volt rack power solution at Analyst Day. I think you highlighted like 600 kilowatts within a couple of years. I mean we're seeing more in the press about even megawatt racks within the next handful of years. So I'm just curious if you could elaborate on the expected market opportunity or TAM there and sort of when rack power sales are expected to become material for MPS?
Michael Hsing: Yes. Our customer asked us to pull in, I believe with this month, we start – if not this month, next month, we deliver samples. I think this month, okay? We deliver modules, each module level is like 120-kilowatt levels. And for each modules, you add together somewhere about 600,000 kilowatt to 1 million watt power. And so we do have a product for that. And well, we do have initial development, now we have samples, okay?
Rick Schafer: Michael, not to press you on it too hard, but would we see revenues like material revenues this year? Or is this more of a sample year, qualification year and it's more of a 2026 revenue driver?
Michael Hsing: I believe it's 2026, okay? And if you – we expected to have a higher revenue come from that type of modules. And so at the same time, we prepare our production ramps, production qualifications and there's a lot of work in the second half of the year. But we fully expected it and we anticipate that part of the growth.
Rick Schafer: Thanks for all that, Michael. And then my second question is really on auto and to me, I think you have several like material content drivers ramping this year. You look at 48-volt transition beginning 800-volt battery transition. You've talked about power isolation modules. I know you talked about that at Analyst Day also. I guess I'm curious, kind of a similar question in terms of like how much do you expect BMS to contribute to that segment to auto segment revenues this year? And I guess I'm curious if there are any regions favored within that.
Michael Hsing: Yes. Of course, China's model changes much faster than any other regions. But we do see in the U.S. and Europe, even Korea, okay, we're changing and changing not only from 400 volts to 800 volts and also from 12 volts to 48 volts. And those segments started very – these are still early at the very early stage. And we do ship those products now, okay, to those segments. And I believe all the early changes, we are all in it in every model.
Bernie Blegen: Yes. And I think in automotive, in particular here, because we've heard some concerns about unit volumes from North American and Chinese EVs in particular. But when we look at our second half, a lot of the momentum will be design wins that we secured in previous years that are coming to market, particularly in North America and in Europe. So we have really – it's a content-driven second half story for automotive.
Michael Hsing: Yes. What you mentioned about 800 volts, 48 volts and those probably we'll see a lot more in the 2026 and 2027.
Rick Schafer: Great. Thank you, guys.
Michael Hsing: Okay.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Joe Quatrochi from Wells Fargo. Joe, your line is now open.
Joe Quatrochi: Yes. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to follow-up on your comments on the storage and computing segment. I can appreciate you guys are seeing some design wins ramp. I guess as we look forward here, just given like the abnormal seasonality, strength that you saw in 1Q, how do we think about that business kind of throughout the rest of this year?
Michael Hsing: Are you talking about seasonality? I don't know. Nowadays, the proper MPS of being a public company now 21 years. And in recent years, I don't know what the seasonality is. But we talk about the design wins in the memory side, okay, the memory part of the power management. And we're talking about for the last year or two or so. And I think at one time, we will ramp up this year, but we don't know these are kind of things plus/minus quarters, and you get it close to us and you get orders by the end of the quarter, they don't push up. Now here's the numbers. And we're not very good at forecasting the numbers, but we are good pretty good at delivering numbers.
Bernie Blegen: But I think a really important point here as well is that how broad-based this is. So we're looking at DDR5, SSD, even HDD on the memory side. And then as Tony pointed out previously that within the notebook that there are a variety of factors that are driving that end market as well. So...
Michael Hsing: CPU side, notebook side, CPU side, desktops and notebook side. And Bernie mentioned all these segments, these are pretty evenly growth, maybe memory side, the DDR5 is a little bit more than the other ones. But they're pretty much evenly growth in all each segments.
Tony Balow: Yes. And Joe, just relative to what Bernie said before, going into Q2, everything is plus or minus a couple of points kind of thing. So you would infer from that, that, that segment would not see a sharp fall off necessarily in Q2.
Joe Quatrochi: Yes. No, that's helpful. I appreciate it. Maybe as a quick follow-up. Looking at the enterprise data side, maybe on the non-AI segment of that market, how are you thinking about traditional server CPU demand this year?
Michael Hsing: They're doing good. And as you probably know, listen, okay, all these are a lot of servers has a refresh, adopting whatever the Intel's the latest models. And we expected – as we said it in the beginning of the last year, the year before, we will increase our market shares. And now we're pretty much okay. And we see as we said it, and years ago, last year.
Bernie Blegen: And I think just to stay on that point for a little bit longer is that, again, much like the other areas of our business, we're seeing consistent steady growth. It's not like a spike or a hockey stick.
Michael Hsing: We will gain shares in the next year, I think we even gain a higher percentage in the server market.
Joe Quatrochi: Perfect. Thank you.
Michael Hsing: Okay.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Gary Mobley of Loop Capital. Gary, your line is now open.
Gary Mobley: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the solid first half performance. On the topic of China, can you give us a sense of how big your business now is in China relative to local indigenous consumption? And given your China for China manufacturing supply chain, how has that and how will that position you versus your larger U.S. competitor?
Michael Hsing: If you know our story, this is – a lot of design and a lot of design activities and a lot of manufacturing happening in China 10, 15 years ago. And started 2016, we diversified not only from the – before the U.S. and China and started 2016, 2017, we established placing in Europe, multiple places since then. And as I mentioned, before mostly our manufacturing partners that's in China after the pandemic, we migrate a lot by serendipity, I said earlier. And as a result, was the capacity within China. So we announced. And so I don't know how we engage with our competitors, okay, if there's any concentration or concentrated in the U.S. for production or concentrated in China in the current environment, neither of a good. You need a really balanced. And in China, your manufacturing, particularly manufacturing for China in the U.S. is outside China, and the same as Europe.
Gary Mobley: Okay. As my follow-up, I wanted to ask about capacity and customer order lead times. It appears as though you have almost half a year's worth of inventory on your balance sheet. And you probably have infinite manufacturing availability, at least in the intermediate term.
Michael Hsing: No. Quite infinite. Yes, so we have a lot. Yes. Okay. Go ahead. Sorry.
Gary Mobley: So my question is, have you seen any sort of uptick in customer order lead times? And related, has that improved your visibility or your backlog or any of those forward-looking metrics?
Bernie Blegen: So as far as the inventory, let's take that on first off, is that we're a little bit – our model is to hold about 180 to 200 days on our books, and we're well below that level right now. When we look at inventory in the channel, we also see that, that is very lean against what we typically experience or what our model is. As far as the lead times, they're actually holding pretty well as far as what we're seeing in the supply chain. And as I've commented in prior comments that in certain of our end markets, they do demand short lead times, and so we have to build ahead of their demand. I think though, right now, we have a lot of flexibility, we're very well positioned regardless which way the market goes.
Michael Hsing: Yes. If you know our – we targeted 180 days to 200 days for many, many years, and – because for the new – all the new product ramp. And in Q1, I don't know if you remember, as I said, the inventory levels very low, both from our – both from a disti levels and as well as within MPS at the very low levels, I may even said it, it was unhealthy levels, too low. And overall, our strategy is we always hold more inventory than in disti. And we have a better management.
Gary Mobley: Thank you.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Joshua Buchalter of Cowen. Joshua, your line is now open.
Joshua Buchalter: I wanted to follow-up on Joe's question from…
Tony Balow: Josh, are you there?
Michael Hsing: We can't hear. Oh, I cannot hear you. Now it's better.
Tony Balow: Yes. I can hear you now.
Michael Hsing: Nope. Now it's cutting out.
Joshua Buchalter: Oh, no. Last try. Good?
Tony Balow: There you go. We can hear you.
Joshua Buchalter: Okay. I'm sorry about that, guys. It's my first time on Zoom. I wanted to follow-up on Joe's question from earlier on storage and compute. I totally appreciate the share gains that you mentioned, but the 38% sequential growth in what's usually a sub-seasonal quarter for PCs is certainly eye-popping. Are there any more metrics you can give us as to maybe content or share shifts that are going on and to give us comfort that there's not inventory build happening here? Thank you.
Michael Hsing: Well, in the past, we have a few eye-popping numbers, right? So we didn't surprise it. I mean, as we said, it's a pretty evenly growth in the segment, particularly a little bit more than the DDR5 as we said a few quarters ago. Bernie, do you want to…
Bernie Blegen: Yes. Josh, you might recall from my comments from year-end when we were looking at the Q1 outlook, and I said that there was an atypical seasonal uplift anticipated in storage and compute. And against our internal expectations, we came in within low single-digit performance to the upside. So while it maybe counter to whatever seasonality we've experienced in the past, everything rolled out pretty much as anticipated.
Tony Balow: Yes. We have…
Michael Hsing: Okay, go ahead.
Tony Balow: And Josh, just remember that storage compute, you heard Michael say it before, it's growth from both the memory side as well as the notebook side. So it's not all notebook driven that might apply to your seasonality question.
Michael Hsing: And a desktop. And here is we have always – particularly in the last couple of years, and the market is very dynamic. And you see one segment popping up. The other one segment is not so much. And in the last couple of years, you see more. This quarter, is storage and the compute. Last quarter, I don't know, auto, before was enterprise, okay? And we keep like running like a circle.
Joshua Buchalter: Thank you for the color. And then I wanted to follow-up on enterprise data also. You mentioned the increased confidence versus three months ago. Is that coming from your biggest customer in that segment? Or is that more confidence in some of the newer platform wins that you expected to ramp in the second half? And within that, like are lead times still measured in weeks? And when would you expect to, I guess, have more visibility onto the share in enterprise data?
Michael Hsing: Do you imply, we circle back. We feel as the time – as closer to the second half, we feel better, as always, and we have a more clear visibility. Bernie?
Bernie Blegen: No, that's exactly right. We've talked about this in the past. It's not just the main customer, but some of our other customers are operating with shorter lead times. And as a result, we feel very good about the design wins, the qualifications. And as I mentioned earlier, it's really the timing of when they expect to ramp. But even within that, we're getting increasingly more confident.
Michael Hsing: Are you talking about large customers, small customers, when we're looking at all these, they all can be very big, they can all be very big.
Joshua Buchalter: Congratulations on the results and apologize for my technical difficulties again.
Michael Hsing: No. Okay. Thanks, Josh. Okay.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from William Stein of Truist. William, your line is now open.
William Stein: Great. Thanks for taking my questions, guys. Two topics. I wanted to hit on tariffs and then I wanted to hit on some growth opportunities. On the tariff side, people have asked a bunch of different questions, but I wonder if you'd help us understand if there are any direct as in unit costs and unit pricing impact that's influencing your Q2 guidance? And is there any indirect or unit demand impact influencing your Q2 guidance?
Bernie Blegen: No to both questions.
Michael Hsing: Yes, yes.
William Stein: And then at the Analyst Day, you showed some pretty unique products for a semiconductor company. The sort of finished full up the products. As I recall, there was a sonogram. I think you threatened to list that on Amazon, if I recall, but also building automation, you had audio amplifiers. I can't imagine that these are contributing meaningfully to revenue. But I wonder what your customer – either established customer or emerging customer reaction was to this. Did you see anything worth noting that could drive future demand that we want to think about?
Michael Hsing: All I try to do is, as Bernie said earlier, we want to have a silicon-based solution company. I want to monetize our know-how. And for examples, building automation box, we did it. And you add a lot of chicken stuff in the box. So we sell sub $0.50 for all of our products. We added together and we put some software or most of our products is the programmables and now we're making MCUs, we put all together. It can be a very good viable solution for a lot higher dollars and same as ultrasound areas. And these are, to me, very interesting, we can leverage our know-how sell instead of sell $1, $2 parts, now you start to sell thousands, ten thousands dollar stuff. And our customers and sometimes and they are related to our customers. Our customers, they buy – we're talking to a different level of people. We're not talking to engineer anymore, we want to have cooperating with the large companies, we have those solutions. And you can sell – you can buy the entire solution, you can have like a white box, you label it. And or another way is you buy our modules and rather than the chip. It just take much of an effort from their hand. And we do things because we do silicon. We do silicon and we know we can know the module levels and we structure out a little bit with adding more software, it's the entire systems. And depending on the level of our customers' interest, we can engage with them in the chip levels and the module levels on the system levels. And we just want to provide more. And that's our know-how. We leverage our know-how, leverage on the silicon. And I contacted several very, very large companies. They are the leader in the area. There's much, much welcome to these kind of solutions. They want to work with us, and they want to work with us. And this is at the very beginning. That's kind of things we are transforming a company from a silicon only to a solution company. These are the ones. I think we – that's how we – from a silicon to module we grow out of the silicon company, then from our modules, we probably stay in the module level. We are never going to sell blinds and shades or blinds and air conditioning. We are – these are still in the module levels.
William Stein: Great. Thank you.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Chris Caso of Wolfe. Chris, your line is now open.
Christopher Caso: Yes. Thank you. First question is with regard to the power for some of the custom AI projects this year. Could you detail how significant that is for the enterprise data segment this year? And maybe some idea of what the content is on that as compared to the largest customer in that segment?
Bernie Blegen: So when I look at the opportunities, particularly with AI, the products are only getting higher power and they're getting smaller footprints. And it's that area of innovation where we can help lead our customers to their end solutions in a way that our customer – our competitors aren't. So right now, the market has been dominated with really one main customer. And now as we see the second half of the year, in particular, there's going to be a number of new market entrants, and they're all with the same formula.
Michael Hsing: Including a big and small. And the small looks like it will be a big. And the dollar content is it's in half years or years, a few hundred million dollars, okay? I mean it's $500 million, $600 million. These are – it's not unthinkable for half years.
Christopher Caso: Got it. As a follow-up question, maybe I'll dig into some what you talked about on the confidence on the enterprise data as you go through the year. And I guess maybe a little more detail of why you feel a little more comfortable now as compared to where you were at the beginning of the year. Is it simply a matter of qualifications where you're now qualified on platforms that you may not have been qualified on at the beginning of the year? Is it more confidence with regard to market share on those? Just a little bit of what is driving the confidence for the year as compared to where it was 90 days ago.
Michael Hsing: Well, the year is half year. And now the half year, almost half year later, and you feel bad or feel good and it's all going to happen as we're getting closer, okay? And so we see the results as we expected it.
Bernie Blegen: Yes. I say that we've got more positive data points that we can look at. But still how that converts in the year, that's why I mentioned earlier that we're operating within a range of outcomes.
Michael Hsing: Yes. And just we always – one thing we're good at looking in the past, we're pretty good at it as we said.
Christopher Caso: Yes. Thank you.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Jack Egan of Charter. Jack, your line is now open.
Jack Egan: Great. Thanks so much for taking the questions. So I was hoping you could talk a bit about the margin outlook for some of the new accelerator ramps in the second half and into 2026 and 2027. Is there really like a structural difference in the margin profile for those products going into custom ASICs and TPUs versus GPUs, whether better or for worse? I mean, really just any similarities or differences as to how that kind of long-term trajectory plays out would be helpful?
Bernie Blegen: I wouldn't say that there's a structural change. You have individual opportunities that could be plus or minus. So this market – but there isn't a fundamental change in our margin model because of it.
Michael Hsing: Yes. MPS, we want to operate well within our model, we are at the lower end, and we are very much aware of that. And we want to do is we're not going to high volume, low-margin business. It doesn't matter which area. And all these new products, I said earlier, we released, we all have higher margins. And we want to stay on the best performance. We're not competing on the price.
Jack Egan: Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then I guess for my follow-up, as it kind of relates to just the broader analog cycle across end markets, if you kind of strip out Monolithic's new design wins that are ramping and share gains, are you seeing any signals that end demand broadly in maybe some of the more downtrend markets is starting to increase? I mean I'm not sure if you can really separate those factors out. But if you're looking at markets like automotive and industrial, is there anything that gives you confidence that maybe those markets are actually turning around?
Bernie Blegen: I think for MPS, it's impossible to strip out the revenue ramps from new products. I know that we've had a competitor or two that have announced that they've seen a bottoming out or potential improvement. Again, our story has to do with the new product revenue ramps. And in particular, we've talked a lot about the second half as far as enterprise data, but I don't want to ignore all of the other opportunities in all of our other end markets. So we feel very well positioned regardless of the macro for both the second half of this year as well as the momentum we're carrying into 2026.
Michael Hsing: Yes. For – if you know the history, for 21 years as a public company, we only have one year, 2010, we – the year we didn't grow, we missed $3 million. Every year, we grow.
Jack Egan: Right. Okay. That’s super helpful. Thanks so much.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our last question is from Kelsey Chia of Citi Research. Kelsey, your line is now open.
Kelsey Chia: Hi, Michael and Bernie. Thanks for taking my question. So I'd like to dive deeper on the gross margin side. So it seems that legacy wafer pricing is trending down and also you are talking about new ramps in enterprise data and auto. So is there room for gross margin expansion going forward in the second half?
Bernie Blegen: Of course, there is room for gross margin expansion.
Michael Hsing: For second half, no. Yes. We're not going to increase the price to our customer, okay? For next year, that's very positive.
Bernie Blegen: Yes, yes.
Kelsey Chia: Okay. Right. And I'll also like to tap into on the communications end market. So I believe that segment is also benefiting from the AI infrastructure build-outs. I believe on the optical module side. Could you provide more color on those applications? And also, when can we expect – can we expect sort of, like, a similar ramp to these enterprise data, the second half uptick for this year?
Bernie Blegen: Sure. It was interesting because the way we look at our communications market is we have, obviously, the network telecom exposure. We have the router wireless modems. And more recently, we have optical fiber optics. And I would say that when I look at the last two quarters and the outlook for Q2, it's been very balanced. It hasn't been weighted by any one component. And that that’s what we’re seeing. We already talked about that as far as storage and computing and in automotive in particular.
Kelsey Chia: Okay. Thank you.
Michael Hsing: Yes. All right.
Genevieve Cunningham: This concludes our Q&A session. I'd now like to turn the webinar back over to Bernie.
Bernie Blegen: So I'd like to thank you all for joining us on this conference call. I look forward to talking to you again during the second quarter 2025 conference call, which will likely be held in early August. So thank you. Have a nice day.
Michael Hsing: All right. Okay.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-02-06 17:00:00) =====
Genevieve Cunningham: Welcome everyone to the Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. fourth quarter 2024 earnings webinar. My name is Genevieve Cunningham, and I will be the moderator for this webinar. Joining me today are Michael Hsing, CEO and founder of Monolithic Power Systems, Inc., Bernie Blegen, EVP and CFO, and Tony Balow, Vice President of Finance. Earlier today, along with our earnings announcement, Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. released a written commentary on the results of our operations. Both documents can be found on our website. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that in the course of today's presentation, we may make forward-looking statements and projections within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. That involves risk and uncertainty. Risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ from these forward-looking statements are identified in the safe harbor statements contained in the Q4 2024 earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K, which can be found on our website. Our statements are made as of today, and we assume no obligation to update this information. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bernie Blegen. Thanks, Jen.
Bernie Blegen: Good afternoon, and welcome to our Q4 2024 earnings call. In 2024, Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. posted its thirteenth consecutive year of growth with full-year revenue of $2.2 billion, up 21% from 2023. For Q4 2024, we had record quarterly revenue of $621.7 million, above Q3 2024 and 37% higher than the fourth quarter of 2023. This performance reflected the strength of our diversified market strategy, consistent execution, continued innovation, and strong customer focus. Let me call out a few highlights from 2024. We introduced the silicon carbide inverter for high-powered clean energy applications. Initial revenue is expected to ramp in late 2025. Other silicon carbide-based applications are expected to be introduced in multiple geographies during both 2025 and 2026. We developed a family of high-quality, cost-effective automotive audio products utilizing DSP technology from our 2024 XSign acquisition powered by Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. solutions. For enterprise notebooks, we launched a battery management solution and are sampling a new mini phase power stage. These products enable faster charge time and significantly improve notebook battery life. Building on our first analog-to-digital converter design win in 2024, we are developing new high-accuracy 24-bit converters, which are expected to ramp in the second half of 2025. Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. continues to focus on innovation, solving our customers' most challenging problems, and maintaining the highest level of quality. We continue to invest in new technology, expand into new markets, and diversify our end market applications and global supply chain. This will allow us to capture future growth opportunities, maintain supply chain stability, and swiftly adapt to market changes as they occur. Finally, I'm pleased to announce our quarterly dividend will increase 25% to $1.56 per share. And during Q4 2024, we completed share repurchases under a 2023 $640 million authorization. This week, our board of directors authorized a new $500 million three-year share repurchase program. For the three years ending December 2024, Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. has returned 86% of its free cash flow to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends paid. Our proven long-term growth strategy remains intact as we continue our transformation from being a chip-only semiconductor supplier to a full-service silicon-based solutions provider. I will now open the webinar up for questions. Thank you, Bernie.
Genevieve Cunningham: Analysts, I would now like to begin our Q&A session. As a reminder, participants can click on the menu bar and then click the raise hand button. Our first question is from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Tore, your line is now open.
Tore Svanberg: Yes. Thank you, and congratulations on the solid results.
Michael Hsing: Either Michael or Bernie, could you talk a little bit about the dynamics here in the March quarter, especially by segment? You know, obviously, we know some end markets are still soft, yet others are actually quite healthy. So any more color on how you see the various segments in the March quarter would be really helpful.
Bernie Blegen: Sure. As far as our Q1 outlook, I think we need to take the perspective that relative to the size of the market, we're a fairly small player. But we have a lot of greenfield design wins which have been previously delayed that are now starting to ramp as we enter 2025. So when we look at two of the areas that are going to drive most of the growth in the quarter, automotive is continuing to grow, and communications, where we launched some new products in Q3, are bouncing back from Q4 and will continue strong. Memory's demand profile is also very good, and notebooks look to be having a Q1 uplift. We don't know for sure, but we've had many design wins and believe that those are coming into the market. On industrial consumer, we have a lot of new product ramps that are likely to start to contribute at the end of 2025. And on the enterprise data, it will be down.
Tore Svanberg: Very good. And as my follow-up on enterprise data, how should we think about that business throughout calendar 2025? Again, obviously, a lot of different dynamics, you know, different players. You know, the growth trajectory for that business throughout calendar 2025. Any color you can share with us there?
Bernie Blegen: Yeah. We don't talk about it in the near terms in the specific customers as we always do. So, again, I mean, the near term is that we can control our customers' buying pattern, their allocations, and the like, but overall, this is a multi-billion-dollar market segment. We are getting ready for these next few years in the growth, and it's clearly a multi-billion-dollar opportunity. But for us, in near terms, this year could be even or maybe slightly up. Okay. We is our best guess. We don't know.
Michael Hsing: Yeah. Just to add a little bit of color to how we see the year rolling out, we believe that we will be off to a slower start in the first half of the year. But as the year develops, the customer base is expected to broaden as hyperscalers launch their new products. So we have multiple product ramps with both existing customers as well as with these new hyperscalers. So as Michael just said, we believe it's likely to be a flattish year, but we believe that from a quality and supply availability perspective, we're in very good shape.
Tore Svanberg: That's fair. Congrats again on the results.
Bernie Blegen: Thank you.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer. Rick, your line is now open.
Rick Schafer: Yeah. Thanks, guys. I'll add my congratulations. And if I could maybe tack on to the back of Tore's question, I was wondering if you could update us maybe just to give us a sense of the number of accelerated projects that you expect to ramp this year and into 2026. Just to kind of get a sense. I heard you loud and clear, Michael, that this is a billion-dollar-plus TAM. I'm just trying to get a sense of how...
Michael Hsing: It's a multiple billion. Oh, multiple billion. Yeah. Don't be shy about that. We're not shy on it. No. Okay. We don't want to lose that. Okay?
Tony Balow: Rick, this is Tony. I'll jump in. I think what we want to say is we're engaged across all the hyperscalers, but what you heard Michael say was that the exact timing of the ramp is very difficult for us to call. So I don't think we want to put a specific number of customers or exact ramp times out there other than saying that we're engaged broadly across them. As Bernie said, we believe that's going to scale through the second half.
Michael Hsing: I can give you examples. And we foresee that these projects are going to ramp. In 2022, 2023, you look at the automotive side. We said that we have a lot of design wins. And we said, oh, these are going to ramp up, or we put a lot have a lot of inventories. And, 2023 is kind of flattish years. Our customer delayed their launch, so 2023 affected us. But I keep saying it. We don't really care. So, like, and as long as we have a product and it's designing, and designing their new product, especially to look and we're turning to a revenue plus minus twelve months, eighteen months.
Bernie Blegen: And if I could just add to Michael's comments there. When you look at automotive, it was delayed not just in 2023, but also in the first half of 2024 against what we had built inventory and against our expectations. But now, as you can see, it's very solidly on track with two consecutive quarters of growth. And likewise, you could apply that same formula to what we're seeing in the communications with the release of the fiber optics in the data center. So we have the technology, but where it intersects and ramps in the market, a lot of that's a little bit out of our control.
Michael Hsing: Well, you mean the directly AI powers. Okay. We have so many projects working with multiple hyperscale companies, and so we cannot tell which one is, well, ramping first. Okay? I know what the magnitude of ramping. Just we are getting the supply chain ready, get our quality testing facility ready to receive these revenues. Okay. Turning to these revenues. And so the timing we care less.
Rick Schafer: Thanks for all that color, Michael. You know, funny you're talking about auto because that's my second question if I could. You know, the EV conversion to 48-volt power and to 800-volt batteries is sort of set to ramp this year, I believe, and I know you mentioned in the prepared remarks, Bernie, you know, that you're going to be shipping power isolation content. Second half, I think I heard you say, and I believe EV is about three-quarters of your auto business. So I just wondered if you could talk us through sort of what your potential content given all those changes, right, all these additional drivers, you know, what your content looks like last year or potential content per vehicle versus what it looks like, you know, in 2025 with all these new jump balls.
Michael Hsing: Some very good questions. And we mentioned about 48-volt system many, many years ago. Okay? And particularly for auto, now, it became a hot topic. And we have all these products ready. We're designing those new vehicles. And these have a base on 48-volt systems. We can capture a lot. And, when once their product once their vehicles are ramping up, put on the market, and initially, we'll be another dominant player.
Bernie Blegen: And I think that this is the rollout in automotive starts with EV, which is quicker to adapt new technologies onto their platform, but we expect it to continue for multiyear.
Michael Hsing: Yep. Again, Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. provides a 48-volt integrated solution. And all of these high-power modules are all based on the Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. silicon solutions. And those will significantly change all these discrete ways of doing it, accruing together, the 48-volt solutions. So that definitely sets Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. apart from the rest of our competitors.
Bernie Blegen: And, Rick, beyond just pure 48-volt, remember what you saw beginning Q3 was, you know, designs outside of ADAS start to hit the market. We saw more broad-based growth in the auto segment. We'd expect that to continue as additional sockets come to market. So I think that's the other dynamic that's happening as well.
Rick Schafer: Great. Thanks, you guys.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Ross, your line is now open.
Ross Seymore: Can you hear me now?
Bernie Blegen: Yep. Yep. Hi, Ross.
Ross Seymore: Perfect. Hi there. Just want to revisit the enterprise data side of things and, you know, not to overplay that. But the market share gains and dynamics in server CPU side of things, has that changed at all? Because I, you know, I think everybody knows what's going on with key customers and the diversification, you know, market share shifts and those sorts of things. But do you guys have other things that are happening as we speak as well? So I really wanted to focus on the dynamics outside of those, not just with the ASIC providers and other GPU providers, but also with the CPU market share and servers. So any update on that would be helpful.
Michael Hsing: Ross, so let me say something else first. Our inventory is low and the channel inventory is low. We're ramping up.
Bernie Blegen: I didn't know if I had to follow-up on that. It's a very good question. And let me just give you a little bit of what we're seeing. It's a fast-changing landscape. And what I mean by that, it's difficult to offer commentary on enterprise data in its different components. The lines between CPU and GPU are becoming blurry, and in support of both lines of business, we have a lot of standard products. So while we've historically had better visibility in the separation and track them a little more easily, it's hard for us to make more than just a generalized comment about what direction either market segment's going in.
Michael Hsing: Yeah. I mean, I've added that. Okay. We are getting significant shares on the server side. And once you see the server market start to ramping up, well, the Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. revenue will ramp with it.
Ross Seymore: Great. I guess as my non-inventory follow-up, the communication side, you guys did well in that in the second half of the year. It's a little bit choppy still, but can you just give us an idea of the profile of that business? Much is kind of the old comms versus the new comms, and give us a little bit more color on what the growth driver is that gives you the confidence for the year and, you know, I assume it's on the optical side of things, but just a little more details on that would be helpful.
Michael Hsing: We're all laughing, Sanjay. And would you say the beginning of the question so Okay. It was comms. Right? Ross? Yeah. And the communications.
Ross Seymore: Side, it just you know, you guys have been talking about that growing for many, many years, and it finally did last year. But I know there's some, you know, legacy pieces and some new pieces, so I just wanted to try to get some color on the difference between them.
Tony Balow: Yeah. Ross, I think you kind of hit it when you were asking the question. Right? If you could comp us going forward, the area of strength that we've really been calling out is an optical. And we'd expect that to continue as part of the overall data center opportunity that you heard Michael talk about. So I think that's probably the biggest inflection point that you've seen in the past couple of quarters versus legacy business.
Ross Seymore: Got it. Thank you.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Gary Mobley of Loop Capital. Gary, your line is now open.
Gary Mobley: Hey, guys. Let me extend my congratulations as well. I wanted to start with a housekeeping question. Are there any greater than ten percent customers in fiscal year 2024? And if you can't name the customer, can you at least give us a sense of how big that customer was in the year?
Bernie Blegen: Certainly. For the three quarters Q1, Q2, Q3 in our 10-Q, we said that we had two direct customers which are distributors that were greater than ten percent and one indirect customer that was greater than ten percent, and that carries through for the full year as well.
Gary Mobley: Okay. But you can't give us a number that will publish in the 10-K in terms of the percentage of revenue from that direct customer?
Bernie Blegen: Not at this time.
Gary Mobley: I tried.
Bernie Blegen: Alright.
Gary Mobley: Wanted to ask about revenue diversification outside of your traditional power management market. And if I count correctly, there's maybe four shots on goal, and you highlighted some of those in your press release. And that would be, you know, data converters, silicon carbide, DSP audio, and battery management systems. So my question is, you know, how big in revenue terms could that be, and if this fiscal year 2026 time frame? Or said differently, how much of a growth catalyst can be on top of what you're producing in traditional power management?
Michael Hsing: Traditional power management, they're talking about these are low voltage things that if it's what you mean. And, okay, the silicon carbide is, of course, to me, is also in the power management. And, again, but these are much higher powers, not high very high power management. We don't want to put on the numbers, but these are, again, it's a billion, a couple billion dollar opportunity for all of them. For Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. I don't want to put a timeline on it. Okay.
Tony Balow: I was I know it says, you know, we picked a couple for the script, but we only, you know, could put a few in for time. But I think our strategy continues to be plant a lot of seeds in a lot of different areas that can turn into revenue as the market decides what to prioritize.
Michael Hsing: Oh, that's a good point. And they I only yeah. We on March 20th, we have an analyst day. And that game. And this time, you come over, you will see a lot of showcase on the Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. new technologies. And these all will contribute in the next few years of growth. Okay. And if you want to hang on what what is the numbers, okay, I would say that, okay, if you look at the past before Monolithic Power Systems, Inc., what the model it is. We will I don't see anything any reason we should change. Okay? Sure. Faster or slower.
Gary Mobley: Thanks, guys.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham. Your line is now open.
Quinn Bolton: Hey, guys. I'll offer my congratulations as well. I guess, Bernie, Michael, obviously, a very strong start to the year in the March quarter. Your comments about enterprise data certainly sound like that business might be more second half weighted. And so I guess I'm just trying to think, you know, what what sort of revenue pattern would you expect, you know, through 2025? Is the first half, you know, slower, the second half materially stronger? Do you think that you have some puts and takes? And so it's a, you know, kind of more linear ramp through the year. Just any any sort of thoughts on the shape of revenue through 2025 would be would be helpful.
Bernie Blegen: Yeah. So the comment that we made as far as the outlook for the year really looks at, you know, the design wins we've secured and an expectation of what is going to be ramping. Keep in mind, though, that particularly in the AI side of enterprise data, that that is tended to be very volatile and that we have relatively short lead times as far as when we get hard information or POs for actual delivery. So I think that within the context of, you know, what we believe is most likely to happen, we're very secure by saying a flattish year that's weighted to the back half, but how that curve actually plays out over the quarters is to be determined.
Michael Hsing: Yep. Let me add it. Okay. Bernie said model to me is that these industries and, okay, these applications if you will, and again and very at the it is at the initial ramp. And so you're only involved with a we have a few customers. Now so, like, we talked about it before, so we have multiple customers. Okay. And they start to ramp. It's very good for Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. Very we will we've focused on the diversifications. And even within a single segment.
Quinn Bolton: Well, kinda, I guess that was gonna be my my sort of second question just thinking about the enterprise data segment. Can you just give us a sense what you're seeing in terms of one, you know, like for like, pricing pressure and then two, I think some of the newer designs really move away from a silicon-only solution to much more of a module solution, and I assume that those carry much higher dollar content for you. And so do you see, you know, as you mix the customer, you ramp some of the new hyperscaler designs, do you think the blended ASP trends in that business even if you see some like for like pricing, could that go higher through the year as these new platforms ramp?
Michael Hsing: Well, Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. is going to stick with our models. In that game and margin models. We provide performance. If it doesn't fit the Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. business model, we don't take those businesses. And so far, we're the leading suppliers in silicon as well as power modules. And so this is the reason we in a very short time, in the last twelve, twenty-four months, we have engaged with all these hyperscales. We have all these projects designed in it. And also we have many future products in development.
Quinn Bolton: Got it. Thank you, Michael.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Chris Caso of Wolfe. Chris, your line is now open.
Chris Caso: Yes. Thanks. I guess just to start, I just want to make sure I understood correctly that some of the comments. So when you look at the enterprise data flattish for the year weighted to the back half, and I'm assuming that's the entirety of the enterprise data segment, not just that associated with AI. And, you know, maybe you could talk about how you know, you talked about some of the hyperscalers, some of the custom ramps happen in the second half of the year. Is that what's driving that strength in the back half of the year? What's kind of driving that back half weighting?
Bernie Blegen: Chris, that's an accurate observation. It's as we look at the ramps for those SOCs and some of the tensor processor products that are expected to come out. We've been prototyping those, but the revenue ramps are really weighted to the second half. And in addition, some of our existing customers in the AI business in particular have multiple new products that they're ramping, and those will have different demand profiles as well. And then that's just within the enterprise data. I think another important ingredient is what we've referred to as the triple down effect as we see the other applications that are allied enterprise data or AI specifically in memory, optical, and networking, and all three of those are areas for growth as well during 2025.
Chris Caso: Right. And I guess, you know, as you look at the full year, you know, obviously, you know, from what you guys are seeing and, you know, the better than seasonal Q1, you know, it's safe to say you're starting out a little better than, you know, some of the others in the space. You know, what's your thought as you go through the year? I mean, is there any lumpiness with regard to, you know, some of the opportunities that are ramping early in the year that we should consider as we go through the year? Or, you know, is, you know, excluding the enterprise data's business, do you see revenue, you know, kind of on a fairly stable, upslope trajectory as you go through the year?
Michael Hsing: Yeah. I couldn't tell you some. It's very difficult to say sooner than you go by year by year, we don't go by year by year. Okay. I mean, but all the way, we have to report it year by year. And give you examples. Our large customers start to push out some product pulling a lot of other ones. So we can't we can't really tell. So, like, I mean, and other customers, other hyperscales start to ramp. Okay. It's telling us we're going to keep a rim. Whether the ramp has an effect and remove our revenue needles, in Q4 of this year or Q1 of next year, we can't tell.
Tony Balow: Yeah. Maybe the only thing I'd add on Michael is it just goes back to the focus on what you can control. Right? And, you know, the organization looking at providing the best products, you know, with the best quality, and that's what we can do right now. And as the market then, you know, plays through, that will turn into revenue. So don't think we're trying to get into a quarter by quarter debate here, Chris. I think that's how we've more landed kind of in a first half, second half dynamic at this point.
Chris Caso: Alright. Thank you.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Joshua Buchalter of Cohen. Joshua, your line is now open.
Joshua Buchalter: Yes. Thank you for taking my question. A couple of times, you've talked about the hyperscale program sort of driving growth more so in the back half of the year. I guess if we compare these sockets to, you know, what you've already done in AI and the accelerator side, there's a lot of companies in the analog space that are saying that they have power engagements with ASIC vendors as well. Would you expect the majority of these merchant ASIC programs to be dual-sourced, and I know you're not going to necessarily quantify share, but I'd just be curious to hear how you're seeing the competitive environment in these sockets.
Bernie Blegen: Sure. Let me take the first opportunity there. If you look at our most recent track record in the new and I'd say new, relatively new, AI business. The reason we were able to secure a lead position initially is because of our ability to innovate and our time to market along with, you know, our overall performance characteristics. So to the extent that that is valued, in these product launches, those are the qualities that give us an opportunity to have a first-mover advantage. But as we've said a couple of times on this call, when we look at our customers, we don't necessarily control what their decision process is or why. And so, again, we lead with our strengths and believe that we're well-positioned, and then we'll see how the numbers turn out towards the end of the year here.
Michael Hsing: Yeah. You mentioned the second half. You pinged it down as on the second half of the ramp. What we mean is in the very near future.
Bernie Blegen: Yeah.
Michael Hsing: It could be Q1, but Q1 of next year could be Q3 of this year. Or even overlapping in Q2. And a lot of things, as I said earlier. Okay? And our large customers, some of the push out, other ones are pulling to the game. And pulling very urgently. Okay? I mean, so we cannot tell.
Bernie Blegen: I guess to put a punctuation statement, we remain cautiously optimistic, but our momentum is certainly in the right direction.
Michael Hsing: Oh, that's the professional way to say it.
Joshua Buchalter: We always get the more professional answers from Bernie. Okay. No. Thank you.
Bernie Blegen: Thank you both for the color there. As my follow-up, I guess, you know, you're kind enough to give sort of a rough outlook for enterprise data growth for 2025. Any more clues you can give us on how you're expecting, either at the company level 2025 growth to shake out in any sort of, you know, which segments you would expect to be the biggest contributors to growth?
Michael Hsing: Biggest ones, we're thinking is a multiple of them. Yeah.
Bernie Blegen: And we...
Michael Hsing: Sometimes it would pick a number, but it's not it was wrong. Okay? And but other ones are coming up.
Bernie Blegen: And we focus on the diversified growth that that's that is the key strategy we've been playing the same principles for the last twenty-five years.
Michael Hsing: And if this thing doesn't work, then other things will work. Okay. That's always our strengths. And as long as we bring up the best performance, highest performance in the market. We will if this segment slows down for whatever the reasons, other segments will pick up.
Joshua Buchalter: Thank you both, and congrats on the results.
Michael Hsing: Thank you.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from William Stein of Truist. Will, your line is now open.
William Stein: Great. Thanks for taking my question. We start with what everyone's been asking about is enterprise data. I think you highlighted, Bernie, that it's going to be down sequentially. Can you give us a little help on the modeling? Because, you know, down could be down, like, three percent or, like, thirty percent. Maybe just dimensionalize it a little bit to give us some context, please.
Bernie Blegen: Yeah. I think that it'd be really hard. Again, what Michael just said is that the strength of our model is the diversification. And I would probably point to the outlook that we've given in total for Q1 as being a risk profile that we believe we can deliver comfortably against. Based on what we can see in our backlog and the ongoing ordering patterns. But again, trying to actually stratify with a level of precision on the end market at this point might be difficult.
Michael Hsing: Yeah. You may be looking for precision, and okay. And the realities in the business, we go for long terms. And we go for long term. It doesn't mean near term will have uplift in our revenues. Okay?
William Stein: Yeah. Clearly, my ability to model the near term is problematic. A follow-up if I can. Maybe let me switch gears a little bit. Michael, I think in the past, you talked about having some capability in microcontrollers. Historically, you know, I know that it's not, like a focus or it's not a meaningful part of your revenue as well as I understand. Should we expect that to change? There's so many new products you talk about silicon carbide power and converters now and DSPs even. Should we expect microcontrollers or any other digital sort of logic technology to become a bigger part of your revenue over time?
Michael Hsing: Very good questions. And we don't list out a microcontroller as a standalone standard product that we sell. As a matter of fact, we sell many microcontrollers now. Okay? And as I recall, in my mind, can come up twelve, thirteen microcontroller projects is ongoing. Some of those stuff is shipping. But what we sell microcontroller is this on the system level. And as Bernie earlier said, in the last field conference, Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. is evolving to a silicon-based solution company. Microcontrollers play a key role. And all these powers, all these other lighting, all these other audios, and including power supply, including AIs, they all have microcontrollers in it. And we don't list separate the items and the standard microcontroller part. A lot of and clearly oh, also a lot of microcontroller integrated. And that's the reason we don't list it apart. This is separate. Okay?
William Stein: Thank you.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from William Kirwan of Morningstar. William, your line is now open.
William Kirwan: Hey, everyone. Thanks for letting us get a question. Questions so far, so I'll try not to beat any dead horses. But maybe it sounds like at least in the March quarter automotive communication seemed to be driving some of the growth. So I'm wondering if you could just give a broader view into the demand for those markets for 2025 and your opportunities for share gains in those two.
Bernie Blegen: Sure. Well, it's good to hear you in the Q&A, by the way. When you look at the end markets, most of the ones that we have are long design cycles. And automotive probably lends itself to being the most predictive because we secure design win two to three years for an EV in advance when it gets launched. Or as many as four to five years for a traditional internal combustion engine. Now having said that, the timing of those ramps, when it gets the design win comes to market still remains a question mark. But within the context of, you know, six to nine months, we can be reasonably predictive. So in automotive, we see continuation of what's been driving our last two quarters of growth as far as EVs in China. And those will be supplemented in the second half of the year more likely by a European OEM that is going to be bringing up an autonomous driving ADAS solution. As well as additional content opportunities in North American EV companies. And then when you look at the communication side, I think that is we're very early stages of being able to ramp the revenue opportunities, particularly in fiber optics. We started out with two primary customers, but we expect that customer base to diversify over the year.
Michael Hsing: As always the pattern.
Bernie Blegen: Yeah.
Michael Hsing: That's excellent. And then, you know, maybe one just on some of the new products that were introduced at the start of the call. Really just which one of these maybe excite you the most and what are the new markets that you might be able to enter with these that are the most attractive, do you think, from a growth perspective?
Michael Hsing: The most exciting product, we haven't announced it yet. Come over to an Analyst Day. Okay. March 20th. I'm locked 20th. I said, okay. And these are equal babies. Okay? They all grow.
Tony Balow: Should be very same same right now. Yeah. Again, we picked four, but there's many more behind that. So it's hard to pick just one.
Bernie Blegen: Actually, we wanted to have a teaser to make sure we had the best turnout for the investor day.
William Kirwan: Okay. Excellent. Well, we'll wait for more detail in March. Thanks, guys.
Michael Hsing: Alright. Okay.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Hans Mosesman of Rosenblatt. Hans, your line is now open.
Hans Mosesman: Thanks. Congrats, guys. I'll be quick. What is the split for your enterprise data between AI and non-AI, if that's possible? And I have a follow-up.
Bernie Blegen: Yeah. Again, I think we already answered that question by saying that those lines are getting blurry, so we really don't have a meaningful way to make that divide.
Michael Hsing: And our customers are not were not appreciated where we disclose those numbers.
Bernie Blegen: And our customers have made it very clear.
Hans Mosesman: Is non-AI considered memory and optic historically? Just out of curiosity.
Michael Hsing: Different market segments. Optics and communication, memories, and storage.
Hans Mosesman: Fine. Okay. At the risk of upsetting your customers, if you answer what is the share between your historical AI customer for this year versus accelerator customers. What's the split? Is it ten, ninety, or fifty fifty year?
Bernie Blegen: And for this year, and at the end of the year, and we probably will have a more or in the near term where we have a more clear picture, but then now we don't. And frankly, it's not clear where as Bernie said, we're not in a position to answer that game. And also by either by product, they share the same product, and also some customers and doesn't want us to release these informations.
Hans Mosesman: Okay. Thank you very much.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our last question is from Joe Kotraki from Wells Fargo. Joe, your line is now open.
Joe Kotraki: Thanks for taking the questions. Just curious on the notebook strength that you guys are talking about into the first quarter. Wondering this, you know, what's driving that? Is that strength from are starting to see pull for AIPCs or is it channel refill? Just trying to understand some of those dynamics.
Bernie Blegen: That's a great question. In fact, we believe that a lot of the design wins that we've had in notebooks more recently are tied into, you know, new AI product demand. But as I said, it's a little bit of an atypical ramp for Q1. So we really don't have a definitive answer on the why behind it.
Joe Kotraki: Got it. And then just, you know, trying to think about the new projects that are running in the second half for enterprise data. Any help that you can provide and just try to think about, like, the architectures of those solutions that you're shipping to your customers, are you still largely seeing those as being lateral power opportunities or those starting to move to more vertical solutions?
Bernie Blegen: Yeah. I think you heard us talk a couple of times that we're not going to talk specific at any customer or their particular architectural solution. I think for us, what you see us again focus is providing a portfolio of products with the best quality, the best performance, and then the customers can choose what works for them.
Michael Hsing: And going back to Michael's earlier comment as far as basically the value proposition of the principles we operate under, what we're most interested in doing and continuing to do is winning sockets.
Joe Kotraki: Yeah. Our customers have picked particularly does it not want us to reveal the lateral power or vertical power?
Bernie Blegen: Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. This concludes our Q&A session.
Genevieve Cunningham: I would now like to turn the webinar back over to Bernie.
Bernie Blegen: I'd like to thank you all for joining us for this conference call. As a quick reminder, we will be hosting our investor day on March 20th, 2025. Michael and other Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. executives will showcase our vision for innovation and outline key elements of the company's long-term growth strategy. The event will be held at our San Jose offices and will include live presentations, a Q&A session, and demos of our latest solutions for a number of applications and a lot of other markets. If you haven't done so already, please email your RSVP to mpsinvestor.relations@monolithicpower.com. You can also access a live stream of the event on our investor relations website. Separately, I look forward to talking to you again during our first quarter 2025 conference call, which will likely be held in May. Thank you, and have a nice day.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-10-30 17:00:00) =====
Genevieve Cunningham: Welcome, everyone, to the MPS Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Webinar. My name is Genevieve Cunningham and I will be the moderator for this webinar. Joining me today are Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS; Bernie Blegen, EVP and CFO; and Tony Balow, Vice President of Finance. Earlier today, along with our earnings announcement, MPS released a written commentary on the results of our operations. Both of these documents can be found on our website. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone, that in the course of today's presentation, we may make forward-looking statements and projections within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that involve risks and uncertainty. Risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ from these forward-looking statements are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q3 earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K, which can be found on our website. Our statements are made as of today and we assume no obligation to update this information. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bernie Blegen.
Bernie Blegen: Thanks, Gen. Good afternoon, and welcome to our Q3 '24 earnings call. MPS achieved record quarterly revenue of $620.1 million, 22% higher than revenue in the second quarter of 2024 and 30% higher than revenue in the third quarter of 2023. Our performance during the quarter reflected the strength of our diversified market strategy as we experienced improved ordering trends across most end markets and additionally benefited from initial revenue ramps associated with design wins secured in prior years. Let me call out a few highlights. Q3 2024 automotive revenue was up 28% sequentially with improvements in infotainment, lighting, ADAS, and body controls. Communication revenue was up 65% from the prior quarter, reflecting new product ramps for Wi-Fi, optical, networking, and router solutions. Storage and Compute revenue was up 25% sequentially on the strength of demand for DDR5 and SSD memory and notebooks. MPS continues to focus on innovation, solving our customers' most challenging problems, and maintaining the highest level of quality. In addition, we continue to expand and diversify our global supply chain, which will allow us to capture future growth, maintain supply chain stability, and swiftly adapt to market changes as they occur. Our proven long-term growth strategy remains intact as we continue our transformation from being a chip-only semiconductor supplier to a full-service silicon-based solutions provider. I'll now open the webinar up for questions.
Operator: Thank you, Bernie. Analysts, I would now like to begin our Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer. Rick, your line is now open.
Rick Schafer: Thanks and congrats to you guys. I guess I've got a two-part question if I could. The first is on enterprise data. It looked like it was down about 15% sequentially. I don't know if you could give some color on that. Is that one-time in nature? Or does that reflect a more sustained shift in that segment as we look into 4Q and then into '25? And then my second part of my question, I mean, it looked like auto, I knew you listed a few of them Bernie, automotive, industrial comps, consumer all look like they were up pretty materially sequentially. So is that -- how would you characterize those segments, which have sort of been lagging the last few quarters? Do you feel like those have made the turn?
Bernie Blegen: Sure, Rick. This is Bernie. Let me start with the enterprise data. Sequentially, we were down about 1.5% from Q2. And that a couple of things that we've talked about. One is that, we don't control our customers' ordering patterns. So as it relates to the current quarter, we did see a different ordering trend than we'd observed in each of the past six quarters. And then as far as looking ahead, we've been very open about the fact that as far as supply chain security for our customers, that's going to require a second or third competitor to introduce -- be introduced on the share. And so there's a lot of issues here that we've been talking about and that we're managing. But one very important point is that MPS's strength is in the diversity and we don't try to call out a particular end market's results. We try to deliver the company in total. And that's sort of a short-term view, but Michael may have a couple of comments on longer-term view.
Michael Hsing: Yeah. You probably everybody knows that if you look at the transcript from the last year, we talk about it. The market is big and the market is growing. Well the AI requirements is growing. And so the customers initially will take the -- always take the best solutions and to fulfill their needs. And the best solutions and also the speed of the development service, as you, as Bernie said earlier. And that's why we occupied as a pretty large shares, okay? And I mean, last year, we said that, okay, this market is too big and MPS will be always have a best solutions in these applications. And we will talk -- we also talk about in a -- the market is bigger, there will be a second or third and fourth supply to join this segment. And okay and this is the -- and when would have happen? And we don't know, okay. It happened in the last couple of quarters and they gave me in the next years. What we see that, again, the market is growing very fast. We have other ones like SOC side of market segment and like it hasn't really ramped up yet or started ramping. And the other ones like -- other hyperscale like company -- cloud computing companies and their own SOCs and their own TPUs, they call it the tensor processes system. And that those one is our -- still small. We're ramping in the next few quarters, okay? And as Bernie said that, MPS in the past, we always emphasized diversity and we will not be known to be a AI power supply company.
Bernie Blegen: And then, Rick, I think you had a question as far as automotive and whether or not the step up that we observed from Q2 to Q3 was more of a broader trend line or if it was a one-time event. And this we believe is a step up where a lot of design wins have been waiting in the pipeline for the right opportunity. And so we do believe that specific to us, not a discussion about the broader market, but specific to us that the number of product ramps are expected to come into the next -- come into the stream in the next two or three quarters.
Michael Hsing: Well, again, okay, as we -- as we said many, many years ago, there's a lot of new design wins. And when the ramp will take off, we don't know. It will be plus minus a year or so. Do we care? We don't, okay? And then now all these greenfield products start to rejuvenate and that's what you see in the revenue to date.
Tony Balow: And maybe one more comment just for Rick is that, traditionally, we've been talking about strength in ADAS, but what you heard Bernie talk about was, we saw that strength in automotive across kind of all the segments, including infotainment, body controls, really a sign of those sockets that we had won previously now start generating revenue. So it's more broad-based within automotive than maybe we talked about previously.
Rick Schafer: Thanks for all that color, you guys. And maybe, right on that point on auto specifically. I realize that this is a broad-based pickup and it's some place basically design win driven as all things are with you guys. But I'm curious, specific, I mean, NVIDIA did believe it did really well the last year or two with drive, Warren, and I know you guys do power there. So I didn't know if you could talk specifically about China auto and what content trends look like for you guys there and maybe give a sense of how big China auto is now as sort of a portion of your overall auto segment. Thanks a lot.
Michael Hsing: Well, China is again, EV business is booming. And now the tapered off a little bit and looks like it will -- booming again. And we're going in the right direction again, okay. And there's a lot of requirements. And the infotainment and the new type of infotainment and also the ADAS, okay. It's widely adopted in China. And so that's what we see a bigger portion of it is ramping from China. And also we see it in the -- and other than ADAS, okay, we see a lot of other products and grow -- will grow in -- from Germany -- in Germany and in the US.
Rick Schafer: Thank you, guys.
Operator: Our next question is from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Tore, your line is now open.
Tore Svanberg: Yes, thank you, and congratulations on the record revenue. I wanted to follow up on enterprise data. Obviously, you had two very strong quarters, first half of the year, it took a breather this quarter. But how should we think about that business into the December quarter? And Michael, I know you talked about many new product ramps in 2025, but just sort of specifically for Q4, how should we expect that business to perform?
Michael Hsing: As far as I know, Q4, we don't lose any shares and probably it's going in the -- it was the same as the forecast. Okay, we don't, okay, we don't -- we can't really tell. And this forecast was given us to us in a few quarters ago. And we just fulfill that, fulfill the demand. So we'll have a -- that's what we built for me -- in the last couple of quarters.
Bernie Blegen: Yeah. And I think as we look to the outlook and the guidance that we provided, really enterprise data was somewhere in the plus low-single-digits. So again, our customers ordering patterns are really what drives the performance there.
Tore Svanberg: No, that's very fair. And the one big surprise to me this quarter was communications. I think it was your strongest growth segment this quarter. You highlighted Wi-Fi optical networking. Could you maybe just give us a little bit more color what's going on there? I mean, it does sound like you have some new segments there that you are penetrating, especially on the optical side.
Michael Hsing: Well, the opticals, okay, is a data converter, data communications, within the data centers, okay, within the reps, okay. And that's a portion of it. But that's not all of them, okay. Other one is the new Wi-Fi format and okay start to ramping up. That's the MPS will have a lot of reference designs and that's what we see. It's across the continent. All these projects turning to a revenue now.
Tony Balow: So I think the outlook for, again MPS specifically remains very solid. Generally, after you have a big initial stocking in the quarter with a new revenue ramp, it tends to tail off for a quarter, but we see sustainable growth in communications through the first half of '25.
Tore Svanberg: Great. Thank you for the color. I'll go back in line.
Operator: Our next question is from Joshua Buchalter of Cowen. Joshua, your line is now open.
Joshua Buchalter: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. I think in response to Rick's question, you mentioned two factors that sort of drove the flattening out of enterprise data being order patterns and second sourcing. I guess could you -- or could you maybe rank order which one of those had the bigger impact near-term? And in particular, as we think about your customers diversifying their suppliers, are you seeing this more on AI accelerator platforms that are already in the market or is this tied to the newer platforms that are currently ramping? Thank you.
Bernie Blegen: So I think Michael offered that in Q4, we're not expecting Q3 and Q4 to see share position change. So that was really just trying to acknowledge that is a function of being the market leader in the AI. And then over time, as we see a layering of all these new AI opportunities, Michael referred to the TPUs, which will probably begin to ship late.
Michael Hsing: I don't know if the TPU is what I remember is the TPU maybe is -- maybe Google's name, a trademark name. To me it's a tensor processor.
Tony Balow: Tensor processor.
Michael Hsing: Yeah it's all -- that's what we mean. And it's all really -- some of you in the call referred this as SOCs. And we have many design, we engage with many of our customers in many years ago. And those products is actually we see start to ramp in the last quarter.
Bernie Blegen: Yeah. Okay.
Joshua Buchalter: Thank you for the color. And I realize you've got content in multiple different sockets on many of these accelerator cards. And so my question is going to try to oversimplify it. But how should we think about, as we think about some of these new AI accelerator platforms, your content opportunity may be in relationship to power draw of the actual processors or any other helpful Rules of Thumbs you can give us as we try to fine-tune our models in the next year. Thank you.
Michael Hsing: Well, you said, if you believe so like I hope and -- if you believe as we believe, our products, our solution is the best and the most power efficient and the market is bigger. And that portion of our revenue will grow. The rest of the stuff, I don't get -- I don't -- we don't care. Just let it happen. Let the numbers speaks up.
Joshua Buchalter: Thanks, guys.
Operator: Our next question is from Chris Caso of Wolfe. Chris, your line is now open.
Chris Caso: Yes. Thank you. Good evening. I guess, the first question, as we look at your guidance for the December quarter, not a lot changing on a sequential basis. I think you mentioned that the enterprise data will be up low-single-digits sequentially in December. Anything else that you would call out as kind of growing or shrinking different from the average in December? And then following that, given that enterprise data has grown as a percentage of revenue, does that affect seasonality as you look into the March quarter? Is there anything we should be thinking about with respect to the different customer mix as we go into March?
Bernie Blegen: Sure. If you're looking at Q4 by end market, it's interesting you have some seasonality, but currently, we don't believe that any of the end markets are going to change by more than plus or minus mid-single-digits. So it's a very, very narrow range that we're talking about there. And when we look out into the momentum carried into '25, obviously, we don't guide beyond Q4, but it has been seasonally down quarter for a lot of companies, but I don't have a view on what that's going to look like currently.
Chris Caso: Okay. Thank you.
Michael Hsing: We don't, especially, we don't really care. So as long as we have a design, we design and we are in the project with our customers. And when those ramps start to happen, our customer -- they don't have a clear view. And let those products -- let take its own calls, let the numbers speak itself.
Chris Caso: Okay. As a follow-up, as you look into next year, the other part of your enterprise data business on traditional server, that's an area that you guys have been favorable on for a while, but I guess, you've been waiting for the market to improve. We heard some a little better news from at least one of the CPU vendors this week. Can you give some view of kind of the share content, what you're seeing in that part of the enterprise data business as you go into 2025?
Michael Hsing: Yes. It's a good question. Yes, we do see it, and the volumes started picking up. And as we said many quarters -- many years ago and this was -- this rapid sapphire of something. And the VR 14, we will pick up the shares in the 13.5, by serendipity of a shortage and we prove with significant suppliers in that. And VR 14 and what will be a significant, well, one of the big supply in -- in this rapid sapphire growth.
Tony Balow: And maybe just beyond just the enterprise data segment itself, as you see those ramp, right, they'll pull through other solutions like DDR5 memory and continue to be a tailwind in some of the other segments as well.
Chris Caso: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from William Stein of Truist. William, your line is now open.
William Stein: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Michael, I know you often are involved in some interesting sort of sometimes idiosyncratic growth drivers for the company. I know for some time, you were famously tinkering in the automotive end market and sort of searching for more effective solutions than what was available in the market. And I understand your focus has been perhaps more in the home automation market more recently. And I wonder if you can talk to us about, some things that might be on the come in the next couple of years from the company in that end market.
Michael Hsing: Yes. As you know, it's an MPS have a few thousands of our products. So we're in lighting, we're in -- we are in a thermostat and we are in shades controls and we're in all these fan models and security, the window actuators, and the window and door opening actuators. And we're also making MCU now. And those MCU can be a brain of everything while we're just putting the one box and we're putting one box with the software. So and we sell as a kit. Everything is -- everything including it. It's the key is the ease of use. I think this will change the market segment for building automations.
William Stein: That's helpful. Maybe as a follow-up, you mentioned, your MCUs now. There's another category that you entered relatively recently. You're not really known for it as much, but data converters. I know I think you hired a team in that area and you had some very good results for initial product, maybe in the medical end market. Can you talk about traction in that category, please?
Michael Hsing: We are growing in that segment. The revenue is still small. As you know, these are -- these are design cycles is very long. And also the product life cycles 10, 20 years. I mean they will last forever. And those segments win-win some in some industrial side as well as the medical side. And we have -- as we have more product rolling out as a matter of fact in the next couple of quarters some family of standard product. We will gain more market shares in this segment.
William Stein: Great. Thank you.
Michael Hsing: Okay.
Operator: Our next question is from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Ross, your line is now open.
Ross Seymore: Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a questions. I want to go back to the non-enterprise data side, I think by my math, it was up about 35%, 36% sequentially. I know, you guys have a ton of design wins and you're kind of just waiting for them to ramp, but the magnitude of that ramp, the diversity of it, and just the commentary that bookings are improving seems to be at odds with the very muted recovery that so many of the peers are seeing. So could you just explain, do you think cyclical conditions are getting better or is this a very Monolithic power-specific dynamic? Any sort of color on that.
Bernie Blegen: I think, Ross, we're experiencing a little bit of both. Is somebody?
Michael Hsing: House, can you mute it? Yeah. Okay. You can mute it. Yeah. Okay.
Bernie Blegen: So, Ross, you're asking the difference between growth specific to us and what we're seeing in the market. And in the current quarter or let me go back, the previous quarter, we actually saw improvements in our ordering patterns. But they're not a consistent trend. But what we saw in the current quarter was a lot of new revenue opportunities that we received from design wins secured in previous years that were coming to market now, particularly in the communications, particularly in automotive. And then also we saw an improvement in the overall profile of the memory market.
Michael Hsing: Well, as a matter of fact, we see all across the board.
Bernie Blegen: Yeah.
Michael Hsing: Other than AI. Other than AI power and all across the board.
Ross Seymore: And how are you -- I guess as my follow-up, whether it's in the AI side or otherwise, a lot of supply has been added to the market over the last couple of years to address shortages, et cetera. And so a fear people have is that pricing pressure is going to ensue, whether it's more competition in AI power that you mentioned earlier or just a more aggregate holistic increase in pricing pressure. Are you guys seeing any evidence of that?
Michael Hsing: Well, our competitors also some of the Chinese suppliers and they always want to lower the price to get in the market to get in the socket. That's not the game what we played. And so a lot of the -- our customers they don't change those socket. They don't change the -- our products can swap in -- and quickly. And those kind of things is in a -- and also to the way we emphasize diversity. So not in one segment. It has a lot of shipments and a lot of volumes going into the one particular applications. And for example like AI and we will provide the value. Our value is the highest performance. And all the other products let our customers choose and so the history is telling us, our history short, and as we -- as long as we operate in the same principles and the revenue will keep growing and growing the same way. And we see the next couple of years, especially next year, we see -- all these products will grow. And now this is -- which is to see the first sign of it, and all these design win turning into the revenue now.
Ross Seymore: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham. Quinn, your line is now open.
Quinn Bolton: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, first to start off, I think it was for the first time ever in your June 10-Q, you guys disclosed a 10% plus customer. And I'm wondering, I know you haven't filed the Q yet, but if that's going to be an ongoing disclosure, would you be able to provide us if you had any 10% customers in the June, sorry, September quarter? And if so, what percent of revenue was that customer?
Bernie Blegen: So, Quinn, what you're referencing is basically revenue exposure by direct customer and indirect. And when the customer hits a certain threshold according to the SEC guidelines, we need to put a reference to that.
Michael Hsing: But we're never putting a name out there.
Bernie Blegen: No, no. We do not.
Michael Hsing: Yes, this time, we have -- still have a one customer is bigger than 10%.
Bernie Blegen: Yeah.
Michael Hsing: Bernie, you can check that numbers. Is that right? Only two customers and above 10%.
Quinn Bolton: Okay. And we'll get percentages in the Q.
Bernie Blegen: It's one or two.
Michael Hsing: Yeah, I think, it's one or two. You can check that. I believe it's one. Bernie you can check that. No, it's only one. Two will be very big. I don't -- I don't believe the numbers.
Bernie Blegen: We don't. We don't.
Michael Hsing: Yeah.
Quinn Bolton: Okay. The second question is, I know, you don't want to guide to 2025 yet.
Michael Hsing: Hold on a second. Tony, could you --
Bernie Blegen: Check that?
Michael Hsing: Yeah, could you check that, is that one or two? I think the second one is less than 4%.
Tony Balow: Yes, I'll check it. Give me 10 seconds, so I'll get back to you.
Michael Hsing: Yeah. Yeah. So we are, okay, this had to be on our record. And then let's make it clear. Go ahead.
Quinn Bolton: Yes. Maybe while we're waiting for Tony, my second question was, I know you're not going to sort of give a specific guidance out to 2025, but The Street is looking for continued pretty strong growth in the enterprise data segment. I know you've talked about lots of crosscurrents in terms of expecting some additional competition to enter that market, some pricing pressure at existing customers, but you also have the ASIC designs that start to ramp next year. The Street is kind of looking for that business to hit almost $1.1 billion in revenue. And just wondering is that given your crystal ball, is that sort of a reasonable expectation? Do you think that we should be tempering expectations for that segment, given some of the cross-currents you've mentioned or do you want to just kind of keep it one quarter at a time?
Michael Hsing: Yes, I can tell very confident, confidently we will be, okay, let's say that. And when this market -- when this AI market turn into like a regular server market, MPS will be a significant player in that. And now this is not -- became a, what do you call it, reach to an equilibrium yet.
Bernie Blegen: Not a run rate.
Michael Hsing: No, yeah, this is still ramping up. And when this segment is ramping -- when you start to ramping, it's kind of lumpy. You don't see this thing, okay, you don't see -- you can't keep going forever like the first two -- since last year and the first -- in the first couple of this quarters like our first couple of quarter in this year. And next -- and so to answer your question for next year, clearly, so we have a lot more customers as I said earlier, that will start to ramping those designs will turn into -- those design will turn into revenues.
Tony Balow: Michael, just to circle back relative to distie, we'll call out two, for direct, we'll call out one.
Bernie Blegen: Okay. That's a direct customer, not a distie.
Tony Balow: So we'll call one direct. We'll call out multiple distie is higher than 10%.
Michael Hsing: Yeah, well, distie will never come, and because all the reporting we -- that's in the reporting, all the design creation, all the exposures for the end customer is only one. The next one is, I believe, is a less than -- is about definitely is below 5%.
Bernie Blegen: Yeah.
Quinn Bolton: Got it. Thank you, Michael. Thank you, Bernie.
Michael Hsing: Okay.
Operator: Our next question is from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Tore, your line is now open.
Tore Svanberg: Yes. Thank you. I had a similar question to Quinn, but thinking more about vertical power. So enterprise data this year more than $700 million. I assume the contribution from vertical power is still quite low. And if that's the case, as the market does transition to vertical power, could we see this market base basically even accelerate over the next few years?
Michael Hsing: Absolutely. Not in next few years, next few quarters. Yes. We -- as we said, look, we are playing the power module market segments in -- since 2017. And all these technology, all these manufacturing capabilities and that will really benefit for these vertical power. And as speaking, now we are shipping those products in good volumes.
Tore Svanberg: Sounds good. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Ross, your line is now open.
Ross Seymore: Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me get a little follow-up snuck in here. Inventory, I know Michael, you and I have laughed about that in many times like this in the past.
Michael Hsing: That's my favorite topic.
Ross Seymore: There you go.
Michael Hsing: Yeah.
Ross Seymore: In this instance, internal inventory came down by a lot days-wise. What did external channel do? How are you looking at that? Was some of that 35% sequential growth that I referred to in my initial question a little bit ago, inventory fill, or has the channel stayed lean?
Bernie Blegen: No, the channel stayed lean. In fact, our total days went down in the quarter.
Michael Hsing: Well, we want to -- this is not good. We want to build up. And as always, we build the inventory in the -- it's not synced with the market demand. And you see our -- Ross, okay, you're the expert of MPS inventory. If you checked like our inventory levels, it's the opposite of the market demand. And now the market demand for MPS now is very high. So the inventory is low and we don't think that we're going to reign to a shortage issue, but it's at the inventory level is at the uncomfortable level.
Ross Seymore: Got you. And I guess just to clarify, Bernie, when you said total inventory actually went down, you mean just total channel inventory days fell.
Bernie Blegen: Total channel inventory, yes.
Michael Hsing: Channel inventory is also low. yeah.
Ross Seymore: Got it. Okay. That's it. Thanks guys.
Operator: This now concludes our Q&A session. I would now like to turn the webinar back over to Bernie.
Bernie Blegen: Thank you. I'd like to thank you all for joining us for this conference call and look forward to talking to you again in our fourth quarter conference call, which is likely to be in early February. Thank you. Have a nice day.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-08-01 17:00:00) =====
Genevieve Cunningham: Welcome everyone to the MPS Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Webinar. My name is Genevieve Cunningham, and I will be the moderator for this webinar. Joining me today are Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS; Bernie Blegen, EVP and CFO; and Tony Balow, VP of Finance. Earlier today, along with our earnings announcement, MPS released a written commentary on the results of our operations. Both of these documents can be found on our website. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that in the course of today's presentation, we may make forward-looking statements and projections within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that involve risk and uncertainty. Risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ from these forward-looking statements are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q2 earnings release, and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K, which can be found on our website. Our statements are made as of today, and we assume no obligation to update this information. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bernie Blegen.
Bernie Blegen: Thanks, Gen. Good afternoon, and a big welcome to all of you. Let me open by saying MPS reported yet another record quarter with Q2, 2024 revenue of $507.4 million, exceeding the high end of our guidance. Our strong revenue growth was attributed to three factors, increased demand for AI power solutions, improving order trends in several of our end markets. And lastly, initial revenue ramps associated with design wins secured in past years. Separately, we continue to expand and diversify our global supply chain, to ensure supply stability and capture future growth. As we have emphasized for many years, our results reflect continued success of our proven long-term growth strategy, and our transformation from being only a chip supplier, to a full solutions provider. I will now open the webinar up for questions. Gen, could you please ask the first caller?
A - Genevieve Cunningham: Our first question is from Matt Ramsay of Cowen. Matt, your line is now open.
Matt Ramsay: Thank you very much, everybody. Good afternoon. Michael, Bernie, congratulations on, I'll just say, it's nice to have a calm part in the storm relative to what's been - all of us have been dealing with over the last two weeks, so congrats. I wanted to ask a couple of questions that I imagine the enterprise data segment is going to be a huge focus on this call. So maybe I'll just start with the first question. Bernie, if you could maybe give us some directional color by end market in your guidance for September, I'd appreciate it. And secondly, Michael, if you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing in some of the non-enterprise data segments, like things like consumer, comms, auto. The model's been driven by this big growth in enterprise data, but from what I can tell, your company's had a lot of design win success in some of these other areas where the macro has really been challenging. And I'm wondering if you're starting to see any green shoots there yet, for recovery in some of those other segments? Thanks, guys.
Bernie Blegen: Sure, I'll keep my comments fairly short as far as the Q3 outlook by end market. Essentially, the bookings trend that we carried into Q3 has improved quite a bit over the last few quarters, and has been fairly broad as far as the end market participation. If you look specifically at enterprise data, you'll see that we took a fairly large step up in each of the last two quarters. And then in the third quarter outlook, we see continued growth in communications, storage and computing with incremental improvements and also in our other groups.
Michael Hsing: Yes, your second question, as Bernie said it, we do see some of our - other business would not relate to AI. And now it is difficult to separate AI, non-AI. Other business we designed in which we - let's say that, okay we ship these products to the half a year ago. A year before we see the market start to wakening up. But that's whatever it is, whatever it is, okay. And we do see a lot of new design, new requirement, which is much higher power, for especially for communications. And well, as a matter of fact, as across the board. And these designs are much higher power than the previous versions. And these are all relate to the new design, relate to AI - and AI requirements. And these design wings, we'll probably triggered downs in a game of two [ph] or three years, and change of revenues.
Matt Ramsay: Thank you very much, guys. I appreciate it. I asked two questions. So I'll get back in the queue. Thanks.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Dustin Fowler of Oppenheimer. Dustin, your line is now open.
Dustin Fowler: Hi guys, I just have couple of quick questions. So for power isolation, I believe you ramp later this year in auto followed by data center next year. I think both markets could be Greenfield opportunities in the hundreds of millions each. Could you just give us a sense of the ramp in both markets, the competitive landscape and maybe any market sizing if you can?
Bernie Blegen: Dustin, I apologize. This is Bernie. I didn't hear which two markets.
Dustin Fowler: Oh, sorry. That was auto and data center for power isolation?
Michael Hsing: Okay. Yes. We do start to ship in the gate [ph] and the product for the higher powers and for data centers. And this is only the beginning. And would you say that that's very true? Auto is being known and we, when ADAS and became more, more and more the cars converged into the ADAS, okay. And which we believe in being a two or three years, all the cars will have that features. And we, so far we provide all the, we have design wing in all these car makers, especially in the EVs.
Dustin Fowler: Okay. And I guess as we think about kind of auto this year, I think street has auto model flat. I guess how realistic is that given 70% content gains you have with your largest auto customer before power isolation plus the wins with Chinese OEMs? I guess maybe for Bernie, are you modeling auto flat this year? And how should we kind of think about share gains?
Michael Hsing: Well, we cannot pick the, you want to pick the models and gave me, and you want to pick them, I can't give you a model. My accuracy is a plus minus 12 months. And going forward, we are very confident.
Bernie Blegen: Yes, I think the near term outlook for automotive remains a little bit fuzzy. And for example, in Q2, we were expecting a nice uplift, which did not occur. And so Michael's correct is that positioning within the next two, three quarters, is hard to predict for auto more broadly and EV specifically, but our long-term positioning is only getting better with additional design wins.
Dustin Fowler: All right, thanks guys.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from William Stein of Truist. William, your line is now open.
William Stein: Great, thanks for taking my question. Michael, I'm hoping you can linger on that comment you made about solution selling. I think might've been the term used. I think in the past, we've been conditioned to hear about modules versus semis. Can you linger as to what your, maybe spend a minute explaining what sorts of products and what end markets, and what growth you see coming from that activity?
Michael Hsing: I like that question. Yes, okay. As we said, we started that journey long time ago, okay. And at the beginning, maybe I didn't know, we didn't know what the hell we were talking about. And okay, but that's the directions. And that's including a part of e-commerce. And we sell plug and play solutions. So the effort is that the journey will be, we are, we known to be a semiconductor company. And yes, we do. We do all that we provide. And when we sell a silicon, we're selling, actually we're selling a solutions. We know all the technical details in terms of how we implement the solutions. So my effort is we want to monetize all our knowledges. MPS in the end, doesn't make any things. And we all making the money from our knowledge. While we capitalize all the entire our capabilities. And so the journey we started, now we're selling the solutions. It's probably 20%, 25% of a total MPS total revenue. Every piece of a silicon used to be selling somewhere between $1 and $0.50 to $1. Some of them are a lot of them even lower for the mass market. And which we kind of vary little now, especially in consumer business. And now, we're turning to a solution company is still a semiconductor based solutions. We sell those solutions. Now particularly as you call it, as a modules. And like I don't know what the appropriate word for that. And so today is 25%, 20% to 25% of a total revenues. MPS module business excluding AI. We're running a couple hundred, close to $200 million. And we're growing every year by more than company's percentage growth. And if you look at this, this way, every chip we sell, all the solution is more than a chip price. And you generally $4, $5, $6, $10 of a content that we can sell. So that's the result of today. And we will commit on the journeys. And again, we're transforming a company to a silicon only, to silicon based solution providers.
Bernie Blegen: And Will, if I could just add two comments quickly. The first is, and this is specific to your question, that it's across all of our markets. It primarily focuses on those that have longer design cycles, where we can add expertise in design solution. And the second point is again, while we are driving a lot, a higher percentage of our business to the modules, or to the more complete solutions. We have the ability, like no other company to be able to deliver the type of solution our customer wants, whether it's a die, a chip or some package in between.
Michael Hsing: Yes, and many -- maybe traditional semiconductor companies and they are hard to distinguish, whether they're solution providers or selling modules, selling solutions or selling semiconductor only. And that's especially the case and apply for AI powers. And there's a very few company using a silicon based, the module solution to power up this AI solution or data centers.
William Stein: If I can add a follow-up please. Can you talk about what you're doing in vertical power delivery? I know there's a lot of companies that are claiming to have it, or be ramping it. And I know you guys are one of those companies that are I think more clearly delivering, but maybe you can talk about what your efforts are yielding in that area? Thank you.
Michael Hsing: We are - in the leading positions. Okay, I said it - and there's maybe one, I will say the one or two company. Maybe one company have the capability have - and similar to MPS, the market is huge and it's growing. And MPS is, what the leading position, is because not by one day, like one-or-one an AI happened, we developed that years ago for that. And there's not many semiconductor companies that are based at the semiconductor company have that kind of a capability.
William Stein: Thanks guys, good job on the quarter.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham. Quinn, your line is now open.
Quinn Bolton: Hi guys, let me offer my congratulations. Maybe just first Bernie, a quick follow-up on Matt Ramsay's question on the drivers of sequential growth in the third quarter. I think you mentioned comms and storage and computing, but I didn't hear you specifically say enterprise data. I just wanted to confirm enterprise data is still one of the big growth drivers in the third quarter. And then I'll get to the two questions?
Bernie Blegen: On the enterprise data, the way I tried to tee that up, first off, yes, it is expected to grow, but we have grown significantly each of the four prior quarters to this. So the rate of growth is slowing down. And the biggest for this quarter only. And I offer that because there's a lot of opportunities that have yet to begin to ramp with a number of the different companies that we're currently working on designs with. But I was calling out in particular that both storage and computing and communications will be good drivers in Q3.
Michael Hsing: Quinn, you know VR 13.5 and we start to have a significant revenues. And that was the beginning, you know that. And VR 14, which hasn't really ramped up yet. And we have a lot of design, we increase it. VR 13.5 is like a MPS -- MPS is a test case. And so when during the shortage, okay, a lot of revenues, a lot of volumes shifted to MPS. And our competitors couldn't deliver, we delivered and we delivered. And now the benefit it is - for VR 14, where will be a significant players in the market segment?
Bernie Blegen: And particularly in the second half of this year, it looks like that segment is starting to take off.
Quinn Bolton: Great, that was going to be served. I guess my first question was just, could you talk within the enterprise data about some of the opportunities, whether it's on the CPU power side or just broadening out of your AI portfolio? And then I'll have another question on vertical power if I could squeeze in that second question?
Michael Hsing: Go ahead.
Quinn Bolton: So the question on vertical power, I mean, just some different competitors, may mean different things when they're talking about vertical power. And I just wanted to kind of get your guys' view on the market. When you guys talk about vertical power, is that true vertical power where the voltage regulator is sitting underneath the processor substrate and supplying current vertically into the processor? Or do you guys consider sort of stacked packages, where you've got one or more voltage regulators, or phases in a module with the power inductors and capacitors, and other things that might be stacked vertically, but still delivering current laterally into the processor? What's your definition of vertical? Because I think there's some confusion in the market of what may be vertical and what might look vertical, but actually still supply current laterally?
Michael Hsing: Yes, you're right. There's one is some customers so Quinn and using the top surface lateral power supply, which is like a very similar to server, the server CPU power supply. And other ones turning into the backside, still lateral powers. And more advanced one is directly under the CPU. And so to answer the question, is MPS supply currently we're running all three solutions? Chip, all modules, we have everything there.
Bernie Blegen: And Quinn, if I could also add to this that, the necessity for the different deliveries of power, is as you get into increasingly higher current and in addition to either lateral or vertical power, we also have liquid cooled that, we believe that we have a position on.
Michael Hsing: Yes, to Quinn, to answer your question is that the most efficient and difficult to do, is you're making a module directly under the CPU. And that's the highest efficiency power delivery. There's a lot of a problem, and a lot of technical issues associated with that type of approach. So many companies take a conservative approach, okay? And some companies just do only like servers and top surface lateral power delivery. And for those very high powers, well over 1000 watt, all these powers, the power modules directly under the CPUs. And these are the highest efficiency.
Quinn Bolton: Got it. Thank you, Michael. Thank you, Bernie.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Chris Caso of Wolfe. Chris, your line is now open.
Bernie Blegen: Chris, can you hear us?
Chris Caso: Sorry, I was on mute. You can hear me now?
Michael Hsing: Yes.
Chris Caso: All right, sorry, thank you. The first question is on seasonality, and how that may be changing for you. In the past, the December quarter typically was a seasonally down quarter, but your business mix has changed quite a bit, since those days and the revenue is now coming from segments that are not as seasonally, not a seasonal December quarter. With that, how should we look at December seasonality going forward, or is the old model no longer appropriate, as we look forward? And if there's anything you want to comment on with respect to December?
Michael Hsing: Yes, we're seeking advice from you. What's our seasonality? With a new business, with all these inventory oscillation from our customers, and we don't know so came in - you have a huge shortage, then it comes up the huge over supplies, and okay now, the main, I assume, and our customers consumes all these excessive inventory. Now the market is waking up. And is there another shortage? I don't know. And it's difficult to forecast. And - the lead time is still very short.
Chris Caso: Okay. So we'll do our best for everything good thing?
Michael Hsing: Yes, yes. You can tell us.
Chris Caso: All right. That's fair enough. As my follow-up question, I wanted to follow-up with vertical power as well. And what we know, particularly within the enterprise segment AI, we've got some higher wattage processors coming. Can you talk about what you expect for content on that, and what in particular you expect for vertical power next year? Because I know there's some debate, certainly doesn't seem to be debate over whether you're ready for vertical power, whether the ecosystem is ready for vertical power. And does that make a difference with regard to your content, as you go into the next generation of processors, because the wattage is certainly going higher?
Michael Hsing: Yes, I can tell you this. Our customers will not be appreciated in talking about how many - dollar per their unit, or GPU unit, okay? And so, then they don't want us to talk about it. And second, I don't know, I don't want to know about it.
Chris Caso: Okay. Understand, but I mean, in just in terms of the opportunity, maybe you could speak in more general terms about the opportunity that's available to you?
Michael Hsing: Oh, sure, yes. And now you look at our revenues, right? Okay, for a couple of companies, okay, and from last year, was like a what, it's a 1% or 2%, or maybe last year's, okay, couple of percentage our total revenue. Well, today, so like we're running like a what, 20%? And 20%, so that's a full $500 million, okay? And we were told this is at the beginning. And there's a lot of other companies, like where our opportunities and our design wing hasn't really ramped up in company like Google's and AWS and Meta. And those coming later. So I see the huge opportunities and I do see, okay, this is not MPS only, but the market's way too big. We don't want to turn into an AI company only.
Chris Caso: Yes, I think the only thing I'd probably had on top of that besides for the direct AI opportunity, I think you've heard us talk about the AI trickle-down effect, whether that can be memory, it can be optical, it can be pulled through of networking. I think there's a lot of opportunity for MPS, beyond even the direct AI business?
Michael Hsing: That's a good comment, yes.
Chris Caso: Right, appreciate those comments. Thank you.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Tore, your line is now open.
Tore Svanberg: Yes, thank you, Michael, Bernie. And congrats again on another stellar quarter. I wanted to follow-up on enterprise data, but I'm going to move away from the processor power management, and ask you more about opportunities elsewhere in the data center, especially power supply. I know historically you haven't talked a whole lot about GAN, silicon carbide, but I'm pretty sure you have some activities there. So can you elaborate a little bit on what you're doing on the power supply side of data centers?
Michael Hsing: Yes, I like that one. Okay, I like that one. But I can't tell you the revenue yet, but it's a small, okay? And we, in the since 2016, and again, we start to develop our own silicon carbide. We're not selling expense. It will be a part of our solutions. I said very, very early, so we're not intending to sell a fit [ph] as a power device only. So now, we designed those three kilowatt, six kilowatt, 12 kilowatt power supply. And you guess what? It's a data center. It's a data evaluating, so we have a very little revenues, but the biggest is the MPS only, owned. All our test plot, we're using a huge amount of power supply, and MPS is our own customers. All these testing equipment that we have to design, we have to invent it, how to test these modules particularly, and also as well as burning. And MPS supply these power modules to our vendors, and our vendors are in problem went into these systems and it became our test equipment. And so, that's the revenues we start to generating. And but for 4G and for data centers, and these are still in the, well, we engage them a year ago or so, couple years ago. And so, the revenues small, but we're looking for the big revenues from that segment, because MPS provides the highest efficiency and the smaller size.
Tore Svanberg: Yes, that's great perspective. As my follow-up, I recall, because we've gone through a few cycles together, I recall usually you use downturns to gain a lot of share. I know everyone's excited about data centers today, but what are some of the areas, where you're starting to see more meaningful share gains from a designer perspective, now that we're sort of navigating here at the bottom of the cycle?
Bernie Blegen: Sure, so I think that we've been very clear about the positioning that we have an automotive, and how that's continuing to grow across multitude of different platforms with a multitude of different Tier 1 suppliers and OEMs. I think the most recent area for improvement where somebody's Greenfield opportunities, are becoming more visible in market, would be in particular with communications. We're seeing that in the wireless and 5G, and I think that we've seen some early indications of continuing investment in that segment. So I'd say that's probably the area that will be most visible, but obviously I don't want to forget industrial, which even though right now, is a relatively modest part of our business. And it's not shown a lot of momentum towards growth, probably is the next area, where we have a lot of Greenfield opportunities that will materialize in the next four quarters.
Michael Hsing: Yes, go ahead.
Tore Svanberg: Yes, I was just going to ask, and the RV market, is that going to be under auto or industrial?
Michael Hsing: RV?
Tore Svanberg: The RV market, the Kemppi car market, I know you've talked about that?
Michael Hsing: Oh yes. No, no. Yes, okay. That's one of my favorite ones. Okay, yes, okay. And I think it's going to be in industrial market. Because share - all these products share the same signatures as we do for data centers for our own test plot and for test equipment, okay? We'll be very much shared the same characteristics and also for robotics. And especially for those moving, not stationary robot. And these robots move around, and they all need that type of a power supply and the charging and the battery management. And these all share very much the same characteristics as RVs, okay RVs happen.
Tore Svanberg: Yes, those could be industrial or consumer or even the humanoid stuff too. So I don't think I want to just put those...?
Michael Hsing: I think it's a - we're probably in the industrial side. Yes, okay, yes.
Tore Svanberg: Sounds good. Thank you and congrats again.
Michael Hsing: Okay. Thanks, Tore.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham. Quinn, your line is now open.
Quinn Bolton: Hi guys, just wanted to add a quick follow-up question. There have been a few semiconductor companies this earnings season that have sort of mentioned having licenses to - Huawei being revoked in the quarter. And it's raised some questions from investors. I just wondering if you guys could address do you have a license to ship to Huawei? If you did, has it been revoked? Is that, is there any real exposure at MPS to that customer? It's obviously not impacting your near-term outlook, but I figured I just asked, because we've gotten a number of questions on potential Huawei exposure, across the semi coverage? Thank you.
Bernie Blegen: Quinn, I can make this pretty simple. We don't have any licensing or contractual arrangements with Huawei that are at all. So they can't be canceled. Any business we have with them has always just done on a PO basis, and we have no indication of a change in their relationship.
Quinn Bolton: So Bernie, I guess there was more that export license question. Do you need an export license to ship to them? I think that's what's sort of price?
Michael Hsing: Yes, our product is not, not like in the 20, below 24 nanometer or whatever, that we are not, as far as I know.
Bernie Blegen: Yes, you're right.
Michael Hsing: And as far as I know, we're not subjected to the export limit, have any limitations. And, but we will talk to our, to answer your question precisely, I will consult our legal counsels.
Quinn Bolton: Yes, okay. Okay. Thank you.
Genevieve Cunningham: [Operator Instructions] As there are no further questions, I would now like to turn the webinar back over to Bernie.
Bernie Blegen: Great. I'd like to thank you all for joining us for this conference call, and look forward to talking to you again during our third quarter conference call, which will likely be in late October. Thank you, have a nice day.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-05-01 17:00:00) =====
Genevieve Cunningham: Welcome everyone, to the MPS First Quarter 2024 Earnings Webinar. My name is Genevieve Cunningham, and I will be the moderator for this webinar.
 Joining me today are Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS; Bernie Blegen, EVP and CFO; and Tony Balow, VP of Finance.
 Earlier today, along with our earnings announcement, MPS released written commentary on the results of our operations. Both of these documents can be found on our website.
 Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that in the course of today's presentation, we may make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ from these forward-looking statements are identified in the safe harbor statements contained in the Q1 earnings release and in our latest SEC filings, including our Form 10-K, which can be found on our website. Our statements are made as of today, and we assume no obligation to update this information.
 Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bernie. 
Bernie Blegen: Thanks, Gen. We're doing something a little different in today's earnings call. As a detailed recital performance metrics is included in the company's earnings commentary, accompanying the earnings release, I'll use this time to provide just a few comments on our Q1 2024 performance and our outlook before opening the call up to Q&A.
 Our financial performance improved in the first quarter of 2024 with revenue up both sequentially from Q4 '23 and year-over-year from Q1 '23, Ordering patterns consistently trended upwards through the quarter. Visibility into the second half of 2024, however, is limited and many of our customers remain cautious.
 Despite this uncertainty around the second half of 2024, customer engagement across all of our end markets remains high, and our design win pipeline continues to grow stronger. Additionally, we are continuing to expand our product portfolio and diversify our supply chain globally. We believe both actions position our company for further growth as the market improves.
 In summary, we saw consistent improvement through the first quarter, but we continue to be cautious about the second half of 2024 business conditions. Overall, our proven long-term growth strategy remains intact, and we can swiftly adapt to market changes as they occur.
 I'll now open the webinar up for questions. 
Genevieve Cunningham: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. 
Tore Svanberg: Congratulations on this enviable consistency. I have two questions. My first question is on share gains. And historically, Michael, Monolithic Power tends to really accelerate share gains during downturns. And I know there's a lot of focus on Enterprise Data right now, which is 1/3 of your revenue, but -- can you maybe call out some other verticals or applications where you are seeing more share gains in the current downturn? 
Michael R. Hsing: Clearly, we just wait -- if we haven't out of this downturn. You see this, we compare the rest of the industries, we're like a 10% up. And -- so that's really a share gained. And so in terms of -- so the rest of vertical market as auto is clearly is the one. We won many sockets in there. And MPS is still small compared to all these established -- our competitors.
 And other ones, even other ones -- even the servers and notebooks areas and these are the ones, all gain shares. And the last one is the consumer, as we said it a year ago or so, we gave it up some of the shares because of the capacity constraints. Now, we have a lot more capacity now and you will see some growth in the near future. 
Bernie Blegen: And if I could add one additional comment there is that we've had a number of greenfield opportunities that have been waiting to launch in an improved macro environment. So in addition to the end markets that Michael just referenced, I think that you'll also see share gains in both communications and industrial. 
Tore Svanberg: Great. And for my follow-up question and specifically on Enterprise Data, which is now 1/3 of our revenues. There's been some chatter lately about lower power management content in next-generation AI data centers due to liquid cooling and other techniques to lower overall power. Is this impacting MPS broadly? Or is this kind of more sort of a very specific use case in the server power management market? 
Michael R. Hsing: All these cooling systems, the new format or vertical powers, MPS involve all of them. And if they transition to those markets, those systems -- and MPS in the same gains, okay? We will gain -- and we will grow with it. Is there any other comment? Tony? Okay. 
Bernie Blegen: No, I think that the point that we've demonstrated, particularly with Enterprise Data is the ability to leverage up content as we go into higher-value technology. For example, the water cooled and vertical represent opportunities, not threats. And if you look down the line not to -- not far out, we'll also be going into rack power as well. 
Michael R. Hsing: That's good. Yes, good answer. 
Operator: Our next question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham. 
Quinn Bolton: I'll add my congratulations on very steady performance in a challenging macro environment. I guess I wanted to follow up on Tore's question on enterprise data. Lots of your competitors making noise about perhaps gaining share at your largest enterprise data customer. I'm wondering if you could just sort of address your latest thoughts on competitive landscape in both lateral power and then perhaps looking forward to vertical power? And then I've got a follow-up. 
Michael R. Hsing: Yes. As you may remember, 2016, we have a power curve versus -- the power curve CPU computing capabilities and versus the power densities. And we projected it for 2018 or '19. That would be the crossover point that MPS product. And for those common footprint, driver [ mass ] couldn't fit into the peripheral powers. That's around 700 watts. If you remember that in 2016, we said that. And at the time, we projected with the CPU was wrong. It's actually turned out to be GPUs. But the power is the power, power densities.
 And -- but 2018 or '19 -- and that's pretty much the peripheral power that reach the limit. And now from that time -- and everybody goes to a vertical for even higher power AI computations or learning. So all over these power go to verticals.
 And peripheral powers reached the limit. And I can't comment on our competitors, okay, so far, MPS, well, as always, we want to bring the best technologies. And we are not a champion of volumes, okay? We don't do that. We want to every -- whatever we do, we do the best. And not the volumes that we ship.
 And -- so when the market became normalized and became a normal -- not like the last couple -- last year or so. And there will be more -- more solution come on board. A lot of our competitors start to copy our products, so be it. That's fine. So we are -- we stick our MPS model, we will have a very diversified growth. 
Bernie Blegen: I think it's important to keep in mind when you look at our history, as Michael just referenced there, that we have always won opportunities due to our innovation. And as we look at the next generation of GPU or TPU or ASIC products that are in this high power end market. We're an enabling technology meaning that at the front of the design cycle, we're consulted, we're integrated, in fact, with the development of the next generation of products. So we believe that strategically that, yes, there will be competitive influences on the market but we want to continue to position ourselves as the leader. 
Quinn Bolton: Got it. Maybe just a quick follow-up. Just any comments you guys have on when you think vertical power may go to volume production? Is that something that happens later in '24? Is that not in volume until sometime in 2025?
 And then the follow-up, Bernie, is you look at the consensus estimates, the Street's modeled up 9% sequential growth in your December quarter. Your typical seasonality, I think, is down 1% to 3%. Wondering if you have any comments as to that sort of a-seasonal pattern out in Q4? I know you're not guiding out that far, but wondering if you could make any comments about that sort of atypical growth. 
Michael R. Hsing: I'll answer the first part of it. And the vertical power is happening now. There's multiple of our customers, they are launching the vertical power now and we are shipping those products. 
Bernie Blegen: Yes. And I'll pick up the second part of your question there is that seasonality, particularly as you are exiting a downturn is hard to predict. And what we tried to indicate with our prepared comments is that there are signs of optimism from the standpoint of improved ordering patterns. But how that translates into the second half is hard to predict.
 And so we have more of a profile of the guide that we've given for Q2. But that really as far as the difference between Q3 and Q4, we see them higher than Q2 perhaps. But between the two of them, flattish. 
Michael R. Hsing: Yes. We see AI probably still continue to grow and grow very fast rate. 
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer. 
Richard Schafer: My congratulations guys, and I just had a couple of questions. The first one just since we're talking about power, and I sort of have a point in one on server CPU power. Some of the new x86 platforms that are due out later this year are pushing 500 watts. I mean is there an expectation? Just like the call you made back in 2016, maybe that was a little premature. But is there expectation that x86 is eventually going to move to 48-volt still?
 And if so, I guess, where are we in that transition? How far off do you think that is? 
Michael R. Hsing: Yes. Okay. Now since you mentioned 2016, I can go back to earlier. 2014 we were not even -- we were outside the door, in 2016, we can join, we were invited as a guest. And we gave some tokens so you can play it. And so the transitions and from VR 13.5 to 14, then this type -- this time, when these new CPU power, we have a significant market share. That will keep -- and it's not reflected into revenue yet. And once those CPU release, we will gain a significant amount of shares. 
Richard Schafer: And any comment, Michael, on the transition to 48-volt power for X86? 
Michael R. Hsing: That we don't -- that's probably -- the higher powers is over 700 watts. I think those will transition to vertical powers. And -- which were ready and other ones below that, we believe, are still using a traditional rack power that came in and use 12-volt supply. 
Richard Schafer: Got it. And just as a follow-up, shifting gears a little bit to auto. I was just curious what your expectations are for your auto business this year? Obviously, that market is under a little bit of pressure near term. But I believe you guys have been pretty open about some of your material share gains.
 For instance, with China, within China, ADAS also with some of your top auto -- you with your top auto customer. You've also got some pretty significant share gains, I believe, ramping later this year, but I was curious if you could provide any update there. 
Michael R. Hsing: We saw - yes, go ahead. 
Richard Schafer: I just was curious if you could add in there, what your expectations are from -- I know you had a couple of launches that some OEMs delayed in the second half last year, and I didn't know if you still expect it to benefit from those this year. I know that's kind of a lot in one question, but there's a lot going on in your auto business. 
Michael R. Hsing: Yes, certainly. We actually care less with the share gain, what the revenue expectations. Of course, we have to prepare all the inventories, okay -- and that's the only thing we care. Whatever this or whatever it is, okay. We want to do -- if we're not -- if we're not the best, we will not win those market segments. And particularly, these are new applications and new features.
 So far, we can tell you -- in this year's or end of the last year's, and Chinese EV makers, they produce a lot more. And with those features that we are in, they export it in -- not to U.S., but to the other possible world, they increased somewhere 5 million to 6 million units, okay, million cars. And that's where we see the upside so far. 
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. 
Ross Seymore: Congratulations on the stability. Just a question on the visibility into the second half. I understand the caution, especially given everything going on in the broader market. But you also said that your bookings are improving, the order rates, the engagements, et cetera, et cetera. So is the visibility improving? It's just not as good as it used to be? I'm just trying to reconcile the bookings side improving, but the visibility not. 
Bernie Blegen: Sure, Ross. If we can kind of reflect that over the course of about the last 6 quarters, ordering patterns have been well below whatever we call normal. And when we're seeing improvement, doesn't mean that we're seeing that they have necessarily stabilized or that they're as predictive as when you have like 5 or 6 consecutive quarters of strong ordering patterns. So all we're trying to do right now is remain cautiously optimistic. 
Tony Balow: Ross, it's Tony. The only thing I'd probably add on that, right, is really focused on the design win engagement, making sure that pipeline is healthy because it's difficult to call when the market would come back. As Bernie said, it's still pretty choppy. But if we have that strong design win pipeline as well as having the supply chain diversification we were talking about, we're set to take advantage when the markets do come back. 
Ross Seymore: I guess as my one follow-up, a near-term question for you. Any outliers in the growth that you're guiding to in the second quarter by end market segments versus the 7% total? 
Michael R. Hsing: No. Outliers means like AI stuff, Yes. As I said earlier, we still -- we still see a lot of growth, okay? I mean we are getting -- try to get all the inventory ready, okay, start to go even further, okay, and they even have a lot more upside. 
Bernie Blegen: Yes. If I look sequentially between Q2 and Q1, we do see the continuing demand profile for Enterprise Data. And I think we see also some contribution from Automotive, but the rest of our end markets are pretty flattish. 
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from William Stein of Truist. 
William Stein: Congrats on the good results, and thanks for the change in format. It's a breath of fresh air. 
Michael R. Hsing: And -- you appreciate it. We try to make it life and make it easy for you. 
William Stein: I'm hoping you can update us on the progress you pursued to try to diversify your manufacturing geographic footprint and both on the front end and back end? And then I have a follow-up, please. 
Tony Balow: Yes, I'll start, and then I'll let Michael and Bernie pick up. So I think we continue to make progress on diversification of our supply chain globally. And so I think that is proceeding as planned. And I think that we're set as customers would ask for that capability that we have it ready for them right now. So I think based on what we said in the past, so I would say no change in the expectation there. So Bernie or Michael, anything you want to add? 
Michael R. Hsing: Yes. We built all these capacities our customer demands, okay. There's a few of them that really demand a lot outside of China. So we have more capacity. So that's the comment. Okay. 
William Stein: Okay. Let me try a different topic. Some product types that I know have been ramping maybe over a long period of time. One is converter -- data converters, which is a category, there's -- I think there's really one very dominant supplier, but you guys have started to get into that area. And then the other is the modules that you make when these are much more complex and they have many, many chips, I think, in each one. If you can talk to us about the recent growth in those newer categories, that would be helpful color. 
Michael R. Hsing: Yes. Okay. Let me answer the first ones, data converter -- data converters are -- it's a technology that we're talking about, we developed in the last few years. And we want design win, we start to shipping products, and -- but however, there's only 1 or 2 products, okay? And now we're going to release a family of a product in less than a year, less than a year time. That will meet a more general market.
 The other topic that's when you're talking about -- these modules. Yes, so called e-commerce modules, and we're actually doing well, okay, not exactly the e-commerce we talk about in 2018. And it's going over well over $100 million, okay. I mean -- but these are multi-chip modules is more than $100 million. Actually, all these AI products that we're shipping these all modules. And vertical powers and also the rack powers. We're shipping all these modules. So  I -- in the past, I say -- I said and I'm sick and tired of selling silicon only. I want to leverage -- our leverage and monetize, our know-how will sell these power modules sales solutions. 
Bernie Blegen: And I think that we've sort of hit on one of the strategic differentiators between MPS and a lot of our competitors is that we can offer the most flexible architecture of whether it is delivering a module or silicon die, so however the customer wants to build our silicon or modules into their end application, we have the flexibility to do just that. 
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Matt Ramsay of Cowen. 
Matthew Ramsay: I guess it's my first question. guys, I wanted you to maybe talk a little bit about the content per socket progression that you see for the company in the AI business, in particular, as your -- silicon providers that are driving these platforms make generational transitions there. I think there's a little bit of confusion that the big primary guy in AI is not just launching 1 product, but they're launching 3 different ones that I expect to have slightly different content. And you obviously have other customers there in AI, not just NVIDIA but others.
 So if you could talk generally, Michael, about just what you're seeing from a content perspective, generation to generation there? And maybe Bernie, what are the variables on sort of blended content increases that you might see as we move forward? 
Michael R. Hsing: Yes. I can't talk about the -- well I don't -- we don't know how our customers -- and these are AI GPU providers, how they use it. I mean, they sell -- they have a different model, they have a different model -- they have a different variety of products. We -- as long as we know, okay, they use some -- they use IC chipping in general for peripheral power and verticals is all more than 700-watt powers, over 1,000-watt power. So these are from modules. And how many modules per CPUs, we have rough ideas, but we don't know exactly. 
Bernie Blegen: Yes. And to follow up on your second point, it's a very content-rich environment for us. It also includes memory, for example, and the CPU process -- processor in addition... 
Michael R. Hsing: Or even optical. 
Bernie Blegen: An optical as well. So I think it's really too early to put limits on content availability. In fact, we're finding new areas in order to deploy. 
Michael R. Hsing: So far, we just want to handle the growth. All the demand from a memory side from opticals, from even the GPU, CPU powers. And this period is really the growth period. 
Matthew Ramsay: Got it. That's helpful. I know there's a lot of moving parts. I was going to kind of step back and ask a little bit about gross margin trajectory, it comes up a lot in my conversations. I know you're kind of in that 55% range. I guess, Bernie, what are the puts and takes here? I know there are big customers ramping in enterprise data and there are variables around that.
 There's also mix between your segments and where you're sourcing supply from, there's a lot of variables here. So what would -- I mean, are we kind of at a relative floor in the 55% or slightly above range? And what would be the variables that could drive the margin back higher? 
Bernie Blegen: Sure. This is a pretty simple question. So as you know, the range that we target is between 55% and 60%. We demonstrated that during the post pandemic stimulus that our margin was able to go to the higher end of that limit. And right now, for the last couple of quarters as well as our guidance here, we've maintained a non-GAAP rate of 55.7%. And really, what will enable us to go up is a change in the mix of business. 
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Gary Mobley of Wells Fargo. 
Gary Mobley: Congrats, and thank you for persistently seeing the expectation. Most of the interesting questions have been asked and answered, but I wanted to touch on pricing trends. I know you don't overlap a whole lot with the analog chip market leader. But clearly, they're being aggressive on price. So maybe if you can speak to the different product groups or business segments that might be affected by that? And as well, just generally speak about the pricing environments for your broad set of products. 
Michael R. Hsing: Tony, you want to? 
Tony Balow: I'll start and then let Bernie jump in, right, I think what you've heard from us in the past is that for us, because we lead on innovation and we're trying to work on the next-generation platforms and work on where we really have a differentiated advantage to our technology. We're probably less susceptible to pricing than some of the segments that are volume related or might be more mainstream. So I do know there's lots of reports out there about pricing right now. But I'd say right now, that's not impacting us in a way -- that's not impacting us in any way, and you can kind of see that in our outlook. And so Bernie will add some more on that. 
Bernie Blegen: Yes. And fundamentally, part of the issue that's driving prices both additional capacity in China as well as additional capacity that's coming on with a large North American company. And on the cost side, we've always been very, very competitive regardless of the end market opportunity and... 
Michael R. Hsing: The cost regardless of what the margin is, we always have to -- we always drive the cost down. I shouldn't give you more than you asked, and it's a little bit from the futures. And so far, have nobody asked the question yet. We saw in the near-term market in the next couple of years, the AI truly trickle down to all applications. not only in the cars, and all -- in the sensors, all these -- in building for the phones and all kind of things trickle down to a different level. And that we see now all kind of activities is going on now.
 And we -- there's a lot of design initial phase performing the product ideas. And these are requested from our customers. And we don't see that in the end of the last year, even in the beginning of this year, recently, we see a lot more. So that will drive -- those products definitely will drive the gross margin up. 
Gary Mobley: Thank you for that comprehensive answer. Last quarter, your distribution inventory, I think you characterized it -- I think you characterized the distribution inventory as being a little bit above the target level, what is it now? Have you been able to work that down to more of a normalized level? 
Bernie Blegen: Sure. So there's sort of two ways to look at our channel inventory right now. If you keep it narrow to really the AI supply chain, we're trying to keep that elevated so that, that inventory is basically available on demand. But then with regard to all of the other end markets, we've seen it coming down nicely. 
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. 
Tore Svanberg: I just had two quick follow-ups. I'm intrigued by the consumer segment, Michael, I know that's surprising when everyone is talking about AI. But I think this is the lowest percentage has ever been. But you did talk about getting some share there in the downturn. So any particular applications that we should keep an eye on as you start to grow back in the consumer area? 
Michael R. Hsing: Yes. Okay. That's good question, I mean, yes, that's -- I said earlier that fell into an unhealthy percentage. We want to have a diversified growth, we neglected our consumers. But on the other hand, is during this period, a lot of our competitors care less about cost. We have less effect, but we did lower the price in the notebook market segment. And that's probably you see it now, we grow the notebook revenues faster than notebook market growth. And these are low-margin products.
 But when looking at -- looking forward, audio product. A lot of it related to a consumer product. Maybe, Tony, you can mention -- you can talk about this is okay. 
Tony Balow: I'll go and Michael can certainly talk a lot more, but I'd point you back to what we announced last quarter on Axign acquisition. And we really looked at their technology and saw an opportunity to participate in the high-end audio market and MPS's scale and Axign's technology really offered an opportunity to go after customers, and we're seeing some traction in that area. So consumers got a wide base of potential applications, and I think we'll continue to pick our shots where we can sort of really add value with our innovation. 
Michael R. Hsing: Yes. I can tell you, we will start to ship in Q3 but -- Axign and MPS together as a bundle. 
Tore Svanberg: Yes. That's exciting. And my last question is on communications. It was actually up sequentially this quarter. Everything that we're hearing, of course, is that, that market is still very weak. In your prepared remarks, you said that, that growth was driven by networks. So can you elaborate a little bit what's going on there? Are you actually starting to see that market turning? Or is this just pure share gains? 
Bernie Blegen: It remains a flattish market. I think that in quarter-by-quarter, we're going to see infrastructure go up or down. But the full year outlook is that it will probably be flat with '23. 
Michael R. Hsing: I'm betting on the communication market, it will trickle down from the speed, and demand of higher speed will trickle down all these segments. And we have a lot of design wins in 5Gs or in other high speed or Wi-Fi, and we're ready for that. 
Tore Svanberg: So Michael, what you mean is AI will trickle down. And as that happens, the comm sector will revive? 
Michael R. Hsing: That's right. Yes, it has to. That's no brainer. 
Genevieve Cunningham: Our last question is from Melissa Fairbanks of Raymond James. 
Melissa Dailey Fairbanks: Michael, I love a no-brainer. I mean -- I love that. 
Michael R. Hsing: Yes, I don't need my brain to talk about it. 
Melissa Dailey Fairbanks: I'm adjusting my model accordingly. So I know you guys addressed auto earlier, and I know everyone is focused on enterprise data. But I would like to understand better, we're coming up on the model year builds for like model year 2025. I would like to know where you feel comfortable guiding the auto revenue from here? 
Bernie Blegen: Yes. So let me take that one. A lot of the exposure we have with new content is with the EV companies. And so Michael touched on the opportunity, particularly as it relates to Chinese OEMs where we have a good installed base, particularly as it relates to ADAS or autonomous driving.
 And those tend not to be as seasonally driven as the internal combustion. So while we're seeing some sequential improvement quarter-by-quarter during the year, we don't necessarily -- we're not looking for that hockey stick that used to occur with automotive sales in Q3. 
Genevieve Cunningham: I would now like to turn the webinar back over to Bernie. 
Bernie Blegen: So I'd like to thank you all for joining us on this conference call and look forward to talking to you again during the second quarter conference call, which will likely be in late July. Thank you. Have a nice day.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-02-07 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome everyone to the MPS Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Webinar. My name is Genevieve Cunningham and I will be the moderator for this webinar. Joining me today are Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS, and Bernie Blegen, EVP and CFO. In the course of today's webinar, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management's current views and expectations. Risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q4 earnings release and in our latest SEC filings, including our Form 10-K and our Form 10-Q, which are accessible through our website. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today's call. We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, operating income, other income, income before income taxes, net income, and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Tables that outline the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures are included in our Q4 2023 earnings release. I'd also like to remind you that today's conference call is being webcast live over the internet and will be available for replay on our website for one year, along with the earnings release, which was furnished to the SEC earlier today and is available on our website as well. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bernie Blegen.
Bernie Blegen: Thanks Gen. For the full-year of 2023 MPS achieved record revenue of $1.82 billion. This is our 12th consecutive year of revenue growth driven by consistent execution, continued innovation and strong customer focus. As announced today, MPS is expanding into a new $1 billion market with the acquisition of our partner Axign B.V. Axign is a Netherlands-based startup with early revenue, specializing in programmable multi-core digital signal processors. Axign competitive difference is its ability to deliver signals with near-zero distortion and reduce power consumption for automotive and consumer audio systems. The combination of Axign and MPS's IP, which has been accepted by several high-end audio customers, will change people's experience in their cars, homes, concert venues, and stadiums. Let me turn to a few highlights from this past year. Our integrated power management solutions for artificial intelligence enabled our customers to unlock previously untapped opportunities for innovation and growth. We created new automotive content, powering the ramp of autonomous driving, the digital cockpit and lighting systems for both conventional and electric vehicles. We continued to diversify our global R&D footprint with the further expansion of our engineering centers of excellence in Europe and Taiwan. And finally, we continue to expand and diversify our operating footprint with the qualification of multiple new fab and packaging partners in Taiwan, Singapore, and Malaysia. Turning to our full-year 2023 revenue by market segment. Automotive revenue grew $94.6 million year-over-year to $394.7 million in 2023. This 31.5% gain was primarily driven by increased sales of our highly integrated applications supporting advanced driver assistance systems, the digital cockpit and lighting applications. Automotive revenue represented 21.7% of MTS's full-year 2023 revenue, compared with 16.7% in 2022. Full year 2023 enterprise data revenue grew $71.6 million over the prior year to $323 million. This 28.5% increase was primarily due to higher sales of our power management solutions for AI applications. Enterprise Data revenue represented 17.7% of MPS’ total revenue in 2023, compared with 14.8% in 2022. Storage and computing revenue for 2023 grew $38.5 million over the prior year to $491.1 million. This 8.5% increase was primarily driven by increased sales of products for notebooks. Storage and computing revenue represented 27.0% of MPS’ total revenue in 2023, compared with 25.3% in 2022. Communications revenue fell by $46.5 million to $204.9 million, this 18.5% reduction was a result of lower 4G and 5G infrastructure sales. Communications revenue represented 11.3% of our 2023 revenue, compared with 14.0% in 2022. Industrial revenue fell by $46.5 million to $172.7 million in 2023. This 21.2% decrease primarily reflected lower sales in applications for industrial automation, security and power sources. Industrial revenue represented 9.4% of MPS' full-year 2023 revenue, compared with 12.2% in 2022. Consumer revenue decreased $84.8 million to $234.7 million in 2023. This 26.6% year-over-year decrease was a result of broad market weakness across all segments. Consumer revenue represented 12.9% of MPS' full-year 2023 revenue compared with 17.8% in 2022. Let me take a moment to talk about the general business conditions. Throughout 2023, we highlighted that customer ordering patterns were oscillating, reflecting general economic uncertainty. While we saw a nominal improvement in Q4 ordering patterns, we remain cautious as visibility beyond the current quarter is limited. Despite this ongoing uncertainty, we continue to execute against our long-term strategy by bringing innovative new products to market and expanding design wins across our broad base of customers. We believe these ongoing investments position us well for future growth when the macro environment stabilizes. Switching to Q4 results. MPS had fourth quarter revenue of $454.0 million, down 4.4% from the third quarter of 2023 and down 1.3% from the fourth quarter of 2022. Comparing year-over-year results, fourth quarter 2023 revenue for enterprise data grew by 88.4%. Storage and computing fell 2.9%. Automotive was down 7.8%, Consumer decreased 17.5%, Communications decreased 36.3% and Industrial fell 40.5%. Fourth quarter 2023 GAAP gross margin was 55.3%, down 20 basis points from the third quarter of 2023 and 290 basis points below the fourth quarter of 2022. Fourth quarter 2023 non-GAAP gross margin was 55.7%, flat with the third quarter of 2023, but 280 basis points lower than the fourth quarter of 2022. This year-over-year reduction in fourth quarter non-GAAP gross margin is largely due to sales mix. Turning to operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $141.6 million in the fourth quarter, compared with $128 million in the third quarter of 2023 and $130.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Our non-GAAP fourth quarter 2023 operating expenses were $96.7 million, roughly flat with the third quarter of 2023 and up from the $94.8 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2022. The differences between GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are primarily stock compensation expense and income or loss from an unfunded deferred compensation plan. Fourth quarter 2023 stock compensation expense, including $1.2 million charge to cost of goods sold was $41.1 million, compared with $33.6 million recorded in the third quarter of 2023. Switching to the bottom line. Fourth quarter 2023, GAAP net income was $96.9 million or $1.98 per fully diluted share, compared with $2.48 per share in the third quarter of 2023 and $2.45 per share in the fourth quarter of 2022. Q4 2023 non-GAAP net income was $140.9 million or $2.88 per fully diluted share, compared with $3.08 per share in the third quarter of 2023 and $3.17 per share in the fourth quarter of 2022. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q4 2023 were $48.9 million. As for our balance sheet, as of December 31, 2023, cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $1.11 billion, compared to $1.04 billion at the end of the third quarter 2023. For the fourth quarter of 2023, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $153.3 million, compared with $175.9 million in Q3 2023. Fourth quarter 2023 capital spending totaled $13.8 million. Accounts receivable ended the fourth quarter of 2023 at $179.9 million, compared with the $185.8 million reported at the end of the third quarter of 2023 and $182.7 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. There were 36 days of sales outstanding across these comparable periods. Our internal inventories at the end of the fourth quarter of 2023 were $383.7 million down from the $397.3 million at the end of the third quarter of 2023. Days of inventory rose to 172 days at the end of Q4 2023 from 171 days at the end of third quarter of 2023. We have carefully managed our internal inventories throughout the year given the uncertainty in the market. Using next quarter revenue as a basis, inventory was 175 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, down from 178 days at the end of the third quarter of 2023. I would now like to turn to our Q1 2024 outlook. We are forecasting Q1 2024 revenue in the range of $437.0 million to $457.0 million. GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.1% to 55.7%. Non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.4% to 56.0%. Total stock-based compensation expense, including associated employer taxes of $46.2 million to $48.2 million, including approximately $1.4 million that would be charged to cost of goods sold. GAAP operating expenses between $147.2 million and $151.2 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $101.8 million to $103.8 million. This estimate excludes stock-based compensation expense and amortization of recently purchased intangible assets, but includes litigation expense and the expense from our recent Axign acquisition. Other income before foreign exchange gains or losses expected to range from $5.3 million to $5.7 million. Fully diluted shares to be in the range of $48.8 million to $49.2 million of shares. We continue to execute the share buyback program that was announced in our Q3 '23 earnings call. Finally, I am pleased to announce a 25% increase in our quarterly dividend to $1.25 per share from $1 per share for stockholders of record as of March 29, 2024. In conclusion, while we continue to be cautious about the near-term business conditions, we believe our long-term growth strategy remains intact, and we can swiftly adapt to market changes as they occur. I will now open the webinar up for questions.
Operator:
A - Genevieve Cunningham: Thank you, Bernie. Analysts, I would now like to begin our Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham. Quinn, your line is now open.
Quinn Bolton: Can you hear me? Michael, Bernie, can you hear me?
Michael Hsing: Yes.
Bernie Blegen: Yes, we can. Speak up.
Quinn Bolton: Hey, congratulations on the very stable outlook in a pretty choppy environment. Looks like the enterprise data segment was up $30 million quarter-on-quarter, really driving a lot of the growth in the near term. As you look into 2024, can you just talk about your expectations for enterprise data specifically your opportunity to perhaps expand the customer set with some of the other leading GPU and AI accelerator companies? And then I've got a follow-on question. Thank you.
Bernie Blegen: Sure. I'll take that, Quinn. As far as the initial ramp that we've been experiencing over about the last four quarters, we've really seen or benefited from the acceleration of demand for these applications and solutions. As we look ahead, we see a broadening of the number of market participants or customers that will be participating in that. But at the same time, we also believe that competition within the supply chain will continue. So for a majority of the period to-date, we've enjoyed a pretty high percentage of market share, but expect that to decrease as we introduce second and third suppliers.
Michael Hsing: But overall, the overall added -- overall, the market segment is and grow very rapidly. And we're expanding our production lines and we will meet in the second-half for the demand.
Quinn Bolton: Got it. Maybe just looking at sort of the road map for some of these accelerators in 2024. I think you guys have some new ramps with probably higher content, but I think you also have perhaps lower cost cards coming out where you guys may see a step down in your dollar content. Can you just kind of walk through the puts and takes? We should be thinking about your average dollar content per win? Do you still see that trending higher as power consumption goes up? Or is the increase in competition and perhaps efforts to design cost down cards starting to perhaps limit that dollar content opportunity?
Michael Hsing: The dollar content is -- well, it's -- as a market accelerating again, we have more -- our competitor joining and especially this rate of ramp in -- and also, we see other players, other AI players will enter the market that we are so far, we're behind whether pretty much the sole source of power solutions. And as you see the second half or sometime next year, you will see a lot of other players to be qualified or they solve their -- one of the technical problem is, okay, or the odds. So that's what we expect. The cost side, okay, we're always lowering our cost. And at this time, we want to solve all the problems and we believe we resolve all these issues and during this fast ramp. And also the cost at this time is not really the issue. It's all about the throughput and to meet the customer demand.
Bernie Blegen: And one final comment on content is that with each following generation of new products that are being introduced for AI, the power requirements are increasing. And at this point, we have a belief that the dollar content will go up per server. But at this point, it's very hard to gauge that.
Michael Hsing: In the next version of it is -- the power is even higher -- is much higher as Bernie said. And we started to do these product developments back in a couple of years ago. And we're about to release it to our customers in this quarter and the next couple of quarters.
Quinn Bolton: Perfect, thanks. Thank you for all that color.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer. Rick, your line is now open.
Rick Schafer: Yes, thanks. I'll have my congratulations as well. A couple of questions, if I could. I guess, Michael, I'm curious if you could kind of elaborate a little bit, I'm curious what surprised you the most, the last 90-days or so. I'm thinking particularly of auto, obviously, enterprise data was stronger than expected, but auto seems like it's kind of materially gotten softer for most in the last 90-days. So I was curious if you could comment on what you're seeing there. And of course, you guys had, I think, a couple of delayed model year launches last year and the second half. And I was just getting -- trying to get a sense of when those might ramp. And if you consider that an offset maybe to a slower auto market at large.
Michael Hsing: Good questions, good observation. And towards the end of the last year, it kind of -- auto slowed down. But overall, we as Bernie said earlier, we still grow some high 20%, 30% somewhere in the overall -- in the auto segment. These are mostly primary -- mostly due to the ADS the infotainment or whatever the head units, call it, the digital cockpit. And going for next year we believe we see all the activities and customers and nowadays consuming all these inventories that we shipped and in May or June period times, and now they start to have a higher volume ramp and especially in the EV side. So for this year's first part of this year.
Bernie Blegen: So I think that there has been some softness that has occurred in Q3 of last -- Q3 and Q4 of last year that was observable both for IC and EVs. And as we said in our earlier comments and it applies to automotive, we don't have great visibility beyond just the next quarter. So it's hard for us to predict with the second-half of ‘24, the ramp might look like for automotive.
Michael Hsing: Right, the ramp is in the early adoption in EV is very lumpy and a different automakers and ramping in different schedules, I mean -- but overall, the trend is they will pull out more EV with more our products.
Rick Schafer: Thanks, Michael. And if I could follow up, I know Quinn was asking about some of the 48-volt stuff. I was curious, I mean, you guys are so dominant on this in second stage 48-volt, and I know you've got a stage 1 product now as well. So I didn't know if you could give us a sense of what your expectations are for share or revenue contribution. However, you'd like to discuss it. But I'm curious sort of what Stage 1 power will do to your content, we'll do for your -- for that enterprise data segment. And I also was curious only because you mentioned it a couple of times, new competition coming in 48-volt. And I was just curious to get your thoughts on if it gets harder or the competition going forward as guys like NVIDIA move from a two-year cadence on new processor development to an annual cadence.
Michael Hsing: All right. Yes. This game is always the best performers. So far, our competition, we don't -- I don't want to speak our competition. So far, in what we have, okay, and our customers can be very receptive to our solution. So far, we pretty much have a majority of the volumes. And they keep requesting it and keep requesting we solve all these issues related to their system issues, ours and issues from our side. And -- so when -- even the volume gets even bigger it's good to have another source. Otherwise, again, you don't want the MPS, they can all of them. So again, that's not what we intend to do. And so -- and also the competition in -- it's exactly like a server side. And we are the newcomer in the server market back in -- a couple of years ago, and that's how we win the market. And we had a product long before that. And we also need -- we had to dump the down to meet the common footprints. And because the power density is not high enough. And when this AI come out on the market, the common footprint is not a requirement. So we start to win a lot of -- a lot of shares. And the same is in the servers and have a very similar trend. And that's how we win the market. And we always want to do, as we said in the past. We want to pushing the technology. We want to make sure we're the best.
Rick Schafer: And Michael, any sense of Stage 2 -- or sorry, Stage 1 contribution this year for you guys?
Michael Hsing: Yes, okay. We had some issues on the Stage 1s and we had some design wins and very small volumes in different systems, actually. And now we don't have -- all these issues are resolved. That will significantly gain the content. And in each AR systems.
Bernie Blegen: And Stage 1, for us, at least, is represented about 20%, 25% of the dollar content of Stage 2, and we expect to see the incremental ramp from these products in Q1 and Q2.
Michael Hsing: Yes. We had shipping these products for some of the 48-Volt systems. And also, we supply the -- we are as a supplier for chip and for the silicon, not for the modules. And now we step up the two modules.
Rick Schafer: Great. Thank you guys.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Matt Ramsay of Cowen. Matt, your line is now open.
Matt Ramsay: Thank you very much. Congrats guys. Good afternoon. I'm going to ask both of my questions here together because we got two or three calls going on tonight and I don't want to end up on two lines. I don't know that we want to go interweaving earnings calls. But my two questions are the first one, Michael, since you helped found the company, you guys have not been active in M&A traditionally. So I'd be interested to hear a little bit more about the company you're acquiring the markets that you're going to go after how that whole deal came together and what the prospects for that new technologies that you may -- and people that you may roll into the company. Just any background there.
Michael Hsing: That's a great question. So otherwise, we are taking to the old AI call.
Matt Ramsay: Just really quickly on my second one, so I'll go back. Bernie, if you could just help us out with the guidance for March by segment, that would be helpful to make sure we're all modeling from the same footing.
Michael Hsing: All right. Let me answer your first question. And you said it's inactive in the M&A market. That's not true, okay? And we follow our -- well, it's not really a policy. So we follow what we do for the best for our shareholders. We don't acquire revenue. The reason is cheap to grow revenue for MPS. But we do look -- do apply technology. And so this is the -- in the past, actually, we acquired a field and financially immaterial with our shareholders. And at this time, and it's big enough, we made these disclosures. And to talking about this Axign, is the company that we work with in for three years already. And it's proven that their technology and with our power stage and there will be a huge benefit for -- in audio signal to audio amplification fields. And we have a proven in a very, very, very high-end customers and make these products as a very unique and never achieved in histories that no zero disposing signals and same to speakers. And the cost is very low. The way we achieved that. And also, we achieved a lot of programmable is also software adaptive. And that -- I see it when I listen to those sounds, it's really -- you bring audio first we put in the press release, putting audio quality to everybody's home to lower down -- really low down the cost. And that will revolutionize how we listened.
Bernie Blegen: Matt, I'll take the second question then on the guidance as far as what we're looking at for Q1 here. The growth driver is remains the enterprise data. The positive there is that in addition to AI, we're also seeing incremental positive demand for our traditional CPU data center solutions. When you look at the other groups, you -- basically, we see a flattening in comms, but then we see declines that sort of range between the high single digits and low double digits in the sequential growth between Q4 and Q1 for the other groups. Does that answer your question, Matt. Gen, I think we can move to the next one.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Tore, your line is now open.
Tore Svanberg: Yes. Thank you, Michael, Bernie. And congratulations on 12th consecutive year of growth, especially in this environment. That's stunning. My first question for you, Michael, is 2024. So you've already talked about AI and Bernie just sort of gave us directionally things for Q1. But you always seem to surprise us a little bit but something throughout the year. So I'm just wondering, is there anything that you could share with us that could happen either in industrial or communications. I'm not thinking about cyclical stuff. I'm thinking about more sort of new secular stuff that you're working on that could surprise us on the upside this year.
Michael Hsing: Well, instead of -- well, last year, the growth is not very spectacular. It's like what is a single digit -- 1.5%. Okay. It's -- Yes, okay. But this year, I think is who knows. In last year, we didn't know until ChatGPT happened. Then the AI business took off and was out of our expectations, I mean, we didn't know. But to answer your questions to comment your question 11, what is it, 12 years, 11 years in consecutive year-by-year growth. And it's -- we follow our principles. And again, we want to -- first thing, okay, we want to make sure it’s all the product, what we deliver to our customers is the best product, best performers. And we want to beat all our competition. That's number one. Number two is, we react. We react fast, we're nimble, and we fulfill our customer demand. And that's sort of pretty simple strategy that we followed and we kind of disregarded of what the market segment does. And we don't chase those market segments. This year, who knows, okay, with one of the segments and we'll grow, but I don't expect it we'll grow as big as AI, okay? But maybe a couple of small segments happening and I do see that. And we do see that in the recent quarters and the last quarter source and we see all these orders come in and they came in as we expected, those products are truly better than our competitors.
Tore Svanberg: Makes sense. And as my follow-up, I think most people, when they think about MPS, obvious they think about power management and how much share you've gained there. But when I look at the Axign acquisition, I think about your penetration into the data converter space, you're doing much more stuff on the single processing side. I mean, you're clearly building out, I think, a pretty impressive portfolio in what I would call more the mixed signal part of the market. So will you be able to maybe share that with us over time? I don't know, a percentage of revenue collectively so how much these subsegments can represent for the overall business?
Michael Hsing: Yes. Okay. I think in the next couple of years, and you will see some significant growth from a different area, from a single processing and for data converters and for -- of course, we talk about today and the audio process, and which we're already designing and some consumer -- high-volume consumer market segment. And later, we're going to get into automotive and automotive business. And other ones, we have a lot of small things. A lot of other things like silicon carbides and for silicon carbide projects for green energies for solar -- and for solar inverters. And -- well, these are still kind of power management, but a lot of them, we are other power, and these are for communications. And for communications in between -- in the solar side, okay, so from the inverter side. And even the automotive side back to automotive side, and there's a lot of other communication in the -- within the car, and we'll develop those type of products. And you see MPS in the next few years will migrate out to dose a second to those segments.
Tore Svanberg: Excellent. Thank you and congrats again.
Michael Hsing: Thank you.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from William Stein of Truist. William, your line is now open.
William Stein: Hey, thanks. I'll add my congrats to the remarkably stable outlook. And along those lines, the company has had a longer-term revenue growth and margin model that you have talked about in the past. I think the way you say it is either plus growth or around 20 top line and then 10 to 20 bps per quarter on gross margin. We've been sort of really outside of that model as things have been really volatile since -- really since COVID started, I guess, but I wonder if we're potentially honing back into that model? Or should we sort of throw that away and not think about that anymore? How would you encourage us to think about revenue growth and margins longer term?
Michael Hsing: Yes, those kind of models is models and models. And -- but I think the given time and we will be back in a model is the model can be. It's like a weather forecasting, right? we build models and we didn't predict this thunderstorms. And for like the last couple of years, our model is not correct. And either we have too much we too little. So given those kind of economic, whether it's the environment and that model is not quite right. But they end up -- and also, our model is not very scientific either okay, is based on our empirical historical reasons, okay? And -- but we should not deviate from what we see now again.
Bernie Blegen: And just to give people a refresh of what the model is that Will is referring to is, generally speaking, we outperformed the market by 10 to 15 percentage points and in the stable market conditions where it's growing between about 5% and 8%, it's easy to assume that would be between 15% and 20% growth. On the gross margin or range that we targeted about on a non-GAAP basis, is between 55% and 60%. And then when the environment is more predictable, we look to be able to grow gross margin 10 to 15 percentage points -- or basis points on quarterly successive quarters.
Michael Hsing: Yes. I might as well added, okay. We emphasize the product development and also the customers design win. And I do see a lot of wins and many different segments I said earlier and probably I forgot even half of it, okay, in my mind. And there are so many things going on. And -- so going in the future and when a normalize -- as Bernie said, is a more normalized economic conditions. And there's no reason we will not grow -- we grow 1.5%, okay? That's at least say it that way, okay.
Bernie Blegen: But the market contracted 10%.
Michael Hsing: Yes, yes. Okay. Yes.
William Stein: We certainly are outgrowing long-term, no doubt. The other thing I'd like to ask about is inventories. I think on your own balance sheet, you're running below your long-term target now, maybe the maybe my view of the targeted sale. I'm not sure, maybe you can just update us on inventory relative to your target and also in the channel, what you think is going on there, please? Thanks so much.
Bernie Blegen: Sure. I can take that one. So as a reminder, the model is days on our balance sheet between 180 to 200 days. We came in at about the low 170s this quarter, which was really a reflection of how we have been managing our inventory in this uncertain environment. Having said that, we've started a lot of wafer starts ahead of what we believe will be a potential upside certainly in the next few quarters. As far as the channel, that's been a difficult aspect of this market for everybody. And we've had our share of putting inventory in the channel, but I'm very happy to report that over the last three quarters, it's been coming down appreciably. And we're right now just a little bit above our model.
Michael Hsing: We will start to build inventory.
Bernie Blegen: Yes.
William Stein: Great. Thanks so much guys.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Travis Polan of Wells Fargo. Travis, your line is now open.
Travis Polan: Hi, guys. This is Travis on for Gary. Congratulations on the results. I was wondering if you could provide color on how your customer base has evolved through 2023. Historically, MPS has been diverse from this perspective. But did any customer approach 10%? And along those lines, how do you expect this mix to evolve as we move into 2024?
Michael Hsing: Yes, I see these data we grow our small customer base in -- by a few thousand in last year. And that's kind of exciting. And it doesn't mean we add a lot of revenues. And in the longer term, the wealthy I mean -- the bigger the base, the better it is, the more stable MPS will be. And also, you don't know -- and what's the next hardest things, okay? And our customers will decide that. But the market will decide it. Our customer will take opportunity. If it's not this one, that one well. I mean we just explained that play the percentage. And we just have our products goes out the door. Goes to design in those -- to those customers. And in terms of which segments I have to say it's everywhere. This is okay. The -- I can't remember any numbers more than our grow orders more than five or six things. And -- but that's the beauty you won't go 1,000. I mean that takes a few years and it will turn into bigger revenues.
Bernie Blegen: And Travis, it's an excellent question because I think to align with Michael's point there is that the strength of MPS as far as resilience in different market conditions, is the breadth of the customer base and not have high levels of concentration. Now obviously, with this environment where it has been generally weak except for AI we're in sort of an unusual profile, but we don't expect that to last over the next couple three years.
Travis Polan: Got it. Thank you for the color. That’s all from me.
Michael Hsing: Yes, okay.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Tore, your line is now open.
Tore Svanberg: Yes, thank you. I just had two quick follow-ups. First of all, is on revenue capacity. So I know in the past, Michael, you talked about sort of getting to $2 billion in capacity. Obviously, you're there now. But then also any updates on getting to $3 and even $4 billion of revenue capacity?
Michael Hsing: We are building for $4 billion revenues, again, in capacities. And we -- actually we never changed. And especially out of China, and we -- and that actually fits our plan. and we'll continue to do that. And these kind of capacity issues you look at MPS business. And we see -- we believe these business will grow -- we grow our capacity accordingly. It's really a disregarded, okay, what's the current environment we address for long-term issues.
Tore Svanberg: Very good. And then the other follow-up, any updates on the e-commerce business. We haven't heard about that in a while. So I just want to make sure we check in with you and get an update there.
Michael Hsing: Our module business is -- our -- pure e-commerce, I said it, okay, we didn't know what we are talking about and wasn't that excitement and exciting. But the combination of it and with our web service in the e-commerce and also some interactions help from our website. That generates 150 million units now -- last year. And I can't call it in -- what was that, like seven, eight years ago, seven, eight years ago, we're going to these e-commerce business customers logging our website, we're going to -- they can change their -- they can input their parameters and program our ports, we ship the product within a week or so. That didn't happen that much. But -- and yes, it's happening. But I still believe in the long term, that will be the business because we are loading the power management. We're loading all these product designing barriers. And -- why not? People can program the part and especially younger generations. And they have -- they rather program a product rather than use a solid line, putting us in the arms and get and go to a lab is okay to make it happen. And I think it's longer younger generations would do that. And it will be different from other generations, my generation. And that business I believe in the long-term, we're still picking up. But for now, was more than that bad. I cannot say that way.
Tore Svanberg: Great. Thank you, again.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Melissa Fairbanks of Raymond James. Melissa, your line is now open.
Melissa Fairbanks: Hey, guys. Thanks very much. I was wondering if maybe I could squeeze one in about storage and computing business. I know it's not quite as exciting maybe as what's going on in enterprise data.
Michael Hsing: That's not good.
Melissa Fairbanks: I noted that you did pick up some business on the notebook side last year that was kind of opportunistic. We've got some seasonal factors coming in, in March. We've kind of heard that channel inventories, at least on the PC notebook side have normalized somewhat. But wondering if you could just give us a little bit of color on the storage portion of that business that we don't seem to talk about very much.
Michael Hsing: You know, the answer already. And I said, overall, it's not good. Overall, we take on some market shares, and we start to grow a little bit.
Bernie Blegen: So I think the way to look at it is that we anticipated softness in the storage market. And so as a result, we became more competitive on notebooks an accepted lower-margin business. And it was offsetting declines, particularly in SSD where we've seen a decline. We increased share with a lot of the major customers in the SSD market, but their business was in decline for much of 2023. And then the other positive in the group is that we saw the initial ramp of DDR5 during the year and also graphic cards expanded pretty nicely during the year. So this is a group that has different characteristics and net-net did pretty okay in a pretty difficult market.
Michael Hsing: Well, I think the DDR5, we expect to ramp in last year, right? I mean it happened didn't happen that fast. I mean -- so the key is, again, we make sure our product is designing and when these products will ramp, it's not up to us. And we actually care less but only care is we have a product to ship. Okay.
Melissa Fairbanks: All right. Thanks very much, Michael, I'm sorry to bring up a sore point.
Michael Hsing: It's not a sore point. It's a reality like everybody else is.
Melissa Fairbanks: Sure. Alright thanks guys.
Michael Hsing: Alright, thank you.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham. Quinn, your line is now open.
Quinn Bolton: Hey, guys. Just wanted to follow-up, Bernie, I think you had mentioned that in addition to the GPU and AI, you guys are starting to see better traction on just the core CPU server market I know in the past, you've talked about your goal to try to get your share in that segment to 25%. So wondering if you might just give us an update where do you think your share is in CPU core power today? And how are you feeling about that 25% market share target over, say, the next couple of years? Thanks.
Bernie Blegen: Sure. So what really generates interest with our customers is when they see the new product launches at both Intel and AMD ramping and we do the power management for both of those. And I think that as we observed in the last year or even 18 months that the most recent versions of their products have been delayed. And so we've experienced a slower ramp as far as being able to increase share or content on those platforms. But at least initially, is it was observing for Q1 as well as for the balance of '24, we see that both of those ramps starting to improve and that we'll participate with them. At this point, we don't have any reason to doubt our earlier projections as far as overall share opportunity between 20% and 30%. But right at this particular moment, it's hard to say what we have.
Michael Hsing: Yes. Let me talk about this in looking and we didn't have any. And we are 13.5% and because that was about 2.5 years ago, we have a lot of design wins. We have a design win, a few but for me came in the customers -- at their customers, they couldn't get the -- couldn't ship. And we are turning to be the bigger players. We are four teams in -- back in a few years ago, that we're designing a many different projects. And we expect to be a bigger player. And so that's -- we still believe the same story. And when the CPU market picks up and our revenue will start resume to growth. And so what is the last year, and I don't even remember what was the last year, there wasn't spectacular numbers anyway. And I think as soon or later will turn around.
Quinn Bolton: Got it. Thank you.
Genevieve Cunningham: [Operator Instructions] As there are no further questions, I would now like to turn the webinar back over to Bernie.
Bernie Blegen: Great. Thank you very much, everybody. I'd like to thank you for joining us on this conference call, and look forward to talking to you again in our first quarter which will be in late April. And just to add to that, at that time, we'll be introducing a new format for this call. We will provide you content and context on how the end markets have performed in a written manner, and then we will use the conference call portion more for Q&A. So we believe that, that will be a more efficient use of your time and ours and also more complete communication. So with that, I will thank you. And again, I look forward to seeing you again in April.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-10-30 17:00:00) =====
Genevieve Cunningham: Welcome everyone to the MPS Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Webinar. My name is Genevieve Cunningham, and I will be the moderator for this webinar. Joining me today are Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS; and Bernie Blegen, EVP and CFO. In the course of today's webinar, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management's current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q3 earnings release and in our latest SEC filings, including our Form 10-K and our Form 10-Q, which are accessible through our website. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today's call. We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, operating income, other income, income before income taxes, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Tables that outline the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures are included in our Q3 2023 earnings release, which we have furnished to the SEC and is currently available on our website. I'd also like to remind you that today's conference call is being webcast live over the Internet and will be available for replay on our website for one year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bernie Blegen.
Bernie Blegen: Thanks, Gen. MPS reported third quarter revenue of $474.9 million, 7.6% higher than the second quarter of 2023 and 4.1% lower than third quarter of 2022. Compared with Q2 2023, sales in enterprise data and storage and computing improved sequentially, while automotive, industrial and communications revenue was lower. Turning now to our third quarter 2023 revenue by market. In our enterprise data market, third quarter 2023 revenue of $98.9 million increased 106.2% from the second quarter of 2023 with sequential growth in both GPU and CPU program sales. Third quarter 2023 enterprise data revenue was up 31.4% year-over-year. Enterprise data revenue represented 20.8% of MPS' third quarter 2023 revenue compared with 15.2% in the third quarter of 2022. Storage and computing revenue of $129.5 million increased 3.9% from the second quarter of 2023. The sequential revenue improvement primarily reflected higher sales in commercial notebooks. Third quarter 2023 storage and computing revenue was up 14.7% year-over-year. Storage and computing revenue represented 27.3% of MPS' third quarter 2023 revenue compared with 22.8% in the third quarter of 2022. Third quarter consumer revenue of $62.4 million decreased 4.3% from the second quarter of 2023 as higher gaming and monitor sales were offset by declines in TV and home appliance revenue. Third quarter 2023 consumer revenue was down 30.1% year-over-year. Consumer revenue represented 13.1% of MPS' third quarter 2023 revenue compared with 18.0% in third quarter of 2022. Third quarter 2023 communications revenue of $46.8 million was down 5.1% from the second quarter of 2023, primarily reflecting lower infrastructure sales. Third quarter 2023 communications revenue was down 35.3% year-over-year. Communications sales represented 9.9% of our total third quarter 2023 revenue compared with 14.6% in the third quarter of 2022. Third quarter automotive revenue of $95.2 million decreased 8.8% from the second quarter of 2023 primarily due to lower ADAS and digital cockpit sales. Third quarter 2023 revenue was up 9.3% year-over-year. Automotive revenue represented 20.0% of MPS' third quarter 2023 revenue compared with 17.5% in the third quarter of 2022. Third quarter 2023 industrial revenue of $42.1 million decreased 15.3% from the second quarter of 2023 due to lower sales in security and industrial meter applications. Third quarter 2023 revenue was down 28.2% year-over-year. Industrial revenue represented 8.9% of our total third quarter 2023 revenue compared with 11.9% in the third quarter of 2022. I'd like to make some general comments about our business. In our previous earnings calls, we have noted customer ordering patterns were oscillating within the overall market. This environment persisted through Q3. We continue to see some orders getting delayed or amended by pull-in requests. This lack of short-term visibility continues to make forecasting beyond the next quarter difficult. However, as we said in our last call, our business fundamentals remain unchanged. Our design win pipeline and customer base expanded tremendously, particularly amongst Tier 1 accounts. Additionally, we continue to innovate and have a strong design win pipeline position us well for future growth. Moving now to a few comments on gross margin. GAAP gross margin was 55.5%, 60 basis points lower than the second quarter of 2023 and 320 basis points lower than the third quarter of 2022. Our GAAP operating income was approximately $135.6 million compared to $112.3 million reported in the second quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP gross margin for the third quarter of 2023 was 55.7%, down 80 basis points from the gross margin reported for the second quarter of 2023. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in both GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin is attributed largely to an unfavorable product mix. Our non-GAAP operating income was $167.8 million compared to $153.1 million reported in the second quarter of 2023. Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $128 million in third quarter of 2023 compared with $135.4 million in the second quarter of 2023. Our non-GAAP third quarter 2023 operating expenses were approximately $96.6 million, essentially flat with what we saw in each of the first two quarters of 2023. The differences between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are primarily stock compensation expense and income or loss on an unfunded deferred compensation plan. For the third quarter of 2023, stock compensation expense, including approximately $1 million charged cost of goods sold, was $33.6 million compared with $38 million recorded in the second quarter of 2023. Switching to bottom line. Third quarter 2023 GAAP net income was $121.2 million or $2.48 per fully diluted share compared with $99.5 million or $2.04 per share in the second quarter of 2023. Third quarter 2023 non-GAAP net income was $150.3 million or $3.08 per fully diluted share compared with $137.5 million, or $2.82 per fully diluted share in the second quarter of 2023. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q3 2023 were $48.8 million. Now let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $1.04 billion at the end of third quarter 2023 compared with $941.1 million at the end of the second quarter of 2023. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of approximately $175.9 million compared with Q2 2023 operating cash flow of $90.2 million. Accounts receivable ended the quarter of 2023 at $185.8 million, representing 36 days of sales outstanding, which was one-day higher than the 35 days reported at the end of the second quarter of 2023. Our internal inventories at the end of the third quarter of 2023 were $397.3 million, down from $427.4 million at the end of the second quarter of 2023. Days of inventory of 171 days came in at the end of the third quarter of 2023 were 30 days lower than at the end of the second quarter of 2023. Comparing current inventory levels with following quarter's projected revenue, you can see days of inventory decreased to 180 days at the end of the third quarter of 2023 from 184 days at the end of the second quarter of 2023. I would now like to turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2023. We are forecasting Q4 revenue in the range of $442 million to $462 million. GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.2% to 55.8%. Non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.4% to 56%. Total stock-based compensation expense in the range of $32.2 million to $34.2 million, including approximately $1 million that would be charged to cost of goods sold. GAAP operating expenses between $127.1 million to $131.1 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses in the range of $95.9 million to $97.9 million. This estimate excludes stock compensation expense but includes litigation expense. Interest and other income in the range from $4.1 million to $4.5 million before foreign exchange gains or losses. Fully diluted shares in the range of 48.7 million to 49.1 million shares. We are also pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has approved a share buyback program for up to $640 million over the next 3 years with the goal of offsetting future dilution. In conclusion, while we expect visibility to remain limited in the short term, which was the same as last quarter, we continue to execute on the long-term strategy. I will now open the webinar up for questions.
A - Genevieve Cunningham: Thank you, Bernie. Analysts, I would now like to begin our Q&A session. [Management Instructions] Our first question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham. Quinn, your line is now open.
Quinn Bolton: Hi. Michael and Bernie, congratulations on the results and the outlook in a tough market. I guess, Bernie, Michael, the enterprise data business is very strong quarter-on-quarter. Wondering if you could just give us some thoughts as you look into next year, how you see the GPU business. And specifically, do you see sort of expansion of that customer list driving strength in GPUs? And then a question on CPU. You said CPU was up in the third quarter. Wondering if you're finally starting to see some strength in the Sapphire Rapids and Genoa side of that business? And then I have a follow-up question. Thank you.
Michael Hsing: At this time, Quinn, as Bernie said earlier, these markets are very much oscillating and that came in the net, you see it. We done from this quarter. So from last year, year-to-year, we're still down. But AI, as these are power modules and as we're ramping up as a result of -- can maintain growth over in these years and still a slight growth from the last years. That's mainly due to AI. And also in the prior quarters in the autos that we see as a very lumpy business, as lumpy for ADAS ramping up. But all of these, we believe that will happen in ramping up in the next year, not only from ADAS. And also, as you mentioned about on the general CPU and in the server side. And I might as well as mention all the other ones. We still have a lot of greenfield products that haven't really ramped up yet. And many, many projects gets delayed in this year pushing to next year. And we don't want to give a very clear forecast that we still don't know yet. But sometime in the next years, we believe that they will start ramping up and all these greenfield products. So that's kind of my summary for the near-term business.
Quinn Bolton: Thank you, Michael. I guess a follow-up question. Bernie, I think in the script, you mentioned some pushouts, some pull-ins or expedites. I think the pull-ins or expedites maybe newer given just the overall challenging industry. Were the pull-ins specific to certain customers or end markets or are you starting to see pull-in requests across multiple end markets? Thank you.
Bernie Blegen: Yes. Quinn. I think what we're experiencing here is a unique business cycle and that right now, our end customers are unwilling to commit beyond a fairly lower window of expecting lead times within under 10 weeks for delivery. So that makes, as we said earlier in the comments, the predictability really hard to call right now. But I think, as Michael just said, that when we look at our design win pipeline, it's strong. And we're confident that we're in a good position to capture share and growth as the market recovers. But right now, we're still in a level of unpredictability.
Michael Hsing: He's talking about which segments.
Bernie Blegen: Oh, I'm sorry. Which segments?
Michael Hsing: Yes, which segments. We look at it kind of a rough surveys. Like it's actually across the entire product segment, including consumers. Some of the products, they need and pull-it in very quick. As Bernie said, the lead time is very, very short. And we don't have those products, it's pretty much across the board. And other than AI, we really planned ahead, and we really plan ahead from the beginning of the year. And we can anticipate all the ramp-up even for the next few quarters.
Quinn Bolton: Got it. Okay. Thank you.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Tore, your line is now open.
Tore Svanberg: Yes. Thank you, Michael, Bernie. Congratulations on that $1 billion cash balance. First question is on the Q4 outlook. I know you typically don't guide by segment, but can you just talk about directionally where you expect each segment to trend in Q4?
Michael Hsing: Yes. Q4 is still down quite a bit from Q3 and pretty much everything except maybe not auto. I mean all the public sideways are maybe is slightly up and also that AI power still continuously ramp up.
Bernie Blegen: Yes. I think that when you look at the broader market, we're experiencing a lot of the weakness in demand that many of our peer companies are. And what makes us differentiated is the AI boost we're experiencing.
Michael Hsing: And pretty much AI and auto and everything else is pretty much muted, yes.
Tore Svanberg: Very good. And as my follow-up and maybe related to the previous question on enterprise data and AI, just wondering if you have any visibility on the sustainable growth here. There's obviously one big partner that's ramping right now, but it looks like there's some other processor companies that are going to be catching up next year. So if you could give us any color on, especially enterprise data segment for 2024, that would be really helpful.
Michael Hsing: I can tell you, overall, how the MPS strategies. Like the MPS strategy always get the best -- which provides the best performance. When the volume gets higher and requirement is lower, we don't chase those low-end segment. I see MPS is still in the forefront in terms of best efficiencies and the lowest generate heat in smallest areas. We are still the leading -- would be next year and the year after, all these products are eyeing in development with our customers and with the leading-edge -- leading providers in AI GPUs specifically. And that's a huge market, and we don't want to take all of them. And to your other part of the question is the general market. In general market, in other segments, we view CPUs. And you'll remember in the VR13, we didn't have a lot of design wins. But we put up a lot of inventories in the VR13.5, it became a serendipity. And again, we have a few project design win and other supply -- but we ship a lot. So that's where you see the server data center growth. That's because of that. And for next years, we were told to get ready to have those projects ramping up in a rapid supply, let's call it. And so when these markets are already ramping up, MPS are there.
Bernie Blegen: I think, Tore, you hit on a couple of very good points that as far as the AI GPU opportunity, we're very well positioned both for the near term, in 2024, but more importantly, longer term. And as Michael just emphasized, there is a differentiated market there and we want to stay at the high end of that market. So we've always been aware that there would be competitors entering this space and that's how we're differentiating ourself. And then as far as the CPU and GPU markets what we're preparing to do is to manage the uptick in demand that we're anticipating by building that inventory during the next couple of quarters.
Michael Hsing: Oh, yes. That's what I forgot, while I tried to make a point. And MPS doesn't want to be known as AI power company. We want to focus on the diversified growth. And we do have a lot of greenfield products still haven't realized yet. These are across the segment. And also in the consumer side, in the last years, okay, because last couple of years because the shortages we kind of neglect it. And that will -- in the last half years, we developed a low-cost product and we introduced the market where you'll see the growth. That's only on the -- because of very short design cycle, you will see revenue from next year. And all the other product like industrials, automotive, in tracking inverters, in chargers and also ADAS, these were ramping up. And so we want to achieve very diversified growth, not only on the AI side.
Tore Svanberg: Great color. Good job with the buyback. Thank you.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Ross, your line is now open.
Ross Seymore: Hi, guys, can you hear me?
Michael Hsing: Yes. Hi, Ross.
Ross Seymore: Hi, there guys. So I guess the question I have is, I don't know cyclicality or seasonality is carrying the day. But the last couple of quarters, you've talked about weakness. You're not unique in that. But the fourth quarter, you seem to be guiding pretty much back to a seasonal drop. If I look into the first quarter, is that something that you expect to continue, or is visibility just too limited to really comment on that quite yet.
Michael Hsing: Yes. Well, the numbers kind of reflected seasonal, but the reality is it just happened that way, we can't call it seasonal. This is a fast-changing market, I mean, it's very difficult for us to forecast. That's difficult. Unfortunately, we have a lot of capacities. But these capacity were still the lead time still shorter than our production cycle and we have to get ready just that.
Bernie Blegen: Ross, you bring up a really good point is that if we look at the outlook for Q4, a portion of that is how competitive we were at going after the notebook market. And so the Q4, we're experiencing a little bit of a decline as those are seasonal sales. When we look at Q1, Michael said it best, there isn't a lot of visibility. But as we look at this cycle, we believe that next year is really back half-weighted. And so I would probably indicate that we'll have a more conservative profile as we look at the first half of 2024.
Michael Hsing: Yes. Also, I forgot to mention about it. And we talked about beginning of the year, we'll be aggressive on price and especially within the course of board. And then we have a new product in the consumer segment come out -- already came out. And also in a notebook area, we pretty much have a large market share in the commercial side. In the beginning of the year, we were very starting -- become very aggressive on the price. And now, fourth quarter, you see it in our notebook side start to gain more shares in the consumer side.
Ross Seymore: Got it. Thanks for that. And my one follow-up, I want to just pivot over to the gross margin side of things. You mentioned, Bernie, in your script that you're at the low end of your guidance because of mix. I was a little surprised that enterprise data more than doubled sequentially, but yet you pointed to mix. Can you just talk a little bit about what's going on? What mix were you referring to because I think, whether correctly or incorrectly, at least I assume that enterprise data would be an accretive gross margin category.
Michael Hsing: Sure. Well, consumer notebook, margins are very low. But it's an easier money to be made.
Bernie Blegen: Yes. Michael is exactly right, is that we have been aggressive on pricing across the board. And while that isn't called out specifically as a contributing factor to the lower gross margin, it is reflected in the overall mix, notwithstanding the impact of the GPU and AI business.
Ross Seymore: And has that pricing dynamic, is that starting to kind of normalize from here? Or is that an incremental headwind that we should consider going forward?
Bernie Blegen: I believe that as the market begins to stabilize, that will return to a more normal profile as far as pricing. Again, a very specific point to make here is that most of our customers are attracted and we secured design wins because of our innovation as opposed to pricing alone. So I believe that as the market stabilizes sometime in 2024 that we'll probably return to a more normal pricing environment as well.
Michael Hsing: Yes. You said product mix, right? But also, there's other capacities, and capacity utilizations in [indiscernible] and also add a lot of capacity cost for us. So it's a mix of all of them, not only the product mix.
Ross Seymore: Thank you.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer. Rick, your line is now open.
Rick Schafer: Hey, guys. Let me add my congratulations. If I could follow up, just one more question on enterprise data. You mentioned your greenfield product lineup for next year, I think, a couple of times on call. And one of those really stands out is the silicon carbide power isolation module you guys are working on. And I know that's for a couple of different end markets. I was hoping you could give some color around the sort of engagements you're seeing right now with the CSPs, so in data center, maybe a sense of timing of when those initial revenues would start showing up in the model. And my bigger question is really, do you view sort of power isolation module as a TAM expander for your existing enterprise data franchise? Thanks.
Michael Hsing: Let me answer your first for silicon cover. Thanks for reminding me this. I almost forgot. Yes, we released the product. And first revenue, we'll see sometime in the next years, would be in the solar inverters. And the green energies had a lot of demand, we have got products we designed for those -- that market segment and will start to ramp and also in automotive. And these are not specifically for tracking inverter for these drivers. We do power management. And we will see those products designed and ramping up much later. I mean these are clearly in the dip -- there's a void in the market. No other company produces that kind of a product, and it became very unique. And so I have a very good confidence in the second half of next year, the year after. We will see a lot of new revenue coming from that segment. And what's the second questions, second part of the --
Rick Schafer: Yes. Within CSP, the full rack power that I know you guys have discussed. Is there any color you could give around how you view that? Is that sort of a TAM expander for your enterprise data segment? I'm sorry, the hyperscalers?
Michael Hsing: Oh, the hyperscaler. Hyperscaler is now -- you guys know better than we do. We just only provide the power. So I can mean that, for the CPU side, GPU side, as we said earlier, VR14, we expect to have bigger shares. And if you refer to silicon carbide in that we will develop those products. Those are power supplies. And again, these are plug-and-play power supply, and these are large modules. And that will ramp up -- I don't have a time frame. Probably is towards the very end of the next year, the 2025.
Rick Schafer: Okay. Thanks a lot for that color, Michael. And I guess, maybe if I could try one more slide that Ross question on gross margin. I don't know, Bernie, if you could give us any kind of rule of thumb. And I understand it's a mix issue and I hear everything you're saying about the current pricing environment. But as we look the thing sort of normalizing, say, in the second half next year, say you get back to your $2 billion or better kind of run rate, I mean, should we be thinking gross margin at that level should be back sort of tilting toward the high 50s again at that sort of a run rate?
Bernie Blegen: Yes. I would not be too quick to jump to the high 50s in the near term here. I think that what we've said previously is that we expect for the next few quarters to stay within our model, targeting about 56% plus or minus 50 basis points. And then, as we look at the second half of next year, as things stabilize and we get a better mix that we should see return to have an incremental improvement.
Michael Hsing: Yes. I still see some and I didn't look at the number in details. We expand a lot of capacities. And these are strategically not mistake. And we do see a lot of growth in the next couple of years. And so I believe this capacity, the utilization had taken into effect on the gross margins. I don't know how many -- what's the percentage? I don't know. Maybe Bernie can answer you later.
Bernie Blegen: Yes. On the capacity, and I'll take this topic on because it's an important one as we look ahead, is we talked about a year ago as far as developing new relationships with fab partners, particularly in Taiwan and Singapore as we not only expand capacity in advance of a future upswing in demand but also to diversify by geography. And so those investments are adding to our overall cost profile more in the R&D side than in gross margin specifically today, but that capacity will become available here just as we see the second half of next year starting to --
Michael Hsing: Well, these are for future. China is on --
Bernie Blegen: Yes.
Michael Hsing: But the capacity that we expanded from a year ago and it's not utilized, yes?
Bernie Blegen: Yes, not yet.
Michael Hsing: Okay. Or the test equipment.
Rick Schafer: Thanks for all the color guys.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question comes from William Stein of Truist. William, your line is now open.
William Stein: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I'm hoping Michael, you talked about traction in design wins that will turn into revenue over the next several quarters and years. It sounds like you've been very busy with these, as you always are. And often, that means you can see sort of what's coming a little earlier in terms of where the revenue might shift in terms of the end markets and products and that sort of thing. So when you think about the bigger design wins, either the bigger volume runners or the bigger ASP drivers, is there a shift either in end markets or in mix, let's say, for modules or motion control or things like that? Any other shifts in the revenue mix that we should expect because of these design wins that have yet to ramp?
Michael Hsing: Well, thanks for reminding me the motion. I forgot about that. Okay, yes, we do have a lot of design win in the motion side, too. And we look at it. And the beauty is, I can't call it specifically, really across the board. And that means we have our biggest customers, like 4%, 5%, maybe slightly higher out of these years. And all the other customers, there are a few thousand customers and a few thousand products around, I don't know how many market segments. And they are very healthy in terms of design win activities. And so all of them will turn into revenues. And I can give you some bigger segments, and not many people talking about it. And is not, what is it, a USB-C, USB-PD. And I believe that this will be a huge revenue and growth. And MPS has a lot more content versus a USB-PD versus the USB --
Bernie Blegen: Earlier versions.
Michael Hsing: Yes, earlier versions like type B, okay, now it's Type C. And some of them in auto will be cannibalized for USB type B product. And but C is a much higher content, and that's in auto. And in the consumer side, it's totally new. And USB B type is a very low -- is like a consumer side. And now they're converting to USB-C, and that will be a lot broader applications. And it's based on -- because all unified approach, and especially European countries and drive that standards and I think to migrate to everywhere. They have a clear mandate went to switch it. And I believe even Apple on, for the next version of a phone will be USB-C. And we see MPS has a lot of opportunities, a lot of growth. So other than that, battery management and that will ramp in 2014. And again in a lot of different applications from --
Bernie Blegen: 2024.
Michael Hsing: 2024. And these are from power tool to garden tools and from all kind of other things. I mean those are already designed in products, okay, we're ramping in the next 12 to 24 months or less than 6 to 24 months, I guess, yes.
Bernie Blegen: And in addition, just to repeat sort of the opportunities that we talked about in both green energy, clean energy and as well as in DDR5. So there's a large number of products that are expected to ramp here very quickly for us.
William Stein: Great. If I can ask one follow-up. The inventory decline sequentially surprised us a bit. Perhaps this was always your plan. But if it wasn't, can you describe what happened here? Perhaps customer came in with more demand for something or maybe you decided mid-quarter to reduce production. What -- maybe just set me straight on this issue.
Michael Hsing: We reduced the overall inventories that came in starting at the beginning of the year. That's probably reflects that. And yes, and it doesn't mean we will keep that low. We will boost that up more.
Bernie Blegen: Yes. What we've done is, we've said that we have a range of inventory that we want to operate within between 180 to 200 days. And what you've seen is that we did reduce wafer starts about 9 months or 3 quarters ago, and that's now being reflected in our balance sheet today. But as we anticipate the demand for all of the opportunities that we see possible for 2024, we are beginning to ramp inventory. And as Michael said, we have the capacity available to take advantage of that.
William Stein: Thanks, guys.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Matt Ramsay of Cowen. Matt, your line is open.
Matt Ramsay: Thank you very much. Good afternoon, guys. Michael, I wanted to dig into the automotive market a bit and understand the drivers of the business over the next several quarters. I think you guys have some very exciting new content with one of the leading EV OEMs in the States and obviously some really good content with a number of folks in Asia. So if you could try to help us break down what your expectations are for the drivers of your automotive business over the next, I don't know, 6, 9 months relative to some, I'd say, fluctuations in unit expectations from some key customers, I'd really appreciate it. Thanks.
Michael Hsing: Yes. These type of products is not like a consumers. Like a 0.5 year and you can design you out. And it took us a year -- it took us years and it took us at least 12 months to work with our customers, the major suppliers, and to put in the system and make a production worthy and working. And that's a long effort. And frankly, I don't really care, okay? As long as you win those socket or you win those projects. I mean the revenue will come. And so when is the next 3 months or next 9 months? I don't really know. I mean we thought from the last year, again, we saw the last year, middle of this year, we'll start to ramp up. It didn't. But I think it's next year, sometimes that we'll see more and more ADAS and also the new type of tracking inverters. And so that's pretty much just as everybody else expected. All these products are ramping up, okay, we'll go with it.
Bernie Blegen: And if I can just add to that, that a lot of the customers that are picking up on design wins are skewed more heavily to EVs that are inviting new technology platforms. And that market has slowed in unit volumes observed. But the exciting part of this story is that we see that new platform launches for those customers are in position to ramp in the first half of next year. And we're seeing a proliferation of a broadening of those technologies going into more traditional internal combustion, or IC brands. So I think that the automotive market, while it's difficult to time that our positioning is very secure.
Michael Hsing: Yes. Okay. That's a good point. That ADAS, they start to ramp. We were told at the beginning of the year and at the end of the year and now we were told next years. But all of these are new for us. And in the digital cockpit and also ADAS. So now they tell us early next year. And I don't know I can believe or not. I mean --
Bernie Blegen: We'll see, we'll see.
Matt Ramsay: Thank you, guys. I guess my follow-up question, it's not, to me, the most strategically important part of your business, but I think it has a lot of different benefits is the consumer market in Asia. And I mean Bernie used the cookie jar analogy a number of times over the years. And the consumer market got down to a small enough percentage of your revenue. I think there was an intention to potentially really lean in and try to regrow that business both from a revenue perspective and also, it gives you a lot of flexibilities around growth and margins. And maybe the demand environment is not there today to really lean in and regrow that. But I just wanted to do a pulse check on the strategy, that's still the intention to regrow that business as a percentage of revenue and you feel like you have the product portfolio to go and do that?
Michael Hsing: The strategy is correct. And as in the last quarter, I said like has dropped to unhealthy positions, way too low. And there's a lot of money to be made. And margin may be lower but it helped the EPS a lot. So the second question is whether we have enough product? We did a lot of them, and that came in last 0.5 years. And other ones will release in next couple of quarters and our next quarter also, and those will turn into revenues in the 0.5 year to 9 months' time.
Bernie Blegen: We remain committed to the consumer marketplace as part of our diversification.
Michael Hsing: Absolutely. Okay.
Matt Ramsay: Thank you, guys. Have a good afternoon. Appreciate it.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Tore, your line is now open.
Tore Svanberg: Yes. Thank you. I just had two quick follow-ups. First of all, on the buyback, I mean, this is from a size perspective something that's quite large. And we don't have much history with the company in regards to a size like that. So how should we think about, I guess, philosophy with the buyback? You mentioned to offset dilution, but are you going to be opportunistic? Or are you like some other companies where you buy the stock regardless of the price? Just trying to understand some of the dynamics there.
Bernie Blegen: Yes. So I'd like to comment on that very quickly is that when we looked at doing the buyback, we were demonstrating confidence in our free cash flow over the next 3-year window. And the goal here is to offset dilution that will naturally occur during that period of time. So we're going to apply a go-to-market strategy that is both opportunistic but also programmatic. So we don't have a timetable necessarily for how to implement it during that period, but it will reflect both existing market conditions as well as a systematic program.
Michael Hsing: Well, implies a bylaw, keep it higher, yes.
Tore Svanberg: Yes, that's very helpful. The other follow-up, and I know this is a minor detail, but your lighting control business was up quite a bit in the quarter. Was that mainly because of notebook, or was there something else going on there?
Michael Hsing: Lighting business?
Bernie Blegen: I'm sorry, Tore, you broke up a little bit. Were you talking about storage and computing?
Tore Svanberg: No, no, no. So you have the lighting control business. I mean you showed this in your filings. It was up about 20% sequentially. And I was just wondering if that was because of notebook or anything else.
Michael Hsing: No, these are decorate lighting. We don't have a lot of consumer business anymore. But these are small numbers, okay? I mean I don't know that specifically, but I do know we don't have a lot of consumers because these are really, really low price. These are industrial lightings and decorative lighting.
Bernie Blegen: Yes. I apologize, Tore. I think that you broke up and we missed the heart of your question, which end market?
Michael Hsing: Lighting, he said.
Tore Svanberg: Yes. You have a lighting control versus DC to DC, right? So lighting control, it increased by $4.5 million sequentially. It was [1] [ph]. It's a $100 million annual business. I mean it's not trivial, but obviously, small in the bigger scheme of things.
Michael Hsing: Yes.
Bernie Blegen: Yes. Again, Michael addressed it, but it's a general market.
Michael Hsing: I don't know it specifically, but that's the market where we're in. We will position ourself. We're not specifically in the consumer and in high volumes.
Bernie Blegen: And also, it's in automotive as well.
Michael Hsing: Yes. You're right.
Genevieve Cunningham: [Operator Instructions] As there are no further questions, I would now like to turn the webinar back over to Bernie.
Bernie Blegen: Just closing here, I'd like to thank you all for joining us this webinar and I look forward to talking to you again during the fourth quarter, which will likely be at the end of January. Thank you. Have a nice day.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-07-31 17:00:00) =====
Genevieve Cunningham: Welcome, everyone, to the MPS Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Webinar. My name is Genevieve Cunningham, and I will be the moderator for this webinar. Joining me today are Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS; and Bernie Blegen, VP and CFO. In the course of today's webinar, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management's current views and expectations. Please refer to the safe harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the safe harbor statements contained in the Q2 earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on February 24, 2023, and our Form 10-Q filed on May 5, 2023, which are accessible through our website. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today's call. We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, operating income, other income, income before income taxes, net income, and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Tables that outline the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures are included in our Q2 2023 earnings release, which we have furnished to the SEC and is currently available on our website. I'd also like to remind you that today's conference call is being webcast live over the Internet and will be available for replay on our website for one year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bernie Blegen.
Bernie Blegen: Thanks, Gen. MPS reported second quarter revenue of $441.1 million, 2.2% lower than the first quarter of 2023 and 4.3% lower than the second quarter of 2022. Compared with Q1 2023, sales and communications were lower, while industrial, storage and computing, consumer and enterprise data improved sequentially. Turning now to our second quarter 2023 revenue by market. Storage and computing revenue of $124.5 million increased 3.9% from the first quarter of 2023. The sequential revenue improvement primarily reflected higher commercial notebook sales. Second quarter 2023 storage and computing revenue was up 1.8% year-over-year. Storage and computing revenue represented 28.2% of MPS' second quarter 2023 revenue, compared with 26.5% in the second quarter of 2022. Second quarter 2023 industrial revenue of $49.7 million increased 4.8% from the first quarter of 2023, reflecting increased sales of products for power source and industrial meter applications. Second quarter 2023 industrial revenue was down 11.0% year-over-year. Industrial revenue represented 11.3% of our total second quarter 2023 revenue, compared with 12.1% in the second quarter of 2022. Second quarter consumer revenue of $65.2 million increased 2.9% from the first quarter of 2023. The sequential quarterly revenue improvement reflected higher gaming, TV and mobile device sales. Second quarter 2023 consumer revenue was down 33.0% year-over-year. Consumer revenue represented 14.8% of MPS' second quarter 2023 revenue, compared with 21.1% in the second quarter of 2022. In our enterprise data market, second quarter 2023 revenue of $48.0 million increased 1.7% from the first quarter of 2023, primarily due to initial shipments of new generation AI applications, which offset softer demand for CPU applications. Second quarter 2023 enterprise data revenue was down 26.4% year-over-year. Enterprise data revenue represented 10.9% of MPS' second quarter 2023 revenue, compared with 14.2% in the second quarter of 2022. Second quarter automotive revenue of $104.4 million decreased 0.9% from the first quarter of 2023. Second quarter 2023 automotive revenue was up 71.1% year-over-year. Automotive revenue represented 23.6% of MPS' second quarter 2023 revenue, compared with 13.2% in the second quarter of 2022. Second quarter 2023 communications revenue of $49.3 million was down 27.4% from the first quarter of 2023, primarily reflecting lower infrastructure sales. Second quarter 2023 communications revenue was down 16.9% year-over-year. Communications sales represented 11.2% of our total second quarter 2023 revenue, compared with 12.9% in the second quarter of 2022. I'd like to make some general comments about our business. In our previous earning calls, we have noted customer ordering patterns could oscillate. This has turned out to be the case. We continue to see some orders getting delayed or amended by [pull-in] (ph) requests. This lack of short-term visibility has made forecasting beyond Q3 2023 more difficult. However, our business fundamentals remain unchanged. In the last few years, our revenue and customer base have expanded tremendously, particularly amongst Tier 1 accounts. We believe we've solidified our market share gains by delivering quality products and services. Additionally, we have a strong design win pipeline, which positions us well for future growth. Here are a few highlights -- here are a few of our recent highlights. We have been designated a preferred supplier with multiple Tier 1 customers in automotive and telecom markets. We have started sampling silicon carbide power solutions for data centers and green energy conversion. We are also continuing development for EV power management applications. We are continuing to broaden our customer base for AI applications and developing solutions for next-generation platforms. We have new design wins in battery management solutions and USB-PD for automotive, industrial and consumer applications. These will be major revenue drivers as we look ahead to 2024 and 2025. Moving now to a few comments on gross margin. GAAP gross margin was 56.1%, 120 basis points lower than the first quarter of 2023 and 260 basis points lower than the second quarter of 2022. Our GAAP operating income was $112.3 million, compared to $124.3 million reported in the first quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP gross margin for the second quarter of 2023 was 56.5%, down 120 basis points from the gross margin reported in the first quarter of 2023. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in both GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin is attributed largely to unfavorable variances and higher direct expenses. Our Q2 2023 non-GAAP operating income was $153.1 million, compared to $164.1 million reported in the first quarter of 2023. Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $135.4 million in the second quarter of 2023, compared with $134.5 million in the first quarter of 2023. Our non-GAAP second quarter 2023 operating expenses were $96.0 million, matching what was reported in the first quarter of 2023. The difference between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are primarily stock compensation expense and income or loss on an unfunded deferred compensation plan. For the second quarter of 2023, total stock compensation expense, including approximately $1.1 million charged to cost of goods sold, was $38.0 million, compared with $37.0 million recorded in the first quarter of 2023. Switching to the bottom line. Second quarter 2023 GAAP net income was $99.5 million or $2.04 per fully diluted share, compared with $109.8 million or $2.26 per share in the first quarter of 2023. Second quarter 2023 non-GAAP net income was $137.5 million or $2.82 per fully diluted share, compared with $146.0 million or $3.00 per fully diluted share in the first quarter of 2023. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q2 2023 were 48.8 million. Now, let's look at balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $941.1 million at the end of the second quarter of 2023, compared to $919.1 million at the end of the first quarter of 2023. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of approximately $90.2 million, compared with Q1 2023 operating cash flow of $218.8 million. Accounts receivable ended the second quarter of 2023 at $169.2 million, representing 35 days of sales outstanding, which was two days lower than the 37 days reported at the end of the first quarter of 2023. Our internal inventories at the end of the second quarter of 2023 were $427.4 million, down from the $430.8 million at the end of the first quarter of 2023. Days of inventory of 201 days at the end of the second quarter of 2023 were three days lower than at the end of the first quarter of 2023. Comparing current inventory levels with the following quarter's projected revenue, you can see days of inventory decreased to 184 days at the end of the second quarter of 2023 from 203 days at the end of the first quarter of 2023. I would now like to turn to our outlook for the third quarter of 2023. We are forecasting Q3 revenue in the range of $464 million to $484 million; GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.5% to 56.1%; non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.7% to 56.3%; total stock-based compensation expense in the range of $33.5 million to $35.5 million, including approximately $1.0 million that would be charged to cost of goods sold; GAAP operating expenses between $129.4 million and $133.4 million; non-GAAP operating expenses in the range of $96.9 million to $98.9 million, this estimate excludes stock compensation expense, but includes litigation expense; interest and other income in the range of $3.0 million to $3.4 million before foreign exchange gains or losses; fully diluted shares in the range of 48.6 million to 49.0 million shares. In conclusion, we continue to execute our long-term strategy. I will now open the webinar for questions.
A - Genevieve Cunningham: Thank you, Bernie. Analyst, I would now like to begin our Q&A session. As a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, please click on the Participants icon on the menu bar and then click the Raise Hand button. Our first question is from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Ross, your line is now open.
Ross Seymore: Thanks for letting me ask a question. Just wanted to ask Bernie first, when you had your general business condition update about orders remaining volatile, et cetera, I wonder if you could just give us a little more color. Are things kind of improving, staying the same? And is there any changes in things like competitive intensity, pricing, geographic differences? Any color, a little bit more detail than what you gave on your original preamble?
Bernie Blegen: Sure, I'd be glad to help out with that. So, I think that we started that part of the conversation by acknowledging that in each of the last -- the prior three quarters that we believe that ordering patterns would oscillate. And that's pretty consistent when you're coming off of a period where there'd been an extra normal level of ordering that created a demand supply imbalance that afterwards, you're sort of draining your backlog as you are watching your customers try to align around what they're guessing is end customer demand. So, as a result of that, we have not had the same level of visibility out past 90 to 120 days that we would have during the more normal ordering pattern. And so, as a result of that, we don't have the same level of predictability. On the second half of your question, the one thing that remains consistent, whether it's under normal conditions or whether it's today, is we've always been in a very competitive marketplace. And, obviously, price downs are the norm and that we have competitors like ourselves that are trying to go after as much incremental business during this transitory period as is possible.
Michael Hsing: Let me add, too. We do see a slight improvement in first quarters, and essentially, it's similar. And we do see the consumer business improvement and -- from both -- from U.S. [side] (ph) to Asia side, and other ones, pretty much stay the same.
Ross Seymore: Great. Thanks for that. I guess as my follow-up, Bernie, you guys have had relatively volatile end markets, not specific to you, but just in a general sense. So, any sort of color in your guide for the third quarter between the various end markets? And the one I think most people are most interested in albeit still a relatively smaller part of your business is your enterprise data segment. Any sort of color between the AI side, you talked about last for the second quarter, and the CPU side, which has been a little bit weaker?
Michael Hsing: Yes, you already answered your -- all your questions there. We don't see -- we are -- all the products relate to -- with the AI, like, we cannot ship enough now. And the other ones -- other part of enterprise data, it's like data centers, CPU powers, and these are still delayed.
Bernie Blegen: Yeah. And one other thing to add, and this is specific to MPS, not necessarily a broader comment at the general market, but automotive came in a little bit lower than would have been expected. And as we look at the ramp in the second half, we're observing that at least for two of our customers, unit volumes appear to be lower, and we had two product launches which have been delayed into Q4 and to Q1.
Ross Seymore: Thanks, guys.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham. Quinn, your line is now open.
Quinn Bolton: Hey, Michael and Bernie. I just wanted to ask on the GPU side of the business. There's been recent chatter in the market that one of your large customers maybe bringing in Renesas as a second source as well as potentially Vicor. Just wondering if you might share any thoughts you have as you look forward with that customer about the impact of multi-sourcing with that customer? And maybe a related question, how are you feeling about your position looking into the next generation 3-nanometer processor at that customer? And then, I've got a follow-up. Thanks.
Michael Hsing: Okay. I think, so far, we're in the lead position. And I can't -- we are engaged deeply in the future design, and develop a new product for the second generations for the other -- next generations. And so, other than that, we can't speculate any things, okay?
Bernie Blegen: I think in most scenarios and this particular customer's representative is they want to take a leadership position through innovation, and they found us an equal partner for that. But it's in everybody's best interest that it'd be a competitive, not a single source. And so, yes, we'd always anticipated that there would be redesigns that allow competition into the market.
Michael Hsing: Either as a -- we had to provide the best solution, and at the same time, we understand that our customers require other solutions. This is a very large market. There's no means an MPS can supply everything. And, also, MPS is always -- we emphasize diversified growth. And if there's a performance need, I believe the MPS is the best solution now for the near future.
Quinn Bolton: Thank you, Michael. Bernie, you'd mentioned sort of visibility out beyond 90 to 120 days is pretty choppy at this point just given the industry dynamics. I guess I look out to the fourth quarter, and it looks like the Street has modeled the fourth quarter approximately flat, which I think is an above seasonal pattern for MPS historically. And I'm just wondering can you comment whether you think an above seasonal fourth quarter looks right to you, perhaps given the ramp in the GPU business and some of the timing shifts you just mentioned in automotive? Or do you think it would be best for investors to think that the December quarter is going to see a -- sort of a seasonal decline in the December quarter? Thank you.
Bernie Blegen: Yeah. I think that normal seasonality for MPS would be somewhere between a sequential decline of between 4 percentage points and 5 percentage points. And I can point to the increase in the notebook sales during Q3, which precedes Christmas, so that's a normal seasonal factor that's expected to come down. And we're not seeing the uplift that had been anticipated from automotive. So, I would be more comfortable with a seasonal down in Q4.
Michael Hsing: Well, it's a -- you mentioned as a seasonality -- well, we're talking about seasonality, and I try to figure out what is seasonality now. And last year, we -- last couple of years, we have a very strong Q4, at least the year before that. And the customers see all those shortages, and now the demand is -- clearly is much less. And so, you have a -- we experienced, like, a year-over-year, so like a -- in the last couple years, like, over 40%. And this year, and it clearly is not as much, okay? I mean, much less. And I can't really call it seasonality anymore. So, just as I said, it's not very clear. But as Bernie said, usually in a seasonality, we're lowered.
Quinn Bolton: Understood. Thank you, Michael. Thank you, Bernie.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer. Rick, your line is now open.
Rick Schafer: Thanks. Yeah, guys, I just had a couple questions if I could. The first one is a -- if I could kind of maybe revisit auto for a second. I mean, you mentioned power isolation module in your prepared remarks. And I don't know if you could give us a little bit more color there. Like, kind of an update on how many customers are evaluating the product now? Talk a little bit about if you could, like, design win timing, revenue timing, kind of expectation there? And is auto going to be the first to ramp and then data center and then more of the green stuff? Or how does it all kind of shake out, I guess, is what I'm asking.
Michael Hsing: Yeah, that [we saw] (ph) delay a little bit, but we will reintroduce to resampling and announce, and it was a delay due to the technical issues. And so, as speaking right now, we have resampled it. And mostly, it's in automotive and also data centers. And same as we mentioned earlier, the silicon carbides and -- these are product that we'll start to sample.
Rick Schafer: Okay. Thanks, Michael. And then, second question is you guys have almost $2 billion power management business now. And I think modules are on track to be 10% of that or so this year. And I think that's up from basically nothing just a couple of years ago. So, if this business sort of has, I believe, and Bernie, I'm sure correct me, in lighter better margins, I think, the core average, I think it's a 5x ASP multiplier. I'm just trying to get a sense of -- Michael, how big do you envision this business becoming as a percent of mix going forward? And are there any particular end markets that are going to be favored, at least initially, by the move into modules? Thanks.
Michael Hsing: Yes. Okay. I believe that's our future. And when customers want to have a plug-in-play solutions and they want a less technically involved with power management, and that's -- module solution is the way to go. People doesn't want to buy ICs, design all of -- all these up -- the component. And, initially, that's where we're ramping a lot of them in the auto business, in the industrials, that can be an industrial site, and as well as a telecom, and -- or even semi equipment. And a lot of -- I can give -- go on and on, like, a lot of things to be mentioned. But most of all these products is not price sensitive, and they're not volume consumer-related product. And so, this is still at the very beginning. We have all these customer base, and we have all the new product coming out, and we'll see the similar growth rate in next few years.
Rick Schafer: Got it. Thanks, Michael.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Jeremy Kwan of Stifel. Jeremy, your line is now open.
Jeremy Kwan: Thank you. Yes, this is Jeremy on for Tore. I guess maybe a first question on the comms business. It was down meaningfully as you guys expected, and we're probably one of the early ones to call out last quarter. I guess what's your sense of where things are now? Should we expect this business to kind of sort of bounce along at these levels in the second half before maybe picking up next year? And what are your customers telling you in terms of their expectations?
Michael Hsing: Yeah, as you see, we didn't participate at 4Gs. And 5Gs and other infrastructure business, all new to us. And so, you know that 5G hasn't really ramped up quickly yet. But our products in -- were designed in last few years, we're just waiting for our customers to give us orders. And so far, it's not clear. Okay. Next question?
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from William Stein of Truist. William, your line is now open.
William Stein: Hey. There we go. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I'm hoping you can talk to us about channel inventory. When we look at your P&L, you had nearly 50% revenue growth last year. I think there's a lot of -- there's a pretty strong sense among investors that there might be some inventory still in the channel to be worked through. We'd love to hear any update or any measurement you have of that?
Bernie Blegen: Sure. So, as far as what we observed in Q2 is that there was a meaningful decrease in channel inventories both in terms of dollars and days. And the sort of phenomena that we've seen has been a time delay between when the end customer places an order and when they want to do a pullback because of uncertainty with what end customer demand has been. So, I can point to a couple of our end markets where that was very clear. But we believe right now that we're in a position to continue to bring -- to normalize channel inventories over the next two quarters.
William Stein: So, not normalized yet, so -- is what it sounds like. So, in the September for guidance, I assume there's some expectation that sell-in will be lower than sell-through. Is that fair?
Bernie Blegen: Yeah. Again, going back to the comments about the visibility and predictability out past 90 or 120 days, that's not just the demand that -- the new net orders that we're receiving, but also the strength of the sell-through is also a little harder to predict.
William Stein: Great. Thank you.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Matt Ramsay of Cohen. Matt, your line is now open.
Matt Ramsay: Thank you very much. Michael, Bernie, can you guys hear me okay?
Michael Hsing: Yes.
Matt Ramsay: Awesome. So, I guess for my first question, Michael, we've -- you and I've had some conversations about the company strategically wanting to sort of rebuild the consumer business as a percentage of revenue over time and get it back to a higher level than it's been now. I guess I'd like to revisit some of those conversations and just see if you had any comments about how you feel about supply, the demand environment, and the competitive environment in order to try to push to sort of reemphasize your company and certain parts strategically of that consumer segment. Thank you.
Michael Hsing: Yeah. So, that's a good question. So, now we see some improvement, but this is at the beginning. And, as we see our supply, the cost went down dramatically, and as Bernie said, our inventory values even -- I mean, it will reflect inventory value now. And so, in the past, MPS is named in the price killers. It's a very simple game. We don't mind, and we don't buy in that consumer segments and we have a fight. And all the high gross margins is on the other segments. And it's all because they share our technology strengths. We provide a much better, a much smaller size. And in a consumer segment, in the last couple of years, we neglected that, and -- because we don't have enough revenues -- or enough capacities. And so, it's not that difficult to go back to the same games that we played since IPOed.
Matt Ramsay: Thanks, Michael. I think as my follow-up question, I wanted to really focus on the enterprise data segment just because that's where a large percentage of my investor questions come from. And I think there's two dynamics going on here, right, the strength of the AI business with your lead customer there, and some softness in the CPU market that's well documented. And so, the question is really what would you guys, I think, have built on books inventory to support ramps of all the customers in that space? So, I guess the question is, how quickly and what would the lead times be to respond to an uptick in demand? And do you have any visibility into the timing of a potential reacceleration of that segment? And how long is that visibility? Thanks.
Michael Hsing: Our visibility is okay, probably is well documented. If you're listening to all these major AIs, [probably you will see] (ph) MPS. And you will see that MPS in the next few quarters of a potential. And -- but I can talk to you about technical issues. I think that the MPS is so far the solutions is far better than our competitor. So, we -- in a -- for the next generation of our AI processor, we're not working on now, we're working a year ago, even 18 months ago. And -- so the relationship is a strong and, also, for the technical reason, even more challenging. And the space is critical, and you had to radiate all the heat out. And for the next generation, power even higher. And so, we provide all these vertical solutions, and we pioneer with it. And all the other solution had to fit into the form in a form factors. And the integrated solution is the only way to go.
Bernie Blegen: And I think if I could just add to that, it's also the breadth of the customer opportunities that we're engaged with. And over the course of the next four quarters, we're going to see multiple new customer applications launch initially with MPS. So, yes, we have a very powerful initial position with one customer, but we expect to branch that out very quickly.
Michael Hsing: It was multiple customers.
Bernie Blegen: Multiple customers.
Matt Ramsay: Thank you, guys. Really appreciate it.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Hans Mosesmann of Rosenblatt. Hans, your line is now open. Our next question is from Jeremy Kwan of Stifel. Jeremy, your line is now open.
Jeremy Kwan: Yes. Hi. Thank you for allowing me a follow-up here. I guess, I wanted to ask about capacity. You guys have always been very ahead of curve on long-term capacity and through up and down cycles. I was wondering how you're thinking about it in this environment and whether or not that may give you guys a competitive advantage in some of these applications that you're really targeting? And, also, if you have a CapEx number for this quarter? Thank you.
Michael Hsing: Yeah. As we stated it earlier, many of our customers requested move out of China. And now we kind of achieved more than 50%. We can have more than 50% of our capability out of China. And so, the overall capacities, we don't have it. Problem now is, we have more inventories, and we want to sell more from our inventory. And -- does that answer your questions?
Bernie Blegen: Yeah. And I think that when you look at capacity today, it's really when this environment turns around and becomes more predictable, how are we positioned to service our customers a year and two years from now. And I think the investments that we're making, both in terms of expanding capacity and diversifying it geographically, both on the front-end and the back-end will pay very good dividends as far as customer satisfaction.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Chris Caso of Wolfe. Chris, your line is now open.
Chris Caso: Yes. Thank you. Good evening. First question is regarding order visibility. And I ask because for the past several quarters, there really hasn't been any requirement for turns business going forward. Is that something that's changing going forward, given some of the changes in the end markets? And what does that mean with regard to revenue visibility as we look out at over the next few quarters?
Bernie Blegen: Sure. I think that Michael responded to this pretty nicely in that we saw some improvement in Q2 from Q1 as far as our net bookings, but it's still not to the degree that we historically enjoyed in either 2018 or 2020, just to pick two more recent years. In the past, we would have up to 90%, 95% of our next quarter's revenue in hand at the end of the preceding quarter. And so, you're only relying on a fraction of a percent in order to -- of turns business in order to accomplish the numbers for that particular quarter. So, we're seeing steady improvement, but we're still not at the level yet where we have that predictability.
Chris Caso: Got it. Thank you. As a follow-up, I just had a follow-up question about supply, and I understand that that supply is getting a bit easier out there. Historically, I think your ability to procure supply from places different from your competitor has been a source of competitive advantage for Monolithic Power. How do you see the landscape going forward? I know you bringing on some different foundry partners as you try to diversify outside of China. What do you think that means for both your access to wafers over the long term as well as the pricing? Do you think that competitive advantage remains?
Michael Hsing: Well, you're mentioning of pricing, of course, all these material costs is a much lower than -- or go back to normal, I should say, to -- as pre-pandemic. And so, in terms of a capacities, look, I didn't mention earlier, we want to expand out of China, that's from our customers' request. And the other one is we want to expand it because just for our next couple of years' growth. And mostly, we we're still in a -- follow our long-term plan, and we invest, of course, now which will slow down a little bit in the next few quarters, and -- but over the long term, so we should spin -- we should continue the course.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-05-04 12:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome, everyone, to the MPS' First Quarter 2023 Earnings Webinar. My name is Jennifer Cunningham, and I will be the moderator for this webinar.  Joining me today are Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS; and Bernie Blegen, VP and CFO. In the course of today's conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management's current views and expectations. Please refer to the safe harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the safe harbor statements contained in the Q1 earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on February 24, 2023, which is accessible through our website. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today's call. We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, R&D and SG&A expense, operating income, other income, income before income taxes, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our Q1 2023 earnings release, which we have furnished to the SEC and is currently available on our website. I'd also like to remind you that today's conference call is being webcast live over the Internet and will be available for replay on our website for 1 year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bernie Blegen.
Bernie Blegen: Thanks, Jen. MPS' first quarter revenue of $451.1 million came in about as expected, 19.4% higher than the first quarter of 2022 or 1.9% lower than revenue reported in the fourth quarter of 2022. Our results for the quarter were mixed with weaker quarter-to-quarter demand in our enterprise data and industrial markets, overshadowing improvements in consumer and automotive. Let's take a quick look at our first quarter 2023 revenue by market. First quarter 2023 consumer revenue of $63.4 million increased 19.5% from the fourth quarter of 2022. First quarter 2023 revenue was down 20.8% year-over-year. Consumer revenue represented 14.8% of our first quarter 2023 revenue compared with 21.2 -- a 21.2% contribution in the first quarter of 2022. First quarter 2023 automotive revenue of $105.3 million increased $8.0 million or 8.2% from the fourth quarter of 2022. This sequential revenue increase was primarily due to continued acceptance of our highly integrated solutions for advanced driver assistance systems, the digital cockpit and lighting applications. First quarter 2023 revenue was up 93.1% year-over-year. Automotive revenue represented 23.3% of MPS' first quarter 2023 revenue compared with 14.4% in the first quarter of 2022. First quarter 2023 Communications revenue of $67.9 million rose $3.6 million or 5.6% from the fourth quarter of 2022. This quarter-over-quarter increase primarily reflected a modest revenue improvement in 5G infrastructure. First quarter 2023 revenue was up 22.2% year-over-year. Communications revenue represented 15.1% of MPS' first quarter 2023 revenue compared with 14.7% in the first quarter of 2022. In our storage and computing market, first quarter 2023 revenue of $119.8 million was essentially flat with revenue recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022, as declining storage revenue was offset by higher notebook sales. First quarter 2023 revenue was up 24.1% year-over-year. Storage and computing revenue represented 26.6% of MPS' first quarter 2023 revenue compared with 25.6% in the first quarter of 2022. First quarter 2023 Industrial revenue of $47.5 million decreased $8.6 million or 15.3% from the fourth quarter of 2022. This quarter-over-quarter decrease was due to lower security and power source revenue. First quarter 2023 Industrial revenue was down 2.2% year-over-year. Industrial revenue represented 10.5% of our first quarter 2023 revenue compared with 12.9% in the first quarter of 2022. In Enterprise Data, first quarter 2023 revenue of $47.2 million decreased $21.3 million or 31.1% from the fourth quarter of 2022 due to broad-based weakness in data center spending. First quarter 2023 revenue was up 10.9% year-over-year. Enterprise data revenue represented 10.5% of MPS' first quarter 2023 revenue compared with 11.2% in the first quarter of 2022.  I'd like to share some general business observations. During our 2 most recent earnings calls, we highlighted that customers were becoming more concerned with near-term business conditions and that ordering patterns might oscillate. This behavior continued through the first quarter of 2023. However, we do see order acceleration for products related to artificial intelligence, autonomous driving, and power modules, and our customer engagement and design win momentum remains strong across all of our markets. Regarding operating expenses, we continue to invest in our operations to support long-term growth. In response to customer concerns, we are expanding and geographically diversifying both our global production, operations and our R&D activities.  In summary, we have strong customer engagement, design win momentum and are continuing to invest for the long term, even though timing of the revenue ramp from our customers remains uncertain. Moving now to a few comments on gross margin. GAAP gross margin was 57.4% and 80 basis points lower than the fourth quarter of 2022 and 60 basis points lower than the first quarter of 2022. Our GAAP operating income was $124.3 million compared with $136.9 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2022.  For the first quarter of 2023, non-GAAP gross margin was 57.7%, 80 basis points lower than the fourth quarter of 2022 and 60 basis points lower than the first quarter of 2022. This downward pressure on gross margin is expected to continue near term as we work through higher value inventory built up during the supply-demand imbalance following the pandemic. Our non-GAAP operating income was $164.1 million compared to $174.1 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2022.  Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $134.5 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared with $130.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Our non-GAAP first quarter 2023 operating expenses were $96.0 million up from $94.8 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2022.  The differences between GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are primarily stock compensation expense and income or loss from an unfunded deferred compensation plan.  For the first quarter of 2023, total stock compensation expense, including approximately $1.1 million charge to cost of goods sold, was $37.0 million compared to $35.3 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2022. Switching to the bottom line. First quarter 2023 GAAP net income was $109.8 million or $2.26 per fully diluted share compared with $119.1 million or $2.45 per fully diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2022. First quarter 2023 non-GAAP net income was $146 million or $3.00 per fully diluted share compared with $154 million or $3.17 per fully diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2022. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q1 2023 were $48.7 million. Now let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $919.1 million at the end of the first quarter of 2023 compared to $739.6 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $218.8 million compared with operating cash flow of $52.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. First quarter 2023 capital spending totaled $8.9 million. Accounts receivable ended the first quarter of 2023 at $184.3 million or 37 days of sales outstanding, up 1 day from 36 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022.  Our internal inventories at the end of the first quarter of 2023 were $430.8 million, down from $447.3 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. Days of inventory decreased to 204 days at the end of Q1 2023 compared with 212 days at the end of fourth quarter of 2022.  Comparing current inventory levels with the following quarter's projected revenue, you can see days of inventory decreased to 203 days at the end of the first quarter of 2023, from 212 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. I would now like to turn to our outlook for the second quarter of 2023. We are forecasting Q2 revenue in the range of $430 million to $450 million. We also expect the following: GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.9% to 56.5%. Non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 56.2% to 56.8%. GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses between $132.5 million and $136.5 million. GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to be in the range of $94.9 million to $96.9 million. This estimate excludes stock compensation expense, but includes litigation expense. Total stock-based compensation expense of $38.8 million to $40.8 million, including approximately $1.2 million that would be charged to cost of goods sold. Interest and other income is expected to range from $3.8 million to $4.2 million before foreign exchange gains or losses.  Fully diluted shares to be in the range of 48.6 million to 49.0 million shares. In conclusion, while we remain cautious about near-term business conditions, MPS will continue to focus on business development and investing in infrastructure as necessary to support our long-term growth. I'll now open the webinar up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Tore Svanberg of Stifel.
Tore Svanberg: I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit more, Bernie, on your comment about the business conditions. Because it sounds like the design win momentum is still very strong. The activity is very strong, but you also sort of added there was uncertainty in certain ramps. So maybe you could elaborate a little bit on that, especially when thinking about the second half which seems to be a period where the industry could potentially recover.
Michael Hsing: Let me answer my -- Tore, let me ask first, okay. And -- so you look at all these industries, okay, we -- it's about servers computing, including industrial servers and AI product, that's about 10% of the MPS revenue. And we had a hyper -- we experienced this area really the -- all the entire companies experienced hyper growth, okay, in the last 2 or 3 years. And now the automotive to, again, we're about 23% of our business. Total together and where it's about a 30-some percent. In AI other than, okay -- across the board, other than AI and automotive and so far, still we experienced still very heavy demand.  Other than that, again, all these design win activities that happened in the last 4, 5 years, and they started to ramp last couple of years. And a lot of -- because the reason we have all the inventory, we have expanded capacities and we grow much faster than the average. And now to answer your question directly, the -- our customers, all these products during a ramp, they have a pause. And they don't know what's coming and the new product and they push out. And so we just cutting in the period, which is not bad to me. Because in the last 2 or 3 years, we -- we have been in this unsustainable growth and hyper growth. It's like a 30%, 40% year-over-year, and that will break the company.  And I'm glad to announce we're, okay, coming to -- back to the normal I mean, and we will ride this the global market uncertainties and we just adapt as in the past. Okay, Bernie, maybe you can add some more detail, okay.
Bernie Blegen: And I think Michael has really laid out a very compelling case as far as the growth that we've experienced over the last 3 years, and also identifying that the automotive market remains solidly intact, but particularly in Enterprise Data with the exception of AI that we are seeing lag in ordering patterns there and general weakness in our other markets. So I think the thing to reinforce here is that the business model here remains intact. We've built MPS around sustainable growth over the long haul.  And right now, we're looking at a quarter where the end customer demand is not picking up as well as we might have anticipated a quarter or 2 quarters ago. But again, the business model is intact.
Tore Svanberg: That's great perspective. And as my follow-up, you talked about gross margin coming down very moderately because of higher value inventory. Could you talk about how long you expect that to play out and even some ranges? I mean I assume maybe you'll get to, I don't know, 55%, 56% gross margin. But yes, any color you can give on the -- how long that lower gross margin would last?
Bernie Blegen: Sure. And the good news here is that cycle times and pricing both in the fab, the assembly houses are coming down. And so we'll be able to participate in the lower cost after we burn down the inventory, which is currently at about 203, 204 days. So I would expect that we'll see a downward pressure on margins through Q2 and Q3, and then perhaps a moderation leveling in around Q4.
Tore Svanberg: Yes. Go ahead, Michael.
Michael Hsing: Yes. I might as well add, clearly, we see -- we go into a downturn situation and gave me and -- we don't know, I guess, some segment will grow in MPS because of very diverse companies and some area would be still good. And in general, the consumers and they get products and even some notebook may come back in the second year. And the point is I'll try to make is regarding to gross margins, and as you know in the past, when the industry starts to slow down, and again, MPS will be more aggressive in price. And to gain more consumer segment of the market because it can do 6 months later, when you turn the knob, we actively pursue those products 6 months later, those are fast design cycles, and you will turn the knob in the revenues in about 6 months' time.  So we care less about the short-term gross margins, but the long-term gross margins is still the same. So we emphasize and as you know, in the last 10 years or so, and we'll still pursue those models. And in the consumer segment, we may -- we made just a short -- focus on in the short term to grow the -- to maintain the growth.
Operator: Our next question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham.
Nathaniel Bolton: I guess I wanted to follow up on Tore's question. Really, Michael and Bernie, as you look into the second half of the year, that's normally a seasonally stronger period for the company. Obviously, it feels like there are lots of puts and takes, lots of uncertainty, customers delaying product ramps. But can you give us any sense how you're thinking about the second half of the year? Will you see sort of a normal seasonal uptick in September? Or are you thinking September could be flattish with kind of the 1Q, 2Q run rate? Any additional color would be helpful just to try to think about the second half.
Bernie Blegen: Sure. I think that right now, normal seasonality still applies, but in our case, it's a little more muted because so much of our growth in the business is attached to those new product introductions being made by our customers. So if we look in Enterprise Data in which our major customers or the products that we're supporting have had product delays. And when you look at other aspects of our business, for example, Communications, that's still what I'd refer to as lumpy. It's not necessarily trending in a seasonal pattern.  So I think that your comment is very balanced and all I'm tilting is to the new product introductions being delayed probably being a larger factor than just seasonality.
Michael Hsing: Yes. I think we can't say really like a normal seasonality anymore. I mean we -- we experienced in the past. And you have some segments that grow really well. I mean some segments hit kind of a bottom that came last Q3, last year, Q4, especially like a notebook side. I mean now you see okay, it's a wakening up. I mean, MPS has won orders in design as those reference designs and we have the power -- the power solutions -- and we will see, second half, mostly all the other reservoir business, other than AI, automotive, we don't -- we have no clear views. And so that's the short term.
Nathaniel Bolton: Understood. I wanted to follow up on the Enterprise Data segment. Obviously, a weaker result and sounds like some of the product or customer delays are sort of focused in that segment. Do you still think as the new server cycle ramps that you can get your share of the Vcore power management market towards 20 percentage? Is that still the right opportunity to be thinking about longer term, even if some of those customer programs have pushed out by somewhat?
Michael Hsing: Absolutely. I confidently say that. I mean, because we see all these projects has not really fully ramped yet. In all the data centers, clearly, you guys know better, I mean now slowed down dramatically. I don't know whether they overexpanded last couple of years and now slowed, take a pause, okay? We don't have clear views. And what we know from last quarter to Q1 -- or Q4, Q1 to now, and they kind of slowed down.
Bernie Blegen: And if I can add to that, again, using -- I know that you're focused right now on the short term as far as the second half of the year. But in the GPU space for artificial intelligence, we have a very senior market share position. And as we look ahead to even the next generation, we're in a very good position to take advantage of the next generation of GPUs. So we're really still in early stages as far as being able to leverage up our position and expand our share.
Michael Hsing: Yes, yes. That's I didn't add that part. The GPU part came in the AI side, we have a current design win and as well as the next design, and the futures we will release end of the year or next year. And those were MPS product will ramp to this. Earlier, I referred to is that all these data centers, CPU powers or data center power overall, and we still have maybe just -- if it's not a single digit, just barely double-digit market shares. And a lot of -- and from a transition from a VR13 to 14, and it's not completed yet. We won a lot of design wins in VR14 and it will turn into revenues.
Operator: Our next question is from Matt Ramsay of Cowen.
Matthew Ramsay: Guys, I wanted to ask, I guess, a two part question on gross margin, and this is sort of -- you guys have been in -- gone from sort of 54, 55, 56 on that steady cadence of 10 to 20 basis points a quarter, and that was amazingly steady. And then during the period of supply-demand imbalance, we jumped up to 58 or so, and now we've come back in and you guys discussed that in the short term. But as you look out over the next 2, 3 years and you think about the strategy to be aggressive and grow, and contrast that to some of the opportunities that you have for new design wins and higher content, maybe you could level set us on the long-term gross margin. Has anything changed there? And where is the new normal?  And I guess the second part of that thought, guys, is, have you seen any specific price pressure in any markets as some of your competitors maybe get more supply?
Michael Hsing: Yes. Okay. Let me answer your last part first, okay. Any high volume, our customers have multiple suppliers, we -- they always have a price pressure, other than the last 2 or 3 years. Other than that, they couldn't ship, only the MPS came. Most of the companies have struggled in shipments and MPS, we have less. And so nowadays I mean all the higher volumes as we expected, and in the last couple of years, and I can also remember, we didn't talk that much. We introduced new technology, which is a much lower cost. And there will be a fight.  And so to answer that part of the question. But earlier, I said it, I care less about our gross margin lately, but we're still operating within the models. We're not dramatically go down. Clearly, it will go down. And but -- in a long-term model, to answer your question, 2 or 3 years out, the business -- MPS business is still pretty much intact. And we are focused on those high values. We transition from IC solutions to sell solutions. That still remains our focus. Our long-term business we will go that way and which generate and offers more values, and we have higher gross margins.
Bernie Blegen: And I think just to polish off the comment there is that as far as our model, we've been operating over the last several years between 55% and approaching 60% as far as a non-GAAP gross margin. And as we introduce these higher-value products, they tend to have higher margins. And what that allows us to do is then manage the mix of business such that we stay within our model. So while we sort of anticipated in the near term downward pressure with a flattening here in the next 3 to 4 quarters, we'll continue to look to be opportunistic and managing gross margin to accelerate revenue growth.
Matthew Ramsay: Got it. As my follow-up, and I apologize for this being a near-term question, but with all the different end market volatility. Bernie, if you could help us on your guidance by segment, just the revenue trends that you guys see into the June quarter, that would be great.
Bernie Blegen: Sure. I think that we said earlier in the call...
Michael Hsing: It's fair to ask a short-term question because this is a very uncertain period.
Bernie Blegen: So I think to sort of make a simple point on it is that automotive continues to be doing very well. And there, it's both the market itself as well as the share gains that we're enjoying. I said earlier that Communications is lumpy and the other areas, including Storage and Compute, Enterprise Data and Consumer and Industrial are sort of flattish for the near term.
Michael Hsing: Well, also the storage -- in the AI segment in the -- in data center, if we -- the computing segment is maybe is flattish, okay? I mean I think the majority of our revenues has come from -- still come from servers. And you see it in the ramping in the last 18 months or so. In the AI and the total -- AI in the total revenues is still a smaller percentage. And the other thing I'm pointing out, there's a memory sections. I mean they're changing a new format, and they start to ramp now. This is the result that we're kind of flattish, okay? I mean it depends on how fast you ramp up to DDR5.  MPS has -- have engaged with all the major memory companies that we have a design. We have a -- we have design wins. And if they ramp up faster than we will -- we'll increase that portion of revenues. And it's depending on what the DDR5 will ramp up Matt.
Operator: Our next question is going to be from Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer.
Richard Schafer: I appreciate all the color so far. Maybe if I could ask 1 on 48-volt before we go back on the AI for the question. I know you heard you say Michael or Bernie said it, I think you had said senior market share position there. I'm curious with your primary competitor in 48-volt apparently still struggling. I mean are we at a point now, if we look at 2023, where you guys think you'll likely stay sort of sole source sort of on H100 this year. And I'm just curious as part of that question. I heard you mention Content there. So is there any color you can give us around what Content does as we transition to sort of more powerful accelerators over time? I mean is it similar to what you guys have talked about with the move from VR13 to 14 on VCorPower, where you're talking about going from sort of $50 a or something like $70.  And then finally, Michael, for you, I'm just really curious, are you -- who else are you seeing out there working on 48-volt power? This seems to be a pretty solid and growing market.
Michael Hsing: Okay. Let me answer my part first, and I'll get in...
Bernie Blegen: That's more fun part.
Michael Hsing: On the landscape is okay, I truly okay, says we don't -- we see some competition in the game. I think our products remain the best so far. And so that's why we have -- and we do see some other competition, maybe as a generation of later that came in. As that market segment grows, and the competition will come. I mean the market is too big for MPS. And we welcome other people. And we welcome the cooperations. As a matter of fact, that's what we're doing and not, okay? And -- as MPS is not big enough for that market. And -- but we will be glad to be leaders.
Bernie Blegen: Yes. And again, reinforcing Michael's point there is that it actually when we enjoy a leadership position, and we expect to continue to, competition is very important as far as driving technology improvements. As far as your other question as far as dollar content, when we look at the CPU market, generally, we denominate it with a dual processor, -- and so based on that, we're able to offer an expectation of what the average selling price will be per server.  With the model is still sorting itself out where you can have any number of configurations up to and including 8 GPU boards. So it's very -- it's a little harder to denominate what our dollar content is. And again, we're still in the early stages of watching this model ramp. So I think that we'll have enough experience in about 2 to 3 quarters to have a more accurate read on the dollar content, but it is much higher than what we're experiencing with CPUs.
Richard Schafer: And for my follow-up, I'd love to ask you about 5G band. I know you guys have said in the past you're selling to the big 3 RAN equipment OEMs. I'm just curious how you would describe the ramp there in terms of content, in terms of share? And what I am trying to do is get a sense of how big 5G is now versus how big it could be for you guys. And to something you mentioned earlier, Bernie, I'm just really curious here, could the ramp in 5G sort of smooth some of that lumpiness you described in your comm segment?
Bernie Blegen: Yes. If I was to draw a comparison of our experience with Enterprise Data where we started out with low dollar content and then graduated up the value chain including power management. We're probably about 3 to 4 years behind in the Communications market, where we're still focusing on low dollar content for like point of load knee fuse. Now where this is about to get very exciting is we are getting adoptions for later designs that include our power management for the processors.  So at this stage, we're sort of moving with the market. Again, as an early entrant. But yes, long term, I do think you're going to see a similar growth profile as what we expect to have with enterprise data.
Michael Hsing: Yes, and immediately now, I keep saying MPS is a small company, but we're not nobody anymore. And we engage with all these customers -- these 5G makers and it's only a handful of a companies as speaking now. So we're in the process of signing on the contract now. And so all of these -- okay, and it's just a matter of time.
Operator: Our next question is from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore: Can you hear me?
Michael Hsing: We have a high inventory, yes.
Ross Seymore: How about the channel inventory. We've heard a bunch of companies talk about the channel coming down, and that's a headwind to revenue growth. I know you guys proactively manage that. So you put it on your own balance sheet, but what's the channel looking like?
Michael Hsing: It's also on the high side.
Bernie Blegen: Yes. About 3 quarters ago, we saw an increase in channel inventories, and they've remained at about that same level. So there isn't any real new news as far as the sell-through characteristics.
Ross Seymore: Is that something that's weighing against your revenue right now? Or are you comfortable running at that relatively higher level?
Michael Hsing: No, we want to go lower and we want to lower and particularly in the first quarters and a lot of customer threatens and get much higher volumes, okay? That's why we shipped and now they have a break. And so as a result, inventory didn't decrease that much in the channel.
Ross Seymore: So it went down on your books more so than in the channel?
Bernie Blegen: Yes. The way to look at another aspect to this is that the inventory in the channel, it depends on what our end customers' lead times are. And as we even commented on in the prepared comments, we're seeing a very unusual demand pattern in that we have 3 areas where we're seeing an acceleration as far as the ordering pattern. But they're doing it with a very -- an expectation of having a very short lead time.  So as Michael said earlier, that the channel is built up in the anticipation that the customers were going to realize the sales gains with the new products, but as those have been pushed out, that's left us in this position. So we're going to continue to manage the channel as we always have. But right now, as I said, it's at an elevated level.
Ross Seymore: Got it. And then 1 on the gross margin for you, Bernie. When you talked about the headwinds for it, we see this across the board. So I don't think it's anything particularly different for Monolithic. But the 1 thing you didn't mention was mix. I get that you're carrying higher cost inventory, and it takes a while to flush through. But as you go opportunistically, into the consumer market, is that rising as a percentage of sales, something that is also weighing against gross margins? And if so, when do you think that will kind of normalize as a percentage of sales, if not decrease?
Michael Hsing: Yes, you can see as a normal because the consumer market hasn't happened yet. We reduced -- we downed to the big percentage now, okay? And mostly it's a high-value inventory.
Operator: Our next question is from William Stein of Truist.
William Stein: Regarding something you just spoke about a moment ago, you spoke about elevated inventory and push outs of projects. I think obsolescence risk is relatively small for Monolithic, but maybe you can reassure us on that matter.
Bernie Blegen: Absolutely. Actually, a very helpful question. If you look at our history, we've never had a significant inventory write-off. And a lot of the reasons around that is that our products have long life in the market and long shelf life. So we're actually -- if you look back at 2019, we built up inventories, and we're able to capitalize when the market bounced back in '20 and particularly when the pandemic, infusion of capital occurred.  So we don't see inventory on our balance sheet as a negative. And in fact, when the markets do get more stabilized, particularly in Enterprise Data and in Storage and Computing, I think we're well positioned to take advantage of that uplift.
William Stein: Great. And then like to sort of ask a double question about supply and your supply base. Other analog companies have talked about how their foundries are absolutely not cutting cost and they never see it happening, but you've highlighted this trend in your business. Is it because you're on more advanced nodes and so that's just how sort of pricing in that market works? And then maybe you could also comment on the manufacturing plan, both in terms of long-term capacity and geographic diversity.
Michael Hsing: Yes. We -- you know that, okay, we advance our technology every 2 or 3 years. And we're relentlessly cutting the cost and utilize the better technologies, get better geometries. The fab now in the last 3 years, the fab costs is not lower, higher, as a matter of fact. But we utilized the geometries and also the new technology that we implement, we will be able to lower the cost.  And so the other -- the other question that you're making is a diversified manufacturing. So, we in -- we anticipated that, again, we announced that we have a new partnership outside of China. That's in Singapore. And we will continue to do so. But really outside, there's no U.S. manufacturing for our application, for our product. I mean, it's all resides in Asia, Korea, like Taiwan and Southeast Asia. And in all our module business, we can do it from our side outside of China.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. As there are no further questions, I would now like to turn the webinar back over to Bernie.
Bernie Blegen: I'd like to thank you all for joining us for this Q1 2023 earnings webinar. I look forward to talking to you again during our second quarter conference call, which would likely be in July. Thank you. Have a nice day.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-02-08 17:00:00) =====
Genevieve Cunningham: Welcome, everyone, to the MPS Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Webinar. My name is Genevieve Cunningham, and I will be the moderator for this webinar. Joining me today are Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS; and Bernie Blegen, VP and CFO. In the course of today’s conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management’s current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q4 2022 earnings release and in our latest 10-K and 10-Q filings that can be found on our website. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today’s call. We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, R&D and SG&A expense, operating income, other income, income before income taxes net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our Q4 and full year 2022 earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC and is currently available on our website. I’d also like to remind you that today’s conference call is being webcast live over the Internet and will be available for replay on our website for one year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. Now I’d like to turn the call over to Bernie Blegen.
Bernie Blegen: Thanks, Gen. For the full year, 2022, MPS achieved record revenue of $1.79 billion, growing 48.5% from the prior year. This is despite industry-wide supply chain capacity constraints. This performance represented consistent execution against our strategies and having more Tier 1 customers recognize MPS for advanced technologies, product quality and excellent customer support. Here are a few highlights from 2022. We introduced a new product line of isolated power modules for applications exceeding 1 kilowatt with a fully integrated controller, isolator and power devices. Our initial revenue ramp for this highly integrated and reliable solution is targeted for 2024. These modules are critical building blocks for power management applications for data centers, EVs, plug-in traction inverters, EV chargers, solar power, wind turbines, battery power storage and other industrial applications. Our products are designed to set the industry standard for these critical system-level applications. MPS’ first advanced data converter products for high precision industrial and medical applications were made commercially available during 2022, and we expect to have an initial revenue ramp in 2023. We continue to diversify our global footprint in the expansion of our R&D centers, supply chain partnerships and facilities outside of China to better match our resource distribution with our customers’ geographic demand profile. With our global presence, we believe MPS is in a strong position to support our customers worldwide. Turning to our full year 2022 revenue by market segment compared with 2021. Enterprise Data revenue was up 116.1%, Storage and Computing revenue up 76.8%, Communication revenue up 53.2%, Automotive revenue up 46.8%, Industrial revenue up 18.6% and Consumer revenue up 13.2%, demonstrating broad-based full year 2022 revenue improvement. Full year 2022 Enterprise Data revenue grew $135.1 million over the prior year to $251.4 million. This 116.1% increase is primarily due to higher sales of our power management solutions for cloud-based CPU and GPU server applications. Enterprise Data revenue represented 14.0% of MPS’ total revenue in 2022, compared with 9.6% in 2021. Storage and Computing revenue for 2022 grew $196.7 million over the prior year to $452.6 million. This 76.8% increase primarily resulted from strong sales growth for storage applications and enterprise notebooks. Storage and Computing revenue represented 25.3% of MPS’ total revenue in 2022, compared with 21.2% in 2021. Communications revenue grew $87.4 million to $251.5 million. This 53.2% improvement reflected higher sales of products for both 5G and satellite communications infrastructure applications. Communications revenue represented 14.0% of our 2022 revenue compared with 13.6% in 2021. Automotive revenue grew $95.7 million to $300.0 million in 2022. This 46.8% year-over-year gain primarily represented increased sales of our highly integrated applications supporting automated driver assistance systems, the digital cockpit and connectivity. Automotive revenue represented 16.7% of MPS’ full year 2022 revenue compared with 16.9% in 2021. Industrial revenue grew $34.4 million to $218.2 million in 2022. This 18.6% year-over-year increase primarily reflected higher sales in applications for smart meters and industrial automation. Industrial revenue represented 12.2% of MPS’ full year 2022 revenue compared with 15.3% in 2021. Consumer revenue grew $37.2 million to $319.5 million in 2022. This 13.2% year-over-year increase primarily reflected increased product sales for home appliances and smart TVs. Consumer revenue represented 17.8% of MPS’ full year 2022 revenue compared with 23.4% in 2021. Let’s talk about the general business conditions. During our Q3 2022 earnings call, we highlighted that customers were becoming more concerned with near-term business conditions and order patterns might oscillate in the near future. As a result of this change in ordering patterns, we indicated that our inventory levels would likely catch up to our target of 180 to 200 days and possibly be higher in the near-term. During the quarter, ordering patterns stabilized as customers requested push outs slowed. While this is positive, customers’ orders are still trending below historic norms. In our Q4 2022 inventory is above our target levels. As a result, we remain cautious about near-term business conditions. We also believe MPS can swiftly adapt to market changes as we have done so successfully during similar macroeconomic changes in the past. Switching to Q4. MPS had a record fourth quarter with revenue of $460.0 million, down 7.1% from revenue generated in the third quarter of 2022, but up 36.7% from the comparable quarter of 2021. On a year-over-year basis comparison by market segment, fourth quarter 2022 revenue for automotive grew 72.8%. Enterprise Data revenue increased 69.0%. Storage and computing revenue grew 55.0%. Communications revenue grew 40.1%, and industrial revenue grew 13.3%, while consumer revenue decreased 20.1%. Fourth quarter 2022 GAAP gross margin was 58.2%, down 50 basis points from third quarter 2022 with 60 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2021. Our GAAP operating income was $136.9 million compared to $151.9 million reported in the third quarter of 2022 and $78.6 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2021. Fourth quarter 2022 non-GAAP gross margin was 58.5%, 50 basis points below the third quarter of 2022, but 60 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2021. The year-over-year expansion in fourth quarter non-GAAP gross margin was largely due to a shift in sales mix favoring high-value greenfield products and operational efficiencies, which more than offset higher product input costs. Our non-GAAP operating income was $174.1 million compared to $193.7 million reported in the prior quarter and $102.0 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2021. Let’s review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $130.9 million in the fourth quarter compared with $139.0 million in the third quarter of 2022, and $115.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. Our non-GAAP fourth quarter 2022 operating expenses were $94.8 million, down from the $98.4 million we spent in the third quarter of 2022 and up from the $83.0 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2021. On both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis, fourth quarter 2022 litigation expense was $3.2 million compared with a $2.1 million in Q3 2022 and a $420,000 credit balance in Q4 2021. The fourth quarter 2021 litigation credit reflected in IP settlement and refund of a legal retainer. The differences between GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are primarily stock compensation expense and income or loss from an unfunded deferred compensation plan. Fourth quarter 2022 stock compensation expense, including $1.0 million charged to cost of goods sold was $35.3 million compared with $43.0 million recorded in the third quarter of 2022. The quarter-over-quarter change in stock compensation expense reflected a change in the planned vesting assumptions. Switching to the bottom line. Fourth quarter 2022 GAAP net income was $119.1 million or $2.45 per fully diluted share compared with $2.57 per share in the third quarter of 2022 and $1.51 per share in the fourth quarter of 2021. Q4 2022 non-GAAP net income was $154.0 million or $3.17 per fully diluted share compared with $3.53 per share in the third quarter of 2022, and $2.12 per share in the fourth quarter of 2021. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q4 2022 were 48.5 million. Now let’s look at the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2022, cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $739.6 million compared to $738.1 million at the end of the third quarter of 2022. For fourth quarter – for the fourth quarter of 2022, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $52.2 million compared with Q3 2022 operating cash flow consumed of $18.2 million. Fourth quarter 2022 capital spending totaled $12.8 million. Accounts receivable ended the fourth quarter of 2022 at $182.7 million or 36 days of sales outstanding compared with the $153.4 million or 28 days of sales outstanding reported at the end of the third quarter of 2022, and the $104.8 million or 28 days reported at the end of the fourth quarter of 2021. Our internal inventories at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022 were $447.3 million, up from $397.4 million at the end of the third quarter of 2022. Calculated on a basis consistent with our past practice, and as you can see on the webinar video, days of inventory rose to 212 days at the end of Q4 2022 from the 167 days at the end of the third quarter of 2022. Historically, we’ve calculated days of inventory on hand as a function of current quarter revenue. We believe comparing current inventory levels with the following quarter’s revenue provides a better economic match. On this basis, again, you can see days of inventory increased to 214 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022 from 188 days at the end of the third quarter of 2022. I would now like to turn to our Q1 2023 outlook. We are forecasting Q1 2023 revenue in the range of $440 million to $460 million. We also expect the following: GAAP gross margin in the range of 57.4% to 58.0%. Non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 57.7% to 58.3%. Total stock-based compensation expense of $40.2 million to $42.2 million, including approximately $1.2 million that would be charged cost of goods sold. GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses including litigation expenses between $135.1 million and million $139.1 million. Non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense to be in the range of $96.1 to $98.1 million. This estimate excludes stock compensation expense, but includes litigation expense. Beginning with the Q1 2023 outlook, MPS will no longer separately forecast litigation expenses. Interest income is expected to be in the range from $1.8 million to $2.2 million before foreign exchange gains or losses and charitable contributions. The non-GAAP tax rate for Q1 2023 will be 12.5%. The non-GAAP tax rate remains unchanged from 2022 as there have not been any material changes in tax regulations. Fully diluted shares to be in the range of 48.2 to 49.2 million shares. Finally, I’m pleased to announce a 33% increase in our quarterly dividend to $1 per share from $0.75 per share for stockholders of a record as of March 31, 2023. In conclusion, while we remain cautious about near-term business conditions, we believe MPS can swiftly adapt to market changes and take advantage of the current environment to focus on business development and investing in infrastructure necessary to support long-term growth. I’ll now open the webinar up for questions.
A - Genevieve Cunningham: Thank you, Bernie. Analysts, I would now like to begin our Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham. Quinn, your line is now open.
Quinn Bolton: Hey, guys. Congratulations on the strong results and the nice outlook in this environment. I guess I wanted to start Bernie and Michael, the computing storage business was much stronger than at least I expected in the fourth quarter. You grew revenue quarter-on-quarter when the rest of the PC [ph] market is clearly experiencing softness and inventory correction. So I guess, can you give us sort of your outlook? How do you see that business trending over the next couple of quarters? And then I’ve got a follow up. Thank you.
Bernie Blegen: Sure. I think that there’s been a lot of press recently around weakness in notebooks as far as unit sales. And in addition, we’ve started to see some word [ph] here about declines also in the memory market. Interestingly, memory continued to be very strong for us offsetting a decline in notebooks. And as we look ahead here, we actually see notebooks beginning to improve in the early part of 2023. And probably those gains will offset a decline in memory. So we’re basically looking at this category at least for the first half of the year to be flattish.
Quinn Bolton: Okay.
Michael Hsing: The one component the AI portions still remain to be very strong in the near futures. And then we see a very high growth.
Bernie Blegen: Absolutely. In the enterprise data we’ve really got good traction with the GPUs for artificial intelligence and so that should really be one of our growth drivers in the first half of 2023.
Quinn Bolton: That was going to be my next question, enterprise data was down slightly in the fourth quarter. But it sounds like you see the ramp or just strong results in the first half driven by. It sounds like specifically GPUs, is that right?
Michael Hsing: Yes, that’s related to artificial intelligence.
Bernie Blegen: Yes. When we look at CPUs in the enterprise data, there’s still initial softness as we’re waiting for the platform launches for both the Sapphire Rapids and Genoa to take off.
Quinn Bolton: Do you expect that in the second half than the CPU to on a take [ph] in more second half of the year?
Bernie Blegen: Yes.
Quinn Bolton: Perfect. Thank you.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Tore, your line is now open.
Tore Svanberg: Yes. Thank you. And congratulations on another record year. Michael, I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about the power isolation module business, they expect to ramp in 2024. Is this still based on the company’s BCD technology or are you now starting to venture into some newer technologists? I’m just curious, because you haven’t talked a whole lot about potentially getting into silicon carbide or GaN or anything like that?
Michael Hsing: Yes, so we do have programs that are going to a wide bandgap materials, okay? And in the past, I think we talk about it in, we have a program to make to investigating and develop those devices since 2017. And now we see the first result and we do have some samples ready, but not in the production yet. My prediction is that are somewhere in the middle of the years, okay, or second half of the years. And related to the – your questions about the isolated modules, when any higher powers is pressuring inverters, solar and solar inverters and data centers also chargers, onboard chargers and all these in the wind turbines. All of these have one basic component in all these very high power applications, which is all the power devices driven by using the isolated modules. And MPS is using, again, using our own BCD process and as well as our bandgap materials and we combine togethers and making a very simple [indiscernible] and a very ease of use power modules for those type of applications. Some of these products already in production in the EVs currently. And things that we expected higher growth in the next couple years.
Tore Svanberg: That’s very helpful. And as my follow-up, could you just give us an update on the manufacturing footprint both from a capacity perspective, but more importantly about diversification. You talked about, looking at all sorts of regions to partner with some new manufacturing partners, so yes, both capacity, but then also from a geographic – geographical perspective perhaps an update that? Thank you.
Michael Hsing: Yes. We see as everybody else see in the geopolitical tensions and as you know MPS in the past, we always want to be a local company in every political regions. And we did that successfully in R&D site. And because for one thing is close to customers, other ones and – other ones we isolated from these tensions from between the countries. And for the manufacturing side, currently, we can fulfill all our customer demand to – demand for wherever they want to manufacture it. And we want to – by end of the year or by the next – by end of the year or next years, we will have fully rent and for the new capacities just in case the [indiscernible] really separated.
Tore Svanberg: Great. Thank you so much, and congrats again.
Michael Hsing: Thanks, Tore.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Alex Vecchi of William Blair. Alex, your line is now open. Our next question is from Matt Ramsay of Cowen. Matt, your line is now open.
MattRamsay: Thank you very much. Good afternoon, guys. Can you hear me, okay?
Michael Hsing: Yes.
MattRamsay: Hey, Michael. Hey, Bernie. The – one question that I wanted to ask you that we’ve heard, I mean, you guys – I guess, addressed in your prepared script how you are working to move sort of the operations at manufacturing footprint and other pieces outside of China to in the long term, more sort of align with your TAM and revenue mix for the really, really long term in the company. And you’ve been very clear about those plans. But there’s been some more, I guess, acute reports of maybe some customers that want to very quickly use product sources outside of China. And you’ll probably know some of those reports that I’m talking about. I guess, have those impacted your revenues at all? Are you seeing any strange behaviors from customers that maybe you want to move and source product outside of China more quickly than you’re able to? Or are you already sourcing outside of China to support many of your global customers? Thanks.
Michael Hsing: Yes, it’s a misconception for MPS is that we are – lot of manufacturers that’s in China. That’s true. But it’s a misconception. So, okay, we do in a prior COVID – we do – most of, we do at least half of it manufacturer and at least we have capacities is outside the countries or outside of China. And to answer your question, whether zero impact in the – for whoever customers request to manufacture in the outside of China in the past and the futures.
MattRamsay: All right. Thank you for that, Michael. That’s really clear. Just a question we get a lot. I wanted to talk a little bit about the consumer business, which is kind of the – maybe the least important strategic segment, but also the most volatile. If you look at where, I guess the numbers came in the fourth quarter. And I guess what I’m wanting to understand a little bit is the philosophy that you guys might have if and when some of those consumer markets and the China market in general recover. Are you excited to keep that segment down around 10% of revenue and will continue to prioritize everything else? Or is that a business that you want to serve Michael as it potentially rebounds? Thank you.
Michael Hsing: Yes, and again, I would say that I mean, in the past, last year capacity issues like a constrain the consumer growth. And we do have a lot of opportunity. We just didn’t pick it up because of the capacity issues. And in the downturns in the past, as you know, that again and will be a lot more aggressive for in these consumer market segment because when you react to a price and you react to the opportunity how fast you react to the opportunity. And within the six months, you’ll see the – you’ll see the bigger number change in a consumer segment. And that’s what we would do.
Bernie Blegen: And Matt keep in mind, the resilience of our business model has to do with the diversity of the end markets, the customers, the geographies that we serve. So consumer, well, it has dropped to around 10% of the quarter remains a very important part of that strategy and will continue to invest in it.
MattRamsay: Thank you very much, guys. Appreciate it.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Alex Vecchi of William Blair. Alex, your line is now open.
Michael Hsing: Hello?
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Gary Mobley of Wells Fargo. Gary, your line is now open.
Gary Mobley: Hey, Michael. Hey, Bernie. [Indiscernible] And thanks for taking my question for the first time as a covering analyst. And related to that, I apologize in advance if I ask an uninformed question here. But the inventory for you guys, that 212 days, that’s internal inventory. I believe, however, your sales, 83% of your sales roughly go through distribution. So maybe you can give us a view in terms of distribution inventory and did it increase and if so, to what extent did it favor revenue?
Bernie Blegen: Gary, opening up, welcome to the party. This is Gary’s first call with us.
Michael Hsing: And welcome to the inventory question.
Bernie Blegen: Inventory question. I thought we finished this question.
Michael Hsing: For Gary’s, okay.
Bernie Blegen: Okay. Gary, it’s okay. So when I look at the channel inventories from Q4 to Q1, or I’m sorry, from Q3 to Q4, they basically stabilized. So we didn’t see a significant increase either in terms of dollars or days in the quarter. Likewise when we talk about inventory on our balance sheet, and I’ll address that out as well. There’s about a six month lead time from when we can slow down wafer starts when you see it on the balance sheet. So likewise, as we’re looking now to head to Q1, we see both inventory in terms of dollars on our balance sheet as well as in the channel, stabilizing sell-through in the channel remains very good. And then it should normalize in the second half of the year.
Gary Mobley: I apologize if I step into…
Michael Hsing: It’s fair to say like I mean, in 2019, we deliberate build 200 days plus inventory because we did see all these opportunity. And then now the inventory goes this highs because go over 200 days again. And that is because the customers demand start to pushing out and this is on the high side and we will cautiously and reduce it. And it’s not – this is not the same as it was done in 2019.
Gary Mobley: Got it. Thank you for that. And I wanted to ask about contributors to the revenue growth for the fiscal year, for the quarter, 48.5% is quite commendable. I was hoping maybe you can deconstruct that between ASP increases and unit increases and how you see that playing out for fiscal year 2023 as well?
Michael Hsing: It’s very diverse to growth in – with a little more aggressive activities in the consumer segment. And this is different from 2020 to 2021. And everything is the same because we are not – we don’t – it’s not a one trick ponies, and like not a two trick pony either. So I mean we have a multiple product. We have a product like 5,000, 6,000 different products. We have a few thousands of customers, large customers, let’s say, biggest customer is less than 4% in a different industry. And with our – that’s the same way as we do in the last 10 full years. And we’re still continue to pass.
Bernie Blegen: Clearly, as you look at a business driver in 2022 and as we look ahead, you can also see the impact of selling higher value technologies and higher ASPs that go along with it. So while many companies use this supply-demand imbalance as an opportunity to raise prices to their customers, we only had one single-digit price increase back in February and all of the other is representative of higher ASPs and volume gains.
Gary Mobley: Helpful. Thank you, guys.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Ross, your line is now open.
Ross Seymore: Hi guys, can you hear me?
Michael Hsing: Yes. Its fine.
Ross Seymore: Perfect. Well, first, I also want to welcome Gary to the call and thank him so much for being the one asking the inventory question…
Michael Hsing: You still remember.
Ross Seymore: I knew you would. So I had just one question, one follow-up. The question on the near-term first was, you talked a little bit about stabilization in your orders, but said they’re still below normal. So any color on that? And then folding another near-term follow-on is the first quarter, you said it sounded like Storage and Computing would be flat and Enterprise Data would be up a bit. If you’re flat overall, what’s going down sequentially in the first quarter to get you to that? So that’s kind of an aggregate first question.
Bernie Blegen: So when we look at Q1, and obviously, we’ve guided down about 2%, which is sort of consistent with seasonal trends. And it’s – the industrial is likely to come down. And I may have left you with an incorrect impression because Enterprise Data is likely to go down even though GPU, AI will improve. And then on the plus side, the momentum in automotive continues to be very strong.
Ross Seymore: In the stabilization color geographically by end market, the order stuff you said?
Michael Hsing: Yes. We’re seeing better activity. I think that we commented both in Q3 and repeated it here, that customers have gotten a lot more near-term focused and you can point to consumer, you can point China as being areas that was very observable. And right now, we’re seeing a lot better activity but it hasn’t necessarily translated into what I call a normalized ordering cover.
Ross Seymore: Got it. Thanks for that. And I guess as my longer-term follow-up, a question I get a lot from investors is the really impressive growth you guys did in 2022, up about 50% round numbers. That’s about 30% faster than the SIA defined analog category. And that delta is kind of 2x what you guys historically have done. And some people are concerned that that’s just because of insufficient supply and competition and assume fungibility that you guys are just growing because other people can’t, or some of your competitors had some product issues that they’ll soon rectify. And so those tailwinds could turn into headwinds this year. I know you’re not going to guide for the full year. But are you at all concerned about those two dynamics having kind of overinflated 2022 and turning into headwinds this year?
Michael Hsing: Okay, tell those customer – tell those not customers, okay?
Ross Seymore: Investors.
Michael Hsing: Our investors, our customers choose to buy our stocks. And hey, we don’t do it in the pay to pay, the me-too products. Everything is pretty much single source product. And our products a lot more programmable, a lot more versatile and gave me and our customer can configure those products. And of course, we’ll take advantage of it, okay, in a shortage. Our customers can use our product in a multiple way, I mean, lot of them are software based. And announced and as you know, in the software side and I mean is a lot more stickier. And we will continue to use our technical strengths and to gain the market share and I mean headwinds, okay, for those people they don’t believe that, okay. We have a hearing I mean that’s fair, but our numbers delivered like our past number to show that.
Ross Seymore: Thanks, guys.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer. Rick, your line is now open.
Rick Schafer: Thanks and I’ll add my congratulations, guys. If I could ask my first question, it’s kind of a broad question on your module, just your overall module strategy. I mean, say, it doubles this year to sort of 10% or so of revenues. Bernie, I’m sure you’ll correct me if that’s all base there. But sort of what’s the right contribution long-term? I mean, Michael, I mean, eventually, do you want sort of everything to move in that direction toward module, or is it weighted more to specific end markets, maybe a couple of them already. And I’m curious if you can comment on the margin implications as module becomes a bigger contributor. I think in the past you said this a 5x type ASP multiplier. But again, please correct me.
Bernie Blegen: So I’ll give you the numbers correction and Michael will give you this strategic answer. Modules currently are about 5% of our business.
Michael Hsing: Yes, and it has doubled.
Bernie Blegen: Yes.
Michael Hsing: In a double the year, year-over-year for the last two years. Three years or two years?
Bernie Blegen: Yes, three.
Michael Hsing: Three years.
Bernie Blegen: Yes.
Michael Hsing: Yes. And so it’s a significant business now. I mean and eventually, yes, that’s what all I want to see. And MPS all going to move into a new type of modules I mean in modules, power module has a bad connotation, I know that I mean lot of companies in a power module business and those are 30% gross margins and I don’t know what’s the right word to use it, it is a power modules and like in place okay with, but that’s not your old grandpa’s, again, power modules. And again, this is very different. Our margin is above core average. And some of the solutions much, much higher. But – and we sell it was all well over $100 stuff, and that’s kind of I see as a part of its hardware plus service and customers, the users, they don’t need to know like how does – how to use the product or how to – you have to have a very deep knowledge how to design a power supply, okay. And they should use very simple solutions like what we provide. They don’t need the headaches to design a power supply, I think that we’re going to end up with MPS or without MPS will be that, okay, but MPS want to be a leader in that.
Bernie Blegen: And I’d like to go back to Rick’s earlier question, I would say that back in the day, the single biggest ingredient as far as making a decision for design win had to do with the lowest cost. And I think that what our customers are seeing, particularly in the last three years is there are other value drivers consider as far as time to market how much design resource they want to be saved from having to do a total cost of ownership. And those are areas that we’re able to meet our customers’ demand as well, if not better than any other analog or power provider…
Michael Hsing: Yes, as well to give you examples and okay, we build our own test equipment, semi equipment test equipment and all based on the MPS power modules. And if you buy those kind of power modules, they can selling well over $50. And so that in semi equipment market segments that’s a perfect thought for that. And these are very high ASP and very much, much compact than on the current market.
Rick Schafer: Okay. Thanks for that color. And it actually leads you to my next question. I appreciate all the color that and you guys have certainly discussed with the power isolation module. But just specific to the silicon carbide update, just it does – it sounds like you’ll be sampling this year. Do we – should we expect any material contribution from silicon carbide this year? Or are we kind of looking at 2024? And Michael, I mean, we’ve heard different numbers, but what is the addition of silicon carbide modules for traction inverter, et cetera? What does that do to your potential content per vehicle?
Michael Hsing: Our trashing inverters and using silicon carbide, okay, it’s not this year and maybe even if we will see it next year. Our silicon carbide devices, okay, we design our own – we develop our own, okay. And we want – we picked up some market segment that proves our products are reliable in the first. And that’s the first step. To answer your questions, and this year, okay, and there’s no large number of building in our revenue stream, yes, okay, and so we don’t expect that, but that’s just approved the technologies now.
Rick Schafer: Thanks, Michael. Thanks, Bernie.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from William Stein of Truist. William, your line is now open.
William Stein: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Someone beat me to the module question this time. So I’ll focus in a little bit different direction in the past. I know a few quarters ago, you talked about a team that you hired to work in the converter area, which is something you’re not really that known for, but I think this is also another being ASP and a big growth opportunity for Monolithic. Can you talk about your traction in converters so far and what you expect to come in the coming quarters?
Michael Hsing: Yes. We can – are glad to ask the questions, okay, a couple of days ago, I saw an image and we received from our customers, and we use our customers, use our imaging for the X-ray machines and much better than their prior versions. And so when is – we sample other biotech companies and they are – our product is designed in and we will see the revenues probably a small revenue this year in the next years. This is a slow ramping products that get very high barriers. And the bottom line is we have the technologies, and we have the know-how to design a very high performance data converted. These are – is comparable if it’s not better. And we will broaden the product portfolios and as we expand our teams and these take lot of efforts and a lot of investment. And so far, we built up a pretty good sizable teams. And now you will have – see more general product coming up in the next couple of quarters.
William Stein: Thank you, Michael, appreciate that. Maybe one other, if I can. Something we haven’t heard the company speak a whole lot about lately, and that’s the e-commerce effort. Any update on how your traction is progressing there?
Michael Hsing: E-commerce. Well, maybe it’s not as fast as I want to be. And I said my expectation too high and I think it’s better here is that we launched MPS now I mean, actually, I’ll take back. I think it’s not as – it’s true, not I expect more, okay, but there’s a lot of resistance. I mean – but our modules lot of module ramp-up. It’s from e-commerce. And we – after last year, yes, after maybe 13 or 14 or 15 months ago, we launched MPS in a remote technical support. And that helped a lot. And especially our module side, again, help our customers can schedule a meeting online. And we can solve their – when they’re logging we solve their technical issues. That helped a lot. And I think the most part of the ramp-up is from the MPS now from a website. But overall, all things and it will take time, okay? And you are talking about engineer change their behaviors, okay, how do you design the product and how you’re purchasing the product. And I think as next 10, 12 years, even now in the next five to 10 years for the millenniums and to design a power supply and they want to do Google search rather than do the fundamental design like in the past 20 years ago, like the last 20 years. And so these are the products designed for that, okay, for easy plugging play use and easy to use and can buy from the Internet.
William Stein: Okay, thank you.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Chris Caso of Credit Suisse. Chris, your line is now open.
Chris Caso: Yes, thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. The question is about where lead times are right now and the degree of product shortages. With your inventory up now, has that helped to bring down lead times and alleviate some of the shortages? And if so, has that taken away perhaps some of the incentive for customers to place orders for a product they didn’t – they don’t need. What – it’s obviously one of the things we worry about as we go through the cycle, interested in your view on that.
Michael Hsing: I’d agree that lead times have been coming down. They were up as long combined as much as 26 weeks or six months. And they’re coming down more slowly than you think. So I don’t know. Obviously, our customers have changed their ordering behavior. And if that could be attributed to the change in lead times or the fact that they have adequate inventory or that they’re uncertain about with the next six months, I can’t really say which is a driver in their decision.
Chris Caso: Got it. Okay. As a follow-up, Michael, you mentioned in some earlier remarks, plans to be a little more aggressive on consumer business as you go through the year. So wondering if you could expand on those comments? Is that something just opportunistic this year, something that you see in the market is that just a function of the diversity of your business model where some other business is slow. So you can go find business elsewhere, if you could give us some more color on that, please.
Michael Hsing: I think you made a very good comment. It is opportunistic, okay? Remember, we – how many years ago, we – years ago, let say and we have more than 50% of our MPS revenues is all from consumer. And these are five fast design cycles in fast revenues and cycles product and on opportunities. And we have the right product, right support and right price and you can move the needle quickly. And obviously, in contrary to the other industrial automotive cloud computing and these are much longer design cycles and they’re kind of slowing down one segment to the other or relative in – it’s not as – clearly, it’s not as in the last couple of years. And the consumer is our opportunity again, and we know how to do it, okay? And we have the product and we have the price structures and not as high as all the other segments, and we will do that.
Chris Caso: If I could just follow on that, does that imply when business improves elsewhere, we’ve got a better macro and such some of the product cycles elsewhere with maybe higher margin opportunities develop that you sort of back away from some of that and come back to some of the other segments that have driven growth more recently.
Michael Hsing: No, it’s not. Okay, consumers is a – diversity is always our strategies. And last couple of years, we didn’t grow because of capacity constraints, okay? And we sacrifice on the consumer side.
Chris Caso: Got it. Thank you.
Michael Hsing: Thanks, Chris.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Tore, your line is now open.
Tore Svanberg: Yes, thank you. I just wanted to come back to the data converter business. So you’re obviously getting into the kitchen of 400-pound gorillas here and I think historically, it’s been very difficult to crack into this market. You talked about the high barriers to entry. And other than the product being higher precision, I get that, but is there anything else about your business model that will allow MPS to be successful in this market?
Michael Hsing: I think it’s – we don’t know what is the business model. I think it’s – I know this size takes time. And the market is large, a few competitors. All these, you said these are 800 pounds of gorilla, okay. We are well little highs going around – and we had to run fast. And it’s just to take opportunities and okay, what presents the product and our customers. And they do have an eye on the different suppliers especially come from the last couple of years. And it’s – we have a good hope, but we know it take a while.
Tore Svanberg: That’s fair. And just lastly, could you give us an update on the time line for the $3 billion and the $4 billion capacity that you’re working on?
Michael Hsing: Yes. As we said in next couple of years – next two years, and we’re still on it. And we work with our suppliers and the gaming I just mentioned the consumer business, okay? And one of the reason is we do have obligations and to fill up these facts. And we’ll be aggressive and getting all these – getting these orders, fill the capacities. And that’s our gaming in the past. We repeatedly and do this – have done these kind of things in several cycles already. And this cycle, I don’t see a difference from the last downturns. And – but – so for the capacity expansion, we’re still intact in the game. We’re not – we may slow down a little, so I mean, but we really have obligations with our fabs, okay?
Tore Svanberg: Great. Thank you, again.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham. Quinn, your line is now open.
Quinn Bolton: Great. Thanks for letting me take a quick or ask a quick follow up. Bernie, I just wanted to ask your sort of thoughts on gross margin. You guided to 58% at the mid-point. It looks like the Street consensus was probably 50 to 100 basis points higher than that through the year. So as you look at 2023, do you think March is sort of the bottom and margins can trend higher into the second half of the year? Or is this push in the ability to be opportunistic in the consumer segment likely to keep margins flattish in this 58% level through 2023.
Bernie Blegen: Yes, I’d probably look at it as being flattish for the remainder of 2023. And when you look at what’s taken the margin down and while you’re right, we’re down 50 basis points. It’s not a significant deflation from the rate that we’ve been at trending at over the last two years. And it’s really because we have the additional manufacturing capacity, lower revenue. And as we look at the next two quarters at least, the sales mix is not as desirable. 
Quinn Bolton: Understood. Thank you.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Ross, your line is now open.
Ross Seymore: Okay, just a quick follow-up on my side on the margin side as well. And this time on the OpEx side, you guys did a good job on the OpEx. I know you’re putting litigation expense up into regular OpEx, which thank you for doing that. But just the trend in OpEx throughout the year last year grew maybe half the rate of what revenues did? How do we think about this year?
Bernie Blegen: I think as Michael is expressed here between diversifying our supply chain and continuing to invest in R&D capabilities that we have some very real opportunities for additional investment that would show up in growing our operating expenses. Having said that, though, there is a fair amount of uncertainty as far as what the revenue outlook is, and we want to be good financial managers as we go through these market conditions. So I would expect that it’s likely that operating expenses won’t grow much more than 50%, 60% of revenue growth in the current year.
Michael Hsing: Having said that, in the past, in the past two years, now we reached $2 billion companies and they all one point okay, whatever… 
Bernie Blegen: 1.8.
Michael Hsing: Yes, 1.8, okay. I mean, our infrastructure hasn’t really grown that much. In the last couple of years, and it’s difficult to hire people and now we have a lot more breathing room, okay, this is the time to build up a company.
Ross Seymore: Great. And I guess for a quick follow-up, I just wanted to revisit one of the questions that was asked, I think it was the very first question or close to the beginning on the storage and computing strength. I know you said notebook was better than you thought and the memory/storage was weaker, and those two kind of go the opposite direction in the first quarter then. But those markets in aggregate have been weak across the board for quite some time. So I’m still a little surprised at the strength in the fourth quarter and the stability in the first. What would you attribute that to? Obviously, you’re getting the orders, but are you guys taking share? Is it the Tier 1 penetration? Is it content? Just any more color on that because it’s such a disconnect to the end market in general?
Michael Hsing: I think I believe we gained some shares.
Bernie Blegen: Absolutely.
Michael Hsing: Yes. We gained some market shares.
Ross Seymore: Great. Thank you.
Michael Hsing: Yes, we’re a little bit aggressive on in summer low end market.
Bernie Blegen: Yes.
Ross Seymore: Thank you.
Genevieve Cunningham: [Operator Instructions] As there are no further questions, I would now like to turn the webinar back over to Bernie.
Bernie Blegen: Great. Thank you very much and for joining us for this conference call, and we’ll be talking again here for the first quarter update, which will likely be in the late April. So thank you very much.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-10-27 16:30:00) =====
Company Representatives: Michael Hsing - Chief Executive Officer, Founder Bernie Blegen - Vice President, Chief Financial Officer Genevieve Cunningham - Marketing Communications Manager
Genevieve Cunningham : Welcome everyone to the MPS Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Webinar. Please note that this webinar is bring recorded and will be archived for one year on our Investor Relations page at www.monolithicpower.com. My name is Genevieve Cunningham, and I will be the moderator for this webinar. Joining me today are Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS; and Bernie Blegen, VP and CFO. In the course of today’s webinar we will be making forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management’s current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q3 2022 earnings release and in our latest 10-K and 10-Q filings that can be found on our website. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today’s call.  We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, R&D and SG&A expense, operating income, other income, income before income taxes, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our Q3 2022 earnings release, which we have furnished to the SEC and is currently available on our website. Now I’d like to turn the call over to Bernie Blegen.
Bernie Blegen: Thanks, Gen. First of all, today I’m greeting you from Europe. We held our third quarter Board of Directors meeting in our Barcelona office. We have our Board Members tour of the facility and oversee the operations here.  Now, to the financial results. MPS achieved record third quarter revenue of $495.4 million, 7.5% higher than revenue in the second quarter of 2022, and 53.1% higher than revenue in the third quarter of 2021. This broad based year-over-year revenue growth was the result of consistent executions against our strategies.  Looking at our third quarter 2022 revenue by market. Third quarter automotive revenue of $87.1 million increase 42.7% from the second quarter of 2022, due primarily to new platform launches. Third quarter 2022 automotive revenue was up 60.0% year-over-year. Automotive revenue represented 17.6% of MPSs third quarter 2022 revenue compared with 16.8% in the third quarter of 2021.  Third quarter 2022 communications revenue of $72.3 million is up 21.9% from the second quarter of 2022. Most of the sequential revenue increase was related to the continued communications infrastructure ramp. Third quarter 2022 communications revenue was up 61.8% year-over-year. Communication sales represented 14.6% of our total third quarter 2022 revenue compared with 13.8% in the third quarter of 2021.  In our enterprise data market, third quarter 2022 revenue $75.3 million increased 15.5% from the second quarter of 2022, primarily due to continued strength in our data center and workstation computing sales.  Third quarter 2022 revenue represented 15.2% of MPSs third quarter 2022 revenue, compared with 9.2% in the third quarter of 2021. Third quarter 2022 industrial revenue of $58.7 million increased 5.1% from the second quarter of 2022. Third quarter 2022 industrial revenue was up 12.5% year-over-year. Industrial revenue represented 11.8% of our third quarter 2022 revenue compared with 16.1% in the third quarter of 2021.  Storage and computing revenue of $112.9 million decreased 7.7% from the second quarter of 2022. The sequential revenue decline was primarily due to softening of customer demand from notebooks. Third quarter 2022 storage and computing revenue was up 63.9% year-over-year. Storage and computing revenue represented 22.8% of MPS’s third quarter 2022 revenue compared with 21.3% in the third quarter of 2021.  Third quarter consumer revenue of $89.2 million decreased 8.4% from the second quarter of 2022. The sequential quarterly revenue decline was primarily due to softening of overall demand. Third quarter 2022 consumer revenue was up 21.1% year-over-year. Consumer revenue represented 18.0% of MPSs third quarter 2022 revenue, compared with 22.8% in the third quarter of 2021.  Let's talk about the general business conditions. For the prior six quarters, we have faced product shortages, especially in consumer, storage and computing. Now we have started to see our customers reduce their orders and push out shipments. We’ve experienced similar patterns in the past. We anticipate order patterns might oscillate in the near future. This is not a surprise to us. As a result of this change in ordering patterns, our inventory level will catch up to our target of 180 to 200 days and possibly be higher in the near term.  In addition, we have over 4,000 different products which are required to support thousands of our customers' applications. On average, our product lifecycle succeeds six to eight years, so we are not concerned with carrying an inventory level above target. MPSs business is in a better position today. Rather than managing product shortage problems, we can now focus on long-term business development.  For longer cycle, business like automotive, enterprise data, coms infrastructure and industrial, both our customers and MPS have extended significant effort and made joint investments in the development of multiple leading edge products and applications. As a result, we have secured business which we believe will ramp over the next several years driving revenue growth.  For shorter cycle consumer related business, we will continue to proactively support our customers' needs. We have established MPS as a reliable supplier with excellent customer support during this extended period of product shortages. Accordingly, we believe both longer and shorter cycle customers value MPS as a strategic partner.  We are cautious about the overall business conditions and believe we can swiftly adapt to market changes as we have done successfully during similar macroeconomic changes in the past. There have been recent changes to export control rules and additional companies have been added to the MPs list. As of today we see immaterial revenue impact, directly or indirectly from those new trade restrictions. Our products utilize process nodes in excess a 40 nanometer, which falls well outside the current restrictions.  Moving now to a few comments on gross margin and operating income. Third quarter 2022 GAAP gross margin was 58.7%, which was 10 basis points lower than the second quarter of 2022, and 110 basis points higher than the third quarter of 2021.  Our GAAP operating income was $151.9 million compared to $141.9 million reported in the second quarter of 2022. Non GAAP gross margin for the third quarter of 2022 was 59.0%, essentially flat from the gross margin percentage reported in the second quarter of 2022 and 120 basis points higher than the third quarter from a year ago. Our non-GAAP operating income was $193.7 million compared to $179.4 million reported in the second quarter of 2022.  Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $139.0 million in the third quarter of 2022 compared with $129.1 million in the second quarter of 2022, and $109.2 million in the third quarter of 2021. Our non GAAP third quarter 2022 operating expenses were $98.4 million, up from $92.7 million in the second quarter of 2022 and up from the $78.7 million reported in the third quarter of 2021.  The differences between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are primarily stock compensation expense and income or expense from an unfunded deferred compensation plan.  For the third quarter of 2022, total stock compensation expense, including approximately $1.2 million charged to cost of goods sold was $43.0 million, compared with $42.9 million recorded in the second quarter of 2022.  Switching to the bottom line, third quarter 2022 GAAP net income was $124.3 million or $2.57 per fully diluted share compared with $114.7 million or $2.37 per share in the second quarter of 2022 and $68.8 million or $1.44 per share in the third quarter of 2021. Q3 2022 non GAAP net income was $170.7 million or $3.53 per fully diluted share compared with $157 million or $3.25 per share in the second quarter of 2022, and $98.6 million or $2.06 per share in the third quarter of 2021. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q3, 2022 were $48.3 million.  Now, let’s look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $738.1 million at the end of the third quarter of 2022 compared to $814.1 million at the end of the second quarter of 2022. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $18.2 million compared with Q2, 2022 operating cash flow of $105.2 million. The decline in operating cash flow and increase in other long term assets reflected a $170 million prepaid payment made during the quarter to secure a long term purchasing commitment.  Accounts receivable ended the third quarter of 2022 at $153.4 million, representing 28 days of sales outstanding, which was three days higher than the 25 days reported at the end of the second quarter of 2022, and six days higher than the 22 days at the end of the third quarter of 2021. Our internal inventories at the end of the third quarter of 2022 were $397.4 million, up $37.8 million from the $359.6 million reported at the end of the second quarter of 2022. Inventory at the end of the third quarter of 2022 represented 167 days, which were five days lower than at the end of the second quarter of 2022.  Historically, we have calculated days of inventory on hand as a function of current order revenue. We believe comparing current inventory levels with the following quarter’s revenue provides a better economic match. On this basis, you can see inventory at the end of the third quarter of 2022 represented 189 days, 29 days higher than 160 days at the end of the second quarter of 2022 and 56 days higher than the 133 days at the end of the third quarter of 2021. I would like now to turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2022. We are forecasting Q4 revenue in the range of $450 million to $470 million. We also expect the following: GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 58.1% to 58.7%; non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 58.3% to 58.9%. Total stock-based compensation expense of $37.7 million to $39.7 million, including approximately $1.1 million that would be charged to cost of goods sold.  GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses should be between $131 million and $135 million. Non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses are expected to be in the range of $94.4 million to $96.4 million. Litigation expense in expected to be in the range of $1.3 million and $1.7 million. Interest income is expected to be in the range from $1.1 million to $1.5 million. Fully diluted shares are expected to be in the range of 48.2 million to 49.2 million shares. In conclusion, even though business conditions are softening, our market share gains continue to expand reflecting high customer engagement and our ability to secure design wins. We can now focus on growing our long term business.  I will now open the webinar up for questions. 
A - Genevieve Cunningham: Thank you, Bernie. Analysts, I would now like to begin our Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Matt Ramsay of Cowen. Matt your line is now open. 
Matt Ramsay: Thank you very much. I guess good evening guys if you're in Europe. So Michael, Bernie can you hear me, okay. 
Bernie Blegen : Yeah, buenos noches.
Matt Ramsay: Thanks guys. So two different questions from me. One sort of related to the model and the near term and the other one on a different topic. So the first question, Bernie, if you could help us a little bit, I mean the guidance was a bit light and you talked about some of the macro conditions, but it seemed like weakness was concentrated in the storage and computing segment. So if you could maybe talk about things by segment and what you're guidance implies on a quarterly basis by segment. I think that would be helpful and then I have a follow up. Thank you. 
Bernie Blegen : Sure, just to clarify that the softness that we're seeing is both in the storage and computing as well as consumer. The other segments are still positioned to show growth between Q3 and Q4. The only sort of qualifier that we're still trying to learn about the strength and the runrate of the communications of that segment. So I think what we've done is we feel very, very comfortable with both, how we've been communicating our expected results, but we've added a little conservatism to the outlook. 
Matt Ramsay: Got it. Great! And thank you that. Michael, my second question is on the topic of China, and over the last, I’d say three or four weeks since some of the new commerce and BIS restrictions have come into place, I've been getting a ton of investor questions about this topic with relation to your company on two fronts. I guess the first being, MPS has a significant employee base in China. If you could maybe quantify what maybe percentage of your employees and in what functions are actually in China, and if you've heard from any of these restrictions that there could be any restrictions on those employees need to relocate anybody, those kind of things? And then the second part of the question is on your manufacturing footprint. I know it’s spread across China, Taiwan, increasingly in Korea. We've heard some stories from semi cap companies needing to pull employees out of SMIC for example, in other places because of these new restrictions. So anything in your manufacturing operations that might be disrupted at all because of some of the China restrictions and how far are you guys along or maybe the mix of your capacity that's now outside of China.  You get this nature of the questions, but they've been a pretty frequent and acute over the last three or four weeks. So, it would be great if you could just kind of address some of those topics. Thank you. 
Michael Hsing: Yes, very nice questions. Michael, I'm glad you asked, that what all your concern is I think most of the people totally misconstrued whatever the regulation is. And we do have a presence, we have a large presence within China. This is a U.S. companies, okay, and we’re not subject for sanctions at all. We don't have to have the people to leave – Americans have to leave an MPS office within China and that's not in the sanction entity list, and we are not in a sanction entity list.  And other one is the manufacturing in the last couple of quarters, we already talked about it. We’ve diversified out of China and we’re starting five, six years ago. Also, I should mention that we talk about it on the engineering manpower. This MPS started at 2017, and we are in Barcelona now. We’ve moved a very large team here with the local government support. We are outside of China, and that's not because we – because of sanctions, because we want to diversify. Geometrically we’ll – we will grow into a different region, in the same time zones, wherever we want. We give our customers the better support.
Bernie Blegen : And just to finish up on Michael's comment there, to be perfectly clear, our technology and our products are not subject to restrictions. 
Matt Ramsay: No, thank you very much. Just a really, really quick follow-up. What would you say the percentage Michael of the products or the revenue that is actually sourced from manufacturing footprints inside of China today versus outside. And thank you very much for indulging my question guys, I appreciate it.
Michael Hsing: It is very convoluted and it is very convoluted and packaging’s and also the process wafer manufacturers, and it's very convoluted, we don't have a clear figures now. But going back to the Bernie’s question and of Bernie’s answers, our technologies, we're using 40 nanometer above and the current sanction is a 14 nanometer below. We are far – as Bernie mentioned in the script, we are far from that sanctions in the way using the trading edge. We are really using the trading edge of a fab equipment.
Bernie Blegen : And if I can just follow-up on one quick point as we made in our script here, is that as the supply demand imbalance has normalized, that frees us up from just being in pure production mode to actually be able to invest time in business relationships, to be able to expand and diversify our capacity, which we talked about about three quarters ago, where we're going to go from $2 billion of capacity currently to $4 billion within the next two years, two to three years.
Michael Hsing: These are mostly, we planned these outside of China.
Bernie Blegen : Yeah.
Operator: Our next question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham. Quinn, your line is open. 
Quinn Bolton: Thanks. I don't want to pile on the export control questions that Matt was just asked, but I have one other clarification. You're at 40 nanometer and above and so you're not directly affected. But my understanding is that to the extent a facility, a manufacturing facility in China has multiple process nodes, some above 16 nanometer and some below 16 nanometer that that mixed-use facility would be affected.  So I'm just wondering you know, for those Chinese manufacturing facilities, the fab-by-fab, are any of the fabs that you're running 40 nanometer and above, do they also produce 16 nanometer and below and might therefore be affected by equipment and/or support restrictions. 
Michael Hsing: No. These are fab usually, they don't – advanced fabs, okay, these are 14 nanometer below, and I did not share where these outdated fabs like 40-nanometer above, okay. We're primarily using 65 nanometer. So these are totally different fabs. 
Quinn Bolton: Thanks Michael. That's right, but I just wanted to clarify because I know that yeah, as Matt said, there have been lots of questions on this topic. Maybe one for Bernie. I know you're not guiding beyond the December quarter. But obviously the environment is pretty tough right now, especially on orders. And so I guess as you look out beyond December, can you give us any thoughts as to whether you would see less than normal seasonality in March as some of this weakness continues into next year? And I guess the offset would be, Monolithic Power has some pretty, I think meaningful market share gains, both on the server CPU side, as well as the data center GPU side. When would you think that those share gains start to kick in and might get you back to normal seasonal if not better than seasonal patterns.
Bernie Blegen : Sure. So – and again Quinn, thank you for focusing on more longer-term and strategic issues here. I think it's very easy to get caught in thinking about next quarter and just the quarter after that. And everything, all the indicators that we're receiving as far as the share gains occurring in the data center are on track. Nothing has been changed there at all.  And then as far as how we look at the next few quarters. Again, when we apply cautiousness to Q4, I think we could expect that anything – that any growth opportunities are more likely to be weighted in the second half of 2023.
Michael Hsing: Yes, that's our guess and that's our experience. And I might as well add. You mentioned the CPUs and the CPU power, data centers and MPS is a lot more than that. And you look at Bernie’s, read our script and you have automotive and the data – the enterprise data centers and other ones in communication - the other ones, the communications, these are still, all of them are grown, except the consumer related notebooks, gaming, those type of things, and as everybody is aware of, they are softening. They swings from shortage to oversupplies and then you know kind of almost overnight.  These kind of things we cannot predict. I mean you guys probably predict it better than we know. We just have to react fast, and the overall MPS business, all these are greenfield products will start to ramp in the last few years and will continue to ramp. 
Quinn Bolton: Sorry Michael, I didn't want to shortchange it by only focusing on the data center opportunity. So, thanks for that color. 
Bernie Blegen : Thank you. 
Operator: Our next question is from William Stein of Truist. William your line is now open.
William Stein : Hey! Thank you so much for taking questions. I have one near-term one and then a longer-term one. From a near-term perspective, I'm hoping you can talk about pricing trends and also how your backlog might be changing in terms of the duration of what you have on the books today versus where we've been recently? And then again, I have a sort of longer-term follow-up question, please.
Michael Hsing: For shorter terms and I can name this. Here what we see is for the long cycle, longer cycle business is continued. And because there is no questions related to price, okay? Because all the products, they will last four, five years or even longer, okay, and these products are in the ramping cycles.  In the shortest – in the shorter cycle, consumer related, as I said it earlier, I’ve got notebooks and gamings or the other personal electronics, and these ones okay, they are oversupplied. There's no question – we don't have any questions about the pricing. And that probably will come in, like in later, another quarter later, what will be a new project design, that’s where we, that’s pricing – a question, pricing questions will start to emerge.
Bernie Blegen: And well, you also mentioned backlog, the sort of condition in the backlog overall. And relative to historical norms, we still remain very – you know we're much higher than we have been historically, and – but this has given us an opportunity to address with our customers. In fact, we've been engaged in these conversations for several quarters now, on what they expect real demand to be. So I think that as far as our book of business is looking ahead, it remains very healthy.
William Stein : And then the longer-term question, I tend to ask each quarter about some of the you know more differentiated products and services MPS has, modules in particular. I wonder about the traction of those products and whether you're seeing the uptake of that either expand or falter given the current environment? And then same thing with e-commerce, like you have seen more or less of that given the changing demand environment. Thank you. 
Michael Hsing: Yes, all the products, the modules and the e-commerce business okay, and we don't see any changes and they are just continuing and that's where MPS future business would be and we're even more diversified than MPS' current business.
Bernie Blegen : And I think it's interesting as far as market acceptance for the modules. It really is not concentrated in any one – any market. It's actually pretty evenly distributed against all of our markets. So that to me is a real clear indicator that it fits in well with our diversification strategy.
Michael Hsing: Yes, frankly if you ask me where these module goes, we don't have ideas and that is the beauty of it.
William Stein : Thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeremy Kwan of Stifel. Jeremy your line is now open. 
Jeremy Kwan: Yes, good evening. Can you hear me okay? 
Bernie Blegen : Yes. 
Jeremy Kwan: Great! Just a couple of questions. First, just looking at the lighting business, it looks like it had a nice increase sequentially this quarter. Is there anything that you can call out there? I just want to understand some of the dynamics in that business.
Bernie Blegen : Automotive.
Jeremy Kwan: I'm sorry, the lighting – oh! It’s automotive. Okay. That's what's been driving it.
Bernie Blegen : Yes. As we said in the prepared comments, that there were new platforms that were launched, most of them are tied to the 2023 model year and there were probably three areas, lighting being one of them that really contributed to the uplift in the automotive in Q3.
Jeremy Kwan: So this is something that we can look at as a new baseline and the sort of like a steady ramp from here or should we expect kind of more step functions with each new model here?
Michael Hsing : Well, the lighting is – in automotive lighting have a variety. You have a down light, you have indicators, all kind of indicators, you have the signals, then you have the headlight, okay. So this is the last couple of quarters you see stepping up and that's kind of, that's part of the Greenfield product and automotive start to ramp. The content in the cars, we're growing the content. For the number of cars we have okay, and just at the beginning, we still have a small, very small market here, so it will continue to grow.
Jeremy Kwan: Got it. Great! And just turning to the long term purchasing agreement that you talked about Bernie, can you give us a little bit more details on this, maybe the magnitude or the size of this deal and you know how different is this from things, the way you may have done business in the past. Just any more detail and help us you know to understand your strategic thinking behind this, that would be very helpful.
Bernie Blegen : Sure. So when you think about the period of the supply-demand imbalance that we came out of, we had actually a superior competitive position because we had invested in our supply chain earlier than our competition, and that allowed us to have part availability when they didn't and that allowed for incremental market share gains. So as we continue to expand capacity, we're looking for new opportunities and with existing as well as with new fabs, and so in this instance we wanted to secure a purchasing agreement that in order – that gave us dedicated capacity regardless of what the economic environment was.
Jeremy Kwan: Got it, thank you. And then just one last question, just touching again on the modules. Can you give us any insight into the other differences in terms of the manufacturing supply chain that needs to be managed here? And you know in terms of whether it's sourcing or whether it's the geographic footprint. Are there things that you can call there as well?
Michael Hsing: Most of it – let me answer it that way. Most of our modules assembly is outside of China.
Jeremy Kwan: Great! Thank you very much. 
Operator: Our next question is from Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer. Rick, your line is now open. 
Bernie Blegen : Rick, can you hear us?
Rick Schafer: Yes, sorry I was muted. Can you hear me now, Bernie?
Bernie Blegen : Yes.
Rick Schafer: Great. Well hey guys! Thanks for letting me ask you a question. Maybe my first one just on supply. You know TSM, obviously your newest foundry partner, I was just curious if you could kind of level set us on where you guys are at in terms of the qualification process, you know eventual capacity ramp, sort of maybe even get a sense of how much capacity they are going to have for you ultimately and how much of that might be eight versus 12-inch? Just trying to get a better handle on them as a partner.
Michael Hsing: Yes, most of what we use is 12-inch and also the advanced process modes, of course that thing is in the TSMC. We do use the advanced nodes of gaming and these are for microcontrollers, that type of a product that we do use them and these are not winning in China at all. And a lot of these are product at the very beginning of a ramp and so now we have all the capacities for these new products. Mostly these are for automotive and communications and so now it gives us a lot more room to grow.
Rick Schafer: So Michael, just to kind of get a sense. I mean, is this – could TSM be sort of a 10% contributor to capacity in say a year's time or is that too aggressive to kind of think of how quickly they could ramp?
Michael Hsing: On the lower side as we see now.
Rick Schafer: Thanks a lot and then a follow-up, I'm just curious to get an update on silicon carbide progress, particularly traction inverters. I mean how many customers you're engaged with now and when we might expect to see initial revenues? And I know you've talked about it in the past Michael, but just kind of remind us what that dollar content for MPS looks like ex-EV? And I'm assuming it would be sort of subsystem, but would anything be discrete or would that all be sort of module/subsystem?
Michael Hsing: Yes. Thank you very much to ask that question. Yeah, that kind of things, the silicon carbides and the high-power modules okay, that work gets me excited. We do have our first product going through the qualification now; it's working. MPS does not intend to sell as a power device, as a power device only and like a power set only. We will sell within using our combined with our silicon technology produce these small modules.  And we do have many customers engaged in automotive, automotive sections and also the large energy storage and as well as BMS, the car charging stations and those kind of things, we don't have any revenue yet, okay, but it will be in the next few years.
Rick Schafer: And Michael, just a reminder just sort of what it does to content for you guys or potential content in a car or a vehicle?
Michael Hsing: I think these content will be enormous, okay? I don't even have a - that would be in the billion, and I don't have a – a couple of billion dollars of opportunity is a smaller. It's a very conservative estimate. Just thinking about it, all the power trains okay, driver trains, all the charging stations, MPS is not going to make and sell a chip only, we’re selling the entire systems.
Rick Schafer: Great! Thanks a lot for all the color. 
Operator: Our next question is from Alex Vecchi of William Blair. Alex, your line is now open. 
Alex Vecchi: Hey everyone! Thanks for taking my questions. Bernie, maybe one for you just on a housekeeping question around gross margins. Can you elaborate a little bit on the down sequential? The only reason I'm asking is given the end market weakness and notebooks in consumer I would have thought is lower gross margin mix. So anything you can do to help on that and how to think of it like from here.
Michael Hsing: Sure, Alex. So there's a lot of ingredients that play into the gross margin outlook and certainly the direct margin by end market is a significant part of it. Another is the amount of - I don't like to call it necessarily unused capacity. The fixed cost that isn't necessarily absorbed by the same volume. So it's really the fixed cost issue as opposed to the sales mix that's putting a little bit of downward pressure on the gross margin.
Alex Vecchi: Okay. And then similarly to that extent, just expand on Rick's questions regarding the new fab partner or TSMC. Do you view that relationship eventually being gross margin accretive or dilutive versus your Chinese partners?
Michael Hsing: Well, these are the events note and we're moving that towards that – in the territories and therefore these are more microcontrollers, and more highly digital content products and it's a different product. We – there is no gross margin issues. So in that case we don't go down compete with the price. All the products that we add is more. These are values more in the software side. 
Bernie Blegen : And I think that when you look at TSMC, these are new and advanced products that we're developing with them, whereas we're at the same time doing an expansion and diversification away from China and that would include other fabs, both in South Korea as well as in Taiwan.
Alex Vecchi: Okay, that’s really helpful. With that I’ll go back into queue. Thank you. 
Operator: Our next question is from Melissa Fairbanks of Raymond James. Melissa, your line is now open. 
Melissa Fairbanks: Hi guys! Thanks very much. We saw CapEx – maybe a little longer-term question for you. We saw CapEx dip a little in the third quarter. Maybe could you give us an update on your longer-term capacity planning, not just with TSMC, but more broadly? Does the near-term demand weakness impact those longer-term plans? And then when we're looking at getting to $4 billion in revenue, what's the path to that ramp and the cadence of the investment needed to get there?
Michael Hsing: Well, it's a – we always – if you look at our past. If you look at how we expand our capacity, what is our investment, and if you look at the past eight, nine, 12 years, it's the same pattern as the next four, five years. And we're not going to over invest. We're not going to less invest it, okay.  So the trend, if you look at it. If you're plotting our OpEx and also the growth rate, and it should remain pretty constant in the past four years and in the past eight years, in 12 years, in also the last two or three years the growth pattern is really different from previous four years, and whatever the growth rate we have in the next four years, you can use the plotting – you can use the same kind of percentage range.
Bernie Blegen : And Melissa, keep in mind that when we do the fab expansion, the capital expenditures are borne by our partners not directly by us. So when you look at our run rate that Michael is referring to, that's more heavily concentrated in test equipment, which can fluctuate from anywhere between $8 million per quarter to $14 million per quarter. It just so happens that we made a lot of those investments earlier in the year, and that's why we're lower.  The other thing that we invest in is that we do buy or we develop our own facilities and those can be layered on and currently there are no investments of any material nature.
Michael Hsing: Yes, let me clarify this a little more, rather than give you a model. You know MPS, we don't own the fab, we don't own fab equipment, and the cost of associating with capacity expansion, one is we have to qualify the process, and the large portion of it is to qualify our products. We have 4,000, well over 4,000 products, and each product to go through a qualification, that takes about eight to nine months. That cost, that's very costly and so that's – if we don't – if we slow down and the demand slows down, we don't have to qualify as fast okay, and so the cost will be spread out. 
Bernie Blegen : And those costs are borne in our R&D expenditure line.
Melissa Fairbanks: Okay great, that’s very clear. Thanks very much guys. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. As there are no further questions, I would now like to turn the webinar back over to Bernie.
Bernie Blegen : Thanks Jen. I'd like to thank you all for joining us for this conference call and look forward to talking to you again during the fourth quarter conference call, which is likely to be held in early February. Thank you and have a nice day!

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-08-02 17:00:00) =====
Genevieve Cunningham: Welcome everyone to the MPS Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Webinar. Please note that this webinar is being recorded and will be archived for 1 year on our Investor Relations page at www.monolithicpower.com. My name is Genevieve Cunningham, and I will be the moderator for this webinar. Joining me today are Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS; and Bernie Blegen, VP and CFO. In the course of todayâs webinar, we will be making forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from managementâs current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q2 earnings release and in our latest 10-K and 10-Q filings that can be found on our website. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on todayâs call. We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, R&D and SG&A expense, operating income, other income, income before income taxes, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our Q2 2022 earnings release, which we have furnished to the SEC and is currently available on our website. Now Iâd like to turn the call over to Bernie Blegen.
Bernie Blegen: Thanks, Gen. MPS achieved record second quarter revenue of $461.0 million, 22.1% higher than the first quarter of 2022, and 57.2% higher than the second quarter of 2021. This broad-based year-over-year revenue growth was a result of consistent execution against our strategies. Turning now to the second quarter 2022 revenue by market, in our enterprise data market, second quarter 2022 revenue of $65.2 million increased 53.4% from the first quarter of 2022, primarily due to an accelerated ramp in our data center and workstation computing sales. Second quarter 2022 revenue was up 117.9% year-over-year. Enterprise data revenue represented 14.2% of MPSâs second quarter 2022 revenue compared with 10.2% in the second quarter of 2021. Storage and computing revenue of $122.3 million increased 26.6% from the first quarter of 2022. The sequential revenue improvement reflected higher commercial notebook and storage sales. Second quarter 2022 revenue was up 111.6% year-over-year. Storage and computing revenue represented 26.5% of MPSâs second quarter 2022 revenue compared with 19.7% in the second quarter of 2021. Second quarter consumer market revenue of $97.3 million increased 21.7% from the first quarter of 2022. The sequential quarterly revenue improvement was broad-based with particular strength noted in home appliances and gaming. Second quarter 2022 revenue was up 27.9% year-over-year. Consumer revenue represented 21.1% of MPSâs second quarter 2022 revenue compared with 25.9% in the second quarter of 2021. Second quarter 2022 industrial revenue of $55.9 million increased 15.1% from the first quarter of 2022, reflecting increased sales of products for power source and security applications. Second quarter 2022 revenue was up 28.9% year-over-year. Industrial revenue represented 12.1% of our total second quarter 2022 revenue compared with 14.8% in the second quarter of 2021. Second quarter automobile revenue of $61.0 million increased 11.9% from the first quarter of 2022. Primarily â due primarily to increased sales of applications for advanced driver system systems, the digital cockpit and lighting products. Second quarter 2022 revenue was up 25.3% year-over-year. Automotive revenue represented 13.2% of MPSâs second quarter 2022 revenue compared with 16.6% in the second quarter of 2021. Second quarter 2022 communications revenue of $59.3 million was up 6.7% from the first quarter of 2022. Most of the sequential revenue increase was related to 5G infrastructure. Second quarter 2022 revenue was up 58.3% year-over-year. Communications sales represented 12.9% of our total second quarter 2022 revenue compared with 12.8% in the second quarter of 2021. Moving now to a few comments on gross margin. GAAP gross margin was 58.8%, 90 basis points higher than the first quarter of 2022 and 280 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2021. Our GAAP operating income was $141.9 million compared to $96.1 million reported in the first quarter of 2022 and $60.6 million reported in the second quarter of 2021. Non-GAAP gross margin for the second quarter of 2022 was 59.0%, up 70 basis points from the gross margin reported for the first quarter of 2022 and 270 basis points higher than the second quarter from a year ago. The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increases in both GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin is attributed largely to operational efficiency gains and a more favorable sales mix. Our non-GAAP operating income was $179.4 million compared to $133.6 million reported in the first quarter of 2022. Letâs review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $129.1 million in the second quarter of 2022 compared with $122.7 million in the first quarter of 2022 and $103.6 million in the second quarter of 2021. Our non-GAAP second quarter 2022 operating expenses were $92.7 million, up from the $86.6 million we spent in the first quarter of 2022 and up from the $70.3 million reported in the second quarter of 2021. The differences between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are primarily stock compensation expense and income or loss on an unfunded deferred compensation plan. For the second quarter of 2022, total stock compensation expense, including approximately $1.2 million charged to cost of goods sold was $42.9 million compared with $39.8 million recorded in the first quarter of 2022. Our second quarter 2022 GAAP other income â other expense was $5.1 million compared with $634,000 in the first quarter of 2022. Our second quarter 2022 non-GAAP other expense was $7,000 compared with non-GAAP other income of $1.6 million in the first quarter of 2022. The decrease is due to a $2 million increase in charitable contributions, partly offset by the favorable impact of currency exchange rates. The difference in non-GAAP other income and GAAP other income is the income or loss on an unfunded deferred compensation plan. Switching to the bottom line. Second quarter 2022 GAAP net income was $114.7 million or $2.37 per fully diluted share compared with $79.6 million or $1.65 per share in the first quarter of 2022 and $55.2 million or $1.16 per share in the second quarter of 2021. Second quarter 2022 non-GAAP net income was $157.0 million, or $3.25 per fully diluted share compared with $118.3 million or $2.45 per fully diluted share in the first quarter of 2022 and $86.5 million or $1.81 on a per share â per fully diluted share in the second quarter of 2021. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q2 2022 were 48.3 million. Now, letâs look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $814.1 million at the end of the second quarter of 2022 compared with $775.9 million at the end of the first quarter of 2022. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of approximately $105.2 million compared with Q1 2022 operating cash flow of $107.4 million. Accounts receivable ended the second quarter of 2022 at $125.5 million, representing 25 days of sales outstanding, which was 4 days lower than the 29 days reported at the end of the first quarter of 2022 and 1 day higher than the 24 days in the second quarter of 2021. Our internal inventories at the end of the second quarter of 2022 were $359.6 million, up from the $311 million at the end of the first quarter of 2022. Days of inventory of 172 days at the end of the second quarter of 2022 were 6 days lower than at the end of the first quarter of 2022. Historically, we have calculated days of inventory on hand as a function of current order revenue. We believe comparing current inventory levels with the following quarterâs revenue provides a better economic match. On this basis, you can see days of inventory of 162 days at the end of the second quarter of 2022, which were 13 days higher than the 149 days at the end of the first quarter of 2022 and 44 days higher than the 118 days at the end of the second quarter of 2021. I would like now to turn to our outlook for the third quarter of 2022. We are forecasting Q3 revenue in the range of $480 million to $500 million; GAAP gross margin in the range of 58.4% to 59.0%; non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 58.7% to 59.3%; total stock-based compensation expense in the range of $42.8 million to $44.8 million, including approximately $1.3 million that would be charged to cost of goods sold; GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses between $136.2 million and $140.2 million; non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses in the range of $94.7 million to $96.7 million; litigation expense in the range between $2.3 million and $2.7 million; interest and other income in the range from $1.3 million to $1.7 million before foreign exchange gains and losses; fully diluted shares in the range of 47.9 million to 48.9 million shares. In conclusion, we are continuing to execute on our growth strategies, including expansion and diversification of our R&D centers and manufacturing partnerships in multiple countries. I will now open the webinar up for questions.
A - Genevieve Cunningham: Thank you, Bernie. Analysts, I would now like to begin our Q&A session.  Our first question is from Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer. Rick, your line is now open.
Rick Schafer: Thanks and congratulations to you guys. Another great quarter. This may seem like a silly question given the guidance. But I am just curious, are you seeing any impact from the delayed launch of Sapphire Rapids? I mean I know your accelerator content is a lot higher than your CPU core power content. I think 48-volt, and please correct me if I am wrong, I think our math shows 48-volt track into sort of $100 million this year, so I guess Iâm just looking at sort of the puts and takes. I know itâs â this is a pretty much a monster guide. But I am just a little curious if you were seeing any drag there from that delayed launch?
Michael Hsing: So far, we see it for the next year or so. All our growth is â these are â as you know, these are all growing fields. And again, I mean we donât own the products that were designed in the last few years, like I mean, for whatever the divulging of it, okay. And so if there is a delay the one thing is that we actually care less and itâs out of MPS control. And â but overall, we have a new â has a higher power processor and MPS can provide a much higher benefit to those market segments. So, itâs off for about 1.5 years and 1 years and we donât notice it as in this period and where we gain more market shares. And in a way, we grow from this existing business that we have plenty of it to growth.
Rick Schafer: Okay. Thanks a lot, Michael, for the color. And if I could follow-up maybe on the supply question, majority of your wafer supply is still in China, plus you have got to pay your big Chengdu back end facility. So I guess, how concerned are you if with trying to derisk supply chain as we keep watching headlines with the U.S. government trying to tighten restrictions, etcetera on equipment and everything in China? So just curious, your thoughts there? And maybe as part of that, if you could talk about where things stand now with TSMC and give a sense maybe of timing and capacity plans there? Thanks.
Michael Hsing: Yes. Just like any other companies, okay, clearly, we are transitioning out from the last 20 years of manufacturing from China to other places. And all this infrastructure had to be built up. And we are just like other companies. Like we are in a transition, so actually, we started transitioning earlier. We first started from our engineering manpower. So that came in and we transitioned out of 6, 7 years ago â 6 years ago. And manufacturers, we started like 2 â about 3 years ago and as you know, we always use a trading edge of a DRAM fab, okay or a digital fab. And 3 or 4 years ago, clearly, okay, these are higher node, okay, 60 nanometers and 40 nanometers fabs. Okay, they are all engaged with the MPS, okay. And as we have a reputation, so we will fill up all these fab. And now it opens up in careers and I mean Taiwan and â these are the places now, okay, we are only talking about a fab this one now. And in the next few years will be, again will be â I canât say itâs a move out of China soon, okay, we â and a still bigger capacity, okay. And we have a large market segment in our â 30% of our revenues still from China. So in the next year or a couple of years later, next year, we probably will be very diversified.
Bernie Blegen: And just to add to that, that as the capacity restrictions are becoming less of a concern for the market in general, customers are asking for diversification as in a China plus one strategy. So we are working along those lines in companion to expanding our overall capacity.
Michael Hsing: Yes. They all require â each region center require their local supplied. Thatâs where we are playing the game. I mean thatâs our customer request. And so we are fully aware of that. And so we engage with all these fabs. And okay, across South Asia and Europe and Korea and Japan. And so thatâs how I see it.
Rick Schafer: Okay, thanks a lot for the color. Congrats again.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Matt Ramsay of Cowen. Matt, your line is now open.
Matt Ramsay: Thank you very much, guys. Hopefully, you can hear me okay. Congratulations on the results. So I had two questions, and Iâll just go ahead and ask both at the same time because I think weâve got multiple calls going tonight. The first one, Michael, both in the server business, so the new enterprise data segment and in the PC business, could you give us some indication of how far ahead of the unit sales to your power â your core CPU power or accelerator power products actually sell in versus the unit shipments that they get reported by the end customers? And burning the second question, completely unrelated, like $800 million in cash, give or take, if you could kind of walk us through some of the uses of cash there. Iâm sure Michael would like to build some inventory, which is kind of always the case. But if you have any new things to say there, that would be really helpful? Thanks, guys.
Michael Hsing: Well, first, your first question, honestly, I donât really know. I mean itâs difficult. And as you know, we sell â these are building blocks. And for more or less in a server and data center areas, and these are more generic parts, and they can be used multiple awake. And itâs hard to track. And frankly, we donât really care. And as long as we â our revenue goes up, right? And for very high powers, and these are power like a 48-volt power, okay? We do have pretty good dominant players in that segment. And so the â I think a ramp hasnât really just started recently. I mean we will be â in the future, there will be a lot more. But mentioning about â you mentioned about notebooks, I mean weâre mostly in high-performance gaming or mostly in the â in commercial notebook. And number of assets and versus the CPU â versus CPUs, itâs also hard to match in because weâre selling these power devices, they can be through 2 phase, they can be 3 phase, They can be 4 phase. I mean we donât quite note. And also we care less. And so itâs difficult to answer it. So all these notebooks are all the high end, the high-end gaming side and gaming notebooks and commercial. And so these are the ones that they have a variety of a use.
Bernie Blegen: And on the issue as far as our cash position, which, letâs put it on the table, itâs sort of an enviable position to have over $800 million of cash and cash equivalents. And there is probably three things that we look at. The first is weâve been consistently paying out a routine dividend. This year, itâs $3 â $0.75 per quarter, $3 for the full year. and weâre evaluating the sustainability at a even higher level. We generally announced dividend increases in February, comparing with our Q4 operating results and weâd expect to do so again this year. Another area that we found is very key and strategic to us is building out capacity. And weâre looking, as Michael said earlier, for different avenues in order to build out additional capacity. And in some cases, that may require additional investment. And then finally, as you also added is working capital, making sure that we have adequate inventory on hand in order to sustain our customersâ demand profile. And so right now, weâre still below our target of 180 to 200 days of inventory. So we will continue to be investing in inventories as well.
Michael Hsing: Yes. Might as well, all these are Bernie add all the expenses, that they are small compared â relatively compare the cash that we generate every year. And so what we want to do is thatâs probably MPS know the best, be consistent. And we give â increase our revenue yearly. And thatâs what we have been doing in the past few years, and we will continue to do so. And also, we donât want â we will do some acquisitions, but not acquisition for revenues.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from William Stein of Truist. William, your line is now open.
William Stein: Great. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the great results and outlook. Something I tend to ask about is traction in the module business because I know that this is something thatâs helping boost the revenue growth and the margins. Iâm hoping you can maybe update us on the traction in that business, please?
Michael Hsing: Yes. The module is doing well, I mean, but the revenue is still quite small. Itâs a hundred-some million dollars, but in â but I know in the next few years will grow double or triple it. And thatâs what weâve seen in the pipeline, in the design win activities. And so as we said a few years ago, we do e-commerce and okay, we do programmable modules these show true benefits to our customers truly realize it in the end.
Bernie Blegen: Yes. Iâd say that particularly as we had this supply/demand imbalance and our customers are also looking for enabling technologies that the decision process for earning a design win where historically had been just on the lowest cost provider. Now things like the programmability, the flexibility, the time to market, the total cost of ownership are taking a larger weighting in the decision process, and we feel like weâre very strategically positioned to take advantage of that change in the market.
William Stein: Thatâs great. And as a follow-up, if I can. I am wondering if you can talk about your lead times now and how they might have changed in the last, I donât know a couple of months and to the degree to which thatâs been a competitive advantage. My understanding is that youâre offering lead times that enable customers to switch away from competitorsâ products that have lead times that are so long that it suddenly makes sense to switch. Any sort of comments or update on that would help a lot? Thanks, guys.
Michael Hsing: Our own lead time really hasnât changed that much. And we still â weâre still in a lot of delinquencies, okay? And thatâs a good thing, okay, because as Bernie said earlier, in all the benefit of our product technologies. Okay, finally, our customers realize it, and it became a high demand. And even though and I think itâs due to the new design win activities. And they all switch to this type of a new technology or new design methodologies. And now that really benefit MPS. And at the same time, we had to increase our capacities. I mean not only from China and globally, thatâs what our customer demands.
Bernie Blegen: Yes. And just to top off that answer is that I donât think our lead times were necessarily different from anybody else necessarily in the industry. But we have the advantage of having so many new products coming on the market, Greenfield opportunities, that we invested ahead of the curve, and thatâs where we were able to have product availability when others didnât.
William Stein: Thanks, guys.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham. Quinn, your line is now open.
Quinn Bolton: Hi, guys. Congratulations on the nice results. I guess I would love to ask, obviously, weâve seen some in the compute space Intel and Micron offering much more subdued outlooks for the second half. I think there is clearly some inventory purge going on in the channel. And Iâm just wondering, obviously, your September guidance is very strong. But as you look at the order book, have you started to see any changes in the notebook or computer and storage and enterprise data center segment that might echo some of the comments weâve heard from folks like Intel and Micron in the broader market? And then Iâve got a follow-up.
Michael Hsing: We â for the notebooks, okay. And for our side, still â demand is still pretty good and still good, like I mean, and I think as the orders and the orders slow down than before. And but we still have delinquency. And for memory side, for memory side, and there is a lot of new format, okay, starting, weâre still facing shortages now.
Bernie Blegen: Yes. And if I could just add to that is that we are looking at any areas of our business that might be susceptible to either backlog that is canceled or is pushed out. And keep in mind that cancellations are always a part of all semiconductor companies. Itâs not just a one-time or a new event. And the fact of the matter is, is that any influence relative to the size of our overall backlog today is very minor. And so thatâs whatâs given us very confident outlook for the second...
Michael Hsing: The rate of a booking and the rate of cancellations and I would say they are very similar in the last few years. I mean last few quarters, yes.
Quinn Bolton: Okay. So no noticeable uptick in cancellations or push-outs, it sounds like is what youâre saying?
Bernie Blegen: Yes.
Quinn Bolton: Got it. The second question is just enterprise data showing very strong growth, and I think thatâs going to be one of the biggest drivers for the business over the next couple of years, given the Greenfield opportunities. And just â can you guys size for us, is the accelerator card and 40-gig volt opportunity larger than the share gain on CPU power? Do you think they are both equally sort of driving the growth? Iâm just trying to sort of â whatâs the biggest driver, do you think, for the enterprise dataset?
Michael Hsing: I think itâs both. And not only the CPU size for the servers, we gain â and we gain the market share. We stepped into â in that game a couple of years ago, but a very small percentage, and we start to ramp. But weâre still far distance, then they need a bigger suppliers. And thatâs one of â from the server side. And the 48-volts, as you know, we talk about it. And we talked about since 2017 or â18. And we said that this is the inevitable and a trend. You had to go move to 48 volt. And we are now in the forefront of, and weâre not replacing anybody, okay? We set up this market trend. And so â and also in the data center and the rack itself is a big opportunities and MPS are ramping revenue from there, to from the AC power, and these are 380 volts and I guess, 240 volts input convert into 48 volt. And also the battery backup, and we provide the same â we provide the solutions for battery management and also cooling side. And so MPS is almost one-stop shopping place for data center.
Quinn Bolton: Thank you, Michael.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Tore, your line is now open.
Tore Svanberg: Yes. Thank you. First one for Michael. Michael, youâre known for driving a lot of new innovative business models and as we now start to think about adding capacity to get to $4 billion, given the geopolitical dynamics and so on and so forth. I know youâve talked a little bit about this, but are you thinking or working on new business models to try and secure more capacity for your continuous growth?
Michael Hsing: Well, these are one thing, right? We do â of course, we have the fab, we have the mobile. And we will have increased more capacities outside of China. We started about a couple of years ago, also more than a couple of years ago. And now we engage with some bigger DRAM fabs, okay? We will fill that up in the next couple of years. And â but going to futures, MPS actually require less semiconductors and because a lot of products are more programmable and we can use for multiple use. And at the same time, weâre growing our revenues. Weâre selling a lot more than semiconductor. Weâre selling power solutions, more modules. And â so we kind of move up the food chain as the new requirement comes in, we play in the market, weâre not competing with anybody. And we just provide the solutions. And so those are manufacturer. These are clearly â they are different. They are building modules. And we sign up partnerships, okay, for assemble these new modules. And itâs unprecedented. And a lot of testings, a lot of qualifications, MPS designed the whole system from a ground up. And so these are the â there is no such a facility out there. So we had to invent it, that work.
Bernie Blegen: Yes. And I think just to echo a point there is, if you look at our revenue for the quarter, we grew 57%. And keep in mind that weâve had one price increase, and that was in February this year for 5%. And so if you actually look at where the source of revenue growth came from, about half of it is volume related, and the other half is higher ASPs because the higher value products are selling. So that means that weâve differentiated our supply chains. So weâre not just dependent on silicon-based products. Itâs making total solutions.
Michael Hsing: But these are â the bigger effect hasnât really taken place yet. That would be a couple â a year or a couple of years down the road, you will see much bigger effect and â so there is a lot of the new â a lot of work to do ahead of us. And these are â particularly, these are new types of modules. Nobody else build the kind of things, okay? Weâre ground up, we developed and we even develop a manufacturing and as well as testing the qualifications part of it.
Tore Svanberg: Thatâs great, great perspective. Thank you for that, Michael, as my follow-up, and this is related to what you just mentioned there, Bernie, which is pricing. I know youâre obviously growing by adding more value and higher ASP products. But you mentioned that 5% price increases. I think itâs well documented that your competitors have raised prices by more than that. So I guess my question is just simply that, are you gaining a lot of share because you didnât engage in aggressive price increases as some of your customers? I mean, your competitors, sorry.
Michael Hsing: Gaining share, itâs â gaining share is a difficult to count because gaining share, if the equals product is gaining share and going to be in a similar product. And â so you â our price betters, our performance better, weâre gaining shares. Okay. Now weâre talking about completely different things. And those market segments we want to get in there is less price sensitive, but quality, performance a lot more important. And now okay, we offer something that is a lot more than that. And 10 years ago, we said who do we compete with? And not a company sell controller and power MOSFET, they are separate, MPS is integrated. And now youâre talking about MPS, we â our product even on the silicon side. And we have microcontroller, we have a memory, we have digital, we have power. And very unique how we â what we â who do we display. Itâs difficult to say it. Now itâs getting to use these type of silicon-based technology, we migrate out. We became a provider of total solutions. So how do we â who do we display, and okay, how we gain market share? Itâs very difficult to say.
Tore Svanberg: Yes. No, it sounds like youâre displacing more and more companies than before. Just one last quick one for you, Bernie. Most companiesâ DSOs were up this quarter because of the China lockdowns, shipments being later in the quarter. Your DSOs actually went down this quarter. So, can you just talk a little bit about how the China lockdown impacted you? I mean obviously, it didnât impact it the same way, but any other color you can share with us, that would be great? Thanks.
Bernie Blegen: No, we really didnât have much impact from the China shutdown. Obviously, we were able to record revenue growth that is well above the industry average. And the concern we might have had is if our customer supply chains got impacted. But we continue to hit our delivery schedules. And if there was an impact, I am sure we felt some of it, but it was very marginal.
Tore Svanberg: Right. Thank you and congrats on the strong results.
Michael Hsing: Thank you.
Bernie Blegen: Thank you.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Ross, your line is now open.
Ross Seymore: Thanks guys for asking question. First question is really kind of a high-level one. Over the years, you guys have generally outperformed the analog market by maybe 10 or 15 percentage points of growth and gain share, etcetera, etcetera. Even last year wasnât terribly outside of that range. But this year, it seems like that delta probably doubles at least, maybe something more. So, I do get investors that are concerned that your increased availability versus the peers allows you to ship and then it can be double shipping in response to the double ordering. And so itâs a cyclical phenomenon thatâs widening that gap. Can you just talk about the reasons you think that gap is sustainable? And then looking forward, do you think that gap will continue to grow despite the fact that you are operating off of a larger base?
Michael Hsing: Yes. I think what you said partially is correct. I mean the other company couldnât ship, okay, we have the inventories and again, we have a capacity to ship. But this year, particularly, we see things are very different. And a lot of products, especially we ship to these Tier 1 companies are from the industrial side, from automotive side and even the data centers. And they donât â they didnât intend to have MPS has a big â has a majority as a bigger supplier, where they give us as a backup and to test a lot. And in the last years, we shipped all these units, our failures, okay. We are far better than everybody else, and thatâs one thing. The quality of â quality is everything. And â but they took a chance when they have shortages. And so we proved that, give us a bigger opportunity. We proved it, these products as better. Okay, as good as better than our â whatever the parts they design them out. And in the last year, this year, all the new product or the new segment start to grow out. And as our product, we can change it, we can reconfigure it. And that will continue, we continue to grow up. And as we see it at, we cannot handle all the projects. And so in the foreseeable features and these products will continue to grow.
Bernie Blegen: And keep in mind that we are still facing large delinquencies ourselves. And so we have had to be very cautious and opportunistic as far as how we allocate our wafer starts in order to meet real customer demand. So, I think we have been clear that during the first half of the year, we did a cleanup of double orders and have confirmed, as I said earlier, the MPSâ backlog still remains very healthy. And then when you look at the inventory in the channel, we are at lows. Itâs very lean. And we believe we donât have perfect insight, that the inventory on our customer shelves is likewise very lean because we have only been doing partial shipments there. So, as far as the markets we feel reasonably confident, obviously, notebook or some of the consumer could give us, we are trying to stay very close to that and evaluate its impact. But as Michael said, a lot of our new growth opportunities are in these large Tier 1 opportunities. And itâs that secular growth thatâs really driving it. And thatâs different from just building up in the channel or on customer shelves.
Michael Hsing: Yes. I will come back to your questions. Okay. Now you said that you are growing a large basis, so you grow, okay, itâs difficult to grow. Thatâs kind of a built in everybodyâs mind, okay? In my mind, I donât have a limit. And the limit is within yourself, what to do. And people told me, okay, early on $200 million, itâs your barriers, like $500 million of barriers. $200 million at the time, it was a barrier at one time. It happened. And $500 million, it wasnât okay, then people tell me, okay, you are going to grow $1 billion, you need to slowdown. And at the time seriously, that was 2017, 2017 or â18, yes, â17, I actually said it, okay, when we get to $1 billion, we are going to accelerate it. And thatâs at the time, thatâs how I see it. And now, okay, MPS, we are not selling silicon anymore. We are selling raw more than the silicon, and why not accelerating the growth. So, itâs â of course, I am not saying that now okay, a lot of things still depend on our execution. But only thing is the mindset when not dwell on selling semiconductors. And selling semiconductor is limited, but you have a lot of service engineering manpower, we can â our customers can benefit to it. Thatâs not â thatâs unlimited almost.
Bernie Blegen: And supporting Michaelâs point there, you might remember six quarters or seven quarters ago, we made the statement that by the end of Q2 of â22 that we would have capacity to support a $2 billion revenue run rate. And I think that the key there is the execution and the focus and thatâs exactly what we have done.
Ross Seymore: Hi. Thanks for all that color guys. I guess hopefully, a quicker follow-up to all of this as you expand beyond the semiconductor side, you get into â I donât want to say systems, but more solutions in general, some of the stuff you talked about with the entire rack, the AC to DC, the cooling, all the above. What do we look at the gross margin doing in that? That sounds like higher gross margin business. And I know consistency of gross margin expansion is the mantra that you guys have lived by and delivered on. But it seems like mix would go in a big tail or would be a big tailwind for you going forward from a gross margin perspective. So, just talk about what this changing in your revenue mix means, whether itâs end market or system solutions versus chips to your gross margin?
Michael Hsing: Yes. Thatâs kind of things we are going to â of course I can all I will say, okay, we can charge as much as our customers available, okay. And thatâs kind of a half BS , okay. And â but the reality is I think that we are comfortably stay around this mid to high-50s and 55% to 60% in the range. I think thatâs a sweet spot for us. We are not going to print the corners for us to grow to over 70%. And when we get that, we get that, okay. So far, we donât have headwinds. And I think the opportunity drives the model itself. In the next couple of years, I think that we are going to stay around this as we are now. So, maybe move up a slide later. I mean we donât have â at least we donât have the headwinds. And so after 3 years or 4 years we will see how we change our models.
Bernie Blegen: Right. I would just add that I think that we reported gross margin of 59.0%. And as Michael said, somewhere in that area is sort of the sweet spot for our model that allows us also to accelerate our rate of revenue growth. So, itâs something that we will continue to evaluate. But I think right now, we are very comfortable with this being our model.
Michael Hsing: We are not chasing the volumes going down. We are not actually MPS is not good at chasing our volume. We are not doing these manufacturing, okay. Actually, MPS doesnât manufacture anything and the high-volume things, thatâs not MPS forte.
Ross Seymore: Thank you.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Melissa Fairbanks of Raymond James. Melissa, your line is now open.
Melissa Fairbanks: Hi guys. Thanks very much. I will echo the congratulations on another great quarter. I just had two really quick ones for you. First, could you remind us what your inventory target or ideal levels of inventory would be in order to maybe clear some of the delinquencies? And then second, on a somewhat related note, what should we be thinking about for CapEx this year, either as a percentage of revenue or absolute investment. And then whatâs the longer term requirements you need in order to meet your demand or your growth plans?
Bernie Blegen: Good questions. So, as far as inventory, keep in mind that being so much of our positioning is around growth that as sort of a risk management decision. We believe that 180 days to 200 days of inventory is whatâs needed so that we can manage an upside in customer demand, but also if we end up in an unfortunate situation where we have lots of inventory that arenât sellable that we can compensate for that without having any disruption to our customersâ production lines. So, I think that itâs been difficult to manage delinquencies while increasing inventories in order to support our model. But I think we have done a pretty good job in these really unusual times. And then as far as the capital requirements, I think we have talked in the past as far as what our spending rate is. It tends to be on a quarterly basis, can be somewhere between $14 million and $18 million per quarter with a lot of that being testing equipment or even if we are purchasing buildings, we purchase our own office space. And the first half of this year was a little bit lighter than our normal run rate. But I think 14 to 18, absent a big building purchase, is probably a good run-rate.
Melissa Fairbanks: Okay, great. Thanks very much. Thatâs all for me.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Alessandra Vecchi of William Blair. Alex , your line is now open. 
Alessandra Vecchi: Sorry, I was muted. Apologies. I will start over. Bernie, can you hear me? Michael, can you hear me?
Michael Hsing: Yes.
Bernie Blegen: Yes. Hi Alex.
Alessandra Vecchi: Apologies about that user error here. I was saying apologies again, if someone has already asked this question, but I wanted to expand a little bit on Rossâ question, just in terms of the competitive dynamic in your products being superior to those of the competition as well as more of the solution sale. How do we think about power management, in particular, and your positioning within the customer as these products become more complicated, you take up more space on the board, I would assume that those conversations are becoming more tightly coupled and that you guys are becoming more important to the customer in terms of conversation?
Michael Hsing: Yes. Look, I mean we â and as a matter of fact, the form of MPS, from the beginning, so we donât sell pin-to-pin comparables, okay. We â in a similar product, we offer the â actually, we are always a far better product. And much compact, much higher efficiencies. And as an also cost to play without the armor charge on the late and that is known for MPS, okay, and a one-time itâs early period of time, the MPS is like a price, kind of companies. And we actually â we didnât, that means that we left a little lot of dollars on the table. And of course, we are not competing in that market segment anymore. Now okay, we offer either total solutions. And if you do â if you are mentioning up â if you are talking about any applications, they need power. And we are talking about electrical car, MPS can build a whole car and use electronics. And you want to build the data centers, MPS provides the entire product for data centers, and we are mostly there. And thatâs how we sell value. And we are not competing on this product competes with that product. We have all software behind it. And we have user interface, okay, software that changes the game. We are not competing with the product per se anymore.
Bernie Blegen: I think an interesting dynamic that we have been observing is that power management was always an afterthought. It was the last thing after you designed your board and you came up with the least bad solution. Now, we are introduced at the very front end of the development of an application. And the reason is, is because our power solutions enable our customers to be able to develop higher-power solutions than they would otherwise. So, thatâs an interesting twist in the relationship where we are being introduced more earlier to the process and able to jointly come up with the development of shared solutions.
Michael Hsing: As you see â as you remember, MPS like 4 years ago, we actually built a car. Built a very advanced car and far advanced than any car that you see in the market. And with battery management and same time, all the motor controls, a lot more complex than the existing EV. And so just for the purpose, we can demonstrate we can do it. And now we can do it â and 4 years later, actually, we can do a lot more than that. And so thatâs kind of examples.
Alessandra Vecchi: Thatâs extremely helpful. And then, Bernie, just one last quick question, in terms of the guidance, any end market that we should think of or how should we think about the end markets in terms of strength versus â strongest versus weakest strength, any notable things to call out?
Bernie Blegen: Yes. I think that the themes that you are going to be seeing for the next 2 years to 3 years are the enterprise data and automotive. Automotive had a relatively slow first half, but that was exactly what we had in our expectations. There was no new surprise there. And we believe that in the second half, it looks very healthy as does the data center.
Michael Hsing: Yes, as we see it. And okay, as we donât want to â okay, what will we provide, not customer asked for it? Yes, we will do that, a customer do that. We should lead to customers. So, what you should need. Thatâs the game we are really playing, okay. We are playing ahead of game. And I think that all the power stuff like 48 volts, we said that this is like â we said that in 2017, okay, this is the futures, and we anticipated that. Electrical cars, we anticipated that. And so now we can, in the next few years, and we will see the very similar things that we will see all of these will happen.
Alessandra Vecchi: Perfect. Thank you so much. Congratulations again.
Bernie Blegen: Thank you, Alex.
Genevieve Cunningham:  As there are no further questions, I would now like to turn the webinar back over to Bernie.
Bernie Blegen: Great. Thanks Gen. I would like to thank you all for joining us on the webinar and look forward to talking to you again during the third quarter, which will likely be at the end of October. Thank you. Have a nice day.

We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, R&D and SG&A expense, operating income, other income, income before income taxes, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our Q1 2022 earnings release, which we have furnished to the SEC and is currently available on our website.  I'd also like to remind you that today's conference call is being webcast live over the Internet and will be available for replay on our website for 1 year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today.  Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bernie.
Bernie Blegen: Thanks, Gen. MPS posted record first quarter revenue of $377.7 million, 48.4% higher than the first quarter of 2021. The year-over-year revenue increase represented strength in the overall market and more importantly broad-based market share gains, resulting from customer acceptance of our new product introductions.  Before looking at our revenue by market, I would like to call your attention to a change in our reporting. In order to provide increased visibility on data center and cloud computing revenue, a growth reporting for computer and storage to get 2 separate line items. The table has been included in this webinar showing the company's quarterly revenue on this basis since 2017. The first line item is called storage and computing, which primarily refers to total storage and client computing revenue. The second line item is called enterprise data, which captures revenue from data center and product.  In our storage and computing market, first quarter 2022 revenue of $96.6 million increased $18.6 million or 23.9% from the fourth quarter of 2021 due primarily to higher storage and commercial notebook sales. Computing -- storage and computing revenue represented 25.6% of MPS' first quarter 2022 revenue compared with 20.2% in the first quarter of 2021.  In our enterprise data market, first quarter 2022 revenue of $42.5 million increased 5.0% in the fourth quarter of 2021 due primarily to continuing strength in data center and workstation computing sales. Enterprise data revenue represented 11.3% of MPS' first quarter 2022 revenue compared with 6.4% in the first quarter of 2021.  First quarter 2022 communications revenue of $55.6 million rose $9.7 million or 21.1% for the fourth quarter of 2021. The quarter-over-quarter increase primarily reflected higher revenue related to 5G build-outs and satellite communications. Communications revenue represented 14.7% of MPS' first quarter 2022 revenue compared with 14.2% in the first quarter of 2021.  First quarter 2022 revenue from consumer markets of $80.0 million increased $13.6 million or 20.6% from the fourth quarter of 2021. This sequential quarterly improvement of the sequential revenue increase reflected a broad-based increase particularly related to our IoT business. Consumer revenue represented 21.2% of our Q1 revenue compared with a 26.0% contribution in the first quarter of 2021.  First quarter 2022 unearned revenue of $54.5 million decreased 3.2% from the fourth quarter of 2021. Unearned revenue represented 14.4% of MPS' first quarter 2022 revenue compared with 17.6% in the previous year.  In our industrial market, revenue of $48.5 million was essentially flat with revenue recorded in the fourth quarter of 2021. Industrial revenue represented 12.8% of our first quarter revenue compared with 15.6% in the prior year.  Moving now to a few comments on gross margin. GAAP gross margin was 57.9%, 30 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2021 and 250 basis points higher than the first quarter of 2021. Our GAAP operating income was $96.1 million compared with $78.6 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2021. For the first quarter of 2022, non-GAAP gross margin was 58.3%, 40 basis points better in the fourth quarter of 2021 and 250 basis points better than the first quarter of 2021. Our non-GAAP operating income was $133.6 million compared to $112.0 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2021.  On both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis, the sequential quarterly gross margin improvement was primarily due to a better product mix as revenue from higher value, new product introductions are ramping.  Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $122.7 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared with $115.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. Our non-GAAP first quarter 2022 operating expenses were $86.6 million, up from $83.0 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2021. The differences between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are stock compensation expense, amortization of purchased intangibles and income or loss on an unfunded deferred compensation plan.  For the first quarter of 2022, compensation expense, including approximately $1.3 million charged to cost of goods sold was $39.8 million compared with $31.2 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2021.  Switching to bottom line. First quarter 2022 GAAP net income was $79.6 million or $1.65 per fully diluted share compared to $72.7 million or $1.51 per share in the fourth quarter of 2021. First quarter 2022 non-GAAP net income was $118.3 million or $2.45 per fully diluted share compared with $102.1 million or $2.12 per fully diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2021. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q1 2022 were 48.2 million.  Let's look of the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $775.1 million at the end of the first quarter of 2022 compared to $727.5 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2021. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $107.4 million compared with operating cash flow of $28.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. First quarter 2022 capital spending totaled $26.5 million.  Accounts receivable ended the first quarter of 2022 at $120.3 million or 29 days of sales outstanding, up 1 day from 28 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2021. Our internal inventories at the end of the first quarter of 2020 were $311.0 million, up from the $259.4 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2021. Days of inventory increased to 178 days at the end of Q1 2022 compared with 166 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2021.  Historically, we calculated days inventory on hand as a function of current quarter revenue. We believe comparing current inventory levels with the following quarter's projected revenue provides a better economic . On this basis, again, as you can see, days of inventory increased to 159 days at the end of the first quarter of 2022, up from 149 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2021.  I would now like to turn to our outlook for the second quarter of 2022. We are forecasting Q2 revenue to remain of $420 million to $440 million. We also expect to follow -- at gross margin in the range of 58.4% to 59.4%, non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 58.7% to 59.3%, GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses between $132.7 million and $136.7 million, non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to be in the range of $90.0 million to $92.0 million. This doesn't exclude stock compensation and litigation expenses.  Total stock-based compensation expense of $44.2 million to $46.2 million, including approximately $1.5 million that would be charged to cost of goods sold, litigation expenses ranging between $2.3 million and $2.7 million. Interest and other income is expected to range from $1.3 million to $1.7 million before foreign exchange gains or losses, fully diluted shares to be in the range of 47.8 million to 48.8 million shares.  In conclusion, we will continue to execute on our long-term plan for sustainable growth. I will now open the webinar up for questions.
A - Genevieve Cunningham: Thank you, Bernie, analysts. I would now like to begin our Q&A session. . Our first question is from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank.
Bernie Blegen: Ross is not there. Perhaps we can move on.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Alex Vechhi of William Blair.
Alex Vecchi: Congratulations on a great quarter in a tough environment. Maybe you can address a little bit the supply constraints in some of the China COVID impact. It seems like you guys came out from that completely unscathed, be interested in some of the dynamics that's allowed you to do that.
Michael Hsing: Well, Alex, we plan this kind of ramp not from last year from -- not from this year last year, many years ago. And as you remember, in 2017, even '16, we said that we're going to on greenfield products will grow and exactly we don't know at plus or minus a year or so. And so we plan every aspect, including logistics and staff, assembly house and our internal testing. And this is not a 1-year thing. We planned a long time ago. And now when the revenues rent is a little better than we anticipated. And so that's where you see the result.
Bernie Blegen: And if I can add to that, we've also built inventories so that in 178 days, we're just at the lower end of our goal of being between 180 and 200 days, which provides us a good insurance policy as we look ahead to achieving our numbers for the second half of the year.
Michael Hsing: Yes, even the end of the second half of 2019 in -- the business is not as great, but we built according to our plan, and we know the business will come. Our -- at that time, I remember, our inventory is over 200 days. And that part of it, inventories made us -- our customers feel a lot more long more reliable, like MPS as a major player.
Alex Vecchi: Okay. That's really helpful. And then maybe one for you, Bernie, just on gross margin. Margins have been very strong, as I believe. You've alluded to product mix. Just on that front, how much more runway do you think you have on the gross margin front from the uplift on sort of your new products going forward?
Bernie Blegen: Sure. As you've seen both in the results that we had for Q1, along with our guidance for Q2, which positions us around 59% gross margin, I think we've done a fair job of -- digesting is the incorrect word, but acknowledging the uplift in our margins as a result of our product mix. So again, I'll give the same answer I did last time that we believe that we've created a new floor gross margins once we can expand 10 to 20 basis points sequentially. But again, if opportunistically, we see a back set, which allows us to take it up another, we will be happy to take that.  I want to emphasize that, well, most of our peer companies have benefited both in terms of revenue growth and margin expansion from price increases, Ours has been driven primarily by the change in revenue mix, which is favoring these higher-value products. And it was only in February of this year we did a broad-based increase of our prices but that was still far below what the market has seen.
Michael Hsing: Just a pass on the cost to our customers. And as the margin expansion for our case, we said earlier, okay, setting in 2017 or '18, we don't have a headwind in -- by 2019. The, market slowed down a little bit and we built up a lot of some amortizations that -- in a production pipeline. So our margin went slightly lower, but it's not much lower. And now and you see this margin continued to grow.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Matt Ramsay of Cowen.
Matthew Ramsay: Can you guys hear me all right?
Michael Hsing: Yes.
Matthew Ramsay: Michael, I guess, for either one of you guys, it was interesting that you're breaking out sort of the data center piece from the PC and storage business. And I guess I wonder a couple of things about that, like what may be you our guys are trying to signal by breaking those out separately, in particular the new enterprise data segment is up, I don't know, 160% year-over-year, but that's really before the 2 primary server processor vendors launched with new sockets this year. So Michael, could you maybe talk a little bit about the reason for breaking that out and the relative growth rates you guys expect of these 2 new segments as we go forward?
Michael Hsing: If you combine all together, it's a kind of -- we're going to answer -- in the past, we answered those questions anyway and -- but when we reported on some numbers, and so which is more clear and publish you guys know it, have a less meaningful questions and any other reasons.
Bernie Blegen: I think, Matt, you did a good job of saying that this is clearly an inflection point for us, inflection year which will gain momentum as we see both Intel and AMD position for product releases are coming up here. So that, in addition to the expanding footprint we have in both 48-volt and artificial intelligence, we believe that this will be one of our areas for sustainable growth for certainly next 3 to 5 years. And exactly as Michael said, we believe that providing better transparency is definitely a better information for our investors.
Matthew Ramsay: Thanks to both for that. That's helpful. I guess if you look at the second quarter guidance that you provided, $430 million at the midpoint was quite a bit above where consensus was and certainly where my model was. Bernie, if you might take a second to walk us through by segment, how you're thinking about the growth being concentrated, that would be really helpful.
Bernie Blegen: I think that on a dollar or percent basis, we're going to see an accelerating ramp in enterprise, particularly during the second half of the year. I think we're going to see continued growth in our storage and computing albeit probably not at the same rate. Part of the reason for that is that storage tends to be a precursor at least from our experience to a data center ramp. So I think in each of the 2 prior quarters, we've seen a good, strong ramp in storage, and now we're expecting 2 to 3 quarters in the data center.  In the rest of the business, communications, as we said, we've broadened into not only 5G but also into satellite communications. And that's going to continue to be a driver for the foreseeable future. In the other areas, obviously, consumer, that is coming along, we emphasized Internet of Things but we -- actually, the growth there is broad-based.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham.
Nathaniel Bolton: Let me offer my congratulations as well. I wanted to come back to Alex' question about China. Obviously, you source most of your assembly and wafer capacity in China. And I just -- given the zero COVID policy in China and some of the resulting lockdowns, are you rethinking the need to diversify outside of China either on the assembly and test or assembly and wafer foundry side? And then I guess, a related question, I think most of your final test takes place in Chengdu, have you any contingency plans in place in case Chengdu is put under lockdown due to COVID?
Michael Hsing: Yes. We started a couple of years ago. We already started doing so. And as you know that China and manufacturing in Asia is the center of the work, and we can't debate too much or not if they have a serious problems, I think everybody worry about it, even the bigger things. And yes -- the answer is yes, okay. We already started and establish in a different clinical environment.
Nathaniel Bolton: In Chengdu, Michael, do you have test capacity outside of Chengdu, if Chengdu goes under lockdown?
Michael Hsing: Yes. As we're starting to about a couple of years ago, but maybe it's a little more than 12 months ago, we're starting.
Bernie Blegen: With the testing capacity in Chengdu. We've concentrated that on some of our higher value parts including automotive. And now as Michael just said is now we've started transition where we can actually have third parties. So we actually have a built-in contingency plan.
Michael Hsing: Yes, outside Chengdu only, yes, we have -- other than these high reliability product in retesting in our side. And other than that, okay, we do pretty high volumes if it's about half of it. It's in a different facility. When I talk about -- I just mentioned about it is outside China.
Nathaniel Bolton: Got it. Okay. And then my follow-up question is around the internal inventory level that you guys have done an absolutely fantastic job of increasing that in a very tight supply environment. I guess my question is, as you're approaching now the low end of your target range of 180 to 200 days, can you tell us what's going on with lead times? I would think as internal inventories get up to your target level, that may give you the ability to start to reduce lead times to potentially gain even more market share. But wondering if you could give us a sense of what's going on with lead times given that increase in internal inventory levels.
Michael Hsing: Our lead time is in this quarter is the same as the last quarter. So probably even our booking even -- I don't see anything. The rate of our booking is now reduced and Bernie, you said.
Bernie Blegen: And you took my answer on both ones that lead times have remained very consistent each in the last 3 quarters. And again, what you're seeing as far as the build of inventories has been a very conscious and deliberate decision to build the inventories in advance, particularly on the enterprise side, to meet the demand we expect for the second half of the year. And then I think that we've done a good job of positioning ourselves under what has now become uncertain environment.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from William Stein of Truist.
William Stein: Congrats on the very strong results, especially the outlook. We understand though that while we see a great number overall, in particular for the guidance, there's always moving parts when we look at it on a more detailed level. And I wonder if you're seeing either perhaps owing to customers focusing on getting balanced kits or full sets or however you want to call it or if you're seeing anything related to Ukraine or the lockdowns in China, whether any of these factors is influencing either the order rates or the backlog. For example, if none of these things were happening, the outlook would have been even stronger. Any qualification you can provide us would be helpful.
Michael Hsing: Yes. Well, MPS is like selling . And we are not a dominant application supply. We got something in a. -- I mean so whatever we ship is that these are the small part of the solutions. And so we don't know, okay? That's -- actually, that's our model. That's a billion. We don't know where these costs -- and so whether the wall effectiveness, okay, and we're very, very much diversified. We actually don't know it. And okay, they call you there.  So the -- to answer your questions, I mean, only things, yes, we do know where the product was the data centers. The product if it goes to a car, mean these are we're pretty much not a lot where the product ended up, okay. And other than that, we don't.
Bernie Blegen: Just reinforcing the answer from before, there is no significant KPI, whether it's in the bookings or any other area of our business that we're seeing a change over the past 2, 3 quarters. That's helpful.
William Stein: Bernie, you've talked about various levels of revenue that you could achieve at full utilization. In other words, the capacity that you're building for. I know they started couple of years ago. Well, I'm sure it's ongoing really. But the capacity and the upside that we've seen over the last few quarters, of course, those were not planned very quickly. They were planned a long time ago. Can you remind us or maybe update us on the medium to long-term capacity planning that's in place today? What levels of total capacity we can expect over the next few quarters?
Michael Hsing: Yes. That's a good question. I think that we answered the questions in last quarter, okay, we said that we're going to play in the $4 billion of revenues in the next couple of years. And so that's what we do and we continue to invest.
Bernie Blegen: Yes. And I think just to sort of lend some credibility to that, you recall about a year ago, that we offer by the end of Q2, in 2022, that would be at a $2 billion run rate. And with the guide that we have provided and the expectations ahead, I think that's a milestone that backs up the amount of visibility in our supply chain. So right now, the goal as Michael said, $4 billion.
Michael Hsing: Yes. If the demand is there in this year, we will do it, yes. What will do $2 billion, as we said in a couple of years ago. And we continue to see the demand in, and we see the demand will be there. Okay. This is not a one -- a short term, okay, things. And if it does not happen that year, that will happen the year after.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer.
Richard Schafer: I'll echo all the congratulations on other stellar quarter for you guys and outlook. If I could, my first question, I'm just kind of following up on the server breakout and obviously, a big ramp ahead for QSMod and cloud this year. I was curious kind of below that line a little bit, if there's any updates you could give us, like your 48 volt expectations this year or next?  And within that, I'm curious, I sort of assumed 48 volts virtually all AI accelerator for the next couple of years. But I'm curious when you see 48-volt sort of move into other areas like CPU or some broader markets like auto or industrial because I'm curious if you've looked at sort of what that 48-volt SAM looks like for MPS because it seems like an awful big opportunity.
Michael Hsing: Yes. 48 volts actually started in the automotive and also the silver and AI, okay, these CPUs. And for the 48 volts for the car, that's a different thing. but the same technologies. And also, we see these telecom areas, 48 volts, it's all standard and -- so now the 4Gs and the compliance with the 48 volts, again, we have a solution there. So there's a lot of areas we can grow.
Bernie Blegen: And I think that the 48 Volt, not only are we seeing the ramp, its adoption more broadly, but competitively, I would offer that we're very well positioned with some of the new technologies that we've rolled out and expect to roll out during the course of the next 18 months. So I think here again, we time our product releases pretty well with the inflection of this market opportunity.
Michael Hsing: Yes. And as we're talking with the product, the module is ramping, yes. So we provide -- we're providing whatever customer needs. We had a chip level on module level or solution levels.
Richard Schafer: Okay. And then maybe as my follow-up, just on 5G, I haven't asked the 5G question in a while. I mean you guys are engaged with the sort of the big 3 Tier 1 OEMs. And I just was curious if you can give us an update on your expectations. I know you flagged 5G here from 1Q results. So I'm curious what your expectations are for this year. And if there's any update you could give us on sort of how content compares with what you're seeing in server or data center and sort of how that ramp looks. And maybe if you could talk about how you quantify that opportunity in macro base station.
Bernie Blegen: The 5G is a relatively new market segment for us. So it's not like we can draw from our prior experience and calibrated up or down. We're sort of living a little hand to mouth on what demand looks like and how fast we're shipping. So we don't have a real good predictive model. What we talked to you about in the past has been that, again, we believe on a broad base, not only with as you referred to the top 3 but with a number of partners related to 5G infrastructure, we're providing content.  And while it's easy to look at the base station as a means of calculating out what the SAM is available to us. I think that we're also in fiber optic in the data center support for 5G as well as in the transceiver of the base station. And again, I think, as we pointed out, a lot of the initial technology that we're putting in is tending to be lower end and not necessarily specialized or adapted to 5G specifically.  So we don't have the same level of visibility on how it's being deployed, and we've used this strategy in the past with data center. We comment with lower dollar value content, build the relationships and then we're able to go to higher value content.
Michael Hsing: Let me say that we do have a custom design for each of the areas that Bernie said from fiber optics to all the single chain, all the way to transmitters. And we do have a customer design. And based on our standard product modules -- and these are the products. It's not really a low end. It can be, but these products can be used for any other telecom, which provide a building market, it provide power solutions for each of these blocks -- each of these categories. And we do see a lot of activity now in the revenues is ramping now.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Chris Caso of Raymond James.
Christopher Caso: I guess a question about the profile of revenue growth as we go through the year. And thus far, over the past several quarters, your revenue growth has been pretty broadly based, seeing growth in most segments. I know we've been speaking about and we've been anticipating for a while the server ramp as we get to the end of the year. But as we look through revenue in the next kind of 2, 3, 4 quarters, do you expect that revenue growth to continue to be broadly based, where you think this is going to be concentrated in any particular segments?
Michael Hsing: Well, the strategy is we're fired as many cylinders we can, okay? Whenever it grows, we grow, okay? And I think that's the strength among the diversifications. And in the next few quarters, we see the demand even for 2023 and '24, and these are pretty much similar, okay? We don't see that much of a difference.  And one thing we see it, okay, they -- we -- our customers demand more high-value product, which means they can easily adopt in ease of use and a much higher efficiency product and an energy using efficiency product. And so these are much better for us. Instead of our customer do lot development work, we do a lot of development work for our -- we develop the solution for our customers. So that means a higher dollar amount -- a higher dollar content. And so that's really we see that as only difference.
Christopher Caso: Got it. My follow-up question is about the impact of some of the China lockdowns and not from your production side but rather from your customer side. And what we heard from some others or at least one other is that part of the challenges in China right now are customers having facilities that are closed or that freight forwarders simply unwilling to accept product because of some of the logistics challenges that are going on right now. Is that something you're facing as well? And is there any impact on your revenue right now, which might mean some of those issues get solved, that some of that goes into the second half of the year?
Michael Hsing: Absolutely hit us. And don't get me wrong. Even though we grow this much, if we were not that problem, so we ship a whole lot more but we just have -- we anticipated that a little better. So we can still roll in our -- one of our models, can mean there's not much of our model. And for the portion is above our model, even a year, 2 years and again.  And on the other hand, in -- other than our logistics and production limitations, our customers, they have a mix, too. And clearly, you see the auto business. I mean we have less problem of shipping product than other suppliers. So -- and you can't speculate in okay, because of in limited or -- they are buying -- they're purchasing of our product and for because they miss other parts.
Bernie Blegen: And I think that we continue to be very resilient under a number of environmental circumstances. Part of that is the planning that we've set 3, 4 years ago, and some of it is how diversified long is and some of it is how adaptive we can be in the moment. So again, we did acknowledge the impact our customer supply chain affecting us, but I wouldn't say that, that is a pronounced element and we're continuing to monitor it.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Tore Svanberg of Stifel Nicolaus.
Tore Svanberg: Congratulations on another record quarter, quite stunning. First question is on long-term growth. So you grew more than 40% last year. It looks like you're on track to growing another 40% this year at least. Michael, in the past, you've said there's no reason why you can't accelerate growth even though you have higher revenues.
Michael Hsing: You remember that. That's good.
Tore Svanberg: So I'm just trying to understand what you think about long-term growth at this point. Is 40% the right number? I know you're probably not going to commit to a number, but yes, anything you can add on that would be great.
Michael Hsing: Yes. Okay, as always said, okay, about a few minutes ago, I said that our customers even demands the more higher value product, can be in a solution kind of related products, not they wanted a low their engineering effort to MPS. And I see that opportunity is the opportunities for accelerated growth because think about it, if it's MPS, we don't make any and we're just only testing the final control -- quality control.  And that can apply to anything else. And I apply to models, apply tools okay, applied to any other solutions at all, but it's all related to power all related to OEM. And so from now on, you will see MPS, okay, we provide plug-and-play solution for all kind of robotics, for industrial automation and for building controls. And those type of product and -- which has a lot higher ASPs, we buy those components or we specify those components and we incorporate to our solutions. So the unit price will be much higher.  And now it's how fast we can put all these solutions together and turn it into a meaningful revenue. And that, I can't predict. And then you have that product, a lot of knowledges too. Now at the same time, MPS is a semiconductor chip business, keep growing. So I don't see in the near term in the next year or so. I don't see any slowdown, and it's actually accelerated.  And so to the other model is at the very infancies. And if you go 3 or 4, 5 years from now, I think as we will be real solution companies like silicon semiconductor is only a part of it out in the total content. So I want to grow more. I've seen more than $10 billion of companies, I mean $10 billion, $15 billion company, and there is no reason why not?
Tore Svanberg: That's great perspective, Michael. As my follow-up, I wasn't aware you had a lot of traction in the sat comm market. I was just hoping you could add a little bit more color there, what types of applications, what are some of the strengths the company has today in that market. And are you continuing to introduce new products? Because that's -- to me, it's obviously a very high-margin business, right, but it's also a very difficult market to crack into.
Michael Hsing: Yes. It's or committed to sell our communications and not only in the cell like self the grand station there's a huge amount. There's new standards, and again, there's a lot of new activities in that. And we designed it into a few years ago. And mostly, it's a power modules. And also, we have related to these in the cell and I mean this a controlled the solar panels and also a lot of power box. And I think the value in this is so -- this is everywhere, okay -- and these are for antenna to powering up the antenna to power the receivers and also all the way down to the user interface, and we all benefit from.
Tore Svanberg: Excellent. Very good. Congratulations again.
Michael Hsing: Thank you.
Bernie Blegen: Thanks.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore: Can you guys hear me this time?
Michael Hsing: Yes, Ross, you're there.
Ross Seymore: I've been here the whole time. I'm glad that we got it to work. So I guess the first question is a longer-term one, then I'll follow up with a shorter-term one. Michael, you talked many times on tonight's call about moving up the value chain, adding more value. Customers want to use Monolithic for more and more. And in the past, that's going from kind of the second or third tier folks in various markets up to the first tier. So really what I want to get at is, are you seeing evidence of moving up to higher and higher value customers? And does the fact that you didn't raise prices as much as your peers and that you had availability, is that giving you longer-term design wins, higher value design wins? Anything you could do to quantify that dynamic?
Michael Hsing: I don't know how to qualify that, okay, because we don't -- we didn't really -- we didn't increase the price, okay, for those customers the first tier, the value the strategic customers because this prices are negotiated way before that. And we have the audit. And so we always said what we do. It's what we said what we do, okay? So we have to honor that.  And I think that also is a part of MPS branding and so that benefits the for long term. And for other high-value customers or high-value products and it's sporadic. This is the very beginning, a lot of customers don't even know or you offer these solutions but you offer that the entire solutions and -- so they don't even know that, okay. MPS is just starting to. And that actually relates to a few years ago, we said that we're going to do e-commerce, okay? We do e-commerce plug-and-play, programmable, all these things. And these are all related.  And so we do solar only for large customers, and I said we're a satellite company. We have the EV companies. We have a day 1 MPS, do a lot more or even the data centers and the demand of all these, we provide the entire unit. And they don't have to design it. So that's actually a across the board. I just named a few. But revenue is still small. We're starting.
Ross Seymore: And for my follow-up, a near-term question, Bernie, this could either be both revenues and/or the gross margin and your answer on this, and it's really about the mix. You've talked about the gross margin rising because of mix and new products being the driver of that. So if I look at the industrial and automotive businesses, the last couple of quarters, they're great year-over-year, but they've been flat to a little bit down sequentially for the last 6 months or so. Is there anything going on in that business? Is it just lumpiness? Is it waiting for some design wins?  And on the mix side of that equation for gross margin, I think most people believe those could be some of the more accretive areas. So how is the mix such a positive for your gross margin if the 2 areas that are supposed to be the highest margins are actually slightly underperforming the others?
Michael Hsing: Makes sense. That was good question.
Bernie Blegen: Let me reference wehat Michael said earlier. It's the power of our model of diversification of the end markets. And if you go back to the performance, the revenue performance that we demonstrated in industrial and automotive last year, they were leaders in our growth drivers. In the current year and reflected what's the health of the 2 end markets, it really came down to it being the timing of shipments.  So we believe that as far as the design rules that are coming in, that we don't believe that we overshipped them to the extent that that's going to cause us a problem. The orders on the book remained incredibly positive. So again, it's just -- it's more different to quarter-over-quarter as opposed to anything fundamentally different about the market.
Michael Hsing: And also, one of the questions is why the margin goes up and if these are 2 segments go sideways, okay? I mean the year-to-year -- year-over-year growth, I mean, if you look at it from a Q3 last year to now, those segments -- that contributes a lot of margins, okay, gross margins.  And the other segments, like consumers, I mean we phased out and there can be this not on the last year. So maybe the year, beginning of the last year. When the capacity gets issues, as you know, we always phase out these lower margin. That's another part of it. And -- but overall, the greenfield products drive the margins.
Bernie Blegen: And just to add to Michael's point, as far as phasing out lower margin business, we're trying to rationalize our wafer starts to capture the largest opportunity. And as a result, some of the lower-margin business that we would have used to have in our portfolio, we haven't emphasized that in our production planning. It's just not there as a component of our business like it has been historically.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Hans Mosesmann from Rosenblatt.
Hans Mosesmann: Congratulations, like everybody else has mentioned. Good stuff. I have 2 questions. Michael, if we were to split 48 volts as an opportunity. So I'm thinking it getting 48 volts to the rack in your data center and within the rack, getting that 48 volts to the board and every board has to deal with the accelerators and there's power issues there. So there's 3 touch points. If that's the way to look at it, what is the opportunity for each? And where would you be seeing the first incremental business for 48 volts for MPS?
Michael Hsing: I think it's the solution, yes, you're right, okay? And then now the question is does depend on applications, 48 volts, down to 12 volts, down to directly to 1.2 volts. That's at the last part, okay, we don't do that and our customers -- and there's the few providers of the solution is not come -- and so we play in the market. I mean it's not to 12, 48 convert to 12 and convert 5 -- 4 or 5 volts, okay? That's the market we played. We came in and it's open builder materials. Everybody else can jump into it. And we -- so our competitor provides a similar solution.  And so that kind of -- we know this is the application, but which one, we don't know. Which one is hard to tell. All these high current products, and you probably know more than I do, okay, goes to 600 watt to 1,000 watts and even some of the couple of 1,000 watts. You see these are all MPS solutions now and these are -- the higher wattage you go, the volts get smaller.  And so in the coming years and those accelerate the costs, okay, the population in the data centers. And that's where you see it. These are 48 volts that convert to 12. And then you have a new solutions that we provide so you can to a firewall. So okay, an increase close to 1% of efficiency, which is a lot.
Hans Mosesmann: That was very helpful, Michael. My follow-on, just to end this, what is the view of the PC market for MPS? I think Intel mentioned that the low end of the PC market is weak, but the other parts are okay. What's your view to the degree that you have participation there?
Michael Hsing: Yes. We obviously -- okay, and we do well. And we do PCs and case PC, the commercial PCs, that even the low end of business from OEs. And -- but for us, it's a very opportunistic because we have a product developed for server. And without much of an engineering effort, we can spin off to do other products. We did a product for commercial PC and for commercial norms.  And on the other end, we do battery management. We do actually panel. And -- pretty much, we can offer an mobile solutions other than memories, other than the CPUs. And so that's -- it's very opportunistic. And we -- currently, we see the demand is very strong.
Bernie Blegen: Yes. And just to add to that, Michael, is we have a very good footprint in the commercial side. And because we have so many different client offerings, what we're seeing is being able to sell additional content into those same platforms.
Genevieve Cunningham: . As there are no further questions, I would now like to turn the webinar back over to Bernie.
Bernie Blegen: Great. Thanks, Gen. I'd like to thank you all for joining us on the Q1 2022 earnings webinar. I look forward to talking to you again during our second quarter conference call, which we would like to be in July. Thank you, and have a nice day.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-02-10 17:00:00) =====
Genevieve Cunningham: Welcome, everyone, to the MPS Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Webinar. Please note that this webinar is being recorded and will be archived for one year on our Investor Relations page at www.monolithicpower.com. My name is Genevieve Cunningham, and I will be the moderator for this webinar. Joining me today are Michael Hsing, as CEO and Founder of MPS; and Bernie Blegen, VP and CFO. In the course of today’s conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management’s current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q4 earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on March 1, 2021, and Form 10-Q filed on November 8, 2021, both which are accessible through our website. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today’s call. We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, R&D and SG&A expense, operating income, other income, income before income taxes, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our Q4 and full year 2021 earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC and is currently available on our website. I’d also like to remind you that today’s conference call is being webcast live over the internet and will be available for replay on our website for one year along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. Now, I’d like to turn the call over to Bernie Blegen.
Bernie Blegen: Thanks, Jen. In 2021, MPS surpassed the $1 billion revenue milestone by achieving record full year revenue $1.2 billion, 43.0% higher than the prior year. This performance represented consistent execution against our strategies and being recognized by more first tiered companies for our superior technologies, product quality and excellent customer support. As we see more highly – high quality growth opportunities ahead of us, we continue to invest in our infrastructure and operational capabilities. In 2021, MPS grew capacity by 40% and we are on track to expand capacity in 2022, well beyond $2 billion allowing the company to successfully ramp new product revenue and achieve strategic market share gains. Here are a few highlights, which we achieved in 2021. Brought online a new 8 inch fab and continued to qualify parts in the 12 inch fab, we brought online in 2020. We will continue to invest in growing fab and assembly capacity. We design processor cores and MCU technology into products requiring more sophisticated power solutions such as USB power delivery, smart motor drives, and high power electrification. Our first prototype of a high precision analog digital converter product for medical applications achieved outstanding silicon performance and lab evaluations. We have started customer sampling in Q1 2022. Validation of this technology is a strong first step in developing a new business segment supporting both industrial and infrastructure end market applications. We believe new product revenue from a large number of previously released designs will ramp in 2022. The representative sample includes product supporting applications in VR14, 5G, BMS, ADAS, AI, USB PD, DDR, and many more. Turning to our full year 2021 revenue by market segment compared to 2020, automotive revenue was up 87.5% computing and storage revenue up 47.0%, industrial revenue up 54.5%, consumer revenue up 28.1% and communications revenue up 15.3% demonstrating just how broad based our full year 2021 revenue improvement was. Automotive revenue grew $95.4 million to $204.3 million in 2021. This 87.5% year-over-year gain primarily represented increased sales of our highly integrated applications supporting the digital cockpit, automotive – automated driver assistance systems and connectivity. Automotive revenue represented 16.9% of MPS’ full year 2021 revenue compared with 12.9% in 2020. Full year 2021 computing and storage revenue grew $119.1 million over the prior year to $372.3 million. This 47.0% increase primarily resulted from strong sales growth for enterprise notebooks, cloud computing and storage applications. Computing and storage revenue represented 30.8% of MPS’ of revenue in 2021, compared with 30.0% in 2020. Industrial revenue grew $65.2 million to $184.8 million in 2021. This 54.5% year-over-year increase was broad based with each our primary product lines enjoying better than double-digit revenue growth. Industrial revenue represented 15.3% of MPS’ full year 2021 revenue, compared with 14.2% in 2020. Consumer revenue grew $61.9 million to $282.3 million reflecting increased product sales for home appliances and smart TVs. Consumer revenue represented 23.4% of MPS’ full year 2021 revenue, compared with 26.1% in 2020. Communications revenue grew $21.8 million to $164.1 million. This 15.3% improvement reflected higher sales of products for both infrastructure and wireless riders and gateway applications. Communications revenue represented 13.6% of our 2021 revenue, compared with 16.9% in 2020. Switching to Q4. MPS had a record fourth quarter with revenue of $336.5 million, 4.0% higher than revenue generated in the third quarter of 2021 and 44.4% higher than the comparable quarter in 2020. By market segment, revenue for computing and storage grew 91.6% year-over-year, communication grew 54.7%, automotive grew 43.2%, industrial grew 33.3% and consumer grew 1.9%. Fourth quarter 2021 GAAP gross margin was 57.6%. Same as third quarter 2021 and 230 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2020. Our GAAP operating income was $78.6 million compared to $77.1 million reported in the third quarter of 2021 and $40.0 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2020. Fourth quarter 2021 non-GAAP gross margin was 57.9%, 10 basis points higher than the third quarter of 2021 and 220 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2020. The year-over-year expansion in fourth quarter, non-GAAP gross margin was largely due to a shift in sales mix, favoring high value greenfield products and operational efficiency gains, which more than offset higher product input costs. MPS achieved noteworthy market share gains in 2021 due in large measure to product availability and discipline sales price management. Our non-GAAP operating income was $112.0 million compared to $108.4 million reported in the prior quarter and $66.3 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2020. Let’s review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $115.3 million in the fourth quarter compared with $109.2 million in the third quarter of 2021 and $88.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Our non-GAAP fourth quarter 2021 operating expenses were $83.0 million up from the $78.7 we spent in the third quarter of 2021, and up from $63.6 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2020. On both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis, fourth quarter 2021 litigation expense was a credit balance of $420,000 compared with a $3.4 million expense in Q3 2021 and a $1.5 million expense in Q4 2020. The credit balance in fourth quarter 2021 litigation expense reflected it an IP settlement refund of a legal retainer and lower than anticipated fees. The differences between GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are stock compensation expense, and income or loss from an unfunded deferred compensation plan. Fourth quarter 2021 stock compensation expense including $921,000 charged to cost of goods sold was $31.2 million compared with $31.6 million recorded in the third quarter of 2021. Switching to the bottom line. Fourth quarter 2021 GAAP net income was 77 – $72.7 million or $1.51 per fully diluted share compared with $1.44 per share in the third quarter of 2021 and $0.90 per share in the fourth quarter of 2020. Q4 2021 non-GAAP net income was $102.1 million or $2.12 per fully diluted share, compared with of $2.06 per share in the third quarter of 2021 and $1.31 per share in the fourth quarter of 2020. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q4 2021 will $48.2 million. Now let’s look at the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2021 cash, cash equivalence and investments totaled $727.5 million compared to $744.5 million at the end of the third quarter of 2021. For the fourth quarter of 2021, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $28.2 million compared with Q3 2021 operating cash flow of $117.8 million. The between quarter drop in operating cash flow primarily reflected a $51.3 million increase in inventory and higher accounts receivable. Fourth quarter 2021 capital spending totaled $17.6 million. Accounts receivable end of the fourth quarter of 2021 at $104.8 million or 28 days of sales outstanding compared with the $79.9 million or 22 days of sales outstanding reported at the end of the third quarter of 2021 and the $66.8 million or 26 days reported at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020. Our internal inventories at the end of the fourth quarter of 2021 were $259.4 million up from the $208.1 million at the end of the third quarter of 2021. Calculated on a basis consistent with our past practice and as you can see from the webinar video, days of inventory rose to 166 days at the end of Q4 2021 from the 134 days at the end of the third quarter of 2021. Historically, we’ve calculated days of inventory on hand as a function of the current quarter revenue. We believe comparing current inventory levels with the following quarter’s revenue provides better economic match. On this basis, again, we can see days of inventory increased to 152 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2021 from 133 days at the end of the third quarter of 2021. I would now like to turn to our Q1 2022 outlook. We are forecasting Q1 2022 revenue in the range of $354 million to $366 million. We also expect the following. GAAP gross margin in the range of 57.4% to 58.0%. Non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 57.7% to 58.3%. Total stock based compensation expense of $36.9 million to $38.9 million, including approximately $1.1 million that would be charged to cost of goods sold. GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses between $119.2 million and $123.2 million. Non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to be in the range of $83.4 million and $85.4 million. This estimate excludes stock compensation and litigation expenses. Litigation expenses to be in the range of $2.3 million to $2.7 million. Interest income is expected to range from $1.0 million to $1.4 million before foreign exchange gains or losses. Fully diluted shares to be in the range of 47.8 million to 48.8 million shares. Finally, I’m pleased to announce a 25% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.75 per share from $0.60 per share for stockholders of record as of March 31 2022. In conclusions, MPS’ strong financial performance in 2021 was largely due to a 40% increase in fab and assembly capacity, which supported our high-value, greenfield-product, revenue ramp. Looking ahead, MPS is on track to expand capacity in 2022 well beyond $2 billion, allowing the company to successfully ramp new product revenue and achieve strategic market share gains in 2023, 2024 and beyond.
A - Genevieve Cunningham: Thank you, Bernie. Analysts, I would now like to begin our Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Tore Svanberg of Stifel Nicolaus. Tore, your line is now open.
Tore Svanberg: Yes. Thank you. And congratulations on the very, very strong results. So I’m going to ask this question differently. Usually, people ask you how come you carry so much inventory, this time I’m going to ask you, how were you able to actually get your inventory there’s that high. How are you both finding the capacity and again being able to build the inventory in spite of this very, very tight environment we’re seeing in the industry?
Michael Hsing: Well, as you know, in this business, building a inventory a qualifier fab, okay. These are now one day, two day things, enough short-term. These all we planted a few years ago. And now we are cut just the opportunity presents it and we just catch it. And nothing was short terms and okay, we couldn’t – we don’t have a crystal ball for the futures and we just react, we just plan ahead and react as fast as we can.
Bernie Blegen: And I think to add to that, that shows that we have a lot of inventory on hand that presents the capacity to allow us for sales in the next two quarters. So what we’ve done is made conscious investments in inventory, in the supply chain. And what we’re trying to do is manage such that we hold the inventory, we’re still keeping channel in the – channel inventory lean. And we’re trying to make sure to the best of our abilities that we’re in touch with the inventories that our customers are keeping. So they’re likewise lean.
Michael Hsing: Yes. I also want to add and okay, as you remember and a few years ago, and I talk about it. MPS is going for well beyond million or a couple million dollars. And I wasn’t joking and we plan ahead for our business. That’s what we saw a few years ago and now you grow this much is, of course, we didn’t expect that. But we do have a capacities and okay – and we do have to do some creative ways in the scrambling to get to 45%. And so that’s all that is, like, it wasn’t – we don’t have a magic tricks and then in the last six months or so.
Bernie Blegen: And it’s good as you have note – as Michael noted, we crossed the $1 billion revenue threshold and our revenue growth rate is accelerated from historic precedent.
Tore Svanberg: Yes. Well done. As my follow-up question, could you just add a little bit more color on the $2 billion worth of capacity? You’ve talked about now, ramping in on 8-inch, you’re also qualifying products on 12-inch. Will there actually be 12-inch product sales this year?
Michael Hsing: Yes. We’re qualifying, as you know, so MPS don’t build a fab. And we don’t have a lot of capital spendings and again, but we do have a increase all these capacity qualifier fabs, that cost money. And so to answer your questions, like, and we do transitions – nowadays. Okay. We get all this capacity whether it is 12-inch or 8-inch as much as we can.
Bernie Blegen: And just add to that, that was our second 12-inch fab that we brought online in 2020.
Michael Hsing: Yes.
Tore Svanberg: Right. Very good. I’ll go back in line. Thank you and congrats again.
Michael Hsing: Okay. Thank you.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question comes from William Stein of Truist. William, your line is now open.
William Stein: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the odd popping results and outlook. I want to ask about the module business that you’ve spoken about in the past, this thing that might even accelerate growth further over time. I’m wondering what percentage of revenue modules contributes today and how we should think about the trajectory of that business. And if you could also comment on any potential tuck-in acquisitions that were either executed or contemplated for in the future to fulfill your strategy in that area. Thank you.
Michael Hsing: Yes. Okay. I’m glad you asked the question, the module business I think it’s a side of a 10% for this year.
Bernie Blegen: It’s actually mid single digits.
Michael Hsing: Okay. Yes, yes. And so you can quantify as a much more accurately. Okay. I don’t know the others of numbers in detail. All I know is, and okay, we grow 100% every years in the last couple years. And now you using the word accelerating this years and the next couple years, that’s what I see it now. And the other things, okay, the second part of your questions about acquisitions for the tuck-in technology or to enhance our future growth on the – using our MPS technology for those companies. Yes. We are engaged with handful – as a handful of a company, like, more than six companies and we’re – so far we’re engaging with it and nothing we – nothing materials lies. We should announce it now.
William Stein: Thank you.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Alex Vecchi of William Blair. Alex, your line is now open.
Alex Vecchi: Thanks for taking my question. And I echo the congratulations on the outstanding results. Just maybe to expand on Tore’s question with regards to the capacity expansion from $2 billion on, can you quantify how much more capacity do you think you’ll be adding in the next year or two or three or the right way to think about it? I think in the past, you’ve alluded to the fact that the current product portfolio can support upwards of $3 billion to $4 billion in revenues. So is that sort of the right way to think about the long-term trajectory?
Michael Hsing: Yes. That’s absolutely correct. And for the semiconductors, yes, we have to have a fab capacities for that kind of revenues. But even going the features, because we’re selling more high-dollar modules and solutions and which utilizes silicons even less. So we have – we should have – we shouldn’t – and our CIMIC wafer capacity even so will be less factors.
Alex Vecchi: That’s actually really helpful. And then similarly with the comments on – in terms of the segment breakdown, the Storage and Compute segment was very strong in the quarter. And I think you’ve talked a little bit about enterprise notebooks. It seems like that’s one of the areas, notebooks in general, where there’s a little investor trepidation going forward. Can you maybe talk about what the opportunity there is and – or maybe what the SAM is for your notebook outlook over the next few years?
Bernie Blegen: Sure. I think it’s important to qualify that the growth that we’ve experienced, in particular over the last two, three years, has really been at the enterprise level, where we’re selling into units that would retail for above $1,200. And we’ve been very successful as far as capturing a large part of market share that really is not necessarily driven by consumer trends. So they’re not as prone to the downward unit numbers that are being projected for notebooks.
Michael Hsing: Yes. Overall, we want to achieve a balanced growth. We don’t want to be known as a notebook company. And that’s MPS’ strategy is diversify the growth.
Bernie Blegen: And just to pick up on Michael’s point, we saw a very strong uptick in our cloud and server business, particularly in Q4, which we expect to continue to ramp into 2022.
Michael Hsing: Overall, the notebook revenue is very, very – is a single digit now.
Alex Vecchi: Okay. Thank you. With that, I’ll hop back into queue.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham. Quinn, your line is now open.
Quinn Bolton: Hey, guys. I offer my congratulations as well. Bernie and Michael, I’m surprised you haven’t gotten the question yet, but I followed the company for a long time. I think this is the biggest gross margin beat you guys may have ever put up. If I got my numbers right, you beat gross margin by 130 basis points in this quarter. Looking back to the third quarter, I think you had a $4 million litigation revenue in the number that drove strength in gross margin, but that was clearly a onetime issue. So can you talk first about what drove the strength in gross margins and you’re guiding them effectively flat, up 10 basis points technically in the first quarter. So it looks like that margin strength continues. Can you just talk about gross margin?
Bernie Blegen: Sure. We tried to reflect on that a little bit in the prepared comments, where I indicated that we’re benefiting right now by a more favorable shift in our product mix, which is higher margins on the new greenfield business, but also operational efficiencies. As far as we indicated earlier, the percentage of silicon that’s coming from 12-inch, but also is a reflection of our improved quality standards. So I think that as we’ve reflected on what the sustainable margin going forward that we’ve offered sort of a new floor, which we look to grow again 10 to 20 basis points sequentially, although obviously, we’ll keep our eyes open if there is an opportunity to have another step-up.
Michael Hsing: If there’s another side, okay. A few years ago, we talked about a greenfield product. And then you actually, I remember, asked, there is no headwind in – is there any headwind in the gross margins. So the answer was all these new products, greenfield product will aim at the high-end products and high values. And so the gross margin should be better. So this time, we didn’t increase the price that much. We pretty much passed the cost to our customers or not even passed to our customers. But as Bernie said, shifted to 12-inch and also the internal efficiency improvement. And with a high gross margin product, that is the majority of the gross margin improvement.
Quinn Bolton: Got it. And as a follow-on, for two quarters now, you’ve seen a pretty nice increase in your internal inventory levels. Wondering if you could just comment, as you’re building that internal inventory, how much of that is for new greenfield products versus, say, the run rate business?
Michael Hsing: Clearly, we shifted away from a consumer side. And so that we allocated a lot of products for these high-end targeted – MPS targeted market segment. So we grow the inventories for those segments.
Bernie Blegen: I think something to add there is that we do have some high-volume business, and we’re treating that as a run rate. So we’re – it’s probably the area that has the tightest capacity. But where we have these new products, the greenfield opportunities, we have new customers and new markets as an insurance policy to make sure that they’re perceived very positively and that we can cover upside potential. We have been building inventory to support that. And I think that’s been reflected very well as far as the customer acceptance of the new products as well as market share gains afforded by appropriate inventory levels.
Quinn Bolton: Got it. Thank you.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Ross, your line is now open.
Ross Seymore: I’ll echo the congrats. I wanted to follow-up on the second half of your answer to Quinn’s question there, Bernie. And in the past, you guys have always gained market share and very consistently so. This year was – well, this past year was no different. But you also had significantly greater availability than your competition. So I just wanted to see what the client or the customer relationship, how that’s been enhanced because of the availability. Do you believe that the wins you’ve gotten from availability will lead to sticky relationships going forward? You mentioned moving up into kind of first tier customer base. I’m just trying to figure out the sustainability of the revenue growth because of that availability dynamic?
Michael Hsing: That’s a very, very good question. So okay, how do we grow like 45% over – close to a $1 billion base, okay? Well, you think about it, okay, all these products that we released in greenfield products and these two first-tier customers. And usually, these are large customers that they’re ramping a new supply very carefully. So they don’t allocate a large percentage. They always have a second source. And now we have shortage everywhere. MPS have capacities. So everything shifted to MPS. That’s one factor. And the second factor is that we talk about MPS products are more programmable and our customers find out before they care less. And now they find out, our product – single product can do multiple purpose and that contributes in other factors. And so we can replace and we can – shortly, we designed – our customers redesign and the source out to adopt the MPS solutions. So – but these two points is very sticky, especially the second point, and our MPS products are more programmable, and they enjoy that. And they solve their problems and they realize the values. And so I would say they’re very sticky.
Ross Seymore: Great. And I guess as my follow-up question, I thought you talked about another greenfield opportunity, which is a huge part of the analog market which is getting into the converter side of things. Can you just talk a little bit about your aspirations there, some of the applications you’re going after? And what sort of opportunity you see unfolding in that?
Michael Hsing: Yes. We just – we did – we do have a silicon [indiscernible] and the performance is outstanding. And these are the new market segments, and these are purely in a single side, which we never have. These are internally developed. We have a group of people and they have a lot of experience, and that’s a new market segment for us. So the focus will be the communications and also medical applications, like imaging, x-rays and ultrasounds and those type of things.
Bernie Blegen: And just to add, as far as the characteristics of this technology, there are not a lot of companies that have been successful with this. And the ones that have, have carved out pretty exclusive markets. And as a result of that, they command very high gross margins. So we look to be a new market entrant, but also with a very – a big competitive advantage.
Michael Hsing: Yes. So it’s – yes, it is a milestone for MPS. As so-called high-performance analog company, they tried it and they achieved a mediocre result. And now, see what we can do. And we do have a product and so for the next couple of years, and we’ll see what we can do.
Ross Seymore: Thank you.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Chris Caso from Raymond James. Chris, your line is now open.
Chris Caso: Yes, thank you. For my first question, talk a little bit about seasonality. And obviously, the Q1 results are better than what we normally expect in a seasonal Q1, and I suspect that’s because of some of the capacity additions that you’re bringing on. Can you talk about these capacity additions as we go through the year? Are they brought in, in the road to the $2 billion revenue level? At capacity level, is that going to come on fairly evenly during the year? Is there a step up at some point? And then when that happens, do you think that you will be fully able to meet your customer requirements presumably this year?
Bernie Blegen: Chris, I think you get credit for three questions there. Hopefully, I’ll be able to keep the thread going. The first issue had to do with seasonality and generally speaking, from Q4 to Q1, we observed a modest dip. In fact, because we have such an imbalance, an unprecedented demand supply and balance, that in fact seasonality is not as much a function today as opposed to your second question, which has to do with product availability. And that’s sort of the gating item for how fast a company can grow. And as Michael pointed out earlier is that as part of our company, we’ve always built capacity alongside the development of our new products. So we, in fact, got out in front of this upsurge in the market and have been able to participate and, in fact, accelerate our capacity build out. And that’s really a reflection of how we’re looking at 2022. But I think that one thing that we’ve always done is we’ve had to make intelligent decisions many years ahead of when the capacity has been needed. So in fact, we’re in discussions in order to be able to get capacity for 2023, 2024 and beyond. And we feel very secure in what we’re capable of doing in 2022.
Michael Hsing: Well, to answer your questions, honestly, if it gives us another 50% growth for this year, we’ll be in trouble. Okay.
Chris Caso: Okay. I think that will be welcome trouble if that were the case.
Michael Hsing: Yes.
Chris Caso: I’ll take liberty to ask one more that you were nice enough to answer, Mike and Bernie, which is with regard to pricing. And Bernie, you made a comment on the call, you spoke about disciplined sales price management as I think how you termed it. Could you explain what that means and the extent to which pricing has been a contributor to year-on-year growth and whether that’s something that’s in the rearview mirror where you’d expect to continue to increase?
Bernie Blegen: I think that most people have recognized within the semiconductors and even specific to analog that, that created an opportunity for many companies to affect price increases with their customers. And a lot of them implemented that as early as Q1 of this year. We showed – we made a conscious decision not to increase our prices on a broad base or selective market opportunities, but broadly, we did not. And we did that along with having a product availability as a means of being able to secure a higher level of market share. And so now as we look at 2022, we are going to implement selective but more broad-based price increases, but they will be at a more modest level than some of our peer companies have implemented.
Michael Hsing: Yes, when we look at it, we invest in our customers for the future growth and for the future opportunities. And – but we do have a modest gross margin expansions as our model, okay. We keep saying it, and we have a steady state growth in every segment.
Chris Caso: Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer. Rick, your line is now open.
Rick Schafer: Hi, thanks and look – my congratulations guys on the next quarter, another nice quarter. Maybe if I could, just a quick question on 5G. I mean you guys have talked in the past about 5G as a pretty significant opportunity for MPS. I think, Michael, I think you said potentially hundreds of dollars of potential content there, sort of similar to server or data center cloud for you guys. So I don’t know if you could give us any update on design momentum since or when the revenue contribution might sort of start to inflect if that’s still kind of the second half of this year? And I’m curious, as part of that question, are you going to see QSMOD sort of be part of that initial ramp this year? Or is it going to be more sort of point of load ECUs sort of how you began during your journey in server. If you could give any color there, that would be great.
Michael Hsing: Yes. So to answer your first part of the question first, like I mean in the 5Gs, and I give is actually 5G – a lot of products in – especially in the high current side all relate to QSMOD. And similar technology-based product, again, we power up the 5Gs in all areas and from a single size and all the way to transmitters. And we don’t see a very high rate of ramping. And so they’re still steady state. And the other question is QSMOD so like I mean for the data centers. We are – this year, okay, we have to say we occupy is that still less than a single-digit of a total percentage of the total 10 of the market. But the significance is from almost nothing and to a high end of a single-digit. And earlier I said that if we don’t occupy the 30% of the market, we should not be in the business. So we still have a lot of room to grow.
Bernie Blegen: And Michael, with the release of VR14 that we’re in a very good inflection point on the – in the cloud and in the data center.
Rick Schafer: Yes. And Michael, just to follow that, but it took, I think, about three or four years to sort of get point of load need you share today, which I think is about 30%. So I think are you saying that’s sort of a good proxy for QSMOD could be in the next couple of years?
Michael Hsing: Yes. Okay. Yes. So let’s take actually longer than that, more than three or four years. And I was wondering why it so long within – in the early days, I’ll say that we could grow very quickly. I didn’t know what I was talking about, okay? And for the next, as Bernie mentioned, the VR14s, and VR13.5 sort of MPS accepted as other players, okay? And VR14s, I think, we have pretty good shares to start to ramp, but it’s not happening now, and sometimes this year, right?
Bernie Blegen: Yes. VR13 has been delayed again, it’s more likely to be Q3.
Michael Hsing: Yes, yes, yes.
Bernie Blegen: But you are right, we’ve observed in Q4 an uplift as a result of 13.5.
Michael Hsing: Yes, yes. Okay.
Rick Schafer: Thanks. And if I could ask just a follow-up to Bernie probably. I just wanted to ask, I’ve been asked in a long time. Balance sheet looks great, obviously. I was just curious if you could give us an update on use of cash going forward. I mean, obviously, you’ve done a really good job of investing in future growth and R&D, but I’m just curious how much you need to run the business here and feed R&D, et cetera? Thanks.
Bernie Blegen: Yes. And it’s a great question because you want to look at it sort of three levels for our particular story. One is we have to keep a certain amount of cash available in order to fund our growth, particularly as it relates to receivables and inventory, but also we’re expanding operating expenses worldwide at an accelerated rate. And all of those demand a level of liquidity. The next thing that we’ve talked about is building infrastructure and capacity. And even though we’re outsourced as far as our fabs and assembly, we do a lot of our own testing. In fact, with the quality requirements of some of the new markets we’re going in, we can’t outsource that. We do all of our own testing and that requires an additional investment. And then you have buildings, which, as you know, we’re one of the few companies that we purchased our own footprint to house our growing staff headcount. So we’re going to continue to leverage the balance sheet in order to help accelerate our growth while at the same time, as we announced in the prepared comments, we’re increasing the dividend by 25%. So we’re also mindful that we need to return some of the cash back to shareholders.
Michael Hsing: Yes. Well, Bernie said that said accelerated expense growth. No, we’re not accelerating. No, absolutely no. Let’s make that clear. And so we are pretty a little bit above our model, okay, growth – MPS growth – the expenses growth, okay? And for the return of cash to our investors, and we have an overwhelming case support for – from our investors in dividend and not buyback. So we are thought about buybacks again now, okay, we still okay, let’s delay it because we get the feedback, okay, they want to divide. I don’t know whether this related to a tax issue or not related, okay. So I think is in a – in the past, we said our models are consistently increased dividends, okay? And the other side of the using of cash is we want to acquire a company, not for revenue growth, is cheaper to grow MPS revenue by zone. But we can do this. So we can – MPS has a lot of garden variety of different products and can fuel some – can enhance a couple of areas to the end product. And we want to acquire those small tuck-in product, very unique and a sustainable growth and a sustainable. And based on MPS technology, we can grow those companies. And that’s the company we’re really interested. And so the earlier, I said were engaged with a few companies now.
Rick Schafer: Thanks for all the color guys. Congrats.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Matt Ramsay of Cowen. Matt, your line is now open.
Matt Ramsay: Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. Michael, I’ve been asking you about this for, I don’t know, three, four years. But in the last, I guess, three or four months, you guys talked a bit more about opportunities for MPS in the electric vehicle market, some in drivetrains, some in regenerative braking. I wonder if you might talk a little bit more about the revenue opportunity per car with your lead customer, the timing of that, and how wide is the pipeline in terms of the number of engagements that you might have in the EV market? Thanks.
Michael Hsing: EV market, we are in the ADAS area, I think that we are in the ADAS 2.5 or 3.0. We almost engage with everybody. And so I can’t give you numbers. For pure electrical car, MPS has about somewhere $80 to $100 shipping to date. And we’re starting this year. We’re starting not this year, starting actually last year. If you involve with a regenerative braking and a drive trend, those will add another over $1,000. And we don’t have those revenue yet, but we do release those products.
Matt Ramsay: Got it. Any – are those larger ASP products, any thoughts on timing?
Michael Hsing: We are – there’s several – there’s many products that we are talking now, we have released a couple of them already or more than a couple of them already. And the key is we want to offer the total solutions. And customers pretty much can use MPS reference design.
Matt Ramsay: Got it. As my follow-up question, it’s a different topic. And one of the things that I’ve been having investor conversations about is the broad-based industry adding – investing a ton of CapEx and adding a ton of capacity and this fear that the industry is adding it at a peak, right? You see a couple of new fabs coming online from Texas Instruments in the next number of quarters, Infineon is up in CapEx, pretty much everyone is. And so you guys have been in a unique position to have a ton of capacity come online when others have struggled to do it. And it sounds like that’s going to continue for you. I just wonder, any concerns as the industry catches up with capacity, Michael? And maybe you could contrast the type of capacity, the process node that you’re on, the nature of the capacity that you’re bringing online for some that the rest of the industry may be adding. Thank you.
Michael Hsing: Yes. That’s a good question. So okay, you know that okay, first thing I should answer that. MPS don’t build anything. We don’t build anything. We don’t have a fab, but we do have all the technologies. And usually, how we’re getting a fab capacity is those fab are empty. And we go in there, we wonder, we say, okay, we can fill you up. It’s a long-term partnership. And so – and like this year or the last year, okay, and you want to add capacity, forget it, okay? I mean those guys are busy shipment, okay? I mean, there are no fabs. And so we engage with them in the downturns. And we implement our technology. Remember, we don’t – it’s not like building a fab. We don’t build a fab. The cost is minimum. And – but we do have some commitment, and we do have – give some consignment on some equipment, okay. But these costs compare building a fab is much, much less. Okay.
Matt Ramsay: Thanks very much guys. I appreciate it.
Michael Hsing: Yes. Okay.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Tore, your line is now open.
Tore Svanberg: Yes. Thank you. Just two quick follow-ups. I know it’s early in the year, but would you have – so you have four horses that are running really fast. You have one horse that’s kind of just running slowly. If we look at this year, which of the horses do you think will grow a bit faster? I know there’s a lot of talk about auto and server, but yes, which horses should we bet on this year?
Michael Hsing: We don’t want to be in those. MPS is all of company. Definitely not a noble company. And I think it’s – we are shifting – clearly, this year, we’re shifting from our consumers to – well, at least the last couple of quarters. We shifted from our consumer to automotive and server and service from a cloud computing side. And again – and so these are, for this year, probably remain similar. So okay, that’s why we see it.
Bernie Blegen: Yes. And I think that when you say that we’ve got five strong horses, that’s a more accurate reflection because I’d say that in the current year, we were surprised by the strength of Industrial. So – and I think that’s going to continue on into the next year. And as we talked about earlier, the communications market, while it may not be coming on as fast as we had originally hoped for or expected, still looks very promising in the second half of this year. So I think really the thesis remains being broad-based growth.
Michael Hsing: Yes. But in – who knows? And let’s say, all these other market segments slow down and as a consumer business in every half year, we can shift it. And we can shift quickly, okay. That’s – currently, it’s not a favor, but we can shift quickly. And by end of the year, maybe we grow Consumer business.
Tore Svanberg: Sounds good. And coming back to the data converter topic, new segment for you. What are some of the things that we should track for your success there? We all know it’s very difficult to crack into that market. And are you going into that market really, really at the high end of data converter technology? And will that be the way for us to track your success there?
Michael Hsing: So far, yes, it’s a very, very high-end product. And - but that’s a new market segment. Like earlier I said – we said that we’re going to ramping the data center very quickly, okay. Turn out to be – it wasn’t the case, okay? So I don’t want to predict that. But I know the technology is good and the test data showed we can be – we are far better than on the existing market of product.
Tore Svanberg: Great. Yes. I mean if you could even get the $100 million there, I’d be very impressed.
Michael Hsing: Oh, yes. Okay. It’s a matter of time. I’m confident of that. And along the way, probably we learned [indiscernible] Yes, okay.
Tore Svanberg: Okay. Thank you.
Michael Hsing: All right. Okay.
Genevieve Cunningham: [Operator Instructions] As there are no further questions, I would now like to turn the webinar back over to Bernie.
Bernie Blegen: Well, once again, I’d like to thank you all for joining us in this conference call, and look forward to talking to you again about our first quarter, which we’ll likely hold in April. So thanks again, and have a nice day.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-10-28 17:00:00) =====
Genevieve Cunningham: Welcome, everyone, to the MPS Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Webinar. Please note that this webinar is being recorded and will be archived for one year on our Investor Relations page at www.monolithicpower.com. My name is Genevieve Cunningham, and I will be the moderator for this webinar. Joining me today are Michael Hsing, as CEO and Founder of MPS; and Bernie Blegen, VP and CFO. During this webinar, we will discuss our Q3 2021 financial results and guidance for Q4 2021, followed by a Q&A session.  In the course of today's webinar, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management's current views and expectations. Please refer to the safe harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the safe harbor statements contained in the Q3 2021 earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on March 1, 2021, and our Form 10-Q filed on August 9, 2021, which are accessible through our website, www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today's call. We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, R&D and SG&A expense, operating income, interest and other income, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the Q3 2020, Q2 2021 and Q3 2021 releases as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our website. Now I would like to turn the call over to Bernie Blegen.
Bernie Blegen: Thanks, Jen. MPS achieved record third quarter revenue of $323.5 million, 10.3% higher than revenue in the second quarter of 2021 and 24.7% higher than the comparable quarter in 2020. Looking at our revenue by market, third quarter 2021 industrial revenue of $52.2 million increased 20.5% from the second quarter of 2021, due primarily to increased revenue for industrial meters and power sources. Industrial revenue represented 16.1% of our total third quarter 2021 revenue. Third quarter 2021 communications revenue of $44.7 million was up 19.3% from the second quarter of 2021, primarily due to increased infrastructure demand. Communication sales represented 13.8% of our total third quarter 2021 revenue. In our computing and storage market, third quarter revenue of $98.6 million increased $10.9 million or 12.4% from the second quarter of 2021. The sequential quarterly revenue growth primarily reflected sales gains in storage applications. Computing and storage revenue represented 30.5% of MPS' third quarter 2021 revenue. Third quarter automotive revenue of $54.4 million grew $5.7 million or 11.7% over the second quarter of 2021. This improvement reflects continued gains in applications for infotainment, lighting and ADAS. Automotive revenue was 16.8% of MPS' total third quarter 2021 revenue. In our consumer markets, third quarter 2021 revenue of $73.6 million fell 3.3% from revenue reported in the second quarter of 2021. This decrease in consumer revenue reflected lower handset sales. Consumer revenue represented 22.8% of our third quarter 2021 revenue. Third quarter 2021 GAAP gross margin was 57.6%, which was 160 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2021 and 245 basis points higher than the third quarter of 2020. Non-GAAP gross margin for the third quarter of 2021 was 57.8%, 148 basis points higher than the gross margin percentage reported from the second quarter of 2021 and 231 basis points higher than the third quarter from a year ago. Third quarter 2021 gross margin on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis included a $4 million litigation settlement. Excluding this onetime benefit, non-GAAP gross margin would have been 56.6%, essentially flat with the second quarter of 2021 and 110 basis points higher than the third quarter of 2020. Our GAAP operating income was $77.1 million compared to $60.6 million reported in the second quarter of 2021 and $60.0 million reported in the third quarter of 2020. Our third quarter 2021 non-GAAP operating income was $108.4 million compared to $94.9 million reported in the prior quarter and $84.9 million reported in the third quarter of 2020. Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $109.2 million in the third quarter of 2021 compared with $103.6 million in the second quarter of 2021 and $83.1 million in the third quarter of 2020. Our non-GAAP third quarter 2021 operating expenses were $78.7 million, up from the $70.3 million we spent in the second quarter of 2021 and up from the $59.1 million reported in the third quarter of 2020. The sequential increase in Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses primarily reflected in increased spending in R&D for qualifying parts for production and securing foundry capacity. The differences between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are primarily stock compensation expense and income or loss on an unfunded deferred compensation plan. For the third quarter of 2021, total stock compensation expense, including approximately $922,000 charged cost of goods sold was $31.6 million, compared with $32.1 million recorded in the second quarter of 2021. Switching to the bottom line. Third quarter 2021 GAAP net income was $68.8 million or $1.44 per fully diluted share compared with $55.2 million or $1.16 per share in the second quarter of 2021 and $55.6 million or $1.18 per share in the third quarter of 2020. Q3 non-GAAP net income was $98.6 million or $2.06 per fully diluted share compared with $86.5 million or $1.81 per share in the second quarter of 2021 and $79.4 million or $1.69 per share in the third quarter of 2020. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q3 2021 were 47.9 million. Now, let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $744.5 million at the end of the third quarter of 2021 compared to $672.9 million at the end of the second quarter of 2021. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $117.8 million, compared with Q2 2021 operating cash flow of $96.9 million. Third quarter 2021 capital spending totaled $18.6 million. Accounts receivable ended the third quarter of 2021 at $79.9 million, representing 22 days of sales outstanding which was two days lower than the 24 days reported at the end of the second quarter of 2021 and 11 days lower than the 33 days at the end of the third quarter of 2020. Our internal inventories at the end of the third quarter of 2021 were $208.1 million, up $30.8 million from the $177.3 million reported at the end of the second quarter of 2021. Inventory at the end of the third quarter of 2021 represented 134 days, which were nine days higher than at the end of the second quarter of 2021. Historically, we have calculated days of inventory on hand as a function of the current quarter revenue. We believe comparing current inventory levels with the following quarter's revenue provides a better economic match. On this basis, you can see inventory at the end of the third quarter of 2021 represented 135 days, 18 days higher than the 117 days at the end of the second quarter of 2021 and six days higher than the 129 days at the end of the third quarter of 2020. Currently, our inventory levels remain lean. We are working very hard to return inventory to the 180 day to 200 day level necessary to support our future growth. I would now like to turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2021. We are forecasting Q4 revenue in the range of $314 million to $326 million. We also expect the following: GAAP gross margin in the range of 56.0% to 56.6%; non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 56.3% to 56.9%; total stock-based compensation expense of $30.8 million to $32.8 million, including approximately $950,000 that we'd be charged to cost of goods sold. GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses should be between $107.8 million and $111.8 million. Non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to be in the range of $77.9 million to $79.9 million. Litigation expense is expected to be in the range of $3.5 million to $3.9 million. Interest income is expected to range from $1.0 million to $1.4 million. Fully diluted shares to be in the range of 47.9 million to 48.9 million shares. In conclusion, we are continuing to execute our strategy. I will now open the webinar up for questions.
A - Genevieve Cunningham: Thank you, Bernie and analyst. I would now like to begin our Q&A session.  Our first question comes from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Tore, your line is now open.
Tore Svanberg: Yes. Thank you and congratulations on these continued stellar results. First question, and not to, sort of, pick on segments there, but your consumer segment was down sequentially, and you talked about cellphone. I wasn't aware -- we don't think power had that much exposure to cellphones. Is this mainly on the charger side or anything else there that we should be aware of?
Michael Hsing: Hi, Tore. Yes, I think, It is on the charger side. And we do these fast chargings, and we picked up some revenues in the last few years in those cellphone companies. And they thought that they can have a more adoption in the market. So they have some inventories, but it's an unusual way of charging of phones and that came in still not very popular.
Tore Svanberg: Great. Thanks for clarifying that. And as my follow-up, you have a luxury problem now. You have about $0.75 billion in cash on your balance sheet. I know you're out there trying to secure more capacity. So first of all, could you update us on where you are on securing capacity, especially for the next few years? And related to that, will you start to use some of that cash more aggressively to potentially buying more equipment as you continue to obviously show very strong growth? Thank you.
Michael Hsing: All right. Let me answer the first part first. It is -- the expansion is still on track, okay. And the fab issues, we don't have -- we have less fab issues. And we came -- we are on the way to expand our capacity in sometimes in the middle or -- middle of the next year to over $2 billion -- supporting $2 billion of sales. But at the same times, we do have to buy more equipment for testing, for qualifications and also, we need to hire more people. And as you know, to qualify each part it takes time. And the revenues there, opportunities there, it's just a matter of time. And so the second part is buying more equipment. On the other hand, as an investor, our shareholders, investors are very critical about our -- criticized in the past our spending, okay? I mean, we are out of -- we are slightly out of our model now, okay, and I -- we spend money on -- what I mean, a lot more careful, okay? But the opportunity is there, but we do more sensibly.
Bernie Blegen: Yeah. And I think if I can just add to Michael's comment there is that as far as the model that we've always pursued, it was to have our fab partners and our assembly house partners absorb much of the capital required in order to build up capacity, and that remains our being as a fabless company. So nothing has changed in our model. We're just adapting it to this rate of growth that we're enjoying right now.
Tore Svanberg: Thanks again. I’ll go back in line.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Matt Ramsay of Cowen. Matt, your line is now open.
Matt Ramsay: Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everybody. For my first question, Michael, I wanted to ask about a couple of the different computing markets that you guys have product to support. The first one, I think you could -- I don't know, from my perspective, if you could kind of drive a bus through what different PC expectations are for next year. And I wonder if you might touch on what -- rough percentage, Bernie, of revenue might come from the notebook market? And what your underlying planning assumptions are on the PC market for next year? And I guess, in contrast to that, how -- Intel is launching Sapphire Rapids, AMD is launching Genoa next year. What kind of a tailwind from a content perspective could those upgrades in the server market be? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks guys.
Michael Hsing: Okay. For the notebook side, obviously, we gained some market shares in the high-end notebook in this -- after the pandemic, okay, or it was still the tail end of the pandemic. And we increased quite a bit of our market share. And -- but the story there is not -- it's not just we're gaining, that's all we can get. We -- as we increased our new generation with our technologies that's in place, and we will further reduce the cost, and we will address the high-end of our consumer side. And allow me if I address the -- answered your questions, Matthew. And on the server side, we are still a very, very small players. There's a lot more room for MPS to gain.
Bernie Blegen: Yeah. And I don't think that we've ever specifically broken out what percent of the group's revenue is tied to any one of the categories that we track. But I think we have been clear that in each of the last two years, that the growth in notebooks has outpaced the rest of the sectors, including server and storage. Now having said that, one of the things that we're benefiting from is that diversification of how we're positioned in this group. As Michael indicated, we are a relatively small player when it comes to core power management for servers and we believe that with both the next generation of Intel and AMD processor releases, that we stand to benefit from market share gains. And in the more near-term element, as we called out in Q3, we're actually seeing a nice increase in storage sales, which is usually a precursor to ongoing infrastructure spending within the data centers. So I think that we're having a great difficulty, as anybody, in understanding when work from home or work from work, as it relates to notebooks, begins or ends. But I think that we're well positioned because of our diversification to enjoy continued growth in this category for a number of years.
Matt Ramsay: Yes. Thank you.
Michael Hsing: Let me go back to the notebook side that I can -- I think that part of the question, I didn't answer. And again, we're still facing shortages and still a lot of demand in the notebook side. And we don't see the -- we see revenues from -- in the middle of the next year even.
Matt Ramsay: Got it. Thank you very much for all that commentary guys. Just a quick couple of things on gross margin. One, Bernie, the one-timer that was in Q3, any particular reason you didn't pull that out of the non-GAAP number? And secondly, with the pricing environment that we're feeling today, how do you guys think about price increases going forward relative to input costs and what that could mean to margins? Thank you very much.
Bernie Blegen: I'll take the first half of that question real quickly. And then Michael will give comments on the second. As far as how we try to manage GAAP and non-GAAP reporting, is really to be a reflection of what is cash. And in this case, we highlighted that there was a settlement, and that was a cash payment that we received. And so that's the thinking behind not adjusting it as a non-GAAP item. Conversely so, if we have something that works to our detriment and it also has cash implications, we wouldn't non-GAAP that out either. So the two areas that we stay pretty closely to, or three, I should say, are only stock comp, gain and loss from a deferred comp plan and if we have any intangible acquisition amortization.
Michael Hsing: Okay. The second part is how it affected our gross margins on the current supply shortages. I think, as I said, all these new -- well, let me say this, yes, we do see the cost increase in, fortunately, in all the product that we released have gained market shares as all these greenfield products. We started to gain momentum a couple of years ago. And these all have higher margins. And our customers give us a very long-term forecast commitment, and we honor those. We can absorb some in -- some of the cost and -- because the way these products have a much higher margins. And -- so during this time, we value the customer relationship and we don't gouge price.
Genevieve Cunningham: All right. Our next question is from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Ross, your line is now open.
Ross Seymore: Thanks for letting me ask a question. Congrats on continued strong reports and guides. One question on an end market. The communications side, Bernie or Michael, you guys said that, that was up because of infrastructure. That's been a really choppy market for you guys between the infrastructure side going on and off and then the kind of the access side. Can you just talk a little bit more about what you meant by the infrastructure side? And is that the start of something that's going to continue, or should you expect that segment to continue to be lumpy going forward?
Michael Hsing: Well, Ross, you know then that we're transitioning from a these Wi-Fi routers and those to more in real infrastructures like I mean in data centers or these communication between the data centers and the switchers and even towers. So the last years, our customers are pulling a lot of revenues. And this time, then we see all the other things are going like 5Gs and including the commercial Wi-Fi systems and then and – where we play a critical role on these in these areas. And we see the expansions, and we will see a further – continue to expand in the next few quarters.
Bernie Blegen: Yes. I think we remain very optimistic about our long-term positioning within the communication sector and in particular, infrastructure as it relates to 5G. But I think that right now, we have not hit a constant investment cadence on the part of the carriers in either Europe or North America. So we think that as that starts to gain momentum and gets more predictable, we're very well positioned to participate in that.
Ross Seymore: Thanks for that color. I guess as my follow-up, seasonality versus kind of cyclicality and/or supply-driven moves. Obviously, your fourth quarter has guided a bit better than your traditional seasonality kind of flattish this year. But how are you thinking about that as we go into next year and beyond? Is it mainly going to be driven by the product cycles you have in short supply in aggregate? So those would be big tailwinds, or do you believe seasonality is going to become a framework that's something that investors should consider as we go into 2022?
Michael Hsing: Well, Ross, you see the – this market is an exceptionally strong market, I mean. And like I mean, a lot of demand is everywhere, so like I mean, also are constrained by the supply. And we do have a delinquencies. And I mean, but that's we're facing delinquency for many quarters, like I mean – and for – I think we still have the – my opinion is that we still have some kind of seasonality in fourth quarters because all these holidays, all these and it will kind of affect us. And so we see the – as I said earlier, we see the demand is still very strong. So like I mean we're just cautious, and we are on our guidance.
Ross Seymore: And just to add to that is that right now, what we are continuing to do is investing and expanding our capacity because we do believe that this robust demand that we're experiencing will continue, and we want to be able to participate, optimize to the best of our ability, this growth opportunity.
Michael Hsing: Yes, let me clarify the shortages, okay. All these – what I mean with shortage is that we have a few thousand products and always have some mixed issues. And as we don't have a serious – we don't have fab capacity issues. And – but all these are mixed in the – for particular product that we may have – we have a few products that have a – are facing shortages now. So – and as we transfer to a different fab, it just takes time to qualify this.
Ross Seymore: Got it. Thanks, guys.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Alex Vecchi of William Blair. Alex, your line is now open.
Alex Vecchi: Hey, guys. Congratulations on the strong results. Maybe just to piggyback on Ross' question a little bit with seasonality. Bernie, can you give a little color on how we should think about the sequential growth rate by end market for Q4 in terms of maybe strongest end market to weakest?
Bernie Blegen: Sure. So, when you look at Q4, I think that the two primary drivers are going to be computing and continuation of automotive. And then you would normally expect and we expect to see a slight downturn in consumer. So, I think many of the trend lines that we're familiar with are continuing and ongoing, but the amplitude might be a little up or down from what the traditional seasonality has been.
Alex Vecchi: Great. that's helpful. And then similarly, I think on the communications line as well over the last couple of quarters, I believe you guys have pointed to ramp up to that Tier 2 5G OEMs. How should we be thinking about the opportunity eventually next year to crack into a Tier 1, or just generally, how to think about how you're positioned there geographically?
Michael Hsing: Yes. We are designing all -- in all Tier 1s now. And we are so small still like I mean in these big growing market segments. As you know, we don't have anything in 4G, and we expect that we'll be a significant players in there.
Alex Vecchi: Okay, that’s helpful. With that, I'll go back in queue.
Michael Hsing: Okay.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham. Quinn, your line is now open.
Quinn Bolton: Hi guys. Let me offer my congratulations. Michael or Bernie, I guess I wanted to -- I know there have been a lot of disruptions in Southeast Asia, more on the package and test side. Wondering if you could just say whether or not you have any exposure to Malaysia subcons and whether that affected your ability to ship or receive products here in the third quarter or in the fourth quarter looking forward?
Michael Hsing: Yes. There's not so much that affected it. Maybe some products, not I mean -- because we control a lot of our -- the new product, we control our own package technologies. And so we always qualify in a different locations. And so we came in that -- the Southeast Asia problems, okay, we can go through it. We didn't have that much of issues.
Bernie Blegen: Correct, in either Q3 or our outlook for Q4.
Michael Hsing: Yes.
Quinn Bolton: Got it. My second question just on the supply chain is it sounds like from your comments, you're not seeing some of the fab constraints that you'd seen earlier. And inventory increased by $30 million sequentially. I guess my question is, as that capacity comes online, as you ramp inventory on hand, do you think that, that could lead to an acceleration in your ability to meet former delinquencies and see revenue growth rate potentially accelerate as you meet some of those delinquencies, or it -- does it really all come down to that product mix of what customers are demanding versus what you have in inventory that you see that mismatch potentially continuing for several quarters?
Michael Hsing: Yes, to answer your question, as today, absolutely. And we have a lot more we can chew off now. And as the shortages go on or the new product adoptions in all the greenfield products that we ramp up much, much faster than we expected, and we have a normal out-of-forecast orders and we cannot fulfill. And these ones, our customers understand that. I mean -- and so we -- so now, as of today, we have a blue skies. And -- but doesn't mean -- we're not regulators, so I can't forecast it.
Bernie Blegen: Just to add, it's a balancing act, as you can appreciate, because for some of the more mature products that we have, they already have developed markets and a fairly predictable growth in the current market. But what we're trying to do is make sure that these new product introductions can be successful, because that is going to be the future growth opportunity for the company. So, we're trying to satisfy sort of the run rate business in this heightened demand, a period of heightened demand, and at the same time, have very successful new product launches with new customers.
Quinn Bolton: Got it. Can I squeeze one last one in? Do you guys have any meaningful exposure to Chromebooks? And is that a share gain opportunity as you look into 2022? Thank you.
Michael Hsing: Yes, we have. And it's -- if we have a local product, we might as well make them and go design, I mean, everywhere.
Bernie Blegen: Yes. Chromebooks are unique, because while they're considered a -- we tend to go after high-value notebooks, and Chromebooks are known to be lower priced. But they depend on the access to the cloud and good processing power. So the power management, our power management solution is very key. It's a high value for the Chromebooks.
Michael Hsing: Yes. As I said earlier, as our technologies bring online in -- become more mature, so that can mean why not just attacking all these other markets that we're not in.
Quinn Bolton: Yes. Thank you.
Michael Hsing: Yes.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from William Stein of Truist. William, your line is now open.
Q – William Stein: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the great results and outlook. I'm -- I want to ask one question about supply chain stuff and one about long-term growth. First, on the supply chain, it seems -- certainly, if we look not just at your business but across semis, that customers have been in sort of freak-out expedite mode for quite some time. I wonder if you could give us a sense as to whether that abated at all. Did the level or breadth of expedite requests change meaningfully in the quarter? Is it getting hotter or colder in any end market with regard to this sort of urgency of expedites and pull-ins and upsides and all that activity we've heard about? And then again, I have a long-term growth question.
Michael Hsing: Yes. Okay. The answer is okay. I wish that they come down a little bit, then I mean -- and that they're exactly the same as the last quarter and the quarter before. And -- yes, okay.
William Stein: Okay. So the long-term growth question, Michael, I think we've discussed this many times, but we're aware that there's this long-term potential to transition to more of a solutions provider with modules relative to your traditional semi device business. Can you talk about the trajectory of growth of the modules business? An update on perhaps percent of revenues today relative to a quarter ago and where you think it -- that could go over time? Thank you.
Michael Hsing: Yes. I -- our homegrown modules, okay, well, all this strategy, there's MPS involved. There are a lot of technicals in the gate in terms of delivering the end product. Okay, it feels -- there's no end project, it's a mid product, as I feel it well. So our strategies are move up to a food games. And since we put -- we have the knowledge and why win are not captured all the values. And for currently -- current, our module growth, okay, I mean it's much faster than other semiconductors side or selling the chips. But the volume overall is still very small, so like I mean, compare the entire revenues. We tried it different ways in like a launch our websites and like a NPS analyses. And then, they're also using e-commerce, okay? These are doing well. And -- but -- now I'm thinking about it, why we're just applying companies, like I mean, -- and we know that, we need to gain knowledge, gain sales channels, like I mean -- and have those company adopting an MPS technology, we can provide them with better tools, again. And I think the first field attempt in -- are very, very, very encouraging. So like I mean, obviously, I can't talk the detail now. So again, -- and I think that's our strategy.
Bernie Blegen: And if I can just remind you, Will that we talked about this -- touched on it last quarter. And we indicated that what we're trying to do is source different technologies through either IP acquisitions or talent acquisitions that are complementary to our business. And that will accelerate our ability to be a solutions provider for our customers in the next seven, eight years.
Michael Hsing: Yeah. I just don't like it. We have so much knowledge to put an end to it. And in the end, we sell a piece of silicon averaging well below $1, okay? We should sell our solutions at much more than $1, so like a $5, $6, $10, those type of things. And those customers will really appreciate it. They don't have to design from scratch.
William Stein: That's helpful insight. Thank you both.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer. Rick, your line is now open.
Wei Mok: Hi. Good afternoon. This is Wei Mok on the call for Rick Schafer. I just wanted to echo congrats on the results. So for my first question, it's in regards to auto, so it's pretty much well known that the market is supply constrained though you guys are still growing nearly 90% this year. With industry reports showing vehicle unit production improving in 2022, how should we think about your auto business as we look into 2022?
Michael Hsing: Well, it's a very -- at this time, we see everything is very rosy now. And we -- but on the other hand, in -- we are so small. There's no reason, we would not grow, even the downturns. And as we have looked at the addressable market is that this is like over $6 billion, okay? I mean that's conservatively numbers. That's a conservative numbers. And as we introduce more products in especially in ADAS and the EV proportion size. And, okay, we are developing products. I mean, all of these, and again, we can address the future growth really well. So like I mean, there is 2022 -- and okay, there's no reason not if it's a -- I would not say there's a lack of tool like last year, so like also in the auto industry just stopped like I mean, it was a in the normal times. And there's no reason for us not to grow.
Bernie Blegen: And I think to just follow on to the previous question. When we look at automotive, we actually have system-level design wins in ADAS, regenerative braking systems and in external lighting. And all of these solutions have much higher dollar content for us, $60 to $100 per vehicle. So I think this is a very exciting example of how the solution strategy could play out in different end markets for us as well.
Wei Mok: Got it. Great. Thanks for that. As for my second question, it's regards to the console. You guys highlighted consumer being down in 4Q. So is this more of a reflection of normal seasonality, or are you seeing any supply constraints impacting consoles? Thanks.
Michael Hsing: Well, Q3 -- in Q3 in consumer side, it shouldn't be the highest to us. And I think at our customer side, they have too much inventory in the -- for the cell phones in like I mean that affects us. And then in the cellphones especially that's in China, like I mean when they – when the US had an embargo on one of our companies, but the other ones, they thought they can gain the market share. Like I mean, actually, they didn't. And so they're stuck with the inventory.
Bernie Blegen: And I think that what we tried to do in our prepared comments is really make that dip more narrowly defined, but it is really the fast charger in the handsets as opposed to anything that is more broad or pervasive in the rest of consumer?
Wei Mok: Okay. Thanks for that.
Michael Hsing: Yeah, we didn't have much of an exposure in the handsets, and that wasn't my favorite either anyway. So we've got the least products, however in the last years and okay, why not, okay? But now it's okay. We thought it would be a good.
Bernie Blegen: The technology has actually been very well positively received. It's just the imbalance as far as the demand that was expected has trailed those expectations. And so we believe that they have excess inventory and so we're seeing a slowdown for that particular individual category.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Kevin Garrigan of Rosenblatt. Kevin, your line is now open.
Hans Mosesmann: This is Hans for Kevin. Congrats. A couple of questions. Along the lines of inventory, I think AMD, Micron, on the PC side of things, and Texas Instruments on a broader basis, are indicating that customers are changing their behavior a bit in terms of how they take in components in a supply-constrained environment. So rather than just take everything they can get, they're being more selective. Is that something you guys are seeing? And is that unusual if you are seeing that? Thanks.
Michael Hsing: We are too small, but these – we're a very small player, much smaller players compare with the Texas Instruments or the other guys. We don't have a luxury of picking market segments. We're only focusing on long terms. Focus or not focus. We don't do short-term business anyway.
Bernie Blegen: Yeah. To answer your question really succinctly, we haven't seen any change in ordering patterns or our delivery schedule and really don't have an opinion on what the broader market or other market participants are experiencing.
Hans Mosesmann: Fair enough. And so just the last question, your visibility in terms of when you can capture or get back to that 180 to 200 days of inventory, has that changed? And what is that time line? Is it the end of next year? Is it 2023? Thanks.
Michael Hsing: I think the end of the next year would be a good number. Yeah. That's what we – that's a – if the market goes – continue to go this strong, so like I mean hopefully, some we can catch up at the end of the next year.
Hans Mosesmann: And that's – is that a push-out, or is that a pull-in from last quarter?
Bernie Blegen: I'm sorry?
Michael Hsing: Again, you said I talked about last quarter, pull-in or push-out. And like I mean, as I said earlier, we have a – we still have a delinquent season, like I mean – and we're having more delinquency than a customer push-out let's say it that way.
Hans Mosesmann: Okay.
Bernie Blegen: I think the important thing is that, even with the demands that are placed upon us and Michael is correct that we saw no change in Q3 from what we experienced in Q1 or Q2. We were able to increase inventory in a meaningful way this quarter. So again, I refer back to an earlier answer. We said the balancing act that we're trying to do between satisfy more run rate business at the same time as we're meeting demand for our new products as well as building inventory that gives us more flexibility.
Hans Mosesmann: Great. Thank you.
Michael Hsing: Okay.
Genevieve Cunningham: Next question is from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Tore, your line is now open
Tore Svanberg: Yes. Thank you. I just had a few follow-ups. First of all, Bernie, the gross margin guidance for Q4, that does not include any more litigation impact, right? That's...
Bernie Blegen: That is correct.
Tore Svanberg: Okay. Great. So the other question is, a lot of your competitors are discrete companies, and they're probably allocating their products all over the place right now, which I assume means you're gaining share. Can you just talk a little bit to the stickiness of that? I mean I assume once they go with an integrated solution there, they're not going to go back
Michael Hsing: That's very true. And when they've tasted a simple, easy solution, it's difficult. And for these high end -- a little bit of high end in the market, that's what we focus on. The customer pay for it, and they deviated from the way they -- their behavior, how they design product. And I think that's a huge benefit to us. And our other customers, the more in the low-end consumer business, we don't care.
Tore Svanberg: Got it. Just one last question. Michael, in the past, you've talked about, especially in servers and automotive, kind of just getting the side dishes. But eventually, you'll get the main course. Should we expect those two segments to see some main course revenue in 2022?
Michael Hsing: Yes, yes. We are keep eating the crumbs, okay. We eat a lot of crumbs like a whales. Well, not whales. We -- we're small fish trying to eat a lot of crumbs. And now the fish is like, we grow ourselves a little bit, we can eat the real meals, like I mean we -- as you we keep saying, okay, we have the reference design in Intels, and then the real OEMs pick up a onesie and a twosie for these projects and but these are the real beast, like I mean, end up a little bit small. So I think in the next years, we will grow much bigger in so called VR14s and VR13.5. We benefit a lot in -- and other than the point of loans and the E-Fuse and that kind of growth came in, now we really have a core power, have a meaningful revenue coming next years. And now talking about VR14 yet again. And the other thing that worth to mention about and there's about a 48-volt process, as we said earlier. And like I mean by these years, and we forecast about this year and the next year, the cross point had to happen. And like I mean we're waiting -- we were waiting about three, four years ago. And we said that until we end up -- when the powers keep increasing and the heat generation, heat dissipations, they cannot handle anymore, they have to use the 48-volt solutions, and this has happened. And start from AR and next year, we see many data centers adopting 48-volt solutions. And well, we have a benefit of a large lake.
Tore Svanberg: Great. Thank you very much
Michael Hsing: Okay. Thank you.
Genevieve Cunningham:  As there are no further questions, I would like to turn the webinar back over to Bernie.
Bernie Blegen: I'd like to thank you all for joining us for this conference call, and we look forward to talking to you again during the fourth quarter conference call, which will likely be in early February. With that, thank you, and have a nice day.
Michael Hsing: Okay. Goodbye.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-07-27 17:00:00) =====
Genevieve Cunningham: Welcome everyone to the MPS Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Webinar. Please note that this webinar is being recorded and will be archived for one year on our Investor Relations page at www.monolithicpower.com. My name is Genevieve Cunningham and I will be the moderator for this webinar. Joining me today are Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS; and Bernie Blegen, VP and CFO. During this webinar, we will discuss our Q2, 2021 financial results and guidance for Q3, 2021, followed by Q&A session.  
Bernie Blegen: Thanks Jen. MPS achieved record second quarter revenue of $293.3 million, 15.3% higher than the first quarter of 2021 and 57.5% higher than the second quarter of 2020. This broad based year-over-year revenue growth was a result of our diversified growth strategy, technological innovation and investment in production capacity. Turning now to our second quarter 2021 revenue by market, computing and storage revenue of $87.7 million increased 30.0% from the first quarter of 2021. The sequential revenue improvement reflected increased demand and market share gains for servers and data centers and notebooks. Computing and storage revenue represented 29.9% of MPS' second quarter 2021 revenue compared with 34.4% in the second quarter of 2020. Second quarter consumer revenue of $76.1 million increased 14.9% from the first quarter of 2021. The sequential quarterly revenue increase reflected earlier than normal sales of gaming console products.  Consumer revenue represented 25.9% of MPS' second quarter 2021 revenue compared with 25.6% in the second quarter of 2020. Second quarter automotive revenue of $48.7 million increased 8.5% from the first quarter of 2021, primarily due to increase sales of infotainment products. Second quarter 2021 revenue was up 173.9% year-over-year, automotive revenue represented 16.6% of MPS' second quarter 2021 revenue, compared with 9.5% in the second quarter of 2020. Second quarter 2021 Industrial revenue of $43.3 million increased 8.9% from the first quarter of 2021, reflecting increased sales of products for power source applications. Industrial revenue represented 14.8% of our total second quarter 2021 revenue compared with 14.3% in the second quarter of 2020. Second quarter 2021 communications revenue of $37.5 million was up 3.9% from the first quarter of 2021. Most of this sequential revenue increase was due to higher product sales for networking and wireless applications. Communication sales represented 12.8% of our total second quarter 2021 revenue compared with 16.2% in the second quarter of 2020.
Operator:  Our first question comes from Tore Svanberg of Stifel.
ToreSvanberg: Yes, thank you, Michael, Bernie, congrats again on another strong and record quarter. I was hoping you could update us on your capacity plans. I know you've done a pretty good job here, the last 18 months, your inventory seem to be in good shape, perhaps a bit at the lower end. But yes, maybe you could help us understand a little bit more what you specifically are doing on the capacity side.
MichaelHsing: Thanks Tore. Our capacities as always in the past three or four years and we keep expanding. And now we continue that. However, we do have capacities of over $2 billion and before the middle of next year. So we have enough capacity for us to grow. And now we have just qualifier more product and release to productions. And ultimately in our customers' hand.
BernieBlegen: And at the expense of repeating our self story. You recall that last year, we brought up the 12 inch fab. And this year, we've brought up 8 inch fab which is already contributing to inventory. So in both cases, what we're continuing to do is expand out by qualifying more parts so that we will be able to meet the $2 billion level by the middle of next year.
ToreSvanberg: Very good. Thank you for that. And your cash balance has doubled here over the last couple of years. And it's now at $670 million. Obviously, it's a luxury issue to have. But what do you intend to do with that cash? Because obviously, you don't need that much. So do you plan to return that more back to shareholders? Are you potentially looking at M&A? And the reason I'm asking this is because it's so high now, right? I mean, I know historically, you've grown your business organically, but it's so high now that I just have to ask the question what you intend to do with it?
MichaelHsing: That's a good question. As a company, I keep saying we transforming the company from a semiconductor to more solution providers and so we can utilize our cash much better than we can in the past and the strategy is  okay, we will buy in a tuck-in technology companies which comparable to MPS revenues, MPS as a general market coverage. So on the other hand we are also consistently raising dividends. And that's our strategy but we're not excluding buyback shares.
Operator: Our next question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham.
QuinnBolton: You guys hope you can hear me but let me echo my congratulations on the strong revenue and the very nice, gross and operating margins. Bernie, I guess you teased us there at the end of your script, saying that you've got the capacity now to support acceleration in revenue growth. If I look at revenue last year, you did about 35% growth looks like this year; you might do better than that. I'm just trying to interpret when you talk about acceleration in revenue growth, what should we read into that?
BernieBlegen: Yes, I think that you're familiar with our model, which is to outperform the industry by 10 to 15 percentage points. And, obviously, that's a model, that's a guideline. And there are certain periods where we have the right factors both strategically as well as from a market perspective, that allowed us to do better, and sometimes not as well as that model. So for example, if you look at last year's results, you could argue that at 34.5% growth, that we exceeded the market, which was right about 5% to 8%, depending on what you're looking at, by somewhere in the neighborhood of, 15-17 percentage points. And so we look at that is, well above our model, in the current year, obviously, we only guide to Q3. But it's not unrealistic to expect that within the range of possibilities that we could match that performance, or in fact do just a little bit better. So what we're trying to observe here is that in this two three year period, we're actually benefiting from a lot of factors that have us exceeding what our normal model is.
QuinnBolton: Great, thanks for that additional color. Bernie, I also wanted to ask on the compute and storage business up 30% sequentially, I think you mentioned that it was share gains in both servers as well as notebooks. On the notebook side, I thought you already had pretty high share at the high end of the notebook market. So I'm wondering if you could comment, are you starting to see share gains and maybe more mainstream or even low end or Chromebooks on the notebook side. And are there any notable areas of share gains on servers? Thank you.
MichaelHsing: Yes, so we do have some of the share gain across the board in a notebook market segment, as our technologies advanced in which lower the cost, our die size become much smaller. So the cost, the lower costs allow MPS enters a lower notebook segment.
BernieBlegen: And then as far as server, we've been fairly consistent in articulating our strategy as far as being able to grow our market position with each succeeding next generation, particularly Intel and AMD products. Not limited to that though, but also on 48 volt GPUs. So it really expresses the point that we're branching up in share gains within the Intel family, but also branching out into these other opportunities.
Operator: Our next question is from Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer.
RickSchafer: Thank you and I'll add my congratulations. Just kind of keep amazing, everybody, I think I'll ask one more capacity, if that's okay. And it's coming from a spending kind of standpoint. Can you Bernie maybe remind us what the outlook for kind of spending just as a general rule as a percent of revenue, maybe starting next year, once all the new capacity is installed? I mean, I think you're getting so many questions, because everybody sees the kind of growth you guys are putting up. And it's awesome that you have $2 billion in capacity onboard by this time next year. But at this rate, it's only going to in a couple years, right you're going to be bumping your head-on by so. I'm curious because how soon would you have to look to begin ramping incremental capacity again? And what might impact beyond on spending? I'm curious what like, just hypothetically, in two years, three years time, if you're at $2 billion top line, like what would gross margin look like, for instance?
BernieBlegen: Rick, thank you. Good question. Something that's really important to comment on here is that a lot of companies and a lot of analysts and a lot of investors are focused on capacity as if this is a new aspect of the semiconductor business. In fact, capacity is something that we have been managing for the 10 years that I've been hearing before that. It's an integral component to our growth strategy. And so the way that we've been doing it is sequentially adding new fabs and also assembly houses and testing capacity alongside of that to accommodate to be in front of what is expected revenue growth. So while we have made public comment on the fabs that we've invested in to date, we're still continuing on with ongoing relationships in order to secure more fab capacity for the future in order to accommodate that growth beyond $2 billion.
MichaelHsing: Yes, as I said earlier, so we keep expanding and we will never stop. But sometimes faster, other ones -- other times it's slower, again, other than the capacities, physical capacity itself, we have to increase a lot of haircuts, and MPS is a very, very lean, and so we will hire -- we are hiring a lot of people. 
RickSchafer: Thanks. Sorry, I was having some trouble on my end. Thanks, Michael. And thanks, Bernie, quick question on auto, if I could, I mean, by my math, it's on track to maybe grow sort of an 80% or better range this year for you guys. I mean, I'm curious how much of that is being either directly or indirectly limited by supply? And if you could give a sense of what growth could be or talk about growth, maybe demand that's pushed and how that ultimately would show up in the model say next year? I don't know if you could maybe quantify or talk about your auto backlog and maybe where it is today.
MichaelHsing: Maybe Bernie can, this year you said that you mentioned that whether the automotive product is limited by the capacities and the answer is not as much as other segments. Because automotive company, they give us a long lead times. And so we prepare the last year, the last didn't, our customer didn't consume that many of our products, okay and so it all translate to this year. And so we'll be able to ship them now.
BernieBlegen: One of the aspects of automotive that's getting a lot of attention in the press has to do with the fact of electronic component shortages that are shutting down plants or limiting their ability in order to kit a car and put it assembly and as Michael just said we're actually not capacity constrained there. We are meeting all demand from them. And what's been interesting is one of the reasons that automotive got into this bind is because they were working with a just in time inventory model. And I think that they've learned from that that when the parts the electronic components are available, that they will stock them even though they don't have a complete kit to build the car. Now in our conversations and feedback that we're getting is they're actually only trying to satisfy real demand. But that is the timing of when the build plan, when they'll have the complete kit that they can then build the cars. So it's something that we want to monitor because there's been no change in the ordering pattern or our shipment schedule versus expectations because of the other limitations in automotive.
MichaelHsing: Yes, I might as well add it, okay, about a year and a year and a half ago our inventory were at all time high. And that was one of the reasons that why we do that because we were a newcomer in automotive industries, okay, even though with this type of a current revenue. We're still in a very, very little on a market -- in a market percentage of a market, and so it's a clear as a newcomer, and you don't want to upset the customers, okay, and you don't have a product. So as all these as a lack of what we do to all these key customers, we have an inventory, even though they don't have a clear forecast. And so now is a really benefited us. And we gain a lot more design win activities. And because our competitor couldn't, cannot ship a product.
Operator: Our next question is from William Stein of Truist.
WilliamStein: Thanks for taking my question. I hope you can hear me. With regard to first sort of maintenance question with regard to your capacity and inventory, which you've already explained quite a bit about on this call. Are you supply constrained at this time? Are you able to meet all the demand whether it's upside, or maybe customers stretching and trying to build a bit of inventory? Or are you in fact capacity constrained? And our lead times extended as you're communicating them to customers? And then I have a big question of more sort of strategic question after that.
MichaelHsing: Yes, let me explain that way. Okay, we have less capacity constraints than compared to like a half year ago also, and however, as a customer's -- when you call, after you qualify all these new fabs, and we have a month or couple months delayed of a qualifying these product. And to qualify in the fab, it's not exactly science, okay, mean you use different supplier or different equipments, okay, mean different materials and all the problem, all these issue comes -- have an effect on how you qualify products in the end. So this time, okay, we just have to release a lot of new product, lot of existing product from different fabs. And so it's kind of a -- to answer your question here is the kind of a constraints, we have a lot more orders, and we couldn't fulfilled, okay mean but just only a couple of months late.
BernieBlegen: And again, what we're trying to do here is make sure that we're servicing real demand, and not building up inventory, either in the channel or on our customer shelves. So what we've done is we've actually have very transparent relationships with our customers so that we make sure that we're in touch with their business sufficient to be able to make those trade offs.
WilliamStein: Great, thanks. And then the follow up if I can, or the more strategic question, Michael, you refer to this transition from a semi company to a technology solutions company, and it's something I've written about specifically to transition from semi devices to modules. Any quantification around this and perhaps it relates to the ecommerce strategy as well. Any update in that area would be very helpful. Thank you.
MichaelHsing: Yes. Thanks for asking for that question, now is overwhelming by the revenue growth and the company but not only from analysts from outside and the company inside company is overwhelming by the revenue growth, that allocations and the product allocations and in a lot of strategic things, okay, as less pronounced, okay but the module you're absolutely right module business is for a solution, as a solution transforming to a module company as we transforming, we're transitioning from semiconductor to a solution company. And the ecommerce, we have a teams and we finally, we have organized like a product line. And I know the activities in the last quarter also are quadruple. And so the revenue is still small, but is in the millions of dollars. Okay. I mean, it's more than a million dollars, okay somewhere $30 million - $40 million.
WilliamStein: With a module and service?
MichaelHsing: Yes, with the module and service and is growing, as you recall in about five years ago. Three years ago, it's almost zero. Yes. And four years ago, almost zero, okay, I mean we started that. And so we'll continue to focus on that. And so I truly believe that's our future.
Operator: Our next question is from Joshua Buchalter of Cowen.
JoshuaBuchalter: Hey, guys congrats on the results. And thanks for taking my question. Gross margins in both the print and guide were meaningfully higher than your usual 10 to 20 basis point trajectory. Can you elaborate on the key drivers of the leverage there? And I guess speak to the sustainability? Was it driven by mix or something on the cost side getting wafers through your recently ran fabs? Thanks. 
BernieBlegen: Sure. I think that we've discussed in the past that, again, it's our model is that we want to be able to grow gross margin at 10 to 20 basis points sequentially, over the long haul. And we've demonstrated very good consistency in being able to do that. But much like I was describing before, this is an unusual period of growth for the company, both in terms of how fast the revenue is growing. And then obviously, as we described in the narrative, it was that the overheads is not, which would be like direct spending or inventory provisions or anything like that is not growing at the same rate as the revenue growth. And that's where we're getting the near term leverage. As we look out, obviously, we don't want to create an expectation that we're going to be able to grow at the same rate. But by the same token, we have established another floor level for what we expect sustainable gross margin to be.
JoshuaBuchalter: That's helpful. Thank you. And then also on the model, I guess, you mentioned that consumer in console was a bit accelerated versus your normal seasonality. Can you remind us what you would expect the shape of the console business to look like in the second half? And maybe just give us some clues on revenue growth by segment? Thank you.
MichaelHsing: Sure. I don't know if we call it normal, okay. I don't -- I can't think of a normal anymore. Okay. Regarding to our console business, yes, we win a lot of designing, wining the next design, okay, I mean I think the business continues, okay, I mean I think you have a better judgment than us what's the seasonality now for console.
BernieBlegen: I think that Michael makes a very strong point there is that we've had so many puts and takes and different lines of businesses that have been added that the rule of thumb is not as applicable as it might have been back in 2018 or 2019. I would comment on is that we believe that we are optimizing across all of our different end markets. And again, it's really the strength of the model is in the diversification. And whereas a lot of the traditional seasonality would have been tied to consumer for example. Now we have much higher percentage of our business that is tied to computing, automotive and industrial, and they don't necessarily recognize the same level of seasonality. But then to sort of complete the question, I think if you look at the near term growth, obviously, the current year is benefited significantly from automotive and computing storage in particular. And we believe that going forward automotive along with communications should be our longer-term drivers. 
Operator: Our next question is from Tore Svanberg of Stifel.
ToreSvanberg: Yes, thank you. I just have a few follow up questions. First of all, I have a question on your ASPs, which obviously tied to your revenue growth. So now that you are sort of growing in the 50% range, how much of that is units versus ASPs?
BernieBlegen: Yes, I would say if you look at last year, and last year is representative what we're doing in 2021, is of the 34.5% growth 25% of that was tied to volume, 10% was tied to price. And I think when Michael talks about the solutions business; you're looking at previously selling an individual piece of silicon for $0.20 to $0.25. And now depending on the module, we can get between $1 to $3. And what we're looking to be able to do is design complete integrated solutions for different end applications, where those will be able to achieve for the total cost for that solution can be somewhere between $60 to $100. So, there's the ASP on the individual component, but it's more importantly, it's having that attach rate with the total solution.
ToreSvanberg: Very good. And talking about systems, how's your motor business doing? I know that's probably the highest ASP products you have. So how's that business going?
MichaelHsing: It's doing well, but the rest of our company is growing much faster. So it's still small. And you can't break out a percentage yet. But I think that was a -- we will more -- have a -- give a more category of our product rolls. Okay, as we divided into a more finer product line. Yes, we'll give it that number later. Okay.
ToreSvanberg: Sounds good. Michael. And last one, about a year ago, you talked about getting into the medical end market any updates there? I mean, I know it's still probably very, very smallest percentage of revenue, but just trying to understand how fast your traction is in the medical end market.
MichaelHsing: Yes. We have our product now. And that's a well, we're -- we have a several things that we have ultrasound and the ultrasound, we do generate revenue, we see the revenue now. Okay and the other one is x-ray machines. Okay, x-rays. And we put -- we have -- we are evaluating the first silicones and from our design size is  but we have some issue with the fab. But that's a very minor issue, okay, I mean we will be able to solve that problems. And it is outstanding, thank you for bringing it up this. And the performance is like a 5x, 6x better than existing solutions. So the image is a lot more cleaner now. And we couldn't deliver. And so I think the customers are waiting. And we're very excited.
BernieBlegen: One other comment to add here is the technology that we're referring to here is related to our high performance or precision analog converters, right.
MichaelHsing: Data converters, yes, right.
BernieBlegen: And this has been something that we've been working on for I think about 2.5 and three years now. 
MichaelHsing: Two and a half years.
BernieBlegen: 2.5 years. And I think what is really exciting is that this is incredible opportunity. And we're very close to being able to declare that it's commercially viable in the market. So it's not just a medical which is the first end market we're going after with this technology. But the other opportunities this opens up for us.
MichaelHsing: Yes, it's same technologies, similar technologies that we'll be able to use in the telecommunication side.
Operator: Our next question is from Kevin Garrigan of Rosenblatt.
KevinGarrigan: Hi, guys, congrats on the quarter. And thanks for taking my question. Just a quick one for me. I was wondering if you could tell us what percentage of your business or percentage of backlog is based on three year newer products. I think last quarter; Bernie and you had said new products introduced in the last three years were about 37% of sales. So just kind of wondering if this was in the same range this quarter?
BernieBlegen: Yes, the reason that we use that stuff on sort of a one time basis was to really give order of magnitude to just how dynamic this new product introduction is as a component to our growth. So right now, obviously, in such a short one quarter term, it hasn't changed a whole lot up or down. But it's really not something that we want to be reporting on an ongoing basis. 
MichaelHsing: Yes, I think the last time we reported, is that 37%? Yes, I actually went back and look at it and was-- we actually cannibalize ourselves. And I think that's a better way, okay, rather than other big guys eat us alive. And I think that we cannibalize a quite a bit, okay; I think is somewhere as a 10% range. Okay, all these new products, we cannibalize it. And that's why the numbers are so high.
BernieBlegen: But I would say that when there's cannibalization involved, you can bet that for market share gains against our peer companies that's really the leverageable part of this story.
Operator: Our next question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham.
QuinnBolton: Hey, guys. Just wanted to follow up on Joshua's question on gross margins. I know in the near term, better overhead absorption is driving the better margins. But if you guys have access to capacity, and most of your competitors getting strained, I'm wondering, is there any room for you to get a little bit more to raise pricing in certain segments to take advantage of that capacity support? Or will you just continue to kind of put your foot on the pedal and try to drive as much revenue through that additional capacity to support rather than trying to do it through pricing?
MichaelHsing: Well, yes, MPS is still a smaller, is a smallest analog semiconductor business, and at the same times, we want to have a deliver a consistent result. And so now you see the margin even in this period, we don't fluctuate a lot because we don't -- we just pass on our costs to our customers, and we don't randomly just raise because we can now the shortage, we can gouging a price, okay, and that affected our long-term relationship with our customers. And so we just maintain that and maintain our margins. Okay, I think this strategy fits everything, fits for us, yes.
Operator: As there are no further questions, I would now like to turn the webinar back over to Bernie.
Bernie Blegen: I'd like to thank you all for joining us for this webinar and look forward to talking with you again during our third quarter webinar, which will likely be at the end of October. Thank you and have a nice day.
Michael Hsing: Have a nice day.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-05-04 17:00:00) =====
Genevieve Cunningham: Welcome everyone to the MPS First Quarter 2021 Earnings Webinar. Please note that this webinar is being recorded and will be archived for one year on our Investor Relations page at www.monolithicpower.com. My name is Genevieve and I will be the moderator for this webinar. Joining me today are Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS; and Bernie Blegen, VP and CFO. In the course of today's conference call, we will be making forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management's current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today.
Bernie Blegen: Thanks Genevieve. MPS posted record first quarter revenue of $254.5 million 53.5% higher than the first quarter of 2020. The year-over-year revenue increase represented strength in the overall market and more importantly, broad-based market share gains resulting from customer acceptance of our new product introductions. 37% of our first quarter 2021 revenue resulted from new products introduced in the last three years. New product acceptance on this scale has paved the way for accelerated growth. Looking at our revenue by market, first quarter 2021 revenue from consumer markets of $66.2 million increased $28.8 million or 77.1% from the same period of 2020. The year-over-year revenue increase reflected a broad increase in overall demand. Along with the initial ramp - revenue ramp from our new mobile device charging IC. Consumer revenue represented 26.0% of our Q1 revenue compared with 22.6% contribution in the first quarter of 2020. First quarter 2021 automotive revenue of $44.9 million grew 92.5% over the same period of 2020. This growth primarily reflected continuing sales growth for infotainment, safety and connectivity application products and first time revenue from products introduced in the 2021 model year. Automotive revenue represented 17.6% of MPS’ first quarter 2021 revenue compared with 14.1% in the previous year.
Genevieve Cunningham: Thank you, Bernie. . Our first question comes from Joshua Buchalter of Cowen. Joshua, your line is now open.
Joshua Buchalter: Yes, thanks for taking my question and congrats on another set of solid results. I was hoping you could elaborate on the inventory dynamics. You're one of the few companies that invested proactively ahead of the supply issues across the industry, but you're still not near your 180 to 200-day target. So just wondering how you're thinking about balancing rebuilding the channel versus, taking businesses some of your peers can serve or endorse of your share gains? Thank you.
Michael Hsing: Well, as we expand, continue to expand our capacities, as we said it earlier - as we said it in last quarters. And I think that - we expected it with a current rate of increase the capacity will be at the end of the year or early next year. So we achieved that type of inventories. So if the demand is not continued to increase this much.
Bernie Blegen: And I think it's notable, Josh, that we did increase both in terms of dollars and days, the amount of inventory we had from Q4 to Q1, which runs counter to the capacity constraints that some peer companies are experiencing.
Joshua Buchalter: Got it, thank you that makes sense. And any more granularity you can provide in the guidance by end market for next quarter, any of the buckets moving materially more than the others? Thanks and congrats again.
Michael Hsing: Yes, I would probably look to computing where there was a couple quarter gap in data center that data center should begin to take off again. I think automotive appears to be continuing to grow nicely both in terms of year-over-year performance and sequentially. And also we're seeing that same continuation in consumer.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question comes from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Ross, your line is now open.
Ross Seymore: Hi guys, thanks for letting me ask a question. I want to talk about the sustainability of demand. Recently in this earning season, a lot of semi-stocks have sold off on really good numbers. And it clearly looks like the market is worried about double ordering those sorts of peak cyclical activities?
Michael Hsing: Yes, okay and of course, we concerning a double okay I mean in the past, we said okay, we have a rigorous procedures and okay to prevent that, okay. And we partial - we practicing partial shipments in the last six quarters, and we make sure so like - our customers have a very minimal on hand inventories. And the same times - we're not preventing their line downs okay their production line downs. To go back to your questions what's the demand and okay we believe and a lot of our demand is sustainable. The reason we said that, Bernie said earlier in a script and that for us these are Greenfield market, Greenfield product lines, we started to grow and as Bernie said, 37% of our products, we grow all from new products that we released from last three years. And there is no reason to believe next two years, and next years and not even talking about next six months. I'm talking about next couple years. These products will continue to grow. And at the same times, and with the product that we released in the last two years, that will continue to turn into revenues in the 12 months later. So we believe our growth is sustainable.
Ross Seymore: Okay, thanks Michael. I guess for my follow-up a little more specific on one of your segments, the communications area has been very, very volatile. I know there is bans on different customers that can ship at different points in times. But can you talk a little bit about what's driving the sequential growth that was up so much in the first quarter, admittedly off of a weaker fourth quarter? And then as this year progresses, how do you see that market specifically more at the 5G side of things rather than the networking and gateway sides?
Michael Hsing: We see as a matter of fact, I see have talk to - we have a committee casing meetings with the top tiers and a non-Chinese 5G makers okay and that market segment. So we're picking up and we’ll believe, okay they believe this year and in the next year, they're on the delinquency to.
Bernie Blegen: We believe we're very well positioned just as Michael said there, because the reach of new customers that we're addressing the 5G solutions is very broad. So, we think that as the market gains momentum, we're very well positioned to take full advantage of it.
Ross Seymore: Great thanks, guys and congrats again.
Michael Hsing: Thank you.
Bernie Blegen: Thank you.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question comes from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Tore, your line is now open.
Tore Svanberg: Yes, thank you, Michael and Bernie, congrats again on a very strong quarter. First question, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about your share gains especially during times when capacities really tight. So your solutions tend to be more integrated especially versus discrete and a lot of those discretes are in shortage. So I'm just wondering if you are seeing and acceleration in your share gains during this very tight semiconductor environment?
Michael Hsing: Well, if examples and I can give you a couple of example - couple of scenarios and okay, if we were in a - it’s a dual sources and our competitors using - our customers using dual source or triple source. And I was tend to be in a lot more a fewer components, then our competitor. And that is a one interpretation why the demands and we’re gaining so much demand. And another scenario is for the futures, and we gain a lot of market shares, because just recently, because - for those new - there are new project the shippings, they were putting up production for next six to 12 months. And we have a lot of design win lately.
Tore Svanberg: Great and as my follow-up, and you talked about the contribution from the new products, I know you're not going to give us specific information on pricing. But is it fair to say that the ASP is now of those new products are considerably higher than perhaps the last year or two?
Michael Hsing: Yes for the gross margins we stay on course and we are not looking for a price hiking, price hikes okay I mean and that's probably is not sustainable? So like I think probably protects our models and again and going the same train as before, okay and Bernie.
Bernie Blegen: Yes, and just to add to that yes, certainly the new products that we're introducing, and particularly those that are more heavily integrated. The mix of business does favor higher ASP for those new products.
Tore Svanberg: Yes, that's what I thought. Okay thank you congrats again.
Michael Hsing: Thank you.
Bernie Blegen: Thank you.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question comes from William Stein of Truist. William, your line is now open.
William Stein: Great, thanks for taking my questions. Bernie, you think it was you in the opening remarks? You said something about paved the way for accelerated growth? We all know Monolithic done pretty amazing job with regard to growth relative to the industry. But should we interpret that as meaning perhaps we stay above 20% for a more protracted period of time?
Michael Hsing: I think that's all we see announced. And what we see announced and that could be in a year or two years ago. So that can only grow like 8% again mean the last year 30 somethings and that, and this year so far sort of we're in a very high percentage. And so we're look this kind of way it will continue.
Bernie Blegen: Yes, I think that's the message that we've tried to say in the formal comments. And Michael added to that, if you look at the reason for our growth, both last year and this year, it has much more to do with market share gains and new products and having developed our supply chain than it does necessarily rely upon just the broader market. And so, certainly in 2019, we had high expectations, and we were - we're not immune to downturns in the market. But I think that if we have a more normalized demand, that we can perpetuate this accelerated rate of revenue growth, perhaps in excess of the 20% mark.
William Stein: And then along these lines, I think a couple of other questions might have even alluded to it with regard to higher ASP, I think of a big driver of that is your transition to selling more of these modules those types of more complex integrated solutions? Is that the case and I'm hoping you might quantify that for us I think in the past you've talked about growth rates at least to offline of the module business maybe you can talk about whether this is reaching a size where it makes sense to disclose revenue from that piece?
Michael Hsing: Yes, the module business is doing really well and like I mean and a modules/e-commerce business is doing really well. And I think we're beginning to find a way how to grow that. That business by no mean this is a - full blown business yet again, we haven't really break it out. And but that business announced and okay, IC it in - it's much higher ASP. And that will start to grow like a two years out will be a significant difference - and a significant contribution to the revenue growth.
Bernie Blegen: One other aspect to add Will is, that if you look at certain of our end markets, and I'll pick automotive as an example, much more of what they're demanding is not for a specific IC, they want to have a system solution. So if you look for example, autonomous driving or ADAS there has to be built in failsafe redundancy. You have to have system communications throughout and the example I'm using here, that coordinate that the cameras, the sensors and the processor. And so you're buying, you're creating entire chipsets for a dynamic solution. And just by the natural consequence of how you're designing those solutions that have significantly higher ASPs.
Michael Hsing: Yes, and to elaborate on that, and that these are not restricted to only a semiconductor that we design and we offer an entire solutions. And we design like and MPS don't produce anything, but MPS okay, including semiconductor, we design a semiconductor at the same time, we design other components. And we'll - now as Bernie said earlier, even in the automotive business, we're selling solutions, rather than in the past, we’re selling a single piece of silicon in a two or three years later. I don't know - how can you specify as MPS is a semiconductor company, but we're a solution providers. And then we sell solutions, much higher, higher ASP.
William Stein: Yes that's great. Thanks, guys.
Michael Hsing: Thank you.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question comes from David Williams of Loop Capital. David, your line is now open.
David Williams: Thank you, and congrats on the quarter.
Michael Hsing: Thanks, David.
David Williams: I wanted to touch on the capacity expansion and you had mentioned this earlier. But how is that progressing? And I guess, is it moving at the same pace as you would have expected just kind of given some of the tightness that we're seeing within the industry - or maybe is that moving - at your the pace you expected and maybe the pricing of that anything surprising there?
Michael Hsing: Yes, capacity expansions - we mentioned about six quarters ago. So again I mean we steadily an increase in the last years and we did some extra work okay, to increase the capacity okay and from now on probably pretty continuous - kind of increase okay. And so Bernie, you can comment on that okay.
Bernie Blegen: Yes, I think that we've been clear that in 2020, we brought up the 12-inch fab. And now we're continuing to qualify parts on that. In 2021, we're midstream and bringing up an 8-inch capacity. We're continuing to qualify parts. One of the underreported stories here is that we have existing relationships with our fab partners that date back as long as 15 to 20 years. And they're excellent relationships. And we have been able to manage both in terms of when there's under capacity and over capacity, where we have very even handed relationships. So even within our existing foundation or base, that they've been encouraged and been very positive contributors to helping us add capacity as well. So I think the important point here, as we said in our earlier comments, is that continuous investment has always been a part of MPS. It's a differentiator and that we see it as being able to expand over the next several years in order to keep up with the increased demand that we're anticipate.
David Williams: Great, and then maybe just on the leverage, do you think that's remaining in the model here? Obviously, there's quite a bit that's embedded but how - we're thinking that gross margin at the brand and maybe even the operating margin. Where do you think those could go to as you really start to hit on all cylinders and get the revenue acceleration that you've mentioned?
Michael Hsing: Well as revenue acceleration, we need to continue to invest. And obviously, as we can't grow out of thin air so many times, okay. And as long - as the growth rate there, can we see the growth rate in the next four years in the next four months. And once we see that we will invest.
David Williams: Thank you.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question comes from Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer. Rick, your line is now open.
Rick Schafer: Thanks. Hey guys, I'll add my congratulations as well. Maybe a couple questions by end market I guess the first one is automotive. I think you guys outgrew SAR by 35%, 40% last year. And I know tight component supplies, kind of curved first quarter auto production didn't seem to hurt you guys too much. I know your auto business I think was up almost 100%? So I guess my question is, do you see that as a as an ongoing risk or something, that could impact your auto growth I'm curious. You almost doubled it this past quarter I mean, could it have been better if it weren't for components, supply constraints out there, whether they're direct or indirect or I guess any signs things - are things getting better yet in that auto food chain?
Michael Hsing: Yes, whether as our growth is restricted by the shortage of a component from our customer size, okay we don't really know okay. I mean but on the other hand, we have total market share is addressable market where MPS is so small, so teeny tiny. And so, we will notice it, and all these Greenfield product growth okay I mean and these are new demand. And right off the bat okay and these products is just taking off.
Rick Schafer: Okay thanks sorry Bernie.
Bernie Blegen: I'm sorry, just to add one more quick comment we have seen nothing at this point, to indicate that there's necessarily been a slowdown in ordering and automotive. So again as Michael said, we can't make a guess as far as you know, whether there is a limit on demand. But we see continued strong numbers of our backlog.
Rick Schafer: Great, thanks. And maybe just a follow-up on hyperscale as you highlighted, Bernie. I think you've mentioned hyperscale spend kind of picking up or data center starting to show signs of life. So I'm curious, just with the launch of Ice Lake and things are - we are picking that up hearing that elsewhere as well, but hyperscale is getting better. How do you see I guess QSMOD data center? How do you see that ramping this year? I mean, is it relatively linear from here? Are we going to see a second half inflection of some kind? Is that kind of build some inertia? And I'm also curious, I think last quarter, you talked about 48-volt a little bit. I don't know, is it - is it still much too small to kind of break out or talk about, or can you give a sense of what kind of contribution 48-volt QSMODs is now? Thanks.
Bernie Blegen: Sure. So let me start with the 48-volt question. I believe that there is significant growth opportunity for us in 48-volt. I think we're very well positioned as far as both GPUs and down the road in the eventual.
Michael Hsing: AI.
Bernie Blegen: Yes AI applications and there are even automotive applications that were positioned there.
Michael Hsing: And that these are - it’s not in the six months, probably nine months will the revenue will be significantly up.
Bernie Blegen: Yes. So then turning to your other point, the point of inflection for QSMOD, and remember, just for everybody else's benefit that's our dynamic power management for the CPU processor. That really, we see good growth in what we refer to as VR 13.5. But it's when it goes to seven nanometer VR 14, which is expected for next year that, that's where we might get much more of an uplift market share gains.
Rick Schafer: Got it thank you, guys.
Operator: Our next question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham. Quinn, your line is now open.
Quinn Bolton: Thanks, I will offer for my congratulations. Michael and Bernie, I guess my first question is I think you've sort of said 2020 and 2021 would be investment years, which would somewhat constrain your operating margin. Here in the near-term, it looks like your revenues is coming stronger than expected? And so even with that investment, your up margin is expanding, and if I'm doing my math right, it looks like up margin will be over 31% in June. How should we think about your level of investment as revenue continues to come in better than expected? Will you continue to invest or do you think you'll drive further operating leverage going forward?
Michael Hsing: I think up to - from now we see the growth opportunity is, even higher than the last - than the three years ago. And so we will continue to invest and okay, as long as we see that okay as long as we can keep up that kind of growth rate. And if not - we’ll definitely slow it down okay and until we regroup okay. So far - we see too much opportunities.
Bernie Blegen: I guess that's a good problem.
Michael Hsing: Yes.
Bernie Blegen: Yes Quinn, I do think that there are further opportunities for operating margin expansion. But I think that we've tried to be clear on this Quinn. In particular the last 18 months, that we see that there's more value to our shareholders in being able to accelerate the rate of revenue growth. And that's really where we've been putting most of our emphasis on.
Quinn Bolton: Got it? And the second question is, I think you touched on some of this with your disclosure, that new products were 37% of sales, but obviously, is the investment community worries about how much double ordering may be going on, given the overall industry tightness? I guess I'm wondering, do you guys have a figure you can give us for the percentage of your products that are either sole sourced, and/or new products? Because I think where, you know, the threat of double ordering maybe would be on older products that are dual source? And so I guess I'm trying to figure out, what percent of your revenue today might be from older products, that that could have alternative sources?
Michael Hsing: Yes, let me put it that way okay. We have 37% of our products, okay, we have a 4,000, 5,000 products. So think about it and again, and these are 37% and okay of our product in January all these revenue as a portion of our revenue still relatively small. And still in the ramping stage and those products - they are mostly a single source. And as you say that these are legacy products and okay, once the production volume ramps somewhere into the stabilizer and that they will have a second source. And of course, we clearly, we experienced some urgency for - even double ordering okay. And as we said we try to keep them very, very minimal, and okay I mean and just prevent them from lying down at the same times and prevent - we prevent them to have - to carry too much of inventory. I don't know if I answer your questions maybe Bernie you can.
Quinn Bolton: Yes that's helpful. I guess my last quick one for you. Bernie, do you expect to increase your absolute inventory dollars on hand in the June quarter?
Bernie Blegen: Yes, currently, that's what we're modeling yes. Now again, Michael is careful to add that, this is the supply chain, we have pretty good visibility on the demand. We have to continually try to test and make sure we understand that. So on the supply chain we are looking at continuing to increase the dollar value of inventory sequentially in quarters. And demand, we just have to continue to reassess. But as Michael also said, our time horizon has more to do on the demand front, over the next 15 to 18 months as opposed to anything that we're concerned about in the next quarter or two.
Quinn Bolton: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Kevin Garrigan of Rosenblatt. Kevin, your line is now open.
Kevin Garrigan: Hi guys, let me echo my congratulations on the quarter. Just a quick one from me, you alluded a little to it before, I was just kind of wondering how your MPS now service and e-commerce business did this quarter. And how that compares to last quarter, which I believe also had some pretty strong growth, and just kind of looking a little further out, as things start to open back up, do you think that business will take a pause?
Michael Hsing: I don't think it's a business taking a pause, and we just started - that would be very upsetting us, is simply just taking pause okay. And if we’re taking a pause okay I mean we probably won't. At this time, we're still learning and may take a pause okay I mean and that's something we haven't really figured okay I mean. But so far as in the last - four, five quarters okay I mean, and the measurements that were in place, and that we’re putting place and okay they are keep going up and orders and the interacting and demand creating the value for the index for demand - creation is to keep increasing. And I think they were turning to our revenues and okay and turning to a much bigger revenues.
Bernie Blegen: Yes Kevin, if I could add to that a little bit is the e-commerce and the MPS now are just two legs or two aspects of the much larger story of how we transition from an IC company to a solutions provider. That also includes providing fully complete reference designs and a broad array of solutions in all of our different end markets. So this is really proving the longer-term model. And while we are still learning and the numbers are still relatively small, we're in the early innings of this. Everything is very encouraging that we're headed in the right direction and on to something that is very sustainable.
Kevin Garrigan: Got it, that's very helpful. Thanks, guys.
Michael Hsing: Thank you.
Genevieve Cunningham:  As there are no further questions, I would now like to turn the webinar back over to Bernie.
Bernie Blegen: Thanks, Genevieve. I'd like to thank you all for joining us for the Q1 2021 earnings webinar. I look forward to talking to you again during our second quarter conference call which will likely be in July. Thank you. Have a nice day.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-02-04 17:00:00) =====
Genevieve Cunningham: Welcome everyone to the MPS Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Webinar. Please note that this webinar is being recorded and will be archived for one year on our Investor Relations page at monolithicpower.com. My name is Genevieve Cunningham and I will be the moderator for this webinar. Joining me today are Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS; and Bernie Blegen, VP and CFO. In the course of today's conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management's current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today.
Bernie Blegen: Thanks Gen. For the full year 2020, MPS achieved record revenue $844.5 million, growing 34.5% from the prior year. This performance represented consistent execution against our strategies and being recognized by more first tier companies for superior technologies, product quality and excellent customer. As we see more high quality growth opportunities ahead of us, we continue to successfully invest in our infrastructure and capabilities that support that growth. Here are a few highlights, which we achieved in 2020. Brought online a new 12-inch fab one year ahead of schedule allowing for qualified parts to be shipped in Q4 of this year. We will continue to invest in the capacity and diversity of our supply chain with plans to bring up a new 8-inch fab in 2021; began volume shipments of 48 volt QSMOD technology for AI applications, proving the commercial viability of our leading edge system solutions in this critically important market; Designed an integrated power management solution for autonomous driving vehicles. Shipments began to ramp in Q3 of 2020. Launched our ESG website, aggregating all of our environmental, social and governance values, policies and practices into one easily access location. Customers, employees, shareholders are now able to fully appreciate MPS's commitment to sustainability, transparency of our business practices and our ongoing social responsibility.
A - Genevieve Cunningham: Thank you, Bernie. Analysts, I would now like to begin our Q&A session.  Our first question is from Matt Ramsay from Cohen. Matt, your line is now open.
Matt Ramsay: Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Good evening everybody. Hey, Michael and Bernie. Hope you're well. My first question is around the supply that you guys are bringing online. You talked about a couple of different efforts and you have done over the last few quarters to add supply. And I guess, Michael, I wonder if you might characterize it as -- anyway, one, how much supply can you bring online and say the immediate term versus over the next couple of years to support what revenue levels?
Michael Hsing: Well, we said in a couple of quarters ago, we're building a capacity to bidding dollars capability. And so that's all our long-term strategy. We'll do that anyway. And just reason -- in a reason from a last year we pulling a little faster, like we can active -- anticipated these goes up and down. So, as we play for a long-term futures and -- but in the recent years, obviously, with the pulling and increased capacities, okay, as we started in the early last year and we are a little bit ahead of the game -- ahead of the market demands. And from -- looking at near futures we are continued to do so. We still facing delinquent.
Matt Ramsay: Got it. No, that makes sense in the long-term. I guess for my follow-up question is a more near term oriented one. Bernie, if you might give some color as how you're expecting -- I mean, the guidance was well above consensus for the March quarter. Maybe you could talk about it by segment what you're expecting the trends to be as you move from December into March. Thanks guys.
Bernie Blegen: Sure. I think that we saw in 2020 that revenue in both automotive and industrial were probably most heavily impacted because of the COVID pandemic. So what we saw in the second half of the year is that both of those two markets showed marked improvement and have significant momentum as we go into 2021. But really we're broad based. So a lot of the trends that we saw that we benefited from in 2020 will continue on, possibly the only exception is communications, which had a strong three quarters that would be difficult to compare against.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Tore Svanberg from Stifel. Tore, your line is now open.
Tore Svanberg: Yes. Thank you. Congratulations on the execution. So far I think you're the only company that I've seen actually increasing your inventory days. So, congratulations on that too. Last quarter you talked about the size of the delinquencies you had in 2019. Could you give us a ballpark for where they stand right now?
Michael Hsing: I think last quarter -- we talk about last couple of quarters, we have continued facing a delinquent -- delinquencies and this quarter is in the last quarter we are relatively similar and two quarters ago we're facing a bit quite more.
Bernie Blegen: Yeah. And I think that that's a reflection of continued strong demand in the face of industry-wide capacity constraints. So, we've actually had to manage at this level now for about the last three to four quarters. And I'm not saying that we're getting good at it, but we're certainly believe we have it as well under control as possible, a good handle on it. So that we're escalating shipments only based on the needs of the end-user, as opposed to anyone building inventory in either the channel or on customer shelves. And the reason we can meet the most off our customer's demand is -- due to we end -- we add a capacity at the beginning of last year and now we can fulfill most of it.
Tore Svanberg: Very good. And as my follow-up on capacity, you talked about the second 12-inch, also new 8-inch. I know you typically don't name your foundries on these calls. But could you at least talk about sort of the geographical aspect to where your foundry partners are at this point?
Michael Hsing: Now, we tried to diversify outside the China as we speaking and these fabs what could be -- we're still exploring and engaged -- at the beginning of the engagement with both -- with a fab within China and outside of China.
Tore Svanberg: Great. Thank you very much. Congrats again.
Bernie Blegen: Thanks Tore.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is for Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Ross, your line is now open.
Ross Seymore: Hi, guys. Can you hear me?
Michael Hsing: Yes. Loud, clear.
Bernie Blegen: Hi, Ross.
Ross Seymore: Hi, there. So congratulations on the growth, especially impressive, not only relative to the analog group, but the diversity of it. As you looked at 2020 is a whole, other than the year-over-year in coms, which I know is difficult. You talked a little bit about you expected to be diverse. If you just said, what some of the idiosyncratic drivers, company specific things in 2020 would be just a kind of by end market, obviously not customer specific.
Bernie Blegen: Sure. I think that in the computing, we had seen in 2018 and 2019 a run up in notebooks and really in 2020 it was increased demand in the data center, both in terms of powering servers, as well as the storage. In the consumer market, we've benefited from the once every three year refresh of the gaming console. And also we saw a nice uptick, both in home appliances, as well as wearables or mobility. And then when we look at industrial and automotive, as I said earlier, both of those seem to be handicapped at the beginning of the year where we have design wins, but we can't guarantee what the market circumstances are going to be. So, the unit sales on some of the new products we were introduced were a little limited, but certainly showed a lot of strength in the second half of the year.
Ross Seymore: And actually, Bernie, forgive me if I misspoke. I was actually talking more about 2021. What those drive -- similar sort of story, but 2021 more looking forward then back.
Michael Hsing: I think it's a repeat of same -- it’s a 2020 to 2021.
Bernie Blegen: I'd say the only thing in the first half that gives us a little pause aside from the communications comparable is that there's probably going to be some softness in the first half of the year related to computing on the -- at the data center. But outside of that, Michael's exactly right.
Ross Seymore: Well, maybe that's a good …
Michael Hsing: But the softness -- it's not going down. So, still going as not as a strong, but the demand is still -- slightly more than we expected. Yeah.
Ross Seymore: Got it. And then I guess as my real follow-up. A lot of companies are questioning the sustainability of this demand and I know crystal balls are always foggy. But you guys would grow if I just analyze your first quarter guidance, 15%. I know seasonality might not be the breast framework, but there seems to be an active debate amongst investors on is, are things just too hot and there's got to be a stumble because there's excess ordering, inventory is going to build et cetera, et cetera. How are you guys viewing that kind of supply versus demand balance and the trust in the quality of the orders?
Michael Hsing: Well -- and if you look at it in the past three or four years, okay, I mean, we grow some things like in -- from 17% to 25% in the levels. In 2019, right, we grow only 8% and -- but our designing -- all these opportunities still there. Okay? I mean, we just shifted to -- from 2019 to 2020. And so again, in the automotive, industrial in the first half a year, wasn't there. So like a catch up in the second half a year. And in a computing, communications and -- what else I'm missing
Bernie Blegen: Consumers.
Michael Hsing: Yeah, consumers, okay. In the beginning, is a stronger than -- a little bit stronger than normal. And I will say that it's probably even out from 2019s and this year we can see that -- we never forecast a macro economy condition, but we do see these product and we facing a shortages on Amazon's on these the Best Buy and we believe these all are real.
Ross Seymore: Okay. Thank you and congrats.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Rick Schafer from Oppenheimer. Rick, your line is now open.
Rick Schafer: Thanks. And let me add my congratulations on the execution guys. I'm sure it wasn't easy up there this quarter, especially. A couple of questions. I guess I'd like to ask about a couple of your bigger growth pillars, maybe start with auto. I think it grew about 15% last year, with SAR down about 15. So just optically, it looks like you guys could do something around 50% growth this year. I mean, maybe you could talk about what leads that growth. I mean, is it ADAS, body control? Does BMS kick-in at all and kind of add -- give a little more wind to the sales this year. And I guess the second part of that question, I'm just curious, are you worried at all about indirect supply constraints, potentially limiting -- limiting your upside here?
Michael Hsing: Let me talk about your second part first. Growth overall for MPS is limiting by our capacities and utilization of a total capacity. As you know, we have a few thousand -- 4,000 parts and it's inconceivable. We can utilize it in the entire capacities. For the auto growth, yes, okay, we -- as Bernie said earlier, we have ADAS in the stock to rent in the last quarter or so. And we have more customers start to ramp that can -- these are the very high end product and we are very pleased with it Other products in orders, we talk about it in the past, okay, from a lighting to liftgates to -- all the other power modules in auto and now we see start to ramp. We just -- just at the beginning we see all these products start to ramp. But these are still at the beginning.
Bernie Blegen: And Rick, just one more point is that, I think we've read that the auto industry is suffering from its own capacity issues or being able to have a stable supply chain. As I look at our Q1 numbers that is not directly impacting our demand or our ability to ship.
Michael Hsing: Yeah. We are so small in a market presence in auto industry, but all of these initial ramp and it changes the needles in a revenue stream.
Rick Schafer: Thanks. And that's kind of what I was asking about. Just worried if those secondary supply constraints could end up hurting -- somebody else can't ship. Maybe my second question, Michael, just on cloud server. If you could talk about how that data center ramp looks like for QSMOD this year? I mean, it's isolate still a needle mover, or is it really more Sapphire Rapids later this year where you were kind of maybe potentially see a step function in revenues as that starts to pick up?
Michael Hsing: Yeah. I can't relate those acronym, these names with that. I know the VR 13.5 is mostly -- is a ramp -- is a ramping now, as we see the revenue growth. Now VR 14, I think is a -- that'll be a next year story.
Rick Schafer: Thanks.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Alex Vecchi from William Blair. Alex, your line is now open.
Alex Vecchi: Hi, guys. Congratulations on the impressive quarter from me as well. Maybe Bernie, just on a more housekeeping question, your guidance for gross margin at the midpoint is looking flat quarter-over-quarter. Is that a -- is that due to end market mix or are you seeing any increasing manufacturing costs weighing on margins? And then, how should we think about sort of that resumption back to the 10 to 20 basis points going forward?
Michael Hsing: Yes. We -- obviously now you see the consumers segment is growth too, and we have some -- and the slightly, or even with the lower gross margin. On the other hand, yes. The manufacturer costs is going up.
Alex Vecchi: Okay. That's helpful. And then just on your inventory days, you guys have talked in the past about the 180, 200 day target. You've made some improvements quarter. How do we think about getting back to an ideal inventory level in terms of timing?
Michael Hsing: Well, it's -- demand keep coming as is now. It wouldn't be difficult. We think about it end of the end of the year, we hope we will can go back to 180 to 200 days of inventory.
Bernie Blegen: Yeah. I think if you look at whether it's the inventory that we hold on our books or particularly in the channel, it's very lean right now, and then we've already discussed delinquencies. So, we have a lot of catch up to do before we really can get the model to the 180 to 200-day goal.
Alex Vecchi: Understood. That's it for me. I'll pass it along to the next.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Quinn Bolton from Needham. Quinn, Your line is now open.
Quinn Bolton: Hey, guys. I will offer my congratulations as well. Just wanted to follow-up on Alex's question on the delinquencies and your ability to catch up with some of those delinquencies. I mean, how much of the ability to meet those delinquencies is going to come from the new 12-inch fab that you brought online in the fourth quarter of last year. Are you able to qualify more parts and other high volume runners on that fab? Or just kind of curious your ability to actually get to secure more wafer capacity from your five foundry partners in this very tight environment. I guess, a lot of companies are saying that they think supply constraints -- supply is going to remain constraint all year, which makes it sound like being able to get back to 180 to 200 days, delinquencies is a pretty tall order in calendar 2021.
Bernie Blegen: Yeah. It's a great question. And thanks for allowing us the opportunity to give a little more context here. With the new fab, I mean, we were very pleased to report is one of our highlights that we were able to qualify parts and be able to inventory and ship them. But that process of qualifying more parts so that it can be meaningful as far as both deliveries and the dressing our delinquencies is ongoing. And it's going to require an investment both in the 12-inch capability, as well as this new fab that we're bringing up in 2021. So just because we've qualified a few parts and we've got the process started, it still takes about nine to 12 months before you have the full capability of.
Michael Hsing: In 2020, we increase our capacity by 25%. It's -- pointing of off from my head, my rough calculations is about 20% to 25% increase last year.
Quinn Bolton: I guess, my follow-up question was just on the comms space. Obviously, you had three very strong quarters in 2020, and then one of your large customers was no longer able to ship. I believe you may now have a license to resume shipments to that customer. And I'm just wondering if that's the case, do you have now perhaps a better outlook than you might have 90 days ago for the comms business in 2021?
Michael Hsing: Absolutely. We will have a more clear -- and the customer start to place -- placing orders now.
Bernie Blegen: Yeah. And I think there's two forms. There's a -- you identified one customer in particular. And I think we might see that begin to ramp in the second half of this year. But I think more broadly other opportunities are starting to come on not just with the top tier, but some of the second tier customers in the 5G and infrastructure area.
Quinn Bolton: Great. Thank you.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from William Stein from Truist. William, your line is now open.
William Stein: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Michael, I'm wondering if you can update us on the longer term transition to selling more modules. I know that's something that is from a long-term perspective, potentially very creative to growth and margins. I think we're still pretty early in that process, but any movement in the quarter that you'd like to highlight?
Michael Hsing: I think it's -- the result is a very good in the middle of this high demand. Actually, Bernie can tell you what is the ramps, okay, what is the increase.
Bernie Blegen: Yeah. We had -- revenue doubled in 2020, and we exited the year where it continued to increase sequentially quarter. And it's interesting because we thought that it would have more narrow applications, particularly in industrial. But in fact, it's proven to be very broad based and also is sustainable. What I mean by that last point is that we thought that if people want to unit volumes, they might be more likely to go to components and just buy Silicon. And in fact, we're seeing a lot of people that are going into volume shipments with the modules as well.
Michael Hsing: Yeah. It's all across our product lines. That's so I don't have total numbers for the modules that are -- in roughly, so like a $30 million, $40 million now, okay, I mean, compare a year ago. As Bernie said, it is half of that.
William Stein: Great. And then one other thing I'd like to ask about is your MPS NOW service, did you see any change in that in the quarter? I know that's something that seemed to come online sort of just in time for the work-from-home COVID situation that I think was very helpful for you. Any change in that and any anticipated change if we hopefully are able to return to offices in the next quarter or two.
Michael Hsing: Yeah. This is -- it's a great help. We set it up, okay, just at the beginning of our -- just the right before pandemics. All these softwares, videos everything's and also the bench, okay, the working bench, we just set that up we turn it on when the pandemic happens and it's receiver enormous praise from our customers. And in terms of how many new customers, we are really, really careful about. We increased a few thousand percent from the videos, from the virtual bench. Yeah.
William Stein: Great. Thank you.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Kevin Garrigan from Rosenblatt. Kevin, your line is now open.
Kevin Garrigan: Hi, guys. Congrats on the quarter and thanks for taking my question. Just a quick one for me. You alluded a little to this earlier, but in your automotive segment, you've expanded into several other features of the automobile besides kind of infotainment. But can you give us -- can you talk a little bit about some of your design wins there? Are you kind of seeing more design wins and the ones you already have, how are kind of those progressing?
Michael Hsing: Well, I think I should answer Rick Schafer's questions the more precise. The BMS is not -- we don't have a clear design wins in all those sites. And -- but to answer -- your question is we have pretty much across the board in from the body controls to ADAS and to lightings and to ADAS and also to all the sensors. And we have pretty much across the board, but our content that we expanded from $150, $140, and essentially doubled it. And -- but everything's at the beginning, while MPS' revenue so small, so we just -- but you see the net change.
Bernie Blegen: On the dollar content, I just want to go back to that because it's an important part is this is not just unit sales, but some of the new applications that we're bringing on. We go from having $10 of available content to upwards of $40 or $50 for a complete system. So, we're getting both the unit as well as the ASP expansion.
Michael Hsing: We're not talking about revenue small as a compare the market opportunity. As we said, we address the $6 billion market segments. And as now all MPS' product became as a total -- that's a total state. And we only have over hundred some million dollars in revenues.
Bernie Blegen: $110 million.
Michael Hsing: Yeah. $110 million in the most of a new product and ramping started from last year, second half of year.
Bernie Blegen: Yeah.
Kevin Garrigan: Okay. Got it. Thank you.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Ross, your line is now open.
Ross Seymore: Hey guys, thanks for letting me ask a couple of quick follow-ups. Just two quick ones. First, you mentioned an answering a prior question about your ability to ship to the formerly banned product or banned customer. Is that just in the comms space or is that ban some of why your computing and storage segment also went down sequentially in the fourth quarter?
Bernie Blegen: Again, we don't generally talk about individual customers. Sine this one's gotten so much visibility. We actually have three primary lines of business with them. One is in the consumer, one is in the data center and the other is an infrastructure.
Ross Seymore: Infrastructure meaning comms, right?
Bernie Blegen: Yes.
Ross Seymore: Gotcha. Okay. And is there any difference in what you're able to ship going forward out of those three things? Are you able to ship all of them, or is it just -- not the 5G stuff, but the other two?
Michael Hsing: Well, our products there -- again, there's a -- says the building blocks, okay. I mean, particularly in form former comm business and also …
Bernie Blegen: Data center.
Michael Hsing: The data centers, okay. And the shared same product. And we don't know exactly what they -- how they divide it. But consumer device -- consumer device more in the chargers, in the -- that we know. It's a pretty much -- it's continues.
Bernie Blegen: Yeah.
Ross Seymore: Gotcha. And then, the last question is a little bit more housekeeping wise. Bernie, what are you thinking about tax rate for 2021?
Bernie Blegen: Yeah. So, on a non-GAAP basis, we've historically used 7.5% and now we've moved to 10%, which represents that there's certain stock comp that is not as a deductible as it was in prior years. And then, looking ahead, we're not going to try to out guess what the Biden administration is going to do. But I think that we need to be sensitive to the fact that there may be increases both in the domestic rate as well as a higher tax rate on any international profits.
Michael Hsing: Yeah. We don't know at this point. 
Ross Seymore: Got it. Thanks guys.
Genevieve Cunningham: If there are any follow-up questions, please click the raise hand button. As there are no further questions, I'd like to turn the webinar back over to Bernie.
Bernie Blegen: Great. Thank you everybody. Appreciate your joining us for this conference call and look forward to talking to you again the first quarter of 2021, which should likely be in the April timeframe. Thanks again, and have a nice day.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-11-01 17:00:00) =====
Genevieve Cunningham: Welcome, everyone, to the MPS Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Webinar. Please note that this webinar is being recorded and will be archived for one year on our Investor Relations page at monolithicpower.com. My name is Genevieve Cunningham and I will be the moderator for this webinar. Joining me today are Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS; and Bernie Blegen, VP and CFO. During this webinar, we will discuss our Q3 2020 financial results and guidance for Q4 2020, followed by a Q&A session. Analysts you are currently needed, if you wish to ask a question during the Q&A session, please click on the participants icon on the menu bar and then click the raise hand button. In the course of today's webinar, we will be making forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management's current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q3 2020 earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on February 28, 2020 and in our Form 10-Q filed on August 3, 2020, which are accessible through our Web site, monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today's call. We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, R&D and SG&A expense, operating income, interest and other income, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the Q3 2019, Q2 2020 and Q3 2020 releases as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our Web site. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bernie Blegen.
Bernie Blegen: Thanks, Gen. MPS achieved record third quarter revenue of $259.4 million, 39.3% higher than revenue in the second quarter of 2020, and 53.7% higher than the comparable quarter in 2019. As noted in our September 14, 2020 update to our Q3 financial guidance, our revenue increased beyond expectations for two key reasons; first, we were able to fulfill our customers' demand that had been delinquent due to past capacity constraints; second, certain China-based customers requested previously scheduled shipment dates be pulled into the third quarter of 2020. We believe this request was related to trade and regulatory policy changes that occurred during the quarter. These two factors contributed significantly to this quarter's performance relative to the prior quarter of 2020 and to Q3 of 2019. Looking at our revenue by market. Third quarter 2020 communications revenue of $54.7 million was up 81.8% from the second quarter of 2020, primarily due to a pull-in of customers requested ship dates. Communications sales represented 21.1% of our total third quarter 2020 revenue. In our consumer markets, third quarter 2020 revenue of $70.2 million increased 47.4% from revenue reported for the prior quarter of 2020. This extraordinary growth in consumer reflects a combination of market share gains in gaming, wearables and IoT applications along with normal seasonality. Consumer revenue represented 27.1% of our third quarter 2020 revenue. In our computing and storage market, third quarter revenue of $75.3 million increased $11.2 million or 17.5% from the second quarter of 2020. The sequential quarterly revenue growth was broad-based with sales gains recorded in high-end notebooks, servers and storage. Computing and storage revenue represented 29% of MPS' third quarter 2020 revenue. Third quarter automotive revenue of $28.5 million grew $10.7 million or 60.4% over the second quarter of 2020. This improvement reflects a more normal ordering level following the Q2 2020 industrywide slowdown resulting from the pandemic. We believe MPS' market share will continue to expand in the coming years as we have been awarded multiple design wins in infotainment, smart lighting, ADAS and autonomous driving. Automotive revenue was 11.0% of MPS' total third quarter 2020 revenue. Third quarter 2020 industrial revenue of $30.7 million increased 15.3% from the second quarter of 2020, due primarily to increased revenue for power sources and industrial meters. Industrial revenue represented 11.8% of our total third quarter 2020 revenue. GAAP gross margin was 55.1%, matching the second quarter of 2020 and 10 basis points lower than the third quarter of 2019. Our GAAP operating income was $60.0 million compared to $28.0 million reported in the second quarter of 2020 and $30.0 million reported in the third quarter of 2019. Non-GAAP gross margin for the second quarter of 2020 was 55.5%, 20 basis points below the gross margin reported for the second quarter of 2020 and 10 basis points lower than the third quarter from a year ago. Our non-GAAP operating income was $84.9 million compared to $53.0 million reported in the prior quarter and $51.4 million reported in the third quarter of 2019. Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $83.1 million in the third quarter of 2020 compared with $74.6 million in the second quarter of 2020 and $63.1 million in the third quarter of 2019. Our non-GAAP third quarter 2020 operating expenses were $59.1 million, up from the $50.7 million we spent in the second quarter of 2020 and up from the $42.5 million reported in the third quarter of 2019. The sequential increase in Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses primarily reflected higher variable costs associated with the increase in revenue and an increased level of investment in securing foundry capacity. The differences between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are stock compensation expense, an income or loss on an unfunded deferred compensation plan. For the third quarter of 2020, total stock compensation expense, including approximately $707,000 charged to cost of goods sold was $23.0 million compared with $21.0 million recorded in the second quarter of 2020. Switching to the bottom-line. Third quarter 2020 GAAP net income was $55.6 million or $1.18 per fully diluted share compared with $30.2 million or $0.64 per share in the second quarter of 2020 and $29.5 million or $0.64 per share in the third quarter of 2019. Q3 non-GAAP net income was $79.4 million or $1.69 per fully diluted share compared with $50.6 million or $1.08 per share in the second quarter of 2020 and $49.5 million or $1.08 per share in the third quarter of 2019. Fully diluted shares at the end of Q3 2020 were $47.0 million. Now let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $554.5 million at the end of the third quarter of 2020 compared to $515.4 million at the end of the second quarter of 2020. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $77.4 million compared with Q2 2020 operating cash flow of $59.3 million. Third quarter 2020 capital spending totaled $19.6 million. Accounts receivable ended the third quarter of 2020 at $93.5 million representing 33 days of sales outstanding which was six days higher than the 27 days reported at the end of the second quarter of 2020 and two days higher than the 31 days at the end of the third quarter of 2019. Our internal inventories at the end of the third quarter of 2020 were $148.1 million, down from the $152.1 million at the end of the second quarter of 2020. Days of inventory of 116 days at the end of the third quarter 2020 were 50 days lower than at the end of the second quarter of 2020. The sequential drop in days inventory on hand represented an anomaly due to a decrease in the dollar value of inventory and a 39% increase in quarterly revenue. Currently, our inventory levels are lean. We are working very hard to return inventory to the 180 to 200-day level necessary to support our future growth. I would now like to turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter of 2020. We are forecasting Q4 revenue in the range of $218 million to $230 million. We also expect the following; GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.1% to 55.7%; non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.4% to 56.0%; total stock-based compensation expense of $21.8 million to $23.8 million, including approximately $700,000 that would be charged to cost of goods sold; GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses between $81.3 million and $85.3 million; non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to be in the range of $60.2 million to $62.2 million; litigation expense should range between $1.8 million to $2.2 million; interest income is expected to range from $1.0 million to $1.4 million; fully diluted shares to be in the range of 47.1 million to 48.1 million shares. In conclusion, we will monitor market conditions closely and continue to execute. I'll now open the webinar up for questions.
A - Genevieve Cunningham: Thank you, Bernie. Analysts, I would now like to begin our Q&A session.  Our first question comes from Tore Svanberg from Stifel. Tore, your line is now open.
Tore Svanberg: Congratulations on the $1 billion run rate. First question is Q4 guidance. Could you talk a little bit about which are some of the end markets that's going to be performing in Q4? Obviously, I know communications is going to be down but what about some of the other markets for the December quarter?
Bernie Blegen: Tore, thanks for commenting on the $1 billion run rate. Yes, if you compare ourselves against Q3, obviously, that was a high watermark. So probably a more relevant comparison is against Q4 of 2019. And on that basis, we're expecting all of our major markets to be up significantly from the prior year. And then, when you do the comparison against Q3, you'll see that there'll probably be declines in communications and computing and also in consumer, the consumer is seasonally adjusted but we'll still expect to see improvements in industrial and automotive.
Tore Svanberg: Very good. And as my follow-up, you mentioned inventories are pretty lean, so can you just elaborate a little bit on what you're doing to try and get the inventories back up? You said you had some OpEx to maybe secure some foundry capacity but anything else you can add on sort of how you're going to get back to that 180 days of inventory?
Bernie Blegen: Sure. I think as we acknowledged in Q3 that we were able to catch up as far as having adequate capacity in order to service near-term demand and in giving guidance for Q4 that expectation follows along. When we look ahead over the course of the next 24 months, we previously mentioned that we're entering into new relationships with other fabs and expect to grow our overall capacity. So this will be an ongoing investment that we would project for at least about the next six quarters.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question comes from David Williams from Loop Capital. David, your line is now open.
Will Stein: I think there is a mistake. It's Will Stein from Truist. How are you? I guess I'll just go. Bernie, first a clarification. The inventory target that you called out in your script, I think you said 180 to 200. I think that's 20 days higher than what you said on the last conference call. Is that correct? And if so, can you help us understand what's changed?
Bernie Blegen: The previous metrics that we had been using were about 20 days lower, but we've really made this change as far as what we've been trying to explain to the analysts and to investors over the course of about the last two to three quarters. But nonetheless, I do want to address your question, which is in order for us to sustain the level of growth that we have in excess of our market, the industry that we have to have a higher level of inventory, so in other words, there is a mismatch. In other words, we are building the inventory today, but we're not going to -- for the sales that will occur one or two quarters out. And so it's not a perfect reflection for other companies where they're not growing as fast. They can maintain lower levels in terms of days, but here, again, we have to make an incremental investment in order to allow to support our growth.
Michael Hsing: Let me add. As you remember, end of the last year and we are at around 200 days of inventory. If we use that model and to meet this year growth, that probably -- that's about the right numbers. That's the basis that's where this 20 more days come from. And so if you go to a little more details and MPS is a fabulous company, and yet, we have own technologies. This is very unique. I can't think of any of our competitors, they're in the same way of manufacturing and they do to fulfill their manufacturing. Most of them, they have their own fab. And so given the volatilities and also given the growth that we have and also number of product and address all the greenfield market segment, we need probably more than 200 days inventories.
Will Stein: Okay. That helps a lot. If I can have one quick follow-up. The guidance, while great overall on revenue and EPS, the margins are a little bit different from what maybe some would have expected. And Bernie, I'm just wondering if you can tell us if the model we should be thinking about, which historically was that gross would grow at 10 to 20 bps a quarter. And op margin, either there was a, I guess, change in that view that perhaps we wouldn't get an operating margin leverage for the next year or two. Maybe you could just update us on that model for both those lines.
Bernie Blegen: Sure. And I think that you captured it very well is that obviously, our model has been to improve gross margin 10 to 20 basis points sequentially. Now a lot of factors weigh into being able to deliver against those results, including both our mix of business as well as what the market looks like. So again, you have to use these as guidelines, not as an absolute guarantee of what our performance will look like. And then, on the operating expenses, right now, we are going to be continuing to invest in capacity as I said in each of the next six quarters. So that will be an additional layer of investment from what we've seen and so as a result we're not projecting our operating margins to improve significantly over the course of the next two years.
Will Stein: OpEx, I think, is that right? In other words, op margin would just expand with gross, which is 10 to 20 bps a quarter? Or...
Bernie Blegen: Yes.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question comes from David Williams from Loop Capital. David your line is now open. Our next question comes from Quinn Bolton from Needham. Quinn your line is now open.
Quinn Bolton: Let me offer my congratulations on a very strong September and good December outlook. Bernie and Michael, these are sort of unprecedented times in the business and I know you don't typically look out more than a quarter. But I guess, one of the questions I'm hearing from investors is, whether there is any sort of inflated demand still impacting the business in the December quarter. And wondering, to the extent you can give us any sort of thoughts on March, would March show a typical seasonal decline from the December quarter of, say, 3% to 5%, what you would see in a typical year or do you think it could show a greater seasonal factor? I know you don't typically go out two quarters, but again, this is really strong results here in the near term.
Michael Hsing: Let me answer that question. If you're talking about normal seasonality then the outlook is great. And we have so many design in activities and we see so many award projects and as well as you know as well as I know, these were in unprecedented era, pandemics and geopolitical issues and I can't predict and frankly, I care less.
Bernie Blegen: And if I can just add to that is that. I really think that there are certain aspects of our business that we have in good control, as Michael hit on as far as the design wind activity, but right now, we do not have control over what the end customer demand is ultimately going to be about. So I think that as far as executing against our strategy and seeing it show up in our results, I think we're going to continue along that path but there are just too many factors for us, it would be pure speculation at this point.
Quinn Bolton: Maybe I could ask, in past calls, you've oftentimes given us some idea of your sort of starting backlog coverage and I know that typically runs a very high percentage of the revenue guidance. I guess is, with some of the delinquencies you had a past quarter, you had very strong backlog. But as you head into the December quarter, so backlog sort of back to more normal levels that it would have typically run in the last couple of years? Is it still elevated? Can you give us any thoughts on kind of the backlog coverage?
Michael Hsing: Well, as the December quarter -- go into December quarters, we are still facing delinquencies. So the capacity is still limited.
Bernie Blegen: And I think what we're seeing here is that, as I said, in the guidance that we offered is it anticipates both the demand, including the backlog that we had coming into the quarter and it's matched with what our supply chain and capacity limits are. So I guess that I would probably offer that we have some ability for upside, but it's going to be a little bit limited by supply chain.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question comes from Alex Vecchi from William Blair. Alex your line is now open.
Alex Vecchi: Michael and Bernie, congratulations, again, in a very volatile environment. If we can just touch base a little more on the automotive segment. This appears to be the highest revenue quarter you guys have posted since really starting to gain traction in the segment. I've realized the environment is just starting now to get a little bit better. But can you maybe update us on how we should think about the long-term growth targets there? In the past, you've said 40% to 60% growth, obviously, that may be a little premature at this point, but perhaps, update us on how you're feeling on that segment.
Bernie Blegen: I would probably say that automotive is one of the more exciting end markets for us for the next several years. Now if you look at our track record in 2019 and 2020, 2019 was affected by the recession, 2020 by factory closings related to the COVID-19 pandemic. So again, those are circumstances that were largely outside of our control. But what we're seeing is that we're expanding now from our traditional infotainment base into some of these more exciting technologies, including the lighting systems, the ADAS and the autonomous driving. So we think that this is a sustainable revenue growth should be well ahead of what our corporate average is going to be. At one time, we were promoting the concept of being able to grow consistently at 20% to 60% per year, but that would probably back off of that down to a more reasonable between 30% and 40%, but still a very exciting end market for us.
Michael Hsing: Bernie  talking. Okay. Frankly, I don't have clear pictures. And what's the growth? Frankly, I never put MPS' as we have to grow a certain percentage, okay? And what I'm looking at it is, what kind of product, which project and how well we're positioned and which customers, which projects we want designing. And a lot more importantly, okay, what kind of products in the pipeline. That really drives the top line. And so how we predicted what's the next lowest growth percentage, I can't tell you.
Alex Vecchi: No, no, that's fair, but it's good to hear that the trajectory seems to be sort of back on track. And then, similarly, I don't think in the prepared comments you guys commented on the extent of the pull-ins into Q3. Is it fair to say that the vast majority of the sequential decline in Q4 is related to the pull-in activities or is there also a little bit of normalization of demand in there as well?
Michael Hsing: Well, we had a lot of pulling from Q3 and partially in Q4. As I said earlier, we're still facing delinquencies. And so I think that's a combination of the growth and also in a capacity shortage from that past. Okay.
Alex Vecchi: From that past, okay. And then lastly, if I can, on just on the days inventory, the 180 to 200 days, how long will it take you to get back to that level? Is that something you can achieve in Q4, we really looking to more the first half of 2021?
Michael Hsing: Well, if the market slows down, we're going to get there quickly. Again, and this is -- we're at uncomfortable levels. I can meet that. And so we want to increase as much as we can. And now our engineers working the fabs, okay, working at the different fabs and to get the -- to qualify the process and technologies. And so, we hope that in the next six months, we can catch up.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question comes from Joshua Buchalter from Cowen. Joshua, your line is now open.
Joshua Buchalter: Let me echo my congrats. As for my first question, earlier this year, you'd mentioned bringing in additional 12-inch fab online in the second half. As I was wondering, was this the primary driver of the additional capacity you were able to secure in the third quarter? And then looking ahead, how much more capacity do you feel you need to both serve your customers and get the inventory levels up to that that you raise 180 to 200 days?
Michael Hsing: Yes. Okay. The first question is, yes, absolutely, okay. We said earlier this year, we expanded another 12-inch fab, wasn't in our plan, but we hurried up and get that thing going. And we start shipping product in Q3. That's unprecedented and thanks to our people. And they really worked in day and night to manage and qualify these products. Going forward, we just want to expand the capacity to reach 180 to 200 days inventory. And going in the future, if we have a very linear world and then it is very easy to calculate. I think we are living in a very non-linear environment and 200 days inventory, that's what we want to do.
Joshua Buchalter: Got it. That's very helpful. And then for my follow-up, a bit of a bigger picture question. I mean, you guys are now $1 billion or you reached $1 billion run rate this quarter. Are you seeing any increase or changes in the competitive responses from your peers as you move higher on both a unit basis and as well in the socket value?
Michael Hsing: Our ASPs increasing and when we move to high-end market segments. And so, our competitions are always pretty similar. I mean our customer doesn't even know MPS' is $1 billion. There are no MPS. MPS is very small potatoes against all these giants.
Bernie Blegen: But I think you go back to what our competitive basis is, and it really is that we're winning with superior technology and a higher level of customer service and I think that's what our customers are recognizing as far.
Michael Hsing: That's right, yes.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question comes from Rick Schafer from Oppenheimer. Rick, your line is now open.
Rick Schafer: Maybe just a quick follow-on, if I can, on that production question. I know you guys have been pulling in new production and foundry partners pretty aggressively. I mean, I know you've spoken, I think in the past about sort of once it's done, the goal is to kind of be at that $1.2 billion or so in kind of annual revenues. And that's not a lot of headroom for you guys at your current run rate at your current growth rate. So I'm curious, is that $1.2 billion still the right number we should be thinking of in terms of your capacity when all said and done? And maybe what does the time line look like for that now since you're pulling stuff in?
Michael Hsing: Yes. Okay. Obviously, the $1.2 billion is not enough. And if you want to building a fast on the 200 days inventories, it's more than double it right now. So that's what we try to do and it's not easy and that's what we're aiming for, just double it.
Bernie Blegen: And I think that in the past, securing fab capacity and being able to introduce new products at the rate that we are is really nothing new to MPS. But the scale has been getting bigger and so that's why the investments and the time that we have to plan ahead makes a difference. And so all we're doing is preparing both for the capacity but also recognizing acknowledging the investment that goes with it.
Rick Schafer: So if we fast forward 18 months, 24 months, I mean, is there a bogey for where you think your capacity will be? I mean if it's not $1.2 billion, I assume higher than that, but I'm just curious if there is a number you can share or if you know at this point?
Michael Hsing: I'm sorry, I wasn't clear. We're shooting for $2 billion.
Rick Schafer: $2 billion? I'm sorry, I misunderstood. Sorry. Thanks Michael. And then just maybe a question, if I could on 5G. And maybe I was hoping you could talk a little bit about your exposure to the Tier-1 5G ran OEMs, the one that you're allowed to sell to, of course. Where you are in terms of revenue ramp or design win activity? I mean, are any of these guys buying QSMOD yet? Or are you sort of initially seeing more POL issues kind of similar to what you saw in the early stages of your cloud server ramp?
Michael Hsing: I think 5G overall at an early stage. And all I can say now that we engage with all the 5G station makers. And we do have a designing activity and we do have award projects but it's not significant revenue yet.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question comes from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Ross, your line is now open.
Ross Seymore: I want to give the same congrats that everybody else did, stupendous work here. A couple of quick questions. First, when do you expect the delinquencies to be gone?
Michael Hsing: If the market slows down, we're going to do that next quarter. If the demand is still that strong, we continue to face that. And we see some not as bad as last quarters -- last two quarters.
Ross Seymore: And then on the supply side of the equation somewhat, but maybe even more of a regulatory issue. What's the exposure? And how are you dealing with the Huawei ban? And does the SMIC band have any impact on you, whether it's in the supply side or otherwise?
Michael Hsing: Well, Huawei is not our supplier. But SMIC, it is our supplier. So far, it's not affecting us, and we don't know. We can't speculate, what does all these policy means that came in. But on the other hand and we diversified our foundry sources. We're starting from a beginning of this year. We speed it up.
Ross Seymore: So on the Huawei side, just to be clear, you had them as a customer, I believe, in the first half of the year one way or the other. And I assume you're no longer shipping to them and I just wondered if that's part of fourth quarter guidance is then going to zero.
Michael Hsing: Well, we can say zero or some non-zero, and so far, we cannot ship. But there is other rules and regulations coming out and all the other permits, I mean, we cannot speculating or what kind of things we can do and it's all depending on our government now.
Ross Seymore: I guess the last question then away from government type questions is, Bernie, you and Michael have had a framework in for many, many years about the percentage superior growth versus the analog market that you guys have delivered. I think it's been kind of a 10% to 15% positive delta in your favor. Is that rule just thrown out the window now? This year is 25, 30 points above that peer group. And I know one year doesn't make a trend, but as you look at it, is there something that's creating some semblance of escape velocity where that delta expands meaningfully just due to the breadth of your design wins, the markets you're targeting or do we expect a little bit of a reversion to the mean in 2021 after such a great 2020?
Michael Hsing: Well, as I said, the world is not linear. And I remember and I was facing a lot of, I was facing a lot of questions about when our model is like a 20% to 25% growth rate. In 2016, 2017 or 2015, 2016 and we will criticize you will never get there, although we're somewhere around 17%, 18%. And you asked so many times, you forced me say it at the time. I think around 2016, I said that -- but 2018, 2019, we're going to get it over 20%. And that comment is pulling off from my ears, this is not a science. I mean in a non-linear world, it's very difficult to predict. And so I said earlier, we only can anticipate it and by staffing the inventories and by stock inventories. And just get ready, and of course, and the world crashes. Of course, we're not we're going to start to depleting inventories. And we're not building as many as much and so we can modulate the inside a little bit. But for the growth rate, I see all these designing activities and all these projects, I will say last couple of years is better than two, three years before. And we awarded a lot more high-value products, high-value sockets.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question comes from Tore Svanberg from Stifel. Tore, your line is now open.
Tore Svanberg: I just had a follow-up, Michael, on e-commerce. That's obviously a business model that could help you manage capacity, inventory and so on and so forth. Have you been able to keep up with the investments there in this environment, maybe you could just update us on where the e-commerce business stands today?
Michael Hsing: We didn't prepare the numbers. We're doing really good. And I thought that there was nobody going to ask the question because...
Bernie Blegen: We have so much other news.
Michael Hsing: It is okay. I feel, I can say, we've figured out the way to do it. And so until we prove ourselves wrong again. The new website as I think you see it. It's very different and we increased a whole lot more clicks and the customers stay on the pages for a lot longer. And also, we're creating a virtual labs and that part also helps the e-commerce. So we don't have the product FAEs and have them pounding the payment to generate opportunities and we're using the Web site. And the numbers and the increase by increased weekly and I'm very pleased and so we're talking about a few hundred percentage increase from a small number. It doesn't mean a lot, but for us and we learned it. That's the trick. That's the area we're going to do. We're going to enhance that.
Bernie Blegen: I didn't know that there's an even higher arching strategy here where e-commerce is a significant part of and it's really how do you go after underserved customers. And what was surprising to me is, we did look at the last three years as far as how many customers did we have that were under $100,000 and how is that base growing. Because if you can use the linear model, where what they used to do is get in there early...
Michael Hsing: The linear technology.
Bernie Blegen: ..linear technology, getting there early and then develop these long-term relationships and then you grow with their growth. And so as a part of that strategy, I think we're -- the numbers I looked at, we're doing a very good job. They're starting to bear dividends.
Michael Hsing: We increased these number like three or four times.
Bernie Blegen: Yes.
Michael Hsing: And from a small base. And that is a significant and it has happened in the last few years. And now clearly, we can put the metrics. And so, an old saying is that, what you measure what you get. And we know how -- start to know how to -- what to measure and that's to me, is very important. But I'm looking at the revenue-wise, it became meaningful, but I don't have clear details. I don't want to have a pull out my higher numbers.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question comes from Rick Schafer from Oppenheimer. Rick, your line is now open.
Rick Schafer: And speaking of things that haven't been talked about as much maybe in the last couple of quarters. I'm curious if you could give us an update on the design win pipeline or revenue color for your converter business. I'm just curious, has ADI, Maxim opened any doors for you guys? And have you seen the level of engagement with customers increase maybe as a side note or are you seeing more analog, does it line into your resumes or is it easier to find guys? So I'm just curious if you could give us any update there.
Michael Hsing: Finding good people as always hard. All these good company that keep the good people and that's always a challenge. And so we know that we need a diversified. And that came in a lot of times in the last 10, 15 years or more likely the last 20 years. We have a lot of people from China came in. And now two or four, five years ago, we migrated to Europe and the Taiwan and outside of the Mainland China. Now in the last couple of years, it will come back to U.S., and we do see, not necessarily in the Bay Area but other parts of the countries, we do find some talents there.
Rick Schafer: And Michael, any update on what's happening with converters for you guys?
Michael Hsing: The converters, which...
Rick Schafer: The signal chain stuff the team you brought in. I think it's been a couple of quarters since we talked about ADAS.
Bernie Blegen: High-performance analog, yes.
Michael Hsing: Oh, yes. The data converters. Okay. Yes. Okay. I think we received the first chip.
Bernie Blegen: This is prototyping.
Michael Hsing: Yes. And I think we're building solutions and as most of the time, the first chip will have some bugs, it's  and we are building a prototype. We still can't put in a system yet now.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question comes from William Stein of Truist. William, your line is now open.
Will Stein: Follow-up from before. We're just -- someone else asked about e-commerce, but I'm hoping you might give us an update on the eMotion and module business and maybe the programmable traction generally. I think about these as sort of separate from e-commerce, maybe they're not as separate but an update on this part of it would be really helpful.
Michael Hsing: Yes. I think we use that e-commerce platform to promote those products. And that eMotion side, I think the revenues, I had to say some number now otherwise I don't know whether you guys think of whether I do have numbers. I want to have Bernie's. Sometimes it increase almost double. The motion side.
Bernie Blegen: Yes. The eMotion is right in that sort of transition phase because we have a lot of design wins that are going in. So last year, the revenue run rate was somewhere in the $10 million to $12 million, but now the doubling is going to start, particularly as we go into both automotive and industrial applications.
Michael Hsing: Yes. So I'm correct. It was about double.
Bernie Blegen: I think also when we look at the modules business, that is taking off very nicely.
Michael Hsing: The modules started with a smaller base, like a few hundred percent increase. That was $30 million, $40 million.
Will Stein: And is the strength that you're seeing there at all related to the pull-ins and delivering against delinquencies that you had previously or is this part of the rest of the business? What I want to think of as core that might not have...
Michael Hsing: No. It's a small part of it is due to delinquencies. I mean this is a new market segment. And people order from online and we never see those. I mean, it is not our own internet and our own Web site from our distributors and these are very small customers. They never all those parts before. And that's although the numbers is small, but the revenue is still small, but the large number of our customers and they use -- these are plug-and-play modules. And so what and they can just plug-in and they don't have to do any design. And since you mentioned the programming portion and that's part of what we learned that our customer doesn't even want to do programs. They want us to do it. And so we created virtual labs and customer tell us what they want and we show, in our labs, we program everything and then we ship. So now what we are talking about, it's really a custom design for each customer and that is taking off and I'm very glad to see it.
Will Stein: And just a final comment there is on the modules, they're not necessarily tied to any one end market. They're actually very broad-based, initially, we thought that they would be plug-and-play solutions, particularly for prototyping or small volumes, but it turns out that they're actually going to mainstream production.
Michael Hsing: Yes. And so that's something we learned and I'm a former engineering. I'm skilled engineer, our people and we created a great product that we see it and we're reporting like 30 parameters, 70 parameters on the Web site. They can program it and they can see what the result from simulations. And it turned out to be and we put a lot there nobody looking at it and we're wondering why. So we reduced to half and then we cut another half the reduced to five, six, seven, they still don't want to see it. And they want to pick the numbers in a total, you do that for me and that's great. We can do the work, they pay for it. That's fine.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question comes from Quinn Bolton from Needham. Quinn, your line is now open.
Quinn Bolton: Just wanted to see if you might be able to give us an update on your efforts in the GPU space for either desktop or data center GPUs. Just looking at the power consumption of those devices, I think you're seeing desktop GPUs now consuming up to 300 watts. I think data center, maybe up to 400 watts. You guys, I think I talked about that back at Analyst Day as a potential opportunity. Just wondering if you're starting to see any real traction or if you start to need in the curve on either the sort of the gaming or the data center side of GPUs.
Bernie Blegen: Yes. We're seeing substantial movement on both. We probably started out earlier on the desktop, where we started generating revenues with this about 18 months to two years ago. And now we're moving into the data center where we actually are starting to ramp and in particular, 48 volt for artificial intelligence. So the opportunities are significant, but we're still at the very early stages of this market. So fundamentally, we're very well positioned, but it's still going to be another year or two before we still -- we move the dial with revenue ramp.
Michael Hsing: Those are AR, Bernie is talking about, these are over 1,000 watts, and it's not 200 or 300 or 400-watt levels. If you get to that high level, you're only talking about only a few companies, they can supply those types of product. Again, in I think we are in good positions and -- but always can be better.
Genevieve Cunningham:  There appear to be no further questions. I would now like to turn the webinar back over to Bernie.
Bernie Blegen: Great. Thanks, Gen. I would like to thank you all for joining us for this conference and look forward to talking to you again about our fourth quarter results which will likely be in early February. Thank you and have a nice day.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-07-29 17:00:00) =====
Genevieve Cunningham: Welcome everyone to the MPS Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Webinar. Please note that this webinar is being recorded and will be archived for one year on our Investor Relations page at www.monolithicpower.com. My name is Genevieve Cunningham and I will be the moderator for this webinar. Joining me today are Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS; and Bernie Blegen, VP and CFO. During this webinar, we will discuss our Q2 2020 financial results and guidance for Q3 2020, followed by a Q&A session. Analysts you are currently muted. [Operator Instructions] In the course of today's webinar, we will be making forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty which could cause results to differ materially from management's current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and, other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q2 earnings release and in our SEC filings including our Form 10-K filed on February 28th, 2020 and our Form 10-Q filed on May 11th, 2020, which are accessible through our website www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today's call. We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, R&D, and SG&A expense, operating income, interest, and other income, net income, and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the Q2 2019, Q1 2020, and Q2 2020 releases, as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our website. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bernie Blegen.
Bernie Blegen: Thanks Gen. MPS achieved record second quarter revenue of $186.2 million, 12.3% higher than the first quarter of 2020 and 23.3% higher than the comparable quarter in 2019. Second quarter revenue growth was broad-based except for automotive. Our strong year-over-year revenue growth for 2020, in spite of the COVID-19 pandemic, was a result of our diversified growth strategy and our technological innovation. Maintaining this level of superior performance and realizing future growth opportunities requires us to step up investments in capacity, infrastructure, quality assurance, and headcount. We are also expanding our operating capabilities outside China. Turning now to our second quarter 2020 revenue by market. Second quarter computing and storage revenue of $64.1 million increased $12.1 million or 23.3% from the first quarter of 2020. Computing and storage revenue represented 34.4% of MPS' second quarter revenue. The sequential revenue increase reflected strength in storage revenue along with increased notebook revenue. Second quarter server revenue maintained the elevated levels achieved in the first quarter of 2020 and server revenue was significantly higher than the second quarter of the prior year. Second quarter consumer revenue of $47.7 million increased 27.4% from the first quarter of 2020 and represented 25.6% of our second quarter 2020 revenue. The sequential quarterly revenue increase reflected improved sales of products for home applications, IOT, gaming consoles, and VOT, a new acronym which stands for a Variety of Things. Second quarter 2020 communications revenue of $30.1 million was up by 8.0% from the first quarter of 2020. Product sales for communications infrastructure, including 5G networking increased sequentially as did sales of legacy router and wireless applications. Communications sales represented 16.2% of our total second quarter 2020 revenue. Second quarter industrial revenue of $26.6 million, increased 5.4% from the first quarter of 2020, as increased revenue for power sources more than offset a decrease in security based product sales. Industrial revenue represented 14.3% of our total second quarter 2020 revenue. Second quarter automotive revenue of $17.8 million, fell 23.7% from the first quarter of 2020, as the number of automotive OEMs shut down production for most of the quarter in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The range of applications MPS and encompasses now includes infotainment, smart lighting, ADAS and autonomous driving. Again, we believe MPS is well positioned to accelerate growth in automotive when the market returns. Automotive revenue was 9.5% of MPS' total second quarter 2020 revenue. I should point out that despite the past four months of COVID-related travel restrictions, our design activities remain largely unimpacted by the pandemic and have exceeded our expectations across the board. We have seen solid engagement particularly with top tier customers. These new and continuing customer relationships position MPS for long-term success in these critical markets. GAAP gross margin was 55.1%, 10 basis points lower than the first quarter of 2020 and flat compared with the second quarter of 2019. Our GAAP operating income was $28.0 million compared to $31.0 million reported in the first quarter of 2020 and $20.1 million reported in the second quarter of 2019. Non-GAAP gross margin for the second quarter of 2020 was 55.7%, up 20 basis points from the gross margin reported in the first quarter of 2020 and 10 basis points higher than the second quarter from a year ago. Our non-GAAP operating income was $53.0 million compared to $45.9 million reported in the prior quarter and $43.7 million reported in the second quarter of 2019. Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $74.6 million in the second quarter of 2020, compared with $60.5 million in the first quarter of 2020 and $63.1 million in the second quarter of 2019. Non-GAAP second quarter 2020 operating expenses were $50.7 million, up from the $46.1 million we spent in the first quarter of 2020, and up from the $40.3 million reported in the second quarter of 2019. The differences between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarter as discussed here are stock compensation expense and income or loss from an unfunded deferred compensation plan. For the second quarter of 2020, total stock compensation expense including approximately $642,000 charged to cost of goods sold was $21.0 million, compared with the $18.6 million recorded in the first quarter of 2020. Switching to the bottom line. Second quarter 2020 GAAP net income was $30.2 million, or $0.64 per fully diluted share compared with $35.8 million, or $0.77 per share in the first quarter of 2020 and $20.7 million, or $0.45 per share in the second quarter of 2019. Q2 non-GAAP net income was $50.6 million, or $1.08 per fully diluted share, compared with $44.3 million, or $0.95 per share in the first quarter of 2020, and $41.9 million, or $0.92 per share in the second quarter of 2019. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q2 2020 were $46.8 million. Now, let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $515.4 million at the end of second quarter of 2020, compared to $492 million at the end of the first quarter of 2020. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $59.3 million, compared with Q1 2020 operating cash flow of $51.4 million. Second quarter 2020 capital spending totaled $14.6 million. Accounts receivable ended the second quarter of 2020 at $55.1 million, representing 27 days of sales outstanding, which was three days lower than the 30 days reported at the end of the first quarter of 2020 and six days lower than the 33 days in the second quarter of 2019. Our internal inventories at the end of the second quarter of 2020 were $152.1 million, up from the $131.5 million at the end of the first quarter of 2020. Days of inventory of 166 days at the end of the second quarter of 2020 were five days higher than at the end of the first quarter of 2020. I would now like to turn to our outlook for the third quarter of 2020. As we are still in the midst of COVID pandemic, demand visibility for the remainder of the year is not as crisp as we usually see at this point in the year. We are forecasting Q3 revenue in the range of $200 million to $210 million. We also expect the following; GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.2% to 55.8%, non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.5% to 56.1%, total stock-based compensation expense of $21.2 million to $23.2 million including approximately $700,000 that would be charged to cost of goods sold. GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses should be between $70.7 million and $74.7 million. Non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses should be in the range of $50.2 million to $52.2 million. Litigation expense should range between $1.8 million and $2.2 million, interest income is expected to range from $1.5 million to $1.7 million, and fully diluted shares to be in the range of 46.5 million to 47.5 million shares. In conclusion, we continue to grow year-over-year. We are excited about our design activities in the pipeline and expanding our reach in the new frontiers. I will now open the webinar for questions.
Genevieve Cunningham: Thank you, Bernie. Analyst, I would now like to begin our Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tore Svanberg from Stifel. Tore, your line is now open.
Tore Svanberg: Yes, thank you. Michael and Bernie congratulations on another very strong quarter. Before I get into the near-term stuff, you did mention something at the beginning there that you are exploring some operations outside of China. I'm not talking about design centers here, but are you working on something else on the manufacturing side outside of China at this point?
Michael Hsing: Yes. We try to expand another fab and we're exploring another 12-inch fabs, okay, as well as a 8-inch fab outside of China.
Tore Svanberg: Okay, very good. And as we look at the September quarter and congratulations on getting to $200 million in quarterly revenue, could you maybe talk a little bit about some of the end markets that's going to drive that growth? I mean, I'm sure the storage and server business is going to continue to remain strong. But maybe give us the puts and takes on each end market going into the September quarter?
Michael Hsing: Yeah. Tore, our product is a very fundamental use of building blocks, okay? And we supply all these power to power management for all electronic devices and including automotive. And now one segment clearly in this pandemic and everybody knows the infrastructures for telecommunications and data centers and as well as IoTs and the PCs and they'll grow. And MPS okay just supply these are building blocks for all these segments. And as Bernie said earlier other than automotive all segments are doing well.
Bernie Blegen: Very broad based.
Michael Hsing: Yeah.
Tore Svanberg: Very good. Just one last question. The DSO is pretty low now Bernie. And I mean, I assume that's just purely linearity. Anything else going on there?
Bernie Blegen: No. I think we've always had a very good track record with credit and collections and the 27 days in the quarter really is a reflection of how front-loaded the initial sales were in Q2.
Tore Svanberg: Congratulations again. Thank you.
Bernie Blegen: Thank you, Tore.
Michael Hsing: Thank you. Tore.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question comes from Quinn Bolton from Needham. Quinn, your line is now open.
Quinn Bolton: Thank you, and let me echo my congratulations. I guess Bernie, you made some comments about visibility being a little bit less clear today than in years past, obviously COVID it's understandable with the COVID outbreak. But I guess you guys have had a very strong sort of first three quarters of the year including guidance for September. Just wondering can you talk to us about your thoughts on the sustainability of this demand? Or are there certain factors perhaps the game console ramp that may be leading to some particular strength in the September quarter that may soften seasonally as we look out beyond the September quarter? And then I've got a follow-up.
Bernie Blegen: Sure. I think that just given the nature of the current macro environment where we did benefit from accelerated ordering patterns, particularly in -- at the end of Q1 that we don't want to become complacent, because we have seen falloffs in demand after we've had a big run-up like we just experienced. So it isn't that we're seeing anything specifically in the market that causes us concern, but just past experience tells us that it's something that we have to monitor.
Michael Hsing: Yes. The Bernie's comment was very similar to our statement in the Q1 and Q2, okay? We didn't -- we expect at the time that all segment will grow including automotive. And so what is the magnitude of the growth is to our surprise. And even during the first couple of quarters, we -- first quarter, we mentioned again we have more order than we can ship. And so now we're going to second half of this year's the macro conditions to us is not very much -- it's not unsettled. And so we will prepare to change quickly. And -- but overall orders are still very good.
Bernie Blegen: And one last thing just to follow-up on Michael's comment there is that in the beginning of the year, we did have concerns about supply chain capacity. And we've lowered that risk, but that's still an issue that is requiring ongoing management.
Quinn Bolton: Understood. And then longer term, you mentioned you're positively surprised by the strength of the design activity particularly with Tier 1s. I'm sure you're not going to name customers, but are there a couple of applications you might be able to highlight for us that you're really excited about over the next year or two?
Michael Hsing: It's -- a couple of them clearly is 48 volts and as we talk about it and the other one is in the data centers business. And also as Bernie mentioned earlier in automotive, we engaged with heavily and a lot of activity in ADAS.
Bernie Blegen: And I think to keep in mind that in a lot of the markets that Michael just listed is that, we are relatively small players. So we have a lot of upside greenfield opportunities that should continue to drive our growth for the next two to three years at least.
Quinn Bolton: You bet.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question comes from Joshua Buchalter from Cowen. Joshua, your line is now open.
Joshua Buchalter: Good day, thanks for taking my question and congrats on the results. I wanted to begin with storage and computing update. Given the size of the upside, I was a bit surprised to see server not called out as a driver of sequential growth. Could you maybe provide some granularity on was this a function of -- in 1Q was just such a high watermark? Or was there anything else going on within that market that allowed it to grow less than the other ones? Thank you.
Michael Hsing: Yes. Server growth is not a surprise to us. And we talk about it in the past quarters. And we expected a growth from -- say from a year ago. And this year we will grow substantially from last year. So there is no surprises. And so our product is as I remind everybody, it's still a power supply and we're powering up the CPUs and powering up all the electronics electronic devices using a server.
Bernie Blegen: Yes. And I think we tried to add some color to that in the prepared comments by saying that, we enjoyed a noteworthy step up between Q1 and Q2 or Q4 and Q1 and we maintain that same high level in Q2. So when you look at the year-over-year server is one of our largest year-over-year growth drivers.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question comes from William Stein from SunTrust. William, your line is now open.
William Stein: Great, thanks for taking my question. Congrats on these very strong results. I'm wondering if Bernie you can talk to us about backlog versus turns expectations. I think last quarter we had this sort of special situation where you essentially guided for negative net turns, maybe you can confirm my recollection and clarify what guidance implies in that regard for Q3.
Bernie Blegen: I think that the term that we referred to at the end of Q1 was the toilet paper effect that there was an outsized ordering pattern in the last four weeks of March and so we had to take Q2 to more closely understand what that represented. And after we went customer-by-customer and geography to geography, we found out that there were a couple of drivers, well 3. The first was, that there was a increase stepped up increase in demand and particularly as it relates to work from home applications. And so that included storage and 5G and notebooks and then as I said earlier continued strong ordering within automotive. But there was also an acceleration of demand where the distributors and customers wanted to get in line to make sure that they were not. So what we've had to do is a very close evaluation to make sure that we don't let the channel inventories rise too much because of over-enthusiasm. But at this point, we enter this quarter again with a similar backlog profile, as we had last quarter meaning that there's low no reliance on turns business in order to meet our expectations.
Michael Hsing: Yeah. Our assumption, the toilet paper effect wasn't quite right. There is very little, okay? And so the -- after we're diving and deeper into our customers, our distributors, and we found that these growths are real growth and somewhat is very sustainable.
William Stein: Okay, got it. So the elevated orders last quarter were not a sort of a trick, they were for real and it sounds like you're seeing elevated backlog this quarter as well. So, maybe the other -- the other side of this of course is supply. And so that's my second question. Bernie, through the quarter, you talked about how supply was -- the company was more able to deliver. We certainly saw that in the quarter. I think you talked about increased supply at one foundry having a doubling of capacity that's sort of real-time and then another expectation for a ramped in Q4, at maybe a new foundry from one of your existing partners. I think together, it sounded like that was 40% additional capacity, which suggests maybe up to two years of sort of runway. Maybe you could clarify, I think you -- on the call earlier you talked about two fabs that are ramping now. Maybe you can just clarify for us where we are and where you expect capacity to go over the next few quarters?
Bernie Blegen: Yeah. I think that to give full credit, our operations capabilities were put to the test in the early part of this year. And I think that, we responded as well as one could have expected. And most of the numbers that you cited as far as the capacity expansion are pretty close to the mark. I'm not going to confirm or reject them you're in the ballpark. And I think that, it remains an issue because as we look ahead our growth prospects for the next three to five years certainly are significant. And so what we're trying to do is get both capacity but then also get a geographically distributed. So, that's going to require a continuing level of investment, as we look ahead here for the next few years.
William Stein: Thank you.
Genevieve Cunningham: The next question is from Chris Caso from Raymond James. Chris, your line is now open.
Chris Caso: Yes. Thank you. Good evening. And congratulations on the pioneering conference call format, which seems working very well. So my first question is just a follow-on from the other question. And with respect to capacity and the constraints that you're under right now, do you foresee a situation over the next few quarters where those capacity constraints could be an impediment to revenue? I guess, from where we are right now and actually we're seeing -- it appears that we're seeing some good upside the toilet paper effect is not having the effect that we feared. Is there still sufficient headroom for revenue growth as we go through the next few quarters as you're putting these capacity plans in place?
Michael Hsing: Yeah. Let's put that way, our production people and they're working at over 100%. And we still have more revenue that we can ship. I mean, we can order than more than we can ship. And as we increase the capacities in the last six months, the issues are much better now.
Bernie Blegen: And I would also probably just having learned from this recent experience that, we're more likely to also increase our internal inventories, so we don't have to rely upon necessarily in the moment production excellence.
Chris Caso: Great. As a follow-up, with regard to the compute segment, we've heard from some others is that the market itself -- I guess, there's some areas of the compute market which look like they'll be slowing as you go into the second half. There was some of that work from home demand. In notebooks, for example, it looks like it was pulled forward to the first half. Intel had talked about some of the data centers -- the cloud data center revenue, which maybe showing some decline after a number of strong quarters. I know you have a lot of content increase as well. And I guess the question is, if the market should slow, one, is that what you're seeing? And secondly, the extent of your content increases, are they greater than what's happening in the market?
Michael Hsing: We are the new players. Okay? We are a relatively small player in the market segment. And we don't see -- for our revenue growth we don't see any slowdown. And as we become a much bigger percentage then we can answer your question better.
Chris Caso: Thank you.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question comes from David Williams from Loop Capital. David, your line is now open. We'll move to the next question. This comes from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Ross, your line is now open.
Melissa Weathers: Hi, guys. This is Melissa on for Ross. Thank you for letting us ask a question and congratulations on a really strong quarter. I was hoping to get your opinion on the automotive end market specifically. Your larger peers were also impacted by the factory shutdowns around the world. As you're thinking about the recovery in the second half, how do you see this business recovering? And I know you don't guide more than one quarter out, but can you help us understand how sales into auto will resume?
Bernie Blegen: Yes. I think that Q3 we're going to see a restabilization in the market. Interestingly, even though the manufacturing of the OEMs was shut down for two to three months, people still continue to buy cars. So there is some pent-up demand that they need to meet. But I think that the ramp may not be -- it won't necessarily snap back, I'm expecting to see some additional improvement in Q4, as they start to roll out the new model year. But I don't see it being the stair-step growth that we've experienced in past years.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question will come from David Williams from Loop Capital. David, your line is now open.
David Williams: Perfect. Thank you. And thanks for letting me ask a question and congrats on the quarter. I guess the first question is really around the gaming console. And maybe if you could provide any color around the benefit in the quarter from the gaming console and then maybe how that layers into the remainder of the year.
Bernie Blegen: I think that the gaming console is a very -- a somewhat predictable business, as far as there's almost a bell-shaped curve that occurs over five months beginning in June and ending in October. So that is pretty heavily weighted towards Q3 for what we sell into. And right now the visibility will not be crisp, is the word we used before, probably until late August or early September. Though, right now, we seem to be tracking very well against our expectations.
David Williams: Okay. So you'd characterize that as maybe stable to towards your expectations?
Bernie Blegen: Yes. Stable is not a word I normally assigned to gaming consoles, because it does create this bubble which has certain of its own management challenges. But, yes, I would say, that the demand is meeting our expectations and we have adequate supply chain to handle it.
David Williams: Great. And then maybe thinking about the data center and maybe from the computing, how much of this do you think is maybe pull ahead versus more cycle related? Do you think this is sustainable? I realize you're a smaller player, but do you think you're seeing any pull ahead here? Or do you think all of this is maybe natural demand that would have come through pandemic or not?
Bernie Blegen: No. I think the work from home phenomena is real and at some level, we are able to quantify it. But I do think that it is a more front-end loaded cycle as we sort of offered an earlier response. And the only thing to really add is that we're such a small player and this is sort of our first opportunity to really experience accelerated revenue growth, again our visibility and predictability is a little bit low for us right now.
David Williams: Great. Thank you so much.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question comes from Rick Schafer from Oppenheimer. Rick, your line is now open.
Rick Schafer: Thank you. Nice job, guys. I guess my first question now we've talked about or ask on 5G yet. So maybe -- I don't know if you could give a sort of progress on the 5G entry how are things [Technical Difficulty] the largest customer there. I know there's been some uncertainty. I know the government here has been trend you with that [Technical Difficulty] And then I didn't know if you can you talk about how many would be into shipping now? Or do you just [Technical Difficulty] and then I have a follow-up.
Michael Hsing: Rick, your question is barely audible and barely interpretable. We can try it okay try to answer your questions. And 5G is our biggest -- one of the biggest opportunities and very highly concentrated customers. And as you know, the 4G we were not in that and we don't have any revenues. Okay, very little revenues. And now we became a significant player in there and that's because our technologies. And as far as where to grow and which regions? Clearly, China is emphasize it and the Huawei is the biggest players now. So all the other regions we engage with them deeply. And but I have to say they're much slower. And what is the impact for our future business? I believe it's a matter of time. The longer the times and the longer time give us it will be actually better for MPS. And all the other players and had the familiar with MPS and familiar with the MPS technologies. And the time is actually is on our side, but it may affect the revenues. But in China, we see it keep growing in a 5G network.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question comes from Kamil Mielczarek from William Blair. Kamil, your line is now open.
Kamil Mielczarek: Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. First is I just want to follow-up on 5G. Can you provide some detail on how to think about the content you have and specifically the potential SAM given your POL products can be used in transceivers, base stations, fiber optic networks and back-end data centers. And I assume there's a potential for QSMOD as well?
Michael Hsing: Yes. You're absolutely, right. Our opportunity we don't have a clear picture because again our product there is a very fundamental in us supplying powers and doing power management for each component. And it's really a rough calculation it's more than $40, $50 per stations.
Kamil Mielczarek: That's great. Thank you. And just a quick follow-up. How should we think about your entrance into the HPA market? I believe you are initially targeting medical and communication applications. And what's your differentiation versus competitors like TI? And lastly is this a 2021 revenue event?
Bernie Blegen: The primary competition is really with ADI and this is the advanced analog. And you're exactly correct that the first opportunity that we're pursuing is actually with a customer and they've provided us their spec and we would expect to be able to have a product that can be prototyped by the end of this year and have initial revenue after that. As far as the longer-term road map, we talked about communications because it is the next targeted market that were high-performance analog.
Michael Hsing: Data converters. I missed the first part of the question. Okay. Go ahead.
Bernie Blegen: Yes. So just finishing up where the need for high-frequency and high precision. And as I said there's only one or two other players out there. It's a very difficult market to penetrate. But here again, we believe, we're very well positioned to move into it over the course of the next three to five years.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question comes from Tore Svanberg from Stifel. Tore, your line is now open.
Tore Svanberg: Yes. Just a follow-up. And Michael, I'm asking this question because I really respect your view and if you look at Maxim, Linear, ADI, they've been competitors of yours for many years, whether for business or for engineers. They're now all going to be under one umbrella. What do you think that means for the analog space and perhaps for Monolithic power specifically?
Michael Hsing: Well, thanks for saying you respect me. Yes, I think, it's the same the Maxim and Linear Technologies they are very proven and companies and they competed as -- in the past competes with them and MPS has a little bit agile and in terms of technology development and the product development. So our growth is faster. And I think going to futures MPS now has become meaningful players. And we are -- and if you look at the Linear Technologies with our $1.1 billion the MPS is very close to it. And so our customers were looking for a second of multiple suppliers. And with the superior technologies I think that will give us more opportunities.
Tore Svanberg: Very good. Congrats again.
Michael Hsing: Thank you. Yes.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question comes from Kevin Garrigan from Rosenblatt. Kevin, your line is now open.
Kevin Garrigan: Guys, thanks for taking my question and congrats on a great quarter. Just a quick one for me. Can you give us a little color on your e-commerce business? I know with everything kind of virtual now in your recent agreement with Farnell Electronics, can you kind of talk about what's going on there?
Michael Hsing: Yes. Okay. That's the e-commerce glad that you still remember that. And I have to say it's very slow okay, but I really believe that okay. I firmly believe that. We see some initial results. And after -- if you follow our website and our website change keep evolving. And up to a point now we know how do we double or triple the subscribers. And it's actually more than tripled and small start with small numbers. And so we're still doing a lot of surveys. And now I think the website is good enough and that we can work with our partners and online partners and distribute the message more -- much more clearly. And I will see in next few months and we'll see -- I hope to see a lot more result. But overall, we still believe it. And we much believe it in the plug and play solution, it will happen and online distribution, online sales, online configurations that will be the future. And so, for MPS opportunities instead of dollar, sub dollar parts, now, we're selling against $4, $5 or beyond for each component. So, the opportunities still remain and we are still learning.
Kevin Garrigan: Got it. Thanks guys.
Genevieve Cunningham: Our next question comes from Quinn Bolton from Needham. Quinn, your line is now open.
Quinn Bolton: Hey great. Thanks for letting me ask the follow question. Michael, you said some of the applications you're most excited about or center around the data center as well as 48 volts, so just a couple of follow-on questions. With NVIDIA's latest 7-nanometer generation of GPUs going into the data center, wondering if you're able to comment whether you're supplying any power management devices for that new 100 GPU either in a 12-volt or 48-volt SKU? And then longer term, as we look forward to the new Intel VR 14 spec, do you have a sense how much of that market might be 12-volt versus 48-volt? Thank you.
Michael Hsing: All right. Okay. Obviously, we don't mention customers' names and customers' project names. And let's put that way, so, all the 48-volt product that we have a product in it. And in terms of the VR 14 spec, we have a reference design in that. And MPS will be compared via 13s and we're also a small part of it. And I think, the opportunity for MPS. And it became a significant play as a main player in the VR 14 in the next few years.
Bernie Blegen: Both in the 12-volt as well as 48-volt.
Michael Hsing: Yes, for the 12 volts and 48 volts, my belief is mostly still 12 volts. And 48 volts, the application is still limited.
Quinn Bolton: Great. Thank you for that color.
Genevieve Cunningham: [Operator Instructions] As there are no further questions, I would now like to turn the webinar back over to Bernie.
Bernie Blegen: Great. I'd like to thank you all for joining us for this webinar. And look forward to talking to you again during our third quarter webinar, which will likely be at the end of October. Thank you and have a great day.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-04-29 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. At this time all participants lines are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call to Bernie Blegen, Chief Financial Officer.
Bernie Blegen: Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to the first quarter 2020 Monolithic Power Systems conference call. Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS is with me on today's call.In the course of today's conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management's current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor Statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q1 earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on February 28, 2020 which is accessible through our website, www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today's call.We will be discussing gross margins, operating expense, R&D and SG&A expense, operating income, interest and other income, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to financial measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the Q1 2019, Q4 2019 and Q1 2020 releases as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our website.I would also like to remind you that today's conference call is being webcast live over the Internet and will be available for replay on our website for one year, along with earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today.Before going through our financial results, I would like to acknowledge the difficult circumstances we are all operating under. At MPS, we have taken all necessary precautions to ensure the safety of our employees, our suppliers and our customers. At the same time, we remain focused on the need to execute at the highest level possible. Our worldwide efforts are reflected in our continuing level of innovation and customer support.In response to the news of extreme shortages of medical equipment, MPS rose to the occasion to fight the global pandemic. As described in our recent press release, MPS developed and assembled an emergency ventilator prototype in a matter of days leveraging a MIT open-source design concept. We demonstrated our technological superiority and deep system application knowledge to showcase our capability to advance from a component provider to a solution provider in a short period of time.We believe we can help our customers to do the same by taking advantage of MPS' vast and diversified product portfolio, which is highly programmable, flexible and feature-rich. We are also encouraged by the excitement we have received from our existing and potential customers that will lead to many promising opportunities in the medical device industry.Turning now to our financial results. MPS posted record first quarter revenue of $165.8 million, 17.3% higher than the comparable quarter in 2019. MPS continues to benefit from our technology leadership and diversified multi-market strategy.Looking at our revenue by market. In our computing and storage market, first quarter 2020 revenue of $52.0 million increased $12.8 million or 32.6% year-over-year. First quarter 2020 computing and storage revenue represented 31.3% of MPS' first quarter 2020 revenue compared with 27.7% in the first quarter of 2019. The year-over-year revenue increase primarily reflected sales growth for cloud-based servers and storage.First quarter 2020 communications revenue of $27.9 million rose $5.7 million or 25.6% from the first quarter of 2019. The year-over-year revenue increase primarily reflected higher 5G networking sales. Communications revenue represented 16.8% of MPS' first quarter 2020 revenue compared with 15.7% in the first quarter of 2019. First quarter 2020 industrial revenue of $25.2 million increased 18.3% from the first quarter of 2019 and accounted for 15.2% of our total first quarter revenue. The increase over the first quarter of 2019 primarily reflected games and smart meters and security applications.First quarter 2020 automotive revenue of $23.3 million grew 13.6% over the same period of 2019, representing 14.1% of MPS' first quarter 2020 revenue. This growth primarily represented increased sales of infotainment, safety and connectivity application products.First quarter of 2020 revenue from consumer markets of $37.4 million decreased $700,000 or 1.9% from the same period of 2019. The year-over-year revenue decrease reflected continuing reductions in demand for set-top boxes and flat-panel TVs. Consumer revenue represented 22.6% of our Q1 revenue compared with 27.0% contribution in the first quarter of 2019.GAAP gross margin was 55.2%, 10 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2019 and flat with the first quarter of 2019. Our GAAP operating income was $31.0 million compared with $30.7 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2019. For the first quarter of 2020, non-GAAP gross margin was 55.5%, matching the fourth quarter of 2019, but 10 basis points lower than the first quarter of 2019.Our non-GAAP operating income was $45.9 million compared to $50.8 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2019. Our GAAP operating expenses were $60.5 million in the first quarter of 2020, compared with $61.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. Our non-GAAP first quarter 2020 operating expenses were $46.1 million, up from the $41.8 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2019. This increase primarily reflected higher Q1 payroll taxes and increased investment in new products.The difference between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are stock compensation expense and income or loss on an unfunded deferred compensation plan. For the first quarter of 2020, total stock compensation expense including approximately $600,000 charge to cost of goods sold was $18.6 million compared with $18.7 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2019.Switching to the bottomline. First quarter 2020 GAAP net income was $35.8 million or $0.77 per fully diluted share compared with $32.4 million or $0.70 per share in the fourth quarter of 2019. Our Q1 2020 tax provision of minus 22% was due to a one-time discrete tax benefit resulting from stock compensation. First quarter 2020 non-GAAP net income was $44.3 million or $0.95 per fully diluted share compared with $48.4 million or $1.04 per fully diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2019. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q1 2020 were 46.7 million.Now let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $492.3 million at the end of the first quarter of 2020, compared with $458.5 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $51.4 million compared with operating cash flow of $61.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. First quarter 2020 capital spending totaled $10 million. Accounts receivable ended the first quarter of 2020 $54.3 million or 30 days of sales outstanding, up one day from 29 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019. Our internal inventories at the end of the first quarter of 2020 was $131.5 million, up from the $127.5 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019. Days of inventory increased to 161 days at the end of Q1 2020, compared with 155 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019.I would now like to turn to our outlook for the second quarter of 2020. We are forecasting Q2 revenue in the range of $167 million to $173 million. We also expect the following. GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.02% to 55.6%. Non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.3% to 55.9%. GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses between $60.9 million and $64.9 million. Non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to be in the range of $43.4 million to $45.4 million. This estimate excludes stock compensation and litigation expenses. Total stock-based compensation expense of $18.1 million to $20.1 million, including approximately $600,000 that will be charged to cost of goods sold. Litigation expenses are expected to range between $1.7 million to $2.1 million. Interest and other income is expected to range from $1.7 million to $1.9 million before foreign exchange gains or losses. Fully diluted shares to be in the range of 45.8 million to 47.8 million shares.In conclusion, we are not immune to the macroeconomic reality. But our long term growth prospects remain intact. We will continue to execute to our plan and are prepared to manage volatility of future customer demand.I will now open the phone lines for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question is from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Please go ahead, Tore.
Tore Svanberg: Yes. Thank you Michael and Bernie and congratulations on these results in a very challenging environment. First question and you maybe this is a bit philosophical but innovative companies tend to gain a lot of share during a downturn. We are obviously in a downturn. I was just wondering, Michael, if there are certain things that you are looking at to obviously come out of this even stronger than going into this?
Michael Hsing: Tore, you remember the history. great. We tend to --
Tore Svanberg: Michael, you are breaking up. Michael, you are breaking up unfortunately.
Michael Hsing: Can you hear me?
Tore Svanberg: Yes. You might go to the handset instead of the speaker.
Michael Hsing: Sure.
Tore Svanberg: There you go. You are fine.
Michael Hsing: Okay. Can you hear me now?
Tore Svanberg: Yes, we can. Yes, it's much better.
Michael Hsing: All right, okay. Yes, as I stated earlier, Tore, if you remember MPS' history, because you do cover those things since day one of MPS become a public company. And somehow, we tend to do that. And in the downturn, we tend to do well and relatively in the normal times, we are just as good as just everybody else. But the percentage of growth tend to be slightly slower or slightly lower. And how we achieved, I think is that we don't really, our target is many years out. And regardless of the downturns or upturns, we are very consistent. So it's not like other company maybe because they have all the large market share and they tend to react to a shorter term. So if you can think about it and the philosophy and we will tend to well during a downturn.
Tore Svanberg: That's very helpful. And on a similar topic, but more specific, your e-commerce business. I do appreciate it's taken a while to get that up and running. But in this sort of virtual environment we live in, I would think that a business like that would be very, very welcome. So maybe you can elaborate a little bit on what's been going on, on that front?
Michael Hsing: Well, as I said in last quarter, we said e-commerce, like we kind of drop a hook in the Pacific Ocean. There is a lot of fish there. But we didn't hook that. Too many things and all of that. So we are still in the early stage. However, in the last couple of months, we launched ventilators. That attracted so many of new customers or new potential customers and it overwhelmed us. And it's kind of a surprise to us. I think that we are a small company and we are relatively new company and people don't know us. Just we need time and we need to learn how to do it.
Tore Svanberg: That's great. One last question for Bernie. Bernie, you talked about the computing and storage business being up quite dramatically year-over-year. Some other players in the space obviously are talking about similar strength. Did you get a sense that there is some pull-in activity going on there? Intel, for instance, they talk about obviously the second half being weaker than the first half. Any color you can add on that would be great. Thank you.
Bernie Blegen: Sure. I think we are seeing a pattern that's probably consistent with other companies who have exposure to either 5G or data center or to notebooks as there is continuing investment in order to service the work from home aspect of the economy right now. So there has been a lot of activity, particularly in storage, particularly in data center and we are seen a continuing level of investment also in 5G. Again, as with any expectation of what the second half of look like, obviously, this is a challenging environment and we normally only forecast one quarter ahead.
Tore Svanberg: Very good. Congratulations again. Thank you.
Bernie Blegen: Thank you.
Michael Hsing: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Ramsay with Cowen. Please go ahead, Matt.
Josh Buchalter: Hi. This is Josh Buchalter, on behalf of Matt. Thanks for taking my question. I hope everyone is hanging in there okay. I know you guys love questions on inventory. But given all the moving parts on both the supply and demand side, could you update us about how you feel and your comfort level after last quarter you sort of lamented bringing levels down? It would be helpful to hear an update on your visibility into both your on books and in the channel. Thanks.
Michael Hsing: Well, in the last couple of quarters, we said that our bookings are very good and it is still is. And we have inventory problems, the problem to related to and deliver to our customers up and above. And this issues and this growth of this year, we didn't say is from the last couple quarters. We said it a lot earlier. But our macro market have some uncertainty and we were so criticized we have a way inventory. So last December, we took a step and reduced our inventory. And now, barely we can do beyond our forecast. So the condition is even more murkier now. And we had to just react accordingly.
Bernie Blegen: And if I can add to Michael's good point there is that through the challenges that we are facing in the economy right now, as you can see that we continue to operate at nearly 100% capacity both in terms of our supply chain as well as our internal operations. Now, I do not want to minimize those challenges and anyway take away from a lot of very difficult and hard effort on the part of a lot of employees that made that all happen. But so far, we have had minimal disruptions to the supply chain.
Josh Buchalter: Yes. Thank you. I appreciate all the color. And then as my follow-up, are you able to provide any color on your expectations by segment for the second quarter? Thanks and congratulations on the stellar results.
Bernie Blegen: Sure. I can take this one quickly on the numbers front is, is responded to the earlier question is that I believe that much of the growth that we expect to enjoy, should come from the computing and storage as well as in 5G. There is a weakening in demand in traditional consumer and also in automotive.
Michael Hsing: Here is, as added, okay. We try to have a very diverse growth. And my job is, if I do the best job, is for you guys not to know which segment is the growth. And we want to so diversify and you don't know which side, which one and we occupy a very small percentage of each market. And look at the consumer and actually within the consumer, there is a lot of fundamental shift. We shift from traditional TV set-top box and which still have some percentage and within that we have a huge change. We chose to do a much higher high-end of our consumer products and as well the Internet of Things.
Josh Buchalter: Thanks guys.
Bernie Blegen: Okay.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company. Go ahead, Quinn.
Quinn Bolton: Hi guys. Let me offer my congratulations on the nice results and outlook. You guys are significantly outperforming a number of the analog peers sequentially and certainly year-over-year. And I think that that we have seen a number of the analog peers talk about in there forecast, I think they refer to seeing some customers buying ahead or building inventory. And just wondering if you might be able to address that specifically on the compute and 5G side? I know you mentioned that auto and consumer is softening. So maybe just kind of go through just whether you think there is there is any buy ahead activity that may be influencing second quarter guidance? And then I have got a follow-up.
Michael Hsing: Yes. And of course, we are concerned. It's like a toilet paper effect, right. Just a few months ago, all the shelf and the toilet papers are gone. I mean and whether we have see the same kind of effect on us, we really don't know. In some of the areas like in PCs and data centers have a surge. But we kind of expected that. And other ones in the consumer area and it's actually slower than our expectations. But we have to be quick on the feet and we have to react quickly. And in the meantime, we ship as much as we can.
Quinn Bolton: Got it. And then just looking in that data center business, I think Intel has recently canceled the Cooper Lake processor generation to focus on the 10 nanometer Ice Lake to launch late this year. Just wondering if that's had any impact on the Whitley ramp as if you see it? Or are you seeing pretty good design activity, either for existing Purley systems or the initial ramp of Whitley just over the balance of the year? Thank you.
Bernie Blegen: Yes. Good question. So are experience has been showing that we are receiving the same level of customer engagement. And that going back to Michael's point about Q2, that the level of order momentum has continued unabated, regardless of the product change, the change in the product cycle. So at this point, we may not have the full benefit of how end demand will be shaped by this change. But I don't see any early indicators that give me pause. And one other thing to make this specific is going back to Michael's point on being diversified. The business model is not dependent on any individual product launch or the timing. So as I said, that's the advantage of our diversified portfolio.
Quinn Bolton: Great. Congratulations again guys.
Bernie Blegen: Thank you.
Michael Hsing: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Caso with Raymond James. Please go ahead, Chris.
Chris Caso: Yes. Thank you. First question is just regarding product cycles for the year. And I would imagine much like last year, there is a certain part of the business, a large part of the business, which is just driven by product cycles getting customer designs out the door and another portion of it which is related to run rate business. So perhaps that might be affected by downtick in demand. Could you characterize the business? What parts would be more driven by product cycles? What parts would be driven more by run rate demand? And take a look and give us some sense of f how that plays out through the second half?
Michael Hsing: The second half, okay, look, it's not just a philosophical rate, it's not very clear, okay. But our customers' demand is as high as ever. But we divided and we engage our customers in a variety of assignments. And so when they ramp up and it's kind of very short notice, a few and when they test the market and their market is reacting well then they have a huge ramp. And so that's why we need enough inventory to support these new product win. And to answer your question of which particular market segment, in the last couple months, there is the total ship target, the engagement with the customer's total ship in the medical field now. And a lot of parts and a lot of inquiries and all this is particularly helped by the ventilator is totally to our surprise. And at the same time, we didn't expect the computing ramp as this much, okay. And it's just and particularly in the memory side, in the memory power, what is the Bernie, SMD?
Bernie Blegen: Yes, SMD.
Michael Hsing: Yes. So that's our scenario now. And going forward, we are not very clear. And I know that if the new trend is you can work from home and you can work remotely and the cloud computing, the data center, the communication will keep going on. And we are accelerating.
Chris Caso: Thank you. I am sorry.
Bernie Blegen: I am sorry. I just had two small thing to add to that is that on the notebooks, seasonally, those are driven where you have a high Q3 and Q4 and then it tails off. But we see nothing in the aside from cyclical changes there. And then obviously, we have a gaming console that will start to ramp here in the end of the Q2.
Chris Caso: That's helpful. Thank you. As a follow-up, you talked about qualifying some new capacity on 300 millimeter into the second half. Could you give us an update on that? And you know, in the current environment has there been any change to your plans or your need for that capacity either greater or less?
Michael Hsing: Yes. If we see some push outs, it is above and beyond. And if they don't have those push out we are even in deep trouble. And in terms of a customer relationship, not in terms of delivery the numbers. And we are working very hard. We try very hard to bring up another fab and as you know that this is not like an overnight, okay, at least take the half years. And I think that we can meet our demand and qualify some of the high runners.
Bernie Blegen: Yes. We should be able to qualify the high runners before the end of this year and actually be shipping from that fab.
Chris Caso: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from William Stein with SunTrust. Please go ahead, William.
William Stein: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Michael and Bernie, congrats on the good result and outlook. Michael, you mentioned at the start of the call, a transition from a component to a solutions company and you highlighted the ventilator as an example. But at the Analyst Day, you also showed several things that looked like a precursor to this in a way, not only e.Motion, but these programmable modules. And I wonder if there is anything more sort of quantitative that you could disclose to us in terms of revenue or growth or designs or orders as it relates to that what we might describe as a transition or a new leg of growth to the business?
Michael Hsing: Yes. We haven't really prepared a qualitative numbers to use. And as a business, that type of a business, we have to think about how we how we disclose it very accurately to our investors. And it is clearly that trend and we want to make our solutions like our product, a chip-based solution is really ease-of-use. That is the trick. And to lot of like power supplies, lot of motor controls, okay, motion controls and even for the power supply for the data center, lot of technology are maturing, okay. What is on top of that? It's really a plug-in place solution. And you want to take away all the design effort from our customers. And in terms of, maybe Bernie, our modules are doing really well, right? Our modules and if you are talking about only power modules, so we from two, three years ago, like in single low digit million dollars of sales, we now at least of $35 million, $40 million in last year. And that number is great. This is the fastest the growth in percentage wise in MPS revenue streak.
Bernie Blegen: I think I would probably add to that, if I can, that Mike was exactly right, that we haven't really articulated a financial model where we can quantify it in a way that would be meaningful to you. I agree with Michael's assessment of how we are doing with power modules. The thing that I would add though is, whether you are looking at programmability, you are looking at e-commerce solution, you are looking at e.Motion or the power modules integrated solutions that we were just talking about it, it's all about an overarching strategy as far as how to differentiate and leverage all of our multiple technologies and differentiate ourselves in the market.
William Stein: Well, that's helpful. If I can have a follow-up, please. I think last quarter, you talked a little bit about a new area that the business was on investing in and that was high performance converters. I am wondering if you can provide an update on design wins, revenue, any sort of traction that we could think about there. Thank you.
Michael Hsing: Yes. Okay. That group will be joining and they brought in opportunity. We have six, seven guys joining the company and they brought in opportunities. We have the customers, okay, now. And they engage with the customers for the medical companies for a while. And so actually we don't any significant inputs, not a change. And I think that we work with these kind of things that takes about, this is very unusual, okay. So it takes less than a year, we can some results. Usually our product, even internal developments and the ground-up development, we are taking about two or three years to see anything. And this one is, okay, so far is looking good.
William Stein: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you so much. Our next question is from Rick Schafer with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead, Rick.
Rick Schafer: Thank you and congratulation to you guys. In a tough time, you continue to execute. I guess my first question, talking about tough times. I know everybody's seen IHS forecast auto SAAR, I think, down over 20% this year. You guys obviously have a content and it's a pretty significant share gains in that vertical. Do you look at that this year and say that that's enough to offset down, let's say, 20% SAAR? I mean, could your auto revenues be flat for the year? Could they grow in this kind of environment?
Michael Hsing: I think that we look at our history, okay. And we can tag on what is your macro economy segment growth in a downwards in our segment. And we are confident enough, we can say that we can beat it by 10%.
Bernie Blegen: Yes. We got an education in 2019 when there was a complete falloff in production in China and a soft demand in North America and Europe in particular. So I think if you use that as a guide, you can say that the SAAR was down but we were able to grow at about 13%, 14% last year. So to Michael's point is, you cannot apply whatever you think the market is going to do and we are going to outperform by a minimum of 10 percentage points. And last year, it's closer 20%.
Rick Schafer: Great. And then just pivoting into 5G and just maybe if you could provide an update on your 5G ramp opportunity? Maybe give us sense of the MPS dollar opportunity in a macro base station? And part of my question, I am just curious, it seems like such a massive opportunity for you guys. Could 5G be as big as server for you if we fast forwarded two or three years?
Michael Hsing: Yes. Okay. That's a good question. And I only can tell you this. We know 4G, we were out the door. We didn't have any chance. And this the first time we engage with a variety of customers and the ODMs and OEMs and event their suppliers. And so we engage both side, okay. And the real telecom companies and also their supply. And all we see of the opportunity is that we have never seen it before. How big the market is, okay? And we cannot quantify and I am not trying to tell we are in the dark here. We are new. We are a newcomer. And all I know, the opportunity is huge and we don't even try to quantify what's the opportunity. And we all notice as long it is very big.
Bernie Blegen: Yes. And I think you were asking for guidance on the dollar content for the base station. And Michael was correct that we don't have a number. We are too new.
Michael Hsing: Yes. I can tell you why we don't, okay. In a particularly and which segments of the 5G. Our product is in the building box of a 5G. So if you think about it as a brick for the building. And our product there is the standard product in those company and that's going to be use everywhere.
Rick Schafer: Got it. Thanks a lot guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Kamil Mielczarek with William Blair. Go ahead, Kamil.
Kamil Mielczarek: Hi. Congratulations on strong results in this uncertain environment. Can you tell me how design win activity has been trending during the pandemic versus your expectations? And how do you balance growth and margin in this environment? What levers you have to maintain or potentially expand gross margin? Thank you.
Michael Hsing: Yes. The gross margin obviously wiggles a little bit on the sideways in the second half of last year and we are not happy about it. But we try to be very consistent. And given the macro conditions, it kind of makes sense to us. But the new product, particularly the new product is slower. It's ramped at a pretty good rate. But in some of the higher value product it was slower. So that's why the margins go. But in the long term and the margin will steadily go up.
Kamil Mielczarek: And first part of the question was design activity?
Michael Hsing: Yes. Okay. Sorry, forgot about it. That was a very good question. And obviously normal activity slow down which doesn't impact us, okay. We are very much used to it in a work form from outside office. And we still very much engage with our customer but in a very different way, okay, very different market segments. Lot of them relates to medical equipment. And we shift our head where MPS in the past was always a pretty fast on the feet. And so we shift all our interests and we support those customers. But it's not like a normal business now.
Bernie Blegen: One thing I can add to that is that interestingly our operations and our customers' operations in China and in Asia came back online about a month ago. And so not going to try to say that our business as usual. But in the area of the world where we have up to 90% of our employees including a large share of our design professional as well as a majority of our end customer engagement, we were actually seeing a good cadence, good momentum. And as Michael said, on the U.S. front where we are still in the shelter in place, both in our Washington and in our San Jose offices, we have developed over the last several years the ability to both do field application engineering and customer engagement via Zoom and we are fairly competent of that.
Michael Hsing: Bernie, it's not like 90%. It more like a 60% some percent, okay. Yes, we do have a testing and a reliability center that's in China, but in terms of the number of people, Asia, across the Asia, including Japan and most of the U.S. and Europe is okay, including Japan, probably as some percent, okay.
Bernie Blegen: Yes.
Michael Hsing: Yes. So we are more diverse across the world.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And our next question is from Hans Mosesmann with Rosenblatt Securities.
Kevin Garrigan: Hi guys. This is Kevin Garrigan, on for Hans. Thank you for taking my question. And congrats on the results. Just one quick one for me and my apologies if you had alluded to this already. You had mentioned that you are seeing minimal supply disruptions and that's driving good momentum with your Chinese customers. Can you give us any color in terms of if you are seeing any demand disruption?
Michael Hsing: I don't know it was the Chinese customers. Did we say that, may be, okay. That's a misunderstanding, okay. And Bernie, you want to say that, okay?
Bernie Blegen: Yes. As far as any demand disruption occurring, we haven't seen any cancellation of projects or push-outs in orders in a material basis. Obviously, the duration of the macro environment is not understood right now. So we are very sensitive to seeing any early warning signs that we need to react to in this volatile environment. But as at this point in time, we have not seen a step down in demand on a broad base. There are some pockets that we mentioned in an earlier answer.
Kevin Garrigan: Okay. Got it. Thank you.
Bernie Blegen: Thank you Kevin.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from David Williams with Loop Capital. Please go ahead, David.
David Williams: Hi. Good afternoon and congrats on the quarter. Thanks for taking the question as well. I just wanted to see if you had any color on maybe the console launches that are expected, you said, in the second half. How do you think that will ramp? Do you have a sense of what the demand is going to look like or what those volumes could potentially be?
Michael Hsing: Yes. We have a pretty good knowledge but I cannot say that, okay. But that business is very cyclical, okay. And that's a very, for MPS is good money. And for stock value, okay, it's very contrary to what we do. It is very cyclical and that it ramp up and it buys once a year and for most of the year, they don't do anything, okay. And we have, after that, we had to fill up the gas. We have done pretty good in the last two or three years. But as the revenue keep growing, that will be a small part of our MPS business.
David Williams: Great. Thank you. And then just kind of thinking about the comm segment and the design wins and maybe design activity there. Are you seeing a broader base of designs outside of maybe Huawei or some of the other larger companies? Just kind of can you talk about where your seeing the most potential or the most opportunity there?
Bernie Blegen: Sure. And if you look worldwide as far as where a lot of the deployment is, it is in those China and South Korea right now. Europe and North America has been a little slower. So most of our design engagement for now has been in the lab as opposed to actually being commercially rolled out.
David Williams: Okay. Great. Sorry, go ahead.
Michael Hsing: No. I just wanted to clarify, we don't employ any customers in our core. And we disclosed that we have large customers, okay. And by rules, okay. So in the 5G, as I said earlier, we engage not only one, okay and many different kind of different like telephone companies. We are also engaged with many different of their space.
David Williams: Okay. Very good. And then lastly for me is, if you are thinking about the rest of the year and even the second quarter perhaps, what are your largest unknowns or potential hurdles that you kind of think about, areas of weakness could be seen? Or what are the areas, I guess, that you are most either troubled or concerned with or I guess paying most attention to, through the back of the year here?
Michael Hsing: [indiscernible].
Bernie Blegen: Michael, you are breaking up again. I am sorry. You are breaking up.
Michael Hsing: I will give you a philosophical joke, okay. Have a joke. We really worry about toilet paper effect. And it's actually, we don't know, then again the demands are very good for the second half of the year. And using, so as we do, okay. And when everything is good, they cancel and over order. And we won't see it, okay. Of course we try very hard, okay, to find what is the real reason, okay. And so far, we have a very good, that's what we try to do, okay. And until our customers start screaming at it. And then we are shipping a product.
Bernie Blegen: Yes. So as opposed to a concern of a rapid fall off, right now we are managing is the toilet paper effect where there is so much in badgering the demand we want to make sure that we are not building inventory on in the channel or in the distributor's warehouses. And the way we do that is we don't ship to the level that they requested. And then if they really do have a stock outage where they are going to lines down, we will hear about it quickly and respond to that. So that's the issue that we are managing now as far as looking beyond that. Maybe we will have better guidance or outlook next quarter.
David Williams: Okay. Well, thanks so much. I appreciate. And the best of luck.
Bernie Blegen: Thank you.
Michael Hsing: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our Q&A session for today. I will turn the call back to Bernie Blegen for his final remarks.
Bernie Blegen: Right. Thank you very much. I would like to thank you all for joining us in this conference call. I look forward to talking to you again during our second quarter conference call, which will likely be at the end of July. Thank you and have a nice day.
Operator: And with that, ladies and gentlemen, we thank you for participating in today's program. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-02-06 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to Monolithic Power Systems’ Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call.. At this time all participants lines are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Monolithic‘s CFO, Bernie Blegen. Please go ahead, sir.
Bernie Blegen: Thank you very much. Good afternoon, and welcome to the fourth quarter 2019 Monolithic Power Systems conference call. I’m joined today by Michael Hsing, Monolithic’s CEO and Founder.In the course of today’s conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management’s current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor Statement contained in the earnings release published today.Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor Statement contained in the Q4 earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on March 1, 2019, and Form 10-Q filed on November 1, 2019, both of which are accessible through our website, www.monolithicpower.com.MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today’s call. We will be discussing gross margins, operating expense, R&D and SG&A expense, operating income, interest and other income, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the Q4 2018, Q3 2019 and Q4 2019 earnings releases as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our website.I’d also like to remind you that today’s conference call is being webcast live over the Internet and will be available for replay on our website for 1 year, along with earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today.For the full year 2019, MPS achieved record revenue of $627.9 million, growing 7.8% from the prior year, while our industry segment experienced a significant downturn. As always, we executed our strategies consistently.In recent years, especially in 2019, more and more first-tier companies recognized MPS’ superior technologies as well as our product quality and our excellent customer support.We see a lot more high-quality growth opportunities ahead of us. Our objective is to successfully manage our expenses to support our growth, which will, in turn, benefit our shareholders in both the long and short term.Here are a few highlights which we achieved in 2019. Introduced leading-edge system solutions using QSMoD technologies for GPU-based, artificial intelligence and machine learning applications.Introduced 48-volt QSMoD technology for both cloud-based and automotive applications, coupled with our design wins in QSMoD in AI applications, MPS is at the early stage of this important revenue ramp. Won a major contract to support a tier 1 automotive supplier, which will begin generating revenue in the next 2 to 3 years.Successfully co-developed cutting-edge solutions for smart driving systems and lighting applications. Began volume shipments of high current programmable power modules for communication applications such as 5G networks.Entered the high-performance analog market with the formation of a high-precision data acquisition business group. With input from our customers, we have completed the detailed product specifications. We expect to release these products in 2020.The initial revenue ramp is expected to begin in 2021. The rollout of these advanced products will mark MPS’ introduction in the highly profitable, high-speed precision data acquisition market segment.We understand the road to success may not be smooth, however, we believe our commitment will pay off in the long term and our shareholders will be pleased with the results of these efforts in the coming years.Let’s go through low lights. We really don’t have any, except there is one item worth pointing out. We deliberately reduced our inventory in Q3 and Q4 2019, which in hindsight was not necessary. As a result, our current inventory level is too low for MPS to maximize our growth in the next few months.Although we can still keep up our growth rate as in the past, we, unfortunately, may not be able to take full advantage of all the potential upside. In order to fulfill customers’ demand in the second half of 2020, we now have to commit tremendous effort in order to accelerate our schedule to bring up a second 12-inch fab. This has created an unnecessary hardship for our team.Turning back to our full year 2019 revenue by market segment compared with 2018. Communications revenue, up 20.1%. Computing and storage, up 18.9%. Automotive, up 12.8%. And industrial, up 12.3%. Consumer revenue was down 10.8%. Full year 2019 computing and storage revenue grew $30.1 million over the prior year to $189.2 million. This 18.9% increase primarily resulted from strong sales growth for cloud computing and high-end notebooks. Computing and storage revenue Represented 30.1% of MPS’ total revenue in 2019 compared with 27.3% in 2018.Communications revenue grew $14.2 million to $84.8 million. This improvement was primarily due to initial ramping of 5G infrastructure sales. Communications revenue represented 13.5% of our 2019 revenue compared with 12.1% in 2018.Automotive revenue grew $10.2 million to $90.3 million in 2019. This growth primarily represented increased sales of infotainment, safety and connectivity application products. Automotive revenue represented 14.4% of MPS’ full year 2019 revenue compared with 13.8% in 2018.Industrial revenue grew $10.9 million to $99.4 million in 2019. This growth reflected sales for applications in power sources, security and industrial meters. Industrial revenue represented 15.8% of MPS’ full year 2019 revenue compared with 15.2% in 2018.Consumer revenue fell $19.9 million to $164.2 million, with the exception of home appliances and wearables, all major consumer markets decreased between years. Consumer revenue represented 26.2% of MPS’ full year 2019 revenue compared with 31.6% in 2018.Switching to Q4. MPS had a record fourth quarter with revenue of $166.7 million, 1.2% lower than revenue generated in the third quarter of 2019, but 8.6% higher than the comparable quarter of 2018. Our market segment revenue from computing and storage grew 27.8% year-over-year.Automotive grew 8.6% and communications grew 8.5%. Industrial was essentially even with Q4 2018, while consumer revenue fell 5.7% from the prior year.Fourth quarter 2019 GAAP gross margin was 55.1%, 10 basis points lower than the third quarter of 2019, but even with margin reported in the fourth quarter of 2018. Our GAAP operating income was $30.7 million compared to $30.0 million reported in third quarter of 2019 and $33.1 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2018.Fourth quarter 2019 non-GAAP gross margin was 55.5%, 10 basis points lower than both the third quarter of 2019 and the fourth quarter of 2018. Our non-GAAP operating income was $50.8 million compared to $51.4 million reported in the prior quarter and $46.6 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2018.Let’s review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $61.2 million in the fourth quarter compared with $63.1 million in the third quarter of 2019 and $51.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2018.Our non-GAAP fourth quarter 2019 operating expenses were $41.8 million, down from the $42.5 million we spent in the third quarter of 2019, but up from the $38.7 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2018.On both the GAAP and a non-GAAP basis, fourth quarter 2019 litigation expenses were $991,000 compared with a $692,000 expense in Q3 2019 and a $409,000 expense in Q4 2018.The differences between GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are stock compensation and income or loss from an unfunded deferred comp plan.Fourth quarter 2019 stock compensation expense, including $574,000 charged to cost of goods sold was $18.7 million compared with $21.3 million recorded in the third quarter of 2019.Switching to the bottom line. Fourth quarter 2019 GAAP net income was $32.4 million or $0.70 per fully diluted share compared with $0.64 per share in the third quarter of 2019 and $0.61 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018.Q4 2019 non-GAAP net income was $48.4 million or $1.04 per fully diluted share compared with $1.08 per share in the third quarter of 2019 and $0.99 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q4 2019 were 46.5 million.Now let’s look at the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2019, cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $458.5 million compared to $422.0 million at the end of the third quarter of 2019. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $61.0 million compared with Q3 2019 operating cash flow of $72.4 million. Fourth quarter 2019 capital spending totaled $8.7 million.Accounts receivable ended the fourth quarter of 2019 at $52.7 million or 29 days of sales outstanding compared with the $58.3 million or 31 days reported at the end of the third quarter of 2019 and the $55.2 million or 33 days reported in the fourth quarter of 2018.Our internal inventories at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019 were $127.5 million, down from the $135.6 million at the end of the third quarter of 2019. Days of inventory fell to 155 days at the end of Q4 2019 from 163 days at the end of the third quarter of 2019.Before turning to our outlook for Q1 2020, I would like to remind everybody of our long-term non-GAAP financial model, which has been largely unchanged for the past 5 years.First, we target to grow revenue in a rate that is 10 to 15 percentage points greater than our peers. In a year where the market is expected to grow between 5 to 8 percentage points, we believe that MPS should be able to grow annual revenue from 15% to 20%. Second, we target quarterly gross margin to grow by 10 to 20 basis points sequentially.Third, to ensure continued growth, we target increases in our R&D and SG&A investment at 50% to 60% of the annual revenue growth rate. Finally, we expect to return 30% to 40% of the company’s annual free cash flow to shareholders.This long-term financial model is an important tool in setting expectations for accelerated revenue growth and providing operating leverage while allowing for a proper level of business reinvestment.I would now like to turn to our Q1 2020 outlook. We are forecasting Q1 2020 revenue in the range of $161 million to $167 million. We also expect the following: GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.1% to 55.7%.Non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.4% to 56.0%. Total stock-based compensation expense of $18 million to $20 million, including approximately $600,000 that would be charged to cost of goods sold.GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses between $58.4 million and $62.4 million. Non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to be in the range of $41.0 million to $43.0 million. This estimate excludes stock compensation and litigation expenses. Litigation expenses to be in the range of $1.5 million to $2.5 million as NPS prepares for an upcoming trial, which is set to begin at the end of March. Interest income is expected in the range -- to range from $1.5 million to $1.7 million before foreign exchange gains or losses. Fully diluted shares to be in the range of 46.2 million to 47.2 million shares. Finally, we are pleased to announce a 25% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.50 per share from $0.40 per share for shareholders of record as of March 31, 2020.In conclusion, we will continue executing on our strategy and winning market share. I will now open the phone lines for questions.
Operator: Thank you [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jeremy Kwan with Stifel, Nicolaus. Your line is open.
Jeremy Kwan: Yes, good afternoon. Congrats on the strong results and outlook, especially in a challenging environment. I guess my first question, regarding - you mentioned about not having sufficient inventory in hand to meet all the immediate demand you’re seeing, is there a way you can kind of quantify what’s kind of being left on the table? And is there a chance to capture this maybe later on in the coming quarters?
Michael Hsing: All these products, which is design [indiscernible] and our customers have upside, there is - many of us - many of them, they told us. So we believe, okay, these are - these sockets are difficult to change. And they’re not changing - it can change month by month, and those volumes still will be with us.
Bernie Blegen: Yes. We’re not trying to identify a risk factor with regard to our ability to execute against expectations. We’re just saying that it would be imprudent for us to allow our investors to believe that there is even more upside beyond that because we may have some constraints with regard to inventory.
Michael Hsing: Yes, our inventories, we involve a few thousand products. And very difficult to predict, which was the ramp ahead of - which ones to ramp first. And so that causes a lot of problems for our planning and also for our shipments. We’re now doing partial shipment.
Jeremy Kwan: Great. Thank you very much. That’s helpful clarity. And I guess my follow-up would be, Bernie, you mentioned entering the high-performance analog market with the high-precision data acquisition group, can you give us more details about this, maybe you or Michael, maybe what initial application is going to go after first and how do you plan to compete in this market and maybe your sales strategy? Do you need more distribution partners or is this something that you can leverage your e-commerce platform? Thank you.
Michael Hsing: The initial one is in - these initial market segments there in the communications and as well as medical applications. And we don’t have a long-term strategy. I think through our Internet - through our e-commerce and we tried to push everything through e-commerce.
Jeremy Kwan: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Alessandra Vecchi with William Blair. Your line is open.
Alessandra Vecchi: Thanks. Congratulations on a wonderful quarter. Just on 48-volt, you talked about the new product introductions in 2019 and I believe you guys said on the last earnings call that you’d be seeing some revenue in Q1. Can you just update us on that and how we should think about the total revenue opportunity there as we look into 2020 and 2021?
Bernie Blegen: Yes. I don’t think that we guided, per se, on giving an exact revenue outlook for Q1 with beginning of 48-volt. But we said that it would be in 2020. And right now, it’s - everything is tracking pretty much along our expectations.So what’s really exciting is that I think that it validates our strategy to have gone into 48-volt and to enjoy and participate in many of the opportunities there it brings us.
Alessandra Vecchi: Okay. That’s helpful. And then I apologize if I missed it, but Bernie, did you give us a little bit of clarity in terms of by segment in Q1. What segments maybe you thought would be the strongest sequentially?
Bernie Blegen: Yes. Again, I think the broader question there is what’s going to be -- what is the revenue drivers looking like. And at this point, I think it’s a continuation of more of what we’ve been seeing recently. So for example, the compute and storage market is very well positioned for growth in the early part of the year. Likewise, communication, we believe that there’s also a significant opportunity for growth, particularly in Q1.When you look at - oh, I should make 1 asterisk on computing, notebooks, which are -- we report in computing, are seasonal. And coming out of Q4, they tend to have a seasonal decline, which we are anticipating as well. But when you look at storage or cloud computing, I think that they were very well positioned.And then after that, if you look at consumer again, that still has not hit a steady state or show any signs of being healthy. And again, consumer is also very seasonal, and it’s normal to expect a decline from Q4 to Q1.And then when you look at Industrial, a lot of that was revenue performance, particularly in the second half of the year. It reflected inventory builds on the part of certain of our customers who are anticipating trade restrictions. And so that area may fall off in Q1. In automotive, that tends to go either on the plateau or when it fits designed in your new revenue opportunity, there’s a spike.
Alessandra Vecchi: Okay. Just on automotive, some other semiconductor companies have alluded to sort of a bottoming out improvement there. So are you seeing a similar situation? I know it depends on what model you’re designed into and whatnot, but do you feel like the worst is behind you?
Michael Hsing: I think that we are too small to call the industry. We are growing to all these Greenfield markets and the leasings that we say that isn’t end of the world. All this is the beginning of the world. It’s the beginning in the world for MPS.
Alessandra Vecchi: Understood. That’s it from me. Thank you so much.
Michael Hsing: Thanks, Aless.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michelle Waller with Needham. Your line is open.
Michelle Waller: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the results. So I guess the first one for me, in terms of the next-generation gaming consoles launching in 2020, could you guys walk us through what the ramp is expected to look like for MPS. Is it only a back half driver or do you think you’ll see some meaningful uptick in 2Q? And from a gross margin perspective, how should we think about the impact of corporate gross margins during that ramp?
Michael Hsing: Are you talking about gaming, particularly?
Michelle Waller: Yes. And specifically, yes.
Michael Hsing: Gaming is not a major part of our business. And that is all into the one product, is in a consumer segment, and it is in a share, the similar CPU co-power. And so the business is very lumpy. And - but we treat this very opportunistically. And our customers really like our solutions, and we will support them when the demands come.
Bernie Blegen: And we probably expect to see a similar ramp as we did in 2017.
Michelle Waller: Okay. That’s helpful. And then for my follow-up, you guys mentioned previously that your dollar content opportunity with the Whitley server platform increased to $70 from $50 in the Purley platform.I’m just trying to figure out - I know this is a bit further off, but with the equal stream platform that’s expected to launch in 2021, how do you guys see your dollar content opportunity changing generation over generation? Or just any color you can give there would be helpful.
Bernie Blegen: On the dollar content, we don’t - we haven’t seen an opportunity to expand beyond what we currently are getting on the V14. But then again, the specs are not entirely finalized. So if it turns out that the space of the power requirements are materially different from what V14 is, there might be an opportunity for pricing leverage.
Michelle Waller: Okay. Thank you. That’s all from me.
Bernie Blegen: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Ramsay with Cowen. Your line is open.
Josh Buchalter: Hey, guys. This is Josh Buchalter on behalf of Matt. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the results in a tough environment. I guess the first question was, if we think about your inventory commentary from last quarter, are there any couple of items in particular that you could point to that drove the change in your thought process from 3Q to 4Q?And then also, is there any margin impact from bringing on the new 12-inch fab and your sort of what sounds like capacity constraints?
Michael Hsing: Well, we’re talking about margins. And if you were 12-inch fabs, okay, every time we’re bringing up a fab is and not - we will have a very immediate impact for the margin improvement. All these product - these products that are from new fab is always a year or 2 years down the road. We - in terms of which segments of where our inventory is tight and, again, it’s actually across the board.
Josh Buchalter: Got it. Thank you. And I guess, in the beginning of the call, you mentioned several tier 1 companies launching with your design wins. Were there any, I guess, if you could rank order 1 or 2 that you’re most excited about heading into 2020? Thank you and congrats again.
Michael Hsing: These are, we said it and Bernie said at the beginning of the call, so okay, these are things that were - these are the few things that we achieved in the 2019. And all of these will generate a significant revenue in 2020.
Bernie Blegen: Yes, and it’s not restricted to any 1 end market segment, it’s actually very broad-based to the level of the customer engagement that we’re receiving from Tier 1s.
Josh Buchalter: Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Rick Schafer with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Rick Schafer: Yes. Hi, guys. I’ll echo everyone else’s congratulations on another monolithic quarter, another great quarter. So good job. I just had a maybe question. On Coronavirus, since it’s a topic, is your - you guys have 3 of your 4 production foundries in China, so I’m just curious, Michael or Bernie, if you’re seeing any signs of supply disruption? Or do you expect to see any signs once guys just start coming back to work next week.
Michael Hsing: All the fab, as far as we know, they are all open. They are all operating. And they’re in a really tight conditions, okay? And all the assemblies, same things, okay. And so far and really hasn’t disrupted our supply.
Bernie Blegen: And again, Rick, it’s a very early stage to really fully appreciate or understand how any of our businesses will be impacted.
Rick Schafer: Sure, sure. I understand. So maybe a follow-up, if I could. Just on your auto bus, I know you guys secured one of the, I think, the number 1 Tier 1 auto supplier a few months ago. I’m just curious where we stand on securing the number 2 Tier 1 auto supplier.And as part of your answer, I’m curious, I mean, from after you signed number 1, have you seen - is it too soon to have seen any noticeable uptick in design activity, and maybe also just a comment on China in general. I know - I’d be interested. I know that it was kind of a slow year for China auto, they basically canceled\ the design here, I think, last year or the model year. I’m curious kind of what your expectations are for China this year, what you’re seeing? Thanks.
Michael Hsing: Well, okay. Overall, everybody told us, like, all those will not be a good year, okay? But from the NPS side, we are looking pretty good in fall of 2020. And all these number 1 and number 2 and number 3, all those and we are deeply engaged in that we see all the activities that we the more than we can handle it. And now we have to pick and choose.
Rick Schafer: Got it. Thanks, Michael.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, guys. This is Melissa on behalf of Ross. Congratulations on the really solid quarter. I know you guys don’t guide out more than one quarter. But I guess, from a high-level perspective, now that we’re coming out of this industry downturn, what are your expectations for returning to either seasonal or even above seasonal growth? Is this moderated by what - by your inventory constraints? And how are you thinking about the slip of the recovery from here?
Michael Hsing: Well, you call it industrial out of the downturn came. And as you said - as Bernie said earlier, so we will grow above the industrial market, okay? Plus what’s your upturn and about 10% - 15% to 20%. So we committed on that.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, great. And then does the inventory constraints, is that kind of restricting that growth prospect? Or do you think you can still kind of hit that target?
Michael Hsing: We tried to - and I as we couldn’t - as we said earlier, we cannot maximize it because our customers are pulling in those - pulling the requirements, okay? And so we have to keep them on line up and we have the partial shipment. And that’s - our inventory is in a very low stage, okay?
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. And then the last one for me is your computing and storage segment has been driving really strong growth and I was just curious when you look into 2020, how are you thinking about this shape of that business?And in particular, are you worried about any risk of inventory digestion of lumpy buying or do you think that it’s really strong secular growth that’s driving the strength?
Bernie Blegen: Yes. When you look at 2019, I think that first half of the year was an anomaly where the hyperscales were trying to digest excess capacity. And so I would see, with the V14 haven’t been just recently rolled out a return to a more normalized adoption process.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Your line is open.
Tore Svanberg: Yes, thank you. And congratulation, again. Very nice results. First question on inventory being tight. I mean you’re at 156 days. So how tight is it? I mean I know you want to run a little bit higher than that, but it doesn’t seem alarmingly low either. So maybe you could just elaborate a little bit on that.
Bernie Blegen: I think we’re at 155 days right now. And if you were to look at sort of the industry standards, we’re probably in at about the midpoint range of what people might expect. There’s two things though that differentiate us. The first is the diversity of the number of products that we maintain and then the second is that we build inventories ahead of when we sell them. And as a result, because we’re growing at a rate that is 10 to 15 percentage points faster than the industry that puts more pressure on us to have more inventory available in an earlier stage.So it’s as much a risk management decision with the level we carry. And I think that we’ve said previously that we’re more comfortable with inventory levels between about 160 and 180 days.
Michael Hsing: Yes. For the stagnant companies, inventory, yes, is very predictable. For the growth company and we have a particular for NPS, we have - it is not thousands, we have hundreds of projects and that they are taking off. And some of those faster, other ones the slowest, how do we pick on those? Very difficult to call.
Tore Svanberg: Well, it’s a good problem to have. Second question, and I always ask you this, Michael, if you could give us an update on your e-commerce business. We’ve noticed that the website keeps changing. So if you could update on those, that would be great? Thanks.
Michael Hsing: The e-commerce side, okay, other than MPS website, e-commerce and we’re still learning from that one, okay. But our product to sell to the third party e-commerce site is doing really well.And so as a result of our learning and we’re changing it. You’ve seen that on our website. And so far, we can’t give you the significant number yet, okay? But our views at 2020, end of 2020, I think that they will move some needles.
Tore Svanberg: Great. So at least, you’re now seeing that the traffic really moving in the right direction, it sounds like.
Michael Hsing: Yes. The key is the traffic. But yes, your key is the traffic. So we can - I can give you analogies in a, we believe again, a year ago, we believe that there’s a lot of fishing in the Pacific Ocean. So we dropped the fish in the middle of Pacific Ocean, we didn’t comment anything.And our learning, we’re fishing what kind of fish, where are they? We’re a lot more targeted. So we went through - we have gone through that phase, okay? We’re not a lot more targeted now.
Tore Svanberg: Very good. Make sure you have enough date. Last question on the eMotion business, if you could also update us there, including, obviously, your system-level motor products?
Michael Hsing: Yes. So the model is that the intended is just not selling the models motors and intended to provide a convenience for our customers for the initial ramp. So okay, we - those business at the very beginning, and I go through, we see quite a few orders from our Internet and then, typically, those customers are going very slow.And I mean, that - their project takes a year and 1.5 years and it - to ramp. It’s not like they’re selling a silicon piece, okay? And usually models for the guys that takes about 3 or 4 years.And in terms of eMotion, we have - I don’t know what - Bernie, maybe you can say that, okay, $20-some million this year, more than $20 million - last year, $20-some million. This year, we’re going to keep up a similar growth rate. And that - so we’ll be - certainly would be a $30 million or $40 million.
Bernie Blegen: I think that we’re comfortable in saying that it can be a $30 million or $40 million business here in the next few years. I think, though, that Michael makes a very good point as far as the length of time between adoption and when you actually generate revenue, many of those applications, almost have characteristics similar to automotive.
Tore Svanberg: Very good. Congratulations again.
Bernie Blegen: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And I’m showing no further questions at this time. I’d like to turn the call back to Bernie Blegen for any closing remarks.
Bernie Blegen: Thank you. I’d like to thank you all for joining us for this conference call and look forward to talking to you again during our first quarter 2020 conference call, which will likely be in April. Thank you, and have a nice day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-10-23 18:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to Monolithic Power Systems Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Chief Executive Officer of Monolithic Power Systems, Michael Hsing. Sir, please go ahead.
Michael Hsing: Thank you. Hello, everyone. Good morning from Shanghai. We held our third quarter board meeting in a newly established customer support and marketing center for China. We had our board members for the facilities and to overseas operations here. In the last few days, we received many messages that have showed overwhelming support in response to a recent publication. I’m representing MPS management to express our deep appreciation for your trust and support. Our reaction to this publication is that it is malicious and manipulative. We will not bore your intelligence to go through the details. Lastly, I assure you we will take appropriate actions, including legal actions, against any malicious and unlawful activities damaging MPS reputation and our shareholders interest. Thank you again. Now with that I’ll let Bernie to speak about earnings.
Bernie Blegen: Thank you for that. Good afternoon, and welcome to the third quarter 2019 Monolithic Power Systems conference call. In the course of today’s conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risks and uncertainties, which could cause results to differ materially from management’s current views and expectations. Please refer to the safe harbor statements contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the safe harbor statements contained in the Q3 release and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on March 1, 2019 and Q2 2019, Form 10-Q filed on August 2, 2019, both of which are accessible through our website at www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today’s call. We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, R&D and SG&A expense, operating income, interest and other income, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the Q3 2018, Q2 2019 and Q3 2019 releases as well as the reconciling tables that are posted on our website. I’d also like to remind you that today’s conference call is being webcast live over the Internet and will be available for replay on our website for one year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. MPS achieved record third quarter revenue of $168.8 million, 11.8% higher than revenue in the second quarter of 2019 and 5.5% higher than the comparable quarter in 2018. Looking at our revenue by market; in our computing and storage market, third quarter revenue of $52.8 million increased $11.2 million or 26.9% from the second quarter of 2019. Computing and storage revenue represented 31.3% of MPS’ third quarter 2019 revenue. The sequential quarterly revenue growth was broad-based for sales gains reported in power management for TPUs, high-end notebooks, servers and storage. Coupled with our recent design wins using QSMod, Quantum State Modulation, in server and AI applications, MPS is at the early stage of this important revenue ramp. I also would like to introduce a killer product, a next-generation 48-volt power solution for artificial intelligence, server and supercomputing applications. This solution offers one of the highest levels of energy efficiency with the smallest form factor of its class. Our customers have validated our solutions as we believe we’ll win market share in this important segment. Third quarter automotive revenue of $24.4 million grew 15.1% over the second quarter of 2019, reflecting initial sales of product for infotainment, smart lighting, ADAS and autonomous driving. In addition, we were awarded a relatively large contract at a major Tier 1 automobile supplier. We expect to begin generating revenue from this relationship in the next two to three years. Automobile revenue is 14.5% of MPS’ total third quarter 2019 revenue. Third quarter 2019 industrial revenue of $28.9 million increased 28.6% from the second quarter of 2019 due primarily to increased revenue for security systems, power sources and industrial meters. Much of this growth is projected to be project based, which can vary significantly by quarter. Industrial revenue represented 17.1% of our total third quarter 2019 revenue. In our consumer market, revenue of $43.9 million was essentially flat with the second quarter of 2019 and represented 26.0% of our second quarter 2019 revenue. Sequentially, third quarter revenue reflected a seasonal increase in certain legacy consumer markets offset by decreased sales of products for wearable applications and set-top boxes. Third quarter 2019 communications revenue of $18.8 million was down 14.5% from the second quarter of 2019. Infrastructure, 5G sales, along with sales for legacy router and wireless applications, decreased sequentially. Despite the sequential downturn in 5G revenue, we believe MPS is well positioned to benefit as existing design wins move to revenue. Communications sales represented 11.1% of our total third quarter 2019 revenue. GAAP gross margin was 55.2%, 10 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2019 and 40 basis points lower than the third quarter of 2018. Our GAAP operating income was $30.0 million compared to $20.1 million reported in second quarter of 2019 and $33.5 million reported in the third quarter of 2018. Non-GAAP gross margin for the second quarter of 2019 was 55.6%, matching the gross margin reported for the second quarter of 2019, but 50 basis points lower than the third quarter from a year ago. Our non-GAAP operating income was $51.4 million compared to $43.7 million reported in the prior quarter and $49.2 million reported in the third quarter of 2018. Let’s review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $63.1 million in the third quarter of 2019 compared with $63.1 million in the second quarter of 2019 and $55.5 million in the third quarter of 2018. Our non-GAAP third quarter 2019 operating expenses were $42.5 million, up from the $40.3 million we spent in the second quarter of 2019 and up from the $40.5 million reported in the third quarter of 2018. The difference between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are stock compensation expense and income or loss on an unfunded deferred compensation plan. For the third quarter of 2019, total stock compensation expense including approximately $641,000 charge to cost of goods sold was $21.3 million compared to $22.7 million reported in the second quarter of 2019. Switching to the bottom line; third quarter 2019 GAAP net income was $29.5 million or $0.64 per fully diluted share compared with $20.7 million or $0.45 per share in the second quarter of 2019 and $31.6 million or $0.71 per share in the third quarter of 2018. Q3 non-GAAP net income was $49.5 million or $1.08 per fully diluted share compared with $41.9 million or $0.92 per share in the second quarter of 2019 and $47.3 million or $1.06 per share in the third quarter of 2018, fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q3 2019 was 45.8 million. Now let’s look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $422.0 million at the end of the third quarter of 2019 compared to $369.7 million at the end of the second quarter of 2019. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $72.0 million compared with Q2 2019 operating cash flow of $44.1 million. Third quarter 2019 capital spending totaled $9.1 million. Accounts receivable ended the third quarter of 2019 at $58.3 million, representing 31 days sales outstanding, which is two days lower than the 33 days reported at the end of the second quarter of 2019 and three days lower than the 34 days at the third quarter of 2018. Our internal inventories at the end of the third quarter of 2019 were $135.6 million, down from the $143.6 million at the end of the second quarter of 2019. Days of inventory of 163 days at the end of the third quarter of 2019 were 30 days lower than at the end of the second quarter of 2019. The drop in inventory, both in terms of dollars and days, represent management’s decision to slow wafer start in response to the market downturn. Under normal circumstances, we are comfortable carrying a higher level of inventory to support our accelerated rate of revenue growth given that most of our products are not customer or application-specific and carries minimal obsolescence risk. I would like to turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2019. We are forecasting Q4 revenue in the range of $160 million to $166 million. We also expect the following: GAAP gross margin in the range of 54.8% to 55.4%; non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.2% to 55.8%; total stock-based compensation expense of $18.3 million to $20.3 million, including approximately $600,000 that would be charged to cost of goods sold; GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses between $56.2 million and $60.2 million; non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses expected to be in the range of $38.5 million to $40.5 million. Litigation expense should range between $800,000 to $1.2 million. Interest income is expected to range from $1.4 million to $1.6 million. Fully diluted shares to be in the range of 45.8 million to 46.8 million shares. In conclusion, we continue to execute and deliver the results that speak for themselves. I will now open the phone lines for questions. Hello?
Operator: Yes, sir. Are we ready for questions?
Bernie Blegen: Yes.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Rick Schafer: Hi, guys, congratulations on a nice quarter and another tough setup, but a nice job on the quarter. I guess my first question is really compute, industrial, auto, I mean, all these sort of high-margin kind of new verticals for you, are all up nicely, I think, double digits year-over-year. Maybe could you talk a little bit about relative strength by region or any color you could give there and if you had any 10% customers or anybody close to 10%, any particular customer strength in the quarter?
Bernie Blegen: Sure. Let me sort of stuck that off. It wasn’t [indiscernible]. I think to restate Rick’s question, if that will help [indiscernible] is that we are observing that there is a good relative strength in the quarter for automotive, computing and industrial. And so if you’re looking for a little bit of color as far as the geographic distribution and if there are any 10% customers or what the level of concentration is like. So yes, I got it. So Rick, if you put your finger on that right mix of what drove our Q3 performance, so if I can comment first on the computing and storage. Computing and storage, for us, in the first half exhibited some weakness over what it has done in 2018. And we saw in Q3 strong momentum across all of our lines of business, and there was no individual concentration that drove that nor geographic. So that was nice to see just because in the first half of this year, there has been weak demand. In industrial, that has been an area that has been benefiting or maybe I should say affected by ordering ahead of demand today. And some of that is occurring in China, anticipating any further trading actions. So that was pretty concentrated in power sources and surveillance. Automotive is very broad-based as far as seeing a beginning of sales in new model years to Europe and Korea as well as return of some ordering levels in China. And while I don’t have it exactly at my fingertips, I do not believe we have any 10% customers that we’ll be expecting this quarter.
Rick Schafer: Okay. Thanks. I apologize if it’s difficult to hear me. My second question and my follow-up is just on 5G. It’s obviously becoming a bigger contributor to the MPS growth story. And I know you talked about it being softer in the recent quarter, but obviously, the order book looks good. So what’s your visibility on reacceleration in your 5G business? And maybe if you could provide a little bit of color about what that dollar content opportunity is for you guys, some color on your competition there and maybe share assumptions or expectations. Just some general color on 5G, please.
Michael Hsing: Okay. General color on 5G?
Bernie Blegen: Yes.
Michael Hsing: Okay. On the 5G, what we see is that our customers telling us that there’s more to ramp, okay, as they said, this current – this quarter than that. And I see this is very initial ramp. So it is somewhat lumpy. And for the next few quarters, our customers, they will follow – our forecast is that they will start pulling in materials. And so whether from the last few quarters to this quarter to the next few quarters, okay, our guess is that still the initial ramp, that kind of looks – the ramp is not very smooth, kind of lumpy.
Rick Schafer: Okay. Michael, any comment on sort of dollar opportunity, dollar content opportunity when you think about a 5G base station for MPS?
Michael Hsing: For us, it is difficult to capture because we provide the very basic building block. From the base station to signal chain and to central stations, we provide just the basic building block. We actually don’t know where the product ended up.
Rick Schafer: Okay. Understood. Thanks and congrats again.
Michael Hsing: Thanks Rick.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from William Stein of SunTrust. Your line is open.
William Stein: Great. I think it’s – we’re all having trouble hearing each other perhaps. So, I’ll speak really slowly. I’m hoping you can comment on channel inventory levels, perhaps remind us what the target level is, what that level of inventory was earlier in the year, where it was in Q3 and perhaps where you expect it to go in Q4?
Bernie Blegen: Sure. So at the beginning of this year, and let me open up with, is that we haven’t disclosed the range that we manage to. We talk in more qualitative terms. But certainly, as we look at the end of Q1, we finished above our normal range. And a lot of that has to do with the fact that in the quarter, we had higher sales in January and March with the March sales being disproportional to an even spread. The distributor did not have an opportunity to sell through to end customers. So that’s why that was up. In Q2, we had a more even distribution, and days in the channel returned to normal – at the upper end but normal range. And then in the current quarter, we actually saw terrific sell-through. And again, this is broad-based in all of our geographies. And what we have seen is that we’re actually at the lower end of our range as we finished Q3. So, I’d make that similar comment as I did on the inventories on the book. But that’s probably not a level that we care to sustain that, but it certainly was positive to show that, the strong sell-through.
Michael Hsing: Yes. Let me remind everybody. I think that in the early – regarding to the inventory, in early this year, in one of – I think it’s in February earnings call, we commented that the outlook was uncertain and our inventory buildup, that was due to last December quarters that we anticipated the normal growth for MPS is over 20% growth for the entire 2019. And in February, we started to reduce our wafer starts in reacting to more criticism. And also, we don’t see clear futures. And now we ended up at the very low inventory days and low inventory. We have to build it up again.
Bernie Blegen: And this is referring to the inventory that’s on our books, not in the channel.
William Stein: Great. If I can have one follow-up, please. I think we’re all very interested in your expectations for growth in the coming year. I’m not expecting you to guide necessarily for next year, but I think we have an expectation that through the cycle, you post something on the order of up 20 per year. Do you think next year is going to be typical or reflect a recovery in the broader market so you could at least get close to that number? Or do you think that the current trade situation or anything else would hinder that and keep you materially below it?
Michael Hsing: Yes. Good question. And on this quarter, we delivered – remember, we don’t want to forecast the next quarter – no, we don’t want to forecast the next year. And throughout this period and I think last year, we said that it was not very clear. Now, we did say that all the greenfield products for MPS, our greenfield market segments, they will start to grow. And the initial growth, as we just said, even with the 5G ramp, it’s not very smooth. It’s not very – it’s kind of lumpy. And we – this quarter, we see 5G is not as good as expected. And now the next few quarters start to put in. And so we do see all these – we see this very similar to other segments in auto and in industrial. And so next year, we can forecast our – what’s the growth rate. I think we’ll be better than the industry by 10% to 15%.
William Stein: Good enough. Thank you very much and congratulations on the good results and outlook in this tough environment.
Michael Hsing: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Your line is open.
Tore Svanberg: Yes. Let me echo the congratulations and especially on the record cash flows. So first question, and maybe just to get a clarification in here. So right now, your inventory days are at 160. So what you’re saying is that they will probably go back up again in Q4? That – will they sort of go back to the level you were in Q1 of this year?
Bernie Blegen: Yes. The range that we’re trying to manage between is 160 to 180 days for inventory in our balance sheet. And that may be a little bit higher than what industry and peer norms would be. But again, just going back to Michael’s point that we’re growing at 10 to 15 percentage points ahead of the market. And as a result, this growth is coming from greenfield opportunities with new products and new markets. And so what we do is we invest above the initial demand so that we have positive experiences with our customers.
Tore Svanberg: Very good. And yes, I mean that’s obviously why you had record cash flows this quarter, right, that inventory started selling through. That’s great. Second question is on automotive. So it’s about $100 million a year business now. And I think there’s no secret that you’re starting to gain a lot of traction with – directly with some of the OEMs. And you even mentioned one big contract. So as you think about $100 million, that does not include any other sort of direct OEM relationships that you started to have, correct?
Bernie Blegen: Sorry. I apologize. I didn’t know which end market you were talking about.
Tore Svanberg: Automotive. Automotive.
Bernie Blegen: Automotive?
Tore Svanberg: Yes. $100 million business now, yes.
Bernie Blegen: Okay. And so the question then is how much exposure do we have to the OEMs.
Tore Svanberg: No, no, no. The question is you started to establish some deeper relationships with the OEMs. I’m wondering if that’s sort of already contributing to that $100 million run rate. Or is that all new business that’s still on the come?
Bernie Blegen: So let me say back the question because we’re having difficulty hearing you. And I apologize about that. So you’re saying that on the $100 million run rate, as far as what is our exposure to the OEMs and how much of that is still – that’s roughly the question, yes.
Tore Svanberg: Yes, I mean that’s fine, yes. I’m just trying to understand how much of that business is coming from your more recent wins with bigger OEMs.
Michael Hsing: Oh, yes, yes. Okay. Recent win and the recent award, which is a relatively large project from a Tier 1 automotive supplier, it’s a relatively large project. This will be in the next two or three years. And so far, the existing revenues all ramp up from the Tier 2, some we’ve got very little from Tier 1. And as we will see in the next six to nine months, we will win a lot more in this type of large project. So that will pave the next two to three, three to even four years away.
Tore Svanberg: That’s exactly what I was asking. Just one last question, and I’ll ask a more simple question. When will you be in production with 48-volt?
Michael Hsing: It’s starting now.
Tore Svanberg: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you The next question comes from Alessandra Vecchi of William Blair. Your line is open.
Alessandra Vecchi: Hi everyone. Congratulations also on an amazing quarter in this environment. Just on the OpEx side, you guys have done a phenomenal job sort of holding that steady and managing it. How do we sort of think about balancing your operating expenses going forward with future revenue growth? And then additionally, sort of similar question on the gross margin front, as you guys similarly have done an outstanding job holding those steady. Where do we think – how do we think about the puts and takes of potential margin improvement next year or 2021?
Michael Hsing: I think as we stick to our models, which I wrestled with our large shareholders, I want to spend more money and they want to see the EPS growth as well. And – but here, we stick to our models, which is now, I think that this year, we’re slightly above, right?
Bernie Blegen: Yes, yes. It’s – again, Alex, it’s a fair question. We have a model which I believe our investors are familiar with where we want to be able to provide operating leverage along with revenue growth. However, in the current market conditions, what we’ve done is we tried to hold our gross margin steady while continuing to invest in certain of what we consider long-term strategic investments that will position MPS for the long term.
Alessandra Vecchi: Okay. That’s very helpful. And then similarly, I apologize if I didn’t hear it, but did you give any color on sort of what end markets you expect to be strongest or weakest within the Q4 guide?
Bernie Blegen: When you look at Q4, there’s actually a continuation of some of the positive trends that we saw in Q3 with respect to computing and storage and also with automotive. And as I said before, we think that some of industrial had to do with pull-ins. And I look at the 5G, just to echo Michael’s point there, is that this is a lumpy business. And while it had down Q3, we still believe that, that end market has a lot of traction.
Michael Hsing: So, the Q4 would be better. And consumer, like normal, would be slightly lower. And the other ones will keep a very similar level.
Alessandra Vecchi: Very similar, okay. That’s very helpful. That’s it from me.
Michael Hsing: Thank you.
Bernie Blegen: Thanks, Alex.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Williams of Loop Capital. Your line is open.
David Williams: Thank you. And let me echo the congratulations, guys. It’s an impressive quarter and guide, and happy to see that. But I was hoping you might be able to give maybe, a little more information on your 48-volt architecture, maybe, the benefits there and what that opportunity could be for you and maybe what traction that you’ve already begun to see there.
Michael Hsing: Okay. The 48-volt system, we started four, five years ago that we see the trend. And we – in the 48-volt system, there’s many components that we ship, and we started shipment about a year ago for some power components. And for the – for converting 48 volts to the GPU, those are the products we started to win.
David Williams: What do you think that total opportunity could be if we look a year or two out? What do you think the revenue potential is there?
Michael Hsing: We have actually – we don’t have any idea like what’s the IRR and what’s the artificial intelligence market, okay, and what’s the market size. And for us, it’s very big, and that will certainly move the MPS revenue needle. And we’ve done some efforts to find out how big it can be. Certainly, hundreds of million dollars. And in the data centers, the adoption rate in the 48-volt as the income piece, we don’t see many data centers going to 48 volts other than the one I can think of. They’re advocating 48 volts, but that’s still – their majority of servers still running at 12 volts.
Bernie Blegen: David, if I can add one more comment. I think that the 48-volt is the direction that nearly all data centers, whether it’s for supercomputing or for e-commerce or artificial intelligence, will be migrating to.
Michael Hsing: That’s what we believe. And we believe that those market segments, sooner or later, give us two or three years, they will merge to 48-volts.
David Williams: Okay, excellent. And then just lastly for me. Can you comment just maybe, on the data center inventory? It’s been obviously an issue. But what are you seeing now? And maybe, from your perspective, are you seeing inventory issues there? Or are you maybe, benefiting from just the design wins and company-specific drivers versus the macro?
Michael Hsing: Well, if you’re looking at it now, all the new product wins for us, including the – you just mentioned the 48-volt, these are new products. In the past, I’ve said again and again, all these new products, our customers take a risk on new products and we’re taking a risk. And we don’t want to have any problem in the – during the shipping to the supply market. We don’t have to have any interruption with the qualities or with all these annual issues. We want to build inventory. So, we have more material we can ship. Now, we are at the stage. We have to put a lot of effort to which – who do we ship, and we have to build more inventory.
Bernie Blegen: David, were you also talking about the data centers as far as whether that was penetration in new markets?
David Williams: Yes. I was just curious if there was still excess inventories within the data center that had caused some softness prior, if that had been mopped up yet.
Bernie Blegen: Oh, the data center. Okay.
Michael Hsing: I didn’t get that. Yes.
Bernie Blegen: So, I think that the way to characterize this is that – and what’s interesting is that the downturn that we experienced as a result of overcapacity in the data center was broad-based. And likewise, with just our one – Q3 experience, that also was an individual customer, individual geography. It was an example of very diversified growth, both in terms of our products as well as customers.
Michael Hsing: Great. Thanks so much. Appreciate it.
David Williams: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Quinn Bolton of Needham & Company. Your line is open.
Quinn Bolton: Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. I wanted to just start, and I know you probably haven’t had a lot of time to go through Texas Instruments’ results. But they had a pretty poor outlook, talked about, at the midpoint of their December guide, revenue being down 14%. And that’s, I think, the eighth quarter in a row, where their revenue has decelerated on a year-over-year basis. So, if I use Texas Instruments as a proxy for the analog market, it certainly looks like Texas Instruments might be looking to a mid-single-digit revenue decline in 2020. And so I guess can you talk about, if the analog market is down again next year, how comfortable are you with kind of The Street consensus for 18%, 19% growth? And to the extent you’re comfortable; can you give us some points, where you think you’re seeing growth or where you’re differentiated versus some of your broader analog peers? I know that’s a big, big question, but let’s start there.
Bernie Blegen: Sure. At this point, we’ve only had the opportunity to review the flash reports on TI. So, I am at a deficit to understand how much of the business was affected by downturn in analog versus other elements of their business. But certainly, the significance of the decrease that they projected, both from Q3 and Q4, along with the difference between them and consensus, I think they’re a market driver. We found in 2019 that we’re not – MPS is not immune to what the market movements are like. We continue to focus on the elements that are within our control, which is we introduce the new products. And as Michael said earlier on this call, we still continue to believe that we can outperform the market at 10 to 15 percentage points, but this market hasn’t found its equilibrium yet.
Michael Hsing: Yes. There is no comparison between MPS and TI, because they are so big. They are the markets. We are very small. We can’t – but we do have a lot of opportunities. And so there’s no comparison. But for us, our – we start building 5% to 10% of these market shares in the different segments. And – but at the same time, we’re also expanding our opportunities, so that growth for us in this market segment is enormous and we – in the – we should be much less affected by the macroeconomic conditions.
Quinn Bolton: Thanks, Bernie and Michael. The second question I had is, I think in the June quarter, you guys saw one customer that was over 10% of sales, and you thought that some of that activity was build ahead. You were able to provide and hit your guidance for Q3. You mentioned some additional build ahead activity in the industrial segment here in Q3 in power sources and surveillance equipment. Have you sort of factored that build ahead in Q3 into your fourth quarter guidance, meaning that if you did see some unexpected strength in build ahead demand in Q3 that you’ve sort of tempered those segments in Q4 and that’s still reflected in your 160 to 166 guidance?
Michael Hsing: Yes. Well obviously, we’re aiming for that in Q4. We don’t know, but we have to be in it already for Q4.
Bernie Blegen: Yes, he said it all.
Michael Hsing: Okay.
Quinn Bolton: Okay. So, the answer is yes?
Michael Hsing: Oh, yes, yes, absolutely. Otherwise, we will miss quarter by quarter.
Quinn Bolton: Got it. And then lastly, Michael, I just want to come back to 48-volt. You mentioned that you’ve been sampling product, I think, for about a year. I think in the third quarter, GPUs was one of the areas, where you saw strength. And I just wanted to clarify, was that strength in GPU more from your existing 12-volt design wins? Or have you seen – was that GPU strength in Q3 from 48-volt product?
Michael Hsing: No. It’s – GPU is a more traditional. It’s 12-volt. The 48-volt is not moving the needle yet, but we do see a healthy growth of a revenue stream coming.
Quinn Bolton: Got it. Thank you.
Michael Hsing: Yes.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Ramsay of Cowen. Your line is open.
Matt Ramsay: Thank you very much. Good morning over there, guys. Michael, one relationship that my team has been watching closely that MPS has continued to grow is the relationship with Microsoft across the business. Maybe, you could – to the extent that you can, could you give us a little bit of color as to the nature of that relationship strategically and how it might benefit the different segments of the business as you move forward?
Michael Hsing: Oh, sure. Yes. We don’t comment on customers. But with all our customers, I – in the past, I’ve said this, it doesn’t mean, I don’t like very cyclical business, which move our revenue up or down. And it’s not as smooth as we can manage it. In that regard, I made a statement that is not my favorite, for gaming. And we want to – for our shareholders, we want to build a model that’s very predictable and very predictable growth and – the top-line growth, margin growth. And so in that regard, in gaming, you have every year or every two years in that you have extra revenue, and then the next two or three quarters they start to get lower. So that is giving us difficulty. And then our customers said that this is not your favorite, and we are also listening. And in the following conference call, I clarified we love gaming, because that is still money for our shareholders, still value. And that’s all in models. But that’s all in business models. And as MPS grows, well, revenue grows in roughly over $600 million range. And we – in the last couple of years, we see that accelerating growth and that effect is much, much less. So, I love gaming. I love gaming.
Bernie Blegen: If I can add one additional comment. While we do not talk to individual customers, one thing that I believe separates MPS from our peers and competition is that we’re very responsive to our customers’ requirements. So, if they have an engineering challenge, well, often than not, they turn to us in order to find a solution. And as a result, all of our customers benefit from the innovation, and the level of technology that we’re bringing forward is differentiated.
Michael Hsing: By the way, what we said, this is not corporate BS, our customers are telling us we provide the best support, we provide the best service.
Matt Ramsay: Got it. No. I appreciate the sensitivity to the individual customer. As a follow-up question from my side, there’s obviously been – not on the 5G side, but in just general, data center spending over the last 12 to 15 months, there’s been some challenges. And it seems like the market now is anticipating a reacceleration in cloud spending in the server market. You guys have some great content with certain Intel-based servers, but my understanding is there’s some diversity of that customer base into other computing providers. Maybe, you could talk a little bit about the data center customer base overall and how you’re expecting that business to grow in the next few quarters.
Bernie Blegen: Sure. I think the strength of MPS is diversity. We have all kinds of different technologies that are suitable for different solutions. So, right now, we tend to think very much in terms of the e-commerce data center model. And while that model is very solid and is going to continue for several generations to come, we’re seeing, as Michael mentioned earlier, the initial growth through artificial intelligence. And it’s hard to really size what those market opportunities look like, but here again; we're positioned to take advantage of it. When we look at some of the applications, data center and support of 5G, we're also very well positioned and it's also very initial stage of growth. So I think that when you look at customer relationships we've developed and how adaptive our technology is for different power solutions, I think we're as well positioned as anybody to take advantage of the new developments of an evolving market.
Matt Ramsay: Thank you very much guys. All the best.
Michael Hsing: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Ross Seymore: Hi, guys. Thanks for the question or two. First on the 5G side, just want to understand a little bit better where you guys are playing there. Is the power management that you're doing largely for one form of processor versus another? Are you more FPGA related? ASIC related? ASSP related? Is there any kind of evolution of how you see that progress as people are a little bit worried that the FPGA side might come down and then other sorts of processors would backfill? And trying to figure out how, if that does occur, it would impact or benefit Monolithic?
Michael Hsing: The answer is all of the above. I don't want to be vague, but we try to figure out where our product goes. We – just as a reminder to everybody, our products are fundamental blocks. And that's the power supply blocks. All the eyes are on value making. They all need power and our customers typically design several size of these power blocks with our products. And so when each segment from transmitters to the processing – the data processing to the communication to the fiber line, the optical line, they all need to build the power. And we – they don't – within their company we've become a standard product, standard component that their design engineers design to be in the same systems. So we actually really don't know where our product ended up.
Bernie Blegen: I think you have two parts to your question here, Ross. The first is sort of we have an initial ramp and how defensible or predictable is that. And I think we've been very clear that we're in the early stages of 5G, and it's really hard to foresee how that's going to develop. But to Michael's point, as far as the long-term, when this ramp does occur, I think that we get to take advantage of all aspects of 5G and that's what we're looking forward to.
Ross Seymore: Got it. My next question is it wouldn't be an earnings call at Monolithic if I didn't ask about inventory, so congratulations on that one as well.
Michael Hsing: I've lost my focus in the February call after Ross. Okay, that's a fair question. Actually, we view it as a little too high still because we don't know what the market actually will do.
Ross Seymore: Well, if I'm going to give you grief when it goes up, I have to congratulate you when it comes down. But not to blow too much sunshine at you guys, when you talk about it needing to go back up, how do I – one, is that a dollars or a day's comment? And secondarily, how do I reconcile kind of controlling utilization and lowering utilization with inventory rising?
Bernie Blegen: Sure. So if you think about what you do to manage inventory levels and it starts with the wafer starts, so back in February, we really started to ratchet down the wafer starts. And we did that for an extended period of time [indiscernible] over the last six months. Well, those wafers are now coming into our balance sheet, we're receiving them and it's at a much lower level than we've historically seen [indiscernible]. And yes, we had at the same time, okay demand and there's a lot of good sell-through as well. So that means that our finished goods started to come back into aligning as well. So when we look at composition, we're a little bit light on the raw materials, work in process, and we're probably at about the right level of finished goods. When you look at the ramp that we expect for Q2 [Technical Difficulty]
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of Chris Caso of Raymond James. Your line is open.
Chris Caso: Yes, hello. Can you guys hear us now? Operator, we may have lost the management team.
Operator: I believe. Ladies and gentlemen, please stand by. Apologize. There may be a slight delay in today's conference. Please hold. The conference will resume shortly. Thank you for your patience. Speakers you may precede.
Unidentified Company Representative: Bernie and Michael will back online.
Operator: We'll go ahead and go to the next question. Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Ross Seymore: Hi guys, can you hear me?
Bernie Blegen: Yes, fine, thank you. Now it's perfect, yes.
Ross Seymore: Yes. So I guess you were halfway through, and you probably continued talking even though we couldn't hear you. The inventory side of things, Bernie, you were walking through the utilization and the whip versus the raw materials versus all of that. I think the punch-line to it was what you didn't say. Does that mean that dollars of inventory are going to start going back up, days of inventory, both? And any sort of target range that you expect to get to?
Bernie Blegen: Again, while we closed our range in days between 160 and 180, the fact is that we manage internally to dollars of inventory anticipating wafers starts about six months to eight months in advance of when the revenues are expected to ramp. So right now, we're starting to put wafer starts in support of business for Q2 and Q3 of 2020. And so in that regard, we expect to sort of see a replenishment on a dollar basis. And then obviously, as you look at the cyclicality of our revenues where normally Q1 is about two percentage points to four percentage points lower than Q4, that is a lower denominator, the days will also go up because of that. So my comment was really intended to talk in terms of dollars. And then I think that will have to reflect the impact on the days given our seasonality.
Ross Seymore: Got it. Two relatively quick ones I just wanted to understand. One, the litigation expense seems like it's guided to be about double of what it usually is. Is that something a court case coming due? Or is it something that is one-time in nature? Or is that a new base we should be looking at?
Bernie Blegen: Yes. We have...
Michael Hsing: Definitely not a long time.
Bernie Blegen: It's a worth one-time case, and we have a trial date coming up here in the next quarter or so.
Ross Seymore: Got you. And then the last quick one is IT security camera side of things. I just wanted to – I know you commented on that earlier. But when you said that its customers who were building inventory, is that something that was meant to be a retrospective comment for the first half of this year or second quarter, whatever have you? Or did you see that as an ongoing benefit to your revenues in the third quarter? And then if so, what is it – what do you believe that will do in the fourth quarter?
Bernie Blegen: Well, again, it just speaks to sort of the market uncertainty that we're all experiencing. And I think that if I look at the trend lines for industrial where we reported this revenue stream, it is then significantly higher than its normal run rate for us. And so I think you can infer that there were some pull-ins and that could have some impact on how this particular segment and market performs in the next quarter or two.
Michael Hsing: We heard different messages from our customers and from our end customers. And so the good news is that they have a few new large projects and are starting to ramp, and at the same time, we also heard they're pulling in because of the tariffs. And so again, we're building very basic building blocks and we're not Intel. So we're building them a building processor, and you can see how many servers or how many PCs they built. We can help our still very small cost of the entire build of materials.
Ross Seymore: Got it. All right, guys, that's it from me.
Michael Hsing: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Caso of Raymond James. Your line is open.
Chris Caso: Yes, thank you. Good evening and good morning for you guys. First question is with regard to the 10% plus customer that you had in the second quarter. It sounds like that customer wasn't a 10% customer in the third quarter. Could you give some color about what was going on there? And has the revenue level at that customer now normalized as you look forward into the Q4 guidance?
Bernie Blegen: Yes. I think that we don't talk about individual customers since they get reported in our 10-Q for the Q2. We'll say that we have a number of relationships beyond this particular customer that are very broad-based and where they can have multiple product ramps that are occurring at the same time and that's clearly what transpired here.
Michael Hsing: Yes. And we don't have consistent more than 10% customers. This quarter we don't have it, okay? And we don't have it. And in the past, I don't remember whether we reported it or not. There's one for a certain week and a certain period of time where they swapped all their simple things. But it can be different customers. And overall, we have a very long tail of a number of customers. That's due to our business. We build the building blocks and many customers, they can use that.
Chris Caso: Got it. Thank you. I guess the last question is with respect to your goal of growing 10% to 15% above the industry, it's sort of an abstract goal that – the way I'm thinking about it, and tell me if you agree, is that you need to generate somewhere between $75 million and $90 million of incremental revenue. Perhaps your run rate business grows at the market rate, and this would be on top of that. And I guess if that's the right framework to think about it, what gets you to that? What sort of things can you point to as you look into next year that drive that visibility for that level of design win as you look into next year?
Michael Hsing: Yes. It's a very simple business process and we have product line – we have sales – geographic sales group and we have a product line review there for projecting for the next couple of years and more in the longer term. And the sales is more immediate in the next few quarters. And we gather all these numbers, and the numbers, we're checking against the product line and also sales group. And also – and we see some wide swings in the last nine months due to the tariffs, due to what is modeled in the last year or so. And it's much more rougher than the previous two or three years. That's because due to the tariff, government policies and those, we cannot predict. We cannot predict. And now we're looking for next year why we can say we can do that. One is based on historical numbers and that we can always – we can do that. And what is that real theory behind it is this is more empirical than really a theory. And on the other hand, we're looking at all these sales numbers. These sales numbers are sometimes much bigger than we expected. And so we believe that, and we can grow a lot more than that. Even at the beginning of the year, in January, we forecast to grow more than 20%. But the reality is very different. So to our shareholders, we say that that's based on the historical numbers, we can grow this much.
Chris Caso: All right, thank you.
Michael Hsing: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Bernie Blegen for any closing remarks. Sir?
Bernie Blegen: Great. I'd like to thank you all for joining us in this conference call and look forward to talking to you again during our fourth quarter conference call, which will likely be in early February. Thank you, and have a great day. Thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-08-01 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the Monolithic Power Systems Inc. Q2, 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct the question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time [Operator Instructions]. Also as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to your host, Bernie Blegen, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.
Bernie Blegen: Thank you. Good afternoon. And welcome to the second quarter of 2019 Monolithic Power Systems conference call. Michael Hsing, Founder and CEO of MPS, is with me on today's call.In the course of today's conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risks and uncertainties, which could cause results to differ materially from management's current views and expectations. Please refer to the safe harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today.Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q2 earnings release, and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on March 1, 2019 and Form 10-Q filed on May 10, 2019, which are accessible through our Web site, www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today's call.We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, R&D and SG&A expense, operating income, interest and other income, net income and earnings, on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the Q2 2018, Q1 2019 and Q2 2019 releases, as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our Web site. I'd also like to remind you that today's conference call is being webcast live over the Internet, and will be available for replay on our website for one year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today.MPS achieved record second quarter revenue of $151 million, 6.8% higher than revenue in the first quarter of 2019 and 8% higher than the comparable quarter in 2018. Looking at our revenue by market. In our computing and storage market, second quarter revenue of $41.6 million increased $2.4 million or 6.1% from the first quarter of 2019. Computing and storage revenue represented 27.5% of MPS's second quarter 2019 revenue.Storage revenue was down from the first quarter of 2019 with computing revenue increasing. Nevertheless, the growth in computing was slower than what we'd planned for back in the second half of 2018. The slower than anticipated growth rate was primarily due to customers delaying product launches, or absorbing overcapacity. Having said that, our design activity in the first half of 2019 with top tier customers reached an all-time high end server, storage and AI applications, positioning MPS for long term success in these critical markets.In our consumer markets, revenue of $43.8 million increased 14.8% from the first quarter of 2019, and represented 29% of our second quarter 2019 revenue. The sequential quarterly revenue increase reflected improved sales of products for wearable applications and a seasonal increase in certain legacy consumer market. Second quarter 2019 industrial revenue of $22.4 million increased 5.2% from the first quarter of 2019 due primarily to increased revenue for smart meters and point of sales systems. Industrial represented 14.9% of our total second quarter 2019 revenue. Second quarter automotive revenue of $21.2 million grew 3.5% over the first quarter of 2019.Similar to computing revenue growth in automotive was lower than we have anticipated three quarters earlier due to a slowdown in the broader market. And like computing, our superior technology in design activities both in standard and custom products have been widely accepted by tier one customers. The range of applications MPS encompasses includes infotainment, smart lighting, ADAS and autonomous driving. Again, we believe MPS is well positioned to accelerate growth in automotive when the market returns. Automotive was 14.1% of MPS's total second quarter 2019 revenue.Second quarter 2019 communications revenue of $22million was essentially flat with the first quarter of 2019. Sales for our legacy router and wireless applications decreased sequentially, while sales -- while infrastructure sales, including 5G networks increased. As 5G spending ramps, MPS is well positioned to benefit as existing design wins move to revenue. Communication sales represented 14.5% of our total second quarter 2019 revenue.GAAP gross margin was 55.1%, 10 basis points lower than the first quarter of 2019 and 40 basis points lower than the second quarter of 2018. Our GAAP operating income was $20.1 million compared to $21.7 million reported in the first quarter of 2019, and $24.9 million reported in the second quarter of 2018.Non-GAAP gross margin for the second quarter of 2019 was 55.6%, matching the gross margin reported in the first quarter of 2019 but 40 basis points lower than the second quarter from a year ago. Our non-GAAP operating income was $43.7 million compared to $39.6 million reported in the prior quarter, and $41.4 million reported in the second quarter of 2018.Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $63.1 million in the second quarter of 2019 compared with $56.3 million in the first quarter of 2019, and $52.7 million in the second quarter of 2018. Our non-GAAP second quarter 2019 operating expenses were $40.3 million, up from the $39 million we spent in the first quarter of 2019 and up from the $36.9 million reported in the second quarter of 2018.The difference between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are stock compensation expense and income or loss on an unfunded deferred compensation plan. For the second quarter of 2019, stock compensation expense, including approximately $663,000 charge to costs of goods sold was $22.7 million compared with $16 million recorded in the first quarter of 2019.Switching to the bottom line. Second quarter 2019 GAAP net income was $20.7 million or $0.45 per fully diluted share compared with $26.2 million or $0.58 per share in the first quarter of 2019, and $24.2 million or $0.55 per share in the second quarter of 2018. Q2 non-GAAP net income was $41.9 million, or $0.92 per fully diluted share compared with $37.9 million or $0.84 per share in the first quarter of 2019, and $40 million or $0.90 per share in the second quarter of 2018. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q2 2019 were $45.5 million.Now, let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $369.7 million at the end of the second quarter of 2019 compared to $362.3 million at the end of the first quarter of 2019. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $44.1 million compared with Q1 2018 operating cash flow of $38.8 million.Second quarter 2019 capital spending totaled $19.3 million. Accounts receivable end of the second quarter of 2019 at $55.4 million, representing 33 days of sales outstanding, which was five days lower than the 38 days reported at the end of the first quarter of 2019 and two days lower than the 35 days at the second quarter of 2018.Our internal inventories at the end of the second quarter of 2019 were $143.6 million, up from the $142.5 million at the end of the first quarter of 2019. Days of inventory of 193 days at the end of the second quarter of 2019 were 12 days lower than at the end of the first quarter of 2019. As we've said in the past, we are comfortable carrying a higher than normal level of inventory during a downturn, given that most of our products are not customer or application specific and carry minimal obsolescence risks. Having said that, we do not expect meaningful reductions in the near term, and inventories are likely to remain elevated through the second half of 2019.I would now like to turn to our outlook for the third quarter of 2019. We are forecasting Q3 revenue in the range of $162 million $168 million. We also expect the following; GAAP gross margin in the range of 54.9% to 65.5%; non-GAAP gross margin in the range 65.3% to 55.9%; total stock-based compensation expense of $18.3 million to $20.3 million, including approximately $600,000 that would be charged to cost of goods sold; GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses between $57.1 million and $61.1 million; non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to be in the range of $39.4 million to $41.4 million.We are continuing to invest in our new 55-nanometer process technology on 12-inch wafers, and are selectively adding headcount despite slower revenue growth; litigation expense should range between $400,000 to $600,000; interest income is expected to range between $1.4 million to $1.6 million; fully diluted shares to be in the range of 45.3 million to 46.3 million shares. In conclusion, for the remainder of 2019, we remain cautious amidst the market uncertainty. I believe MPS is well positioned for long term growth.I will now open the phone lines for questions.
Operator: Thank you, sir. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Rick Schafer from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Rick Schafer: Congratulations guys on results. And I know it's not easy to it in this environment. So maybe my first question is if you could just give some more color, or maybe parse out the areas of relative strengths heading into 3Q, which segments, I mean just at a high level. Which segments you expect to grow and maybe which segments might be lagging a little bit?
Michael Hsing: They're kind of all lagging a little bit.
Bernie Blegen: Well, if you look at sequentially. Automotive is expected to probably contribute, both in terms of dollar and also percentage gain. Likewise, I'd say that industrial, which you know can be rather lumpy business, should show some improvement from Q2 to Q3. Again, when you look at the comparison against last year's Q3, to Michael's point exactly, consumer usually is the bellwether and in fact that has remained down from last year. And industrial would be flattish. But we do expect to see continued improvements in both automotive and communication year-over-year.
Rick Schafer: And maybe on that topic to, Michael or Bernie, maybe just a little color on what's happening with China auto. There's -- it doesn't sound like it. But if there -- I mean I guess you did mention auto is picking up a little. So is China specifically is -- are you seeing signs of pick up there? And maybe as part of your answer on auto, I'm curious just if you could talk about some of the design win momentum you guys have there with auto OEMs, tier ones. How the pipeline is stacking up through all this downturn? I assume there's still a fair amount of design activity going on?
Michael Hsing: Yes, our auto as that goes up slightly, I don't know this is from is it noise. It is from a noise or just on certain projects, we're still very small in the entire auto segment, our market share is very small. And in terms of engagements and the designing activities, and we actually surprised ourselves and again after we qualified from first tier suppliers and including OEMs, and the level of engagement and the level of meetings that they requested, and it cannot be better.
Bernie Blegen: And just as a finishing point there, I think that the results that we saw in the first half of the year were colored mostly by the soft demand, particularly in the China market. And then the uptick that we expect to see in the second half of the year is result of the new model years being rolled out, particularly in North America, Europe and Korea.
Rick Schafer: And then just as a quick housekeeping question, if I can, I'll sneak it on. Just on your Huawei exposure. I know it's small for you guys. I think you said low single digits. I mean, some companies have talked about being able to ship that there's not -- basically everything -- because they're not national security. Can you give some color on what you're able to shift to Huawei, how much of that low single digit exposure are you able to actually to ship out to them? Thanks.
Bernie Blegen: Sure. There's a couple of points there. I mean, obviously in the middle of May, that's when the Department of Commerce added Huawei to the entity list. And so like our peer companies, we did an evaluation of how the ban would affect us and how to implement it. And after we completed that review, we concluded that the MPS ICs are really now subject to the entity list prohibitions. We basically determined that certain components working in compliance within the sales band framework. And so we have resumed shipping.One thing to add is that, historically, Huawei has been a very small percentage of our business.And I'm not talking through them in total here, but I am saying that in China, in particular with level of uncertainty related to tariffs and trade that we did see a step up in volumes in Q2 as certain customer build inventories in advance of any further bans.
Michael Hsing: We are not depending on Huawei to grow.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from William Stein from SunTrust. Please go ahead.
William Stein: Great, thanks for taking my questions. Normally, downturns in my experience tend to trigger an increased pace of innovation. Customers sometimes look to use the weak demand environment to leapfrog competitors. And I'm wondering if you're seeing this trend now, and how it affects your view to your future revenue growth?
Bernie Blegen: Will, I think that is a very accurate observation. And particularly when we look at areas that really are exciting for our future. In particular within computing, we've talked about cloud-based server and AI, even storage, which has been down now for about three to four quarters. We're seeing a very high level of engagement. And the same can be held true for automotive, in particular.And a point that Michael made earlier that I do want to emphasize is that in the past, we've had to go out and really get them excited at MPS. And now that engagement is starting to occur where they're calling us and setting up meetings at the executive level. So we're not going to try and tell you the timing of when market is going to turn around. From a theme for this quarter, we really believe that we're well positioned to take advantage of it.
William Stein: Maybe one more if I can squeeze it in. The Q3 guide is remarkably in line with consensus. But I think, at least in my analysis, it looks slightly above typical seasonality. So still, not as robust year-over-year growth as we've come to expect from monolithic but looking like maybe we're passing through the bottom in terms of year-over-year growth. When we think about Q4, while you're not guiding it, I think normal seasonality is up mid to high singles. Any reason to think that would be better or worse than typical?
Michael Hsing: I think of Q4 usually is that we are slightly lower and not up to single digits. And in the last few years and last two or three years, the seasonality -- we don't know what's our seasonality is. When you grow 16%, 17%, 20% some percent, and so the seasonality is not very clear to us. But the Q4, I think is that we are either flat or slightly down, and I don't know what the -- I forgot the last year number, maybe slightly up almost. Last year it was down.
Bernie Blegen: Last year it was down, a year before we were actually up and that was after we've started to get traction in the server business. And we're actually continuing the theme. Well that in both Q1 and Q2, however, however you define our historic norms, we're underperforming in Q3 by about 2 to 3 percentage points. But I think that Michael's point is spot on that we've had a lot of volatility, particularly in the last two years as we've had the change in sales mix. So it's not as predictive as it once was. But I do feel good, to add to your point, that we basically stayed in a good position relative to expectations for the quarter.
Michael Hsing: Yes, one more thing. So I very much agree with you. This year it's -- we don't have a clear views in how the industrials growth. And only we can do is do our best effort to have a design win and to engage with our customer closely.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tore Svanberg from Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead.
Tore Svanberg: Yes, thank you. And congratulations on the results in this environment. First question, the consumer revenue, the year-over-year declines continued to improve. And as we look at through the September quarter, should we expect that trend to continue? So again, I'm not asking for that to be up. But I think it does seem like the year-over-year declines are certainly moderating in each quarter and year?
Bernie Blegen: Tore, thank you very much for your earlier compliment. Yes, the consumers are little bit hard to handicap. I think that you're aware that we parsed it into three general groups, high value, gaming and traditional or legacy. And historically, I think that legacy has had a certain seasonality, it was relatively predictable. But even that's gone out the window as we've seen a softening of demand more clearly in Asia, China, but not exclusively there.And actually the high value, which has a lot of exposure to home appliances, actually has rebounded nicely and is continuing strong. And I think you're also aware that as we start to go into the holiday season that gaming is going to pick up. So it's not clear that -- I would be cautious in using any term like bottomed out or that, it's more that we have a different -- slightly different mix within those three buckets.
Tore Svanberg: And as we start to look at your design activity, it sounds like you're getting a lot of traction with what we'd referred to as really high end processors and AI engines and server, maybe even in 5G equipment. Could you elaborate a little bit on that? And should we start to see some revenues already from those high end processors this year? Or is this more of a 2020 growth goal?
Bernie Blegen: I think those are, to the extent that they're commercially available, they're very early stage. And we don't have enough momentum to clearly identify a trend line, as we said that if we -- take 5G, for example. We're very well positioned with our technology on any number of different platforms with any number of different companies in any of the representative geographies. So we think that, again, the diversification, both in for the technology and what our point of entry is, gives us a lot of confidence that we'll do well. But again, it's going to take time for that market to develop. I think initially that and some of the other high end processing, which you can include AI in, are going to start out a little bit lumpy before a true ramp becomes apparent.
Tore Svanberg: Just one last question. You mentioned 55-nanometer on 12 inch. I assume you're not getting any benefit from that yet. They're probably more 2020. But would that be more of an enhancer to gross margin? Or will you use that process node to basically continue to accelerate the growth?
Michael Hsing: I don't know there's a 55 nanometer is the accurate enough, okay. Yes, we do use a 12 inch. And we starting to 12 inch wafers. And those are, as you said that these use -- we'll always use a trading edge of advanced equipment. And when we build -- these equipment available then we moved in. And those are with solid development always, not two or three years or two or three years later that will benefit our costs and also the features that we can offer to our customers.
Bernie Blegen: And I think an example of that is, if you look at how our fifth generation rolled out. We're now getting the benefits of that, even though that that has been in the market for about the last 3.5 to 4 years.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alessandra Vecchi from William Blair. Please go ahead.
Alessandra Vecchi: Hey, congratulations on the good quarter. Just a quick question on the gross margins, it's not a surprise that they've been trending flat over the last few quarters. So if we look out into next year, what do you need to see happen to resume that 20 basis points of sequential improvement? Is it really -- is it a mix situation, or is it predominantly an in-demand situation?
Bernie Blegen: The one we get to the other. We need to see an increased ramp in overall demand. That really if you look at each of the last four or five quarters, we've actually seen sequential decreases in the sales mix.
Michael Hsing: We've build our productions for much higher capacities, and now we see the growth slower. So that has partially also impacted in the gross margin.
Alessandra Vecchi: No, that makes perfect sense. And then just expand on Tore's comments or question with regards to some of the strong first half design wins ramping in the second half, or starting to go in, I should say. On the AI front, are you predominantly talking about the 48 volt product? Or how should we think about how you play in AI on the processor front?A - Michael HsingYes, we have a design wins, and we have a design win of -- 48 volts we believe is a inevitable solution as power goal keep going up. And so we started a few years ago we developed that kind of solutions. And it's kind of a widely accepted and we expect to have revenue to ramp now. But we don't know if the customers push out the projects but we're still expecting a ramp in the near future in the next couple of quarters.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Williams from Loop Capital. Please go ahead.
David Williams: First, I guess I wanted to see if you could talk maybe about your channel inventories, and how you're feeling about that. It sounds like maybe some of the appliance over inventory has been digested a bit. But throughout the other markets, how do you -- I guess, can you give a sense on how your inventory levels are there? And just how you expect those to trend over the next quarter or two?
Bernie Blegen: And again, I just want to clarify, you said channel inventories?
David Williams: Yes.
Bernie Blegen: Yes. So I think at the end of Q1, we acknowledge that we were above our normal range for channel inventory. Some of that had to do with a backend loading of the quarter where sales that we made in the last month of the quarter did not go out to the final end customer. In Q2, we had much more balanced sales on our side by month. And the channel responded and actually, particularly in China and Taiwan, we've seen a significant reduction. We're back down within our comfort zone with the channel inventories. It's a little bit hard to call out by necessarily end market application. It's easier we have greater visibility as it relates to geography.
David Williams: Great, thanks. And then Bernie you had noted prior that you thought that you could maintain kind of revenue growth that was 10% to 15% above what the industry was averaging. Do you still feel comfortable with that? And just kind of looking at where you are this year, do you think you can do better? Or how do you -- I guess is that still I guess stick to measure by?
Michael Hsing: As I said earlier, this is a kind of uncertain market now, and our customers will not give us a very clear feedback. So that's all -- these are out of our control and what we do the best is have a product designing. And one way or the other, they will turn into a revenue.
Bernie Blegen: And just to agree with Michael's point there is that it's just very difficult for us to project further than one quarter out. And there's sort of an interesting, we have the elements in the business that are within our control and then we have other elements that aren't necessarily directly within our control. And to the extent that we can continue to secure design wins and get the customer engagement, I think that we're doing a very good job both in execution within the quarter but also as far as securing our longer term future.
Michael Hsing: Yes. We're doing a good because we ignored all the macro -- total macroeconomy, and we do -- we can do the best when we can control it.
David Williams: Okay, great. And then one last one from me, if you don't mind. Just kind of look at the computing and storage. How are you seeing, I guess, the demand for the hyperscale data centers? And I guess if you're thinking about that segment, in particular, where do you think you see that the greatest degree of demand today and how do you think that plays out for the rest of the year?
Bernie Blegen: I think that I can acknowledge that somewhere about Q4 and certainly in Q1 and for a portion of Q2, that we saw a dip in demand by hyperscale. We believe based only on our experience, as it was broad-based, it was not just related to an individual company. However, if you look particularly at the long-term demand forecast for e-commerce, eventually, we believe that a lot of it has to do with just absorbing excess capacity or inventory that is built on their shelves, and that the demand for e-commerce based solutions is going to expand and will have to be renewed investment. I don't know exactly when that's going to start to pick up and it might be not even across the board. For example, we might see a little bit more on the server side before we see it in storage. But I think that some time in the next few quarters it will return to building momentum again.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Quinn Bolton from Needham. Please go ahead.
Michelle Waller: This is Michelle on for Quinn. Thanks for taking the question. So I guess the first one is, consensus estimates for 2020 as far as revenue growth, it looks like The Street has you at 19%. So given these macro uncertainties going on, just wondering if you could give us revenue growth drivers in 2020? What would be driving towards?
Bernie Blegen: So let me restate the question, if you don't mind. You had two there. The one is that currently The Street has us growing at just under 19% for 2020. And within that, what growth drivers we believe are significant in those assumptions. Is that correct?
Michelle Waller: Yes.
Michael Hsing: I don't know, it's up 19% now?
Bernie Blegen: Yes.
Michael Hsing: I think we’re kind of a committed we can grow better than the industry average by 10% to 15%. That's all we’re committing that. And even that -- I look at our history, that's what we have done in the past. And this year, I think is the same, this year it’s kind of not very certain. And we'll look back the same as like 2012 and 2008. And those are very uncertain years. And that's what we have -- what we achieved.
Bernie Blegen: And I think that as far as the growth drivers, and again, Michael is right, there’s too much uncertainty to sort of affirm or even not say that we can't live up to the expectations. But I think you're going to see continue increased demand for our products, particularly in computing, automotive. And we're also going to see the initial uptick in the communications markets.
Michelle Waller: And then one just on the project delays. I think you guys kind of touched on that. But I was just wondering, if there's an update as far as it's been -- if you've seen an increase in these delays or how the delays you saw since our first quarter call, have changed over the past quarter?
Michael Hsing: We don't -- it's difficult, some are big project delays and some small project advance. So the weight of each project, we don't have a very clear accounting -- method of accounting and the company is in a way migrated, we’ve become like a 3,000, 4,000 products. And we have again -- at any given time we have a few thousand projects going on. And so we don't know.
Michelle Waller: And just one clarification. For 3Q computing as far as did you say what was the trend that you set for that end market?
Michael Hsing: Yes. So overall, we see a delayed launch and delayed project and we see overall slowing down. And starting from earlier this year and even now the similar conditions.
Bernie Blegen: And one thing to add there is the second half of 2018, actually we did very well with computing and storage. So we're going into a situation where we see some signs of improving momentum. But we have more difficult comps in the second half of the year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Ramsay from Cowen. Please go ahead.
Josh Buchalter: Hey guys, this is Josh Buchalter on behalf of Matt. Let me echo my congrats on some solid results in a tough backdrop. I guess I wanted to circle back to industrial. It took a step down compared to last year but it's still growing solid double-digits in notably weak environment. I realized it's fragmented, but are there any verticals in particular that you'd like to call out that help insulating you here?
Bernie Blegen: Yes, I think that if you're looking at sort of sequential growth, I think we called out the fact that smart meters and point-of-sale systems picked up to a degree that, frankly, we hadn't fully anticipated. And when you look at the year-over-year comparisons, remember, our industrial tends to be a little more fragmented. We've got like four verticals that we depend on. And in fact, power sources and security in addition to smart meters seem to be continuing with good momentum right now.
Michael Hsing: I think that Bernie said is, our industrial market fragmented, our entire company is fragmented, and the beauty is, one segment slow down, other one will pick up. And so, nothing's more than a bigger percentage of total revenues. And when we look at it overall, MPS will grow this year. And will grow at the same pace as last year, we cannot say it.
Josh Buchalter: Understood and appreciate the color. And then as I follow up, I think it's been a couple quarters I was hoping maybe you can provide an update on e-commerce and e.Motion. If there’s anything to share there? Thank you.
Michael Hsing: Still very early, early stage. We try to figure out the why people don't -- or why people tell us have a good solution but nobody buys it, okay. And at least not selling like hotcakes. And we're still in the midst of figuring out why and how we can. But we’re committed. And as long as people say our customers this is a good solution and we'll keep figuring out. But overall revenues and also design -- customer request is -- I don't have a clear number but increases tremendously and we have difficulty to handle that. And that's a very good encouragement. And once we feel we have a handle on it we will give you a revenue commitment.
Bernie Blegen: And again, most of the comments is related to the e-commerce platforms actually in e.Motion we're seeing very good engagement this year with products that are beginning to ramp in revenue. And there’s a pretty broad and diverse number of end-state applications that we probably wouldn't have anticipated even as recent as two years ago. But I think that, that is holding up two expectations for the current year and also as we look ahead into the next year or two.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. I am showing no further questions in the queue at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Bernie Blegen, Chief Financial Officer for closing remarks.
Bernie Blegen: Great. I'd like to thank you all for joining us to this conference call and look forward to talking to you again during our third quarter conference call, which would likely be at the end of October. Thank you. And have a nice day.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for attending today's conference. This concludes the program. You may all disconnect. Good day.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-05-05 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Monolithic Power Systems First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions]As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Bernie Blegen, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.
Bernie Blegen: Thank you very much. Good afternoon and welcome to the first quarter of 2019 Monolithic Power Systems conference call. Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS, is with me on today's call. In the course of today's conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risks and uncertainties, which could cause results to differ materially from management's current views and expectations. Please refer to the safe harbor statement contained in earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the safe harbor statements contained in the Q1 earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on March 1, 2019, which is accessible through our website www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today's call. We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, R&D and SG&A expense, operating income, interest and other income, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the Q1 2018, Q4 2018 and Q1 2019 releases, as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our website. I'd also like to remind you that today's conference call is being webcast live over the Internet and will be available for replay on our website for one year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. MPS had another record first quarter with revenue of $141.4 million, 9.5% higher than the comparable quarter in 2018. MPS continues to benefit from our technology leadership and diversified multi-market strategy. Looking at our revenue by market, first quarter 2019 communications revenue of $22.2 million rose $6.4 million or 40.8% from the first quarter of 2018. Communications revenue represented 15.7% of MPS' first quarter 2019 revenue compared with 12.2% in the first quarter of 2018. The year-over-year increase primarily reflected an initial 5G networking sales, as well as higher sales in the residential gateway and router market. First quarter 2019 industrial revenue of $21.3 million increased 21.6% from the first quarter of 2018 and accounted for 15.1% of our total first quarter revenue, up from 13.6% in the first quarter of 2018. The increase over the first quarter of 2018 primarily reflected gains in power sources and security applications. First quarter 2019 automotive revenue of $20.5 million grew 15.7% over the same period of 2018 and represented 14.5% of MPS' first quarter 2019 revenue versus 13.7% in the same period of 2018. This growth primarily represented increased sales of infotainment, safety and connectivity application products. In our computing and storage market revenue $39.2 million, increased $8.2 million or 26.5% year-over-year. First quarter 2019 computing and storage revenue represented 27.7% of MPS' first quarter 2019 revenue compared with 24% in the first quarter of 2018. The year-over-year revenue increase primarily reflected the sales growth for notebooks and servers. Compared with the first quarter of 2018, revenue from consumer markets decreased $9 million or 19.1%. The year-over-year revenue decrease reflected across the board reductions in traditional consumer markets. Consumer revenue of $38.1 million represented 27% of our Q1 revenue compared with a 36.5% contribution in the first quarter of 2018. GAAP gross margin was 55.2%, 10 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2018 and 20 basis points lower than the first quarter of 2018. Our GAAP operating income was $21.7 million compared with $22.0 million reported in the first quarter of 2018. For the first quarter of 2019, non-GAAP gross margin was 55.6%, matching the fourth quarter of 2018, but 30 basis points lower than the first quarter of 2018. Our non-GAAP operating income was $39.6 million compared to $37.2 million reported in the first quarter of 2018. Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $56.3 million in the first quarter of 2019, compared to $49.5 million in the first quarter of 2018. Our non-GAAP first quarter 2019 operating expenses were $39.0 million, up from the $35.0 million reported in the first quarter of 2018. The differences between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are stock compensation expense and income or loss on unfunded deferred compensation plan. For the first quarter of 2019, total stock compensation expense including approximately $531,000 charged to cost of goods sold, was $16.0 million compared with $15.0 million reported in the first quarter of 2018. Switching to the bottom line, first quarter 2019 GAAP net income was $26.2 million or $0.58 per fully diluted share compared with $21.9 million or $0.49 per share in the first quarter of 2018. First quarter 2019, non-GAAP net income was $37.9 million or $0.84 per fully diluted share compared with $35.0 million or $0.79 per fully diluted share in the first quarter of 2018. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q1 2019 were 45.2 million. Now let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $362.3 million at the end of the first quarter of 2019 compared to $380.5 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2018. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $38.8 million compared with operating cash flow of $16.3 million in the first quarter of 2018. First quarter of 2019 capital spending totaled $59.4 million. Accounts receivable ended the first quarter of 2019 at $58.9 million or 38 days of sales outstanding, up five days from 33 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2018 and four days higher than the 34 days posted in the first quarter of 2018 reflecting the back-end weighting of shipments within Q1 2019. Our internal inventories at the end of the first quarter of 2019 were $142.5 million, up from the $136.4 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2018. Days of inventory increased to 205 days at the end of Q1 2019, compared with 180 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2018 and 177 days at the end of the first quarter of 2018. The 25 days sequential increase is primarily due to an unexpected delay in customers' new product ramps and legacy business push outs. As we've said in the past, we're comfortable carrying a higher than normal level of inventory during the downturn given that most of our products are not customer or application specific and carry minimal obsolescence risk. Having said that, while inventories are likely to remain elevated through the second quarter we do not expect meaningful reductions until early 2020. I would like now to turn to our outlook for the second quarter of 2019. We are forecasting Q2 revenue in the range of $147.5 million to $153.5 million. We also expect the following, GAAP gross margin in the range of 54.9% to 55.5%, non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.3% to 55.9%, GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses between $55.5 million and $59.5 million, non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to be in the range of $38.5 million to $40.5 million. This estimate excludes stock compensation and litigation expenses. Total stock compensation expense is $17.6 million to $19.6 million including $550,000 that will be charged to cost of goods sold, litigation expenses ranging between $300,000 to $500,000. Interest and other income is expected to range from $1.4 million to $1.6 million before foreign exchange gains or losses, fully diluted share to be in the range of 45.1 million to 46.1 million shares. For the second half of the year, we still see some uncertainty in our end markets and remain cautious. We will continue to adapt to the changing market conditions and execute as planned. I will now open the phone lines for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with Cowen. Your line is now open.
Josh Buchalter: Hey. This is Josh Buchalter on behalf of Matt. I was hoping to dig a bit into the computing and storage portion of the business. The year-over-year growth is still solid, but it is below your expectations heading into the quarter. Given the overall weakness we've seen across the board in datacenter, storage and PCs, I was wondering if you could provide a little more granularity there and how that dynamic between weak units in your content increases and new platforms plays out. Thank you.
Bernie Blegen: Sure, Josh, and good to hear from you. I think what we're seeing is in Q3 of 2018, there was a step down in SSD revenue, and that's essentially stayed at that lower plateau in each of the two following quarters. And then in Q4 of last year, we also saw a decrease in server content. And the belief is that certain of the hyper scales have over build the data centers and are taking a pause as they justify the next round in investment.
Michael Hsing: I think as an overall all the design win activities to the same and we compare the last couple of quarters on the server side we still gained shares and I think the revenues also increased. The momentum is the same.
Josh Buchalter: Got it, thank you and then more broadly, given the soft start to the year. I was hoping to hear some thoughts on your seasonality into the second half. And sort of how you're multiple content verticals are paying off on this soft macro that we've seen throughout the entire industry. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the solid results.
Michael Hsing: Yeah, okay. Well second half, that I recon [ph], we don't have a - last year we prepared all inventories and we expect to have a huge win 2019 and up till now still not very certain, and our customers give us a different signals and that came in. So we just are waiting to see.
Bernie Blegen: Yeah, I think that you're aware of that MPS didn't specifically guide beyond the current quarter. But certainly, these are unusual market conditions. If you look at our seasonality going from Q1 to Q2, over the last five years, you'd probably see a trend that we've increased it between 10% and 12% sequentially. Currently, we are forecasting revenues grow at a slower 7% rate, which I believe is probably indicative of a more gradual broad based recovery in the macro environment. So I don't see any one catalyzing event that will necessarily turn the tide for us, as we said, MPS expects to see a more gradual improvement in demand through the remainder of 2019.
Michael Hsing: And overall, we still expect to grow and just because the market share gain. And, but how much growth came in is very difficult to tell now.
Josh Buchalter: Got it, thank you, guys, and congrats again.
Michael Hsing: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Your line is now open.
Tore Svanberg: Yes. Thank you. Couple of questions, maybe we can start off with some of the end markets for Q2 specifically. So, yes, Bernie you mentioned the growth is sub-seasonal, but it's still growth. So, are you seeing all segments recovering or are some still a bit slower than others?
Bernie Blegen: Well, I think that we are actually very well positioned across the board and I think that speaks well on our diversification. If I had to pick out a high runner, as we look at going into - for Q2, I think communications which took a big step-up as a result of initial 5G investments will continue at a little bit elevated level over what we saw in Q1. And certainly that represents a significant improvement over the prior year. I think that computing, you're going to see that also is expected to take a step-up. But recognizing that it's been at a fairly, I don't want to say depressed, but lower level as the data centers have sort of hit the pause button. I think also that automotive, I don't see an immediate turnaround there, but I do see an uptick as we go from Q1 to Q2. And then, industrial, which has really been in a very elevated level for a number of quarters, would probably return to its normal cadence. And consumer again is still being impacted by soft demand.
Michael Hsing: I think the worst one is as Bernie, even said, the last one is the consumer. And all the other one is we gain market shares and actually in Q2 we see better than Q1.
Tore Svanberg: Very good and Bernie, I don't - did I catch - did you say CapEx was $59.4 million in the quarter?
Bernie Blegen: I'm sorry, CapEx?
Tore Svanberg: Yeah.
Bernie Blegen: Yes.
Tore Svanberg: Yes. Can you maybe elaborate a little bit on what that money was spent on because that's a little bit higher than usual?
Bernie Blegen: Sure. We purchased a building in Kirkland, Washington, which we will be using as both our regional executive offices, as well as this is going to be our center for e-commerce, which will give us the opportunity to recruit software engineers with this experience in their background. And if you take sort of a larger view because if you look back, we have been purchasing office space over the course of the last two years and this is part of our geographic diversification program, which allows us to draw talent worldwide for specific end market applications. So as we look forward, we also completed the purchase here a couple weeks ago of a building in Detroit, which will allow us to create a Center of Excellence servicing automotive. And we're in the process of buying office space in Barcelona, where we have a design center. And then also, we are going to be building another location, a couple hours out of Stuttgart, Germany, in the Rhine Valley. So not only do these moves aid our future growth, but we believe that owning the buildings is accretive to the P&L versus the alternatives of renting the facilities.
Michael Hsing: And those money - and we got a better return than we are putting in the bank. But it really help the - it's all EPS plus and particularly in Washington we need more space and so we can acquire building as the EPS plus actually.
Tore Svanberg: Very good, just one last one for you, Michael, the e-commerce business, I always look for updates there. Could you maybe give us the latest and greatest there please?
Michael Hsing: We're still learning. I think it's - overall, we launched websites and that came in - we launched the website frankly and the activities is not as high as we think, but on our distributed website our product sell well. And so obviously, we're still in the learning stage and also all the programmable parts, all the modules, if we give them a floppy disk they can download them and that is doing really well and we have to somehow had it linked to our e-commerce. Again, how do we provide a better usage for our website and how they solve their current problem of using those programmable parts? And we're still learning, but the product itself is not selling through e-commerce, and we're doing really well. It's a better than any - we really expected it. And some glitch on the websites, because there maybe or the way we told is too confusing. We may know to how to use it, auto program the parts. And every other week we are upgrading our website. But the concepts from feedback from our customers, these are revolution parts - these are revolution way of designing power supplied and that they are like that and obviously this still have some missing link.
Tore Svanberg: Very helpful. Thank you.
Michael Hsing: Okay.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rick Schafer with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.
Rick Schafer: Thanks and I'll offer my congrats on a solid quarter in a tough environment, maybe my first question on server. I know your Whitley [ph] - we've talked about anyway your Whitley content going from, I think, something like $50 probably to $70 or something all in. I think most of that increase is QSMod, I believe. Is there any sense or can you give us any sense of how much incremental server contents you'll see as AI accelerator attach rates grow and we migrate to 48-volt? I mean I would assume that those two things would be incremental for you guys to that move to $70 a content, but I'm just curious what that looks like to you guys.
Michael Hsing: Yes. We have all the design wins, and that came in, 48-volts. We now started selling - many customers, we started selling, designing the modules. And we expect the Q2 have some kind of a ramp, and it didn't happen. But we'll still hold the second half. And some projects, we understand it has engineering delay. Other ones, we're not very sure. But what we're for sure is we're winning all these projects.
Rick Schafer: And Michael, to be clear, it is - you're not including 48-volt or GPU accelerator or FPGA accelerators in that move from $50 to $70?
Michael Hsing: No, no, those are separate. Those GPUs and also the AR, these are the content that are much higher - much, much higher. And it's the same kind of thing for ADAS, Jim [ph] four or five. And these are essentially - is the same product, and we are on winning many of these sockets now.
Rick Schafer: Okay. Okay. And then my follow-up question, and this is - I haven't asked in a while, on gross margin. As you guys ramp 55-nanometer, and I know this is a multiyear progression or transition, but as you ramp 55-nanometer on 12-inch wafers and you mix favors, increasingly favors server, auto, industrial and eventually SMB or e-commerce, can we see it kind of a similar scenario that we saw in your top line over the last couple of years where you saw the revenue top line actually accelerate? Could we see an acceleration in your gross margin expansion or just give us maybe some color there on what those puts and takes are as you see them?
Michael Hsing: Yes. I think I mentioned it before. We are not going to - the current margin is not - it's not - we don't plan to use - we don't use this as our long-term model, okay. Our long-term model, the margin will go up. And because we're going after all these high-value products, these are with the higher margin associated with it. And in the next couple of years, these products - obviously, as Bernie mentioned in the - especially in the industrial/automotive and part of the servers and even high-value consumer, the consumer product line, the margin steadily move up and they move kind of slower. But all the other ones, the industrial, automotive and, in particularly, e-commerce, when those things taking off, I think our margin will, in a few years later, you'll see a dramatic improvement.
Rick Schafer: Okay, thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of William Stein with SunTrust. Your line is now open.
William Stein: Hey, thanks for taking my questions. I want to offer congratulations in weathering a tough demand environment very well. I'd like to first ask, as it relates to the cycle, though, Monolithic was a little bit later to see the downturn. I think your company was still presenting this 20% through the cycle as also sort of the current environment situation a little bit longer or you saw the downturn a little bit later. Should we likewise see the recovery a little bit later for Monolithic as well? Is that a reasonable assumption?
Michael Hsing: I think - because you said - as you said, it is a delay, but I don't see a delay, because all these activities, these are green fields. We didn't have it in the four, five years ago. And that design cycle takes two or three years. And all we see is either entered a new product market segments or share gain. And when it recovers - when the market recovers, I think it will accelerate the growth. It will grow faster, much faster than everybody else. And as I said, okay, we will beat the market by 15% at least.
Bernie Blegen: Yeah. I think that's a key ingredient there, Will, is that part and parcel to our belief that we can model annual revenue growth at 20% is that we will outperform the market by 10 to 15 percentage points. So when you look at full year 2018, the market grew at about 11% and we grew at about a little over 24%. So that metric works out. When I look at the guidance for some of our largest peer companies and you aggregate it, there's sort of an acknowledgment, really, in just the last quarter that full year 2019 probably is going to shrink by about 4% to 5%. So if you look at us as being able to perform a 10 to 15 percentage points better, that gets you into the middle single digits, which is not our historic growth. But again, that margin of how we can outperform the market remains intact.
Michael Hsing: So to your questions, I don't see how and why we can delay the recovery. So that's my take.
William Stein: Okay. I appreciate that answer, maybe two other real quick ones. First, I think last quarter, inventory at distribution increased a little bit at the end of the quarter. I'd love an update on that. And also on E Motion please. Thanks.
Bernie Blegen: Yeah, okay. I'll take the first question, and Michael will take the second. So on the channel inventory, and you have to kind of look at the cadence of how this quarter played out. In January, we actually had a very good month, both as far as new business that we booked, the business that sold as well as sell-through by the distributors. I think a lot of that was in advance of an earlier-than-normal Chinese New Year. February was a little lackluster, and what that ended up doing is making - the quarter was really backended loaded, which did not allow the channel time to sell that inventory through. So again, we went up a couple of days, partly because of the order - or the shipping pattern and ordering pattern as well as you have a lower denominator for the quarter. And a lot of that increase did occur in China.
Michael Hsing: Okay. The E Motion - and actually, that product is doing great. And if you notice it, we have online MPS, we're selling small models, including the model now. So like these are meant to be for a demonstration purpose. Actually, we sell quite a bit models now. And overall, it's still too soon to break out the product line, and it's a meaningful to move the needle now and move the overall revenue needle.
William Stein: Great, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Ross Seymore: Hi, guys. I want to ask a couple of questions. The first one is on the inventory side of the equation. You mentioned that there were some push outs and obviously the end demand is weak as well. But when you talked, Bernie, about you didn't expect it to come down until early 2020, is that mainly on a days basis? Or are you talking in dollars basis? And is there some level at which the dollars become worrisome to you? And any sort of obsolescence, risk or anything like that, that we should be concerned about.
Bernie Blegen: So when you look at the increase that we had in Q1 inventory, again, a lot of it reflected wafer starts that began in earlier periods and were now going through WIP and finished goods. And so that, in conjunction with the fact that we did have delays in some of our customers' new programs. And there were some legacy business push outs, particularly in consumer, accounted for much of the increase. We are taking steps as far as lowering wafer starts, and the impact of that should be visible here in Q2 in terms of dollars. But again, the reason we're not expecting the days in the inventory necessarily to come down rapidly is again partly a reflection of the continued weakness or the slower uptick in a recovery here. So I don't think that there is a dollar or a days' quotient that would really get me concerned. But I would like to believe that we're at a level that we're plateauing and then with the opportunity as the recovery gains steam to come down. And as I said in my prepared comments, that's more likely to be in the next year.
Michael Hsing: Under this current market conditions, let's say, the business is same as the second half of the year, we don't plan to write off a bigger chunk of the inventories because these products are all good. We made those products - made a way - created this inventory for - prepare for a big ramp. And it may still happen for Q3. If you look at the inventory, 200 days, okay, 200 days is based on - was it the Q1's number, the Q2's number?
Bernie Blegen: Q1.
Michael Hsing: Yes, Q1 then. And if you're looking at a ramp to somewhere 170 million, 180 million, that's nothing and so we still don't know whether they're going to recover or not. We need this inventory. But this inventory, under an uncertain environment, it is too high to make it.
Bernie Blegen: Yes.
Ross Seymore: Got it and I guess on the comms side of things, great growth year-over-year. You mentioned, in the past, there was some of the gateway in the router side, and then you also mentioned the 5G side of things. Can you remind us on two aspects with the 5G side of things roughly what size is that as a percentage of either the segment or total revenues and then the content that you have in 5G, if you could just remind us of how to think about that.
Michael Hsing: I think the increase are both similar dollar amount. And 5G, Ross, if you remember, a few quarters ago or a year ago or so, our communication was to go sidelines - or go sideways. And I mentioned that in the comms, we have some killer products come out in the comms. And also, we're waiting for new product cycles. And this product hit the market and now move the revenue needles now. In the gateway, it's very price competitive. And under the current situation, we want the revenues, and we just grab those market shares.
Bernie Blegen: Yes. I think this is actually a terrific story. Michael, didn't necessarily take full credit because we have remained very committed to the comms market. But what Michael had just said is we never had a killer application to go after it. And I think that that's the reason that for years this segment has underperformed, really going sideways between $15 million and $16 million per quarter. But now - so we basically missed out on a lot of the 4G wave. But we've recognized the significance of this market, and we developed new products that are exceeding our customers' expectations and their requirements. And I believe that we're very well positioned in a time when the 5G infrastructure investments are about to explode. So as Michael said that we're about 50-50 as far as the mix between the lower-margin gateway and the infrastructure networking. But I think that that's going to tip very much in favor of the higher-margin networking and infrastructure as this rolls out over the next two years.
Ross Seymore: Got it, then one last one for me, given the current market environment, you talked about what the implications were for inventory and revenue, et cetera. How do you guys think about the implications on your OpEx growth related to the aftermarket?
Michael Hsing: I think that we're very selective about hiring. Our hiring plan we changed. They were much reduced. And that's our biggest expense. So we - but we're hiring still and only hire for the best talent. And overall for the company growth, we freeze.
Bernie Blegen: Yeah. And I think just to add to that real quickly is that we also are continuing our investment with the 12-inch and 55-nanometer, which will continue through this year because we believe that's a strategic goal that we want to have in position by 2020.
Michael Hsing: Yeah, okay.
Ross Seymore: Got it. Thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Quinn Bolton with Needham. Your line is now open.
Quinn Bolton: Hi, guys. Wanted to first follow up on some comments you made last quarter about the new product slips given the slower environment. I think you had mentioned a number of areas: China new model automotives, smart meters in China and then it sounded like a few things in the data center GPU server segment. Can you give us some sense when you think those programs may now start to ship?
Michael Hsing: It's smaller amount. We expected more, but there's not as much. And order - however, all the activities, and especially these are first-tier customers, and we engaged a lot more than before. And we're engaging with - even at the executive levels. And before, like a couple of years ago, nobody knows who is MPS. Okay. And now all these activities went up a lot in the infrastructures as well as the server market segments.
Bernie Blegen: And I'd just like to emphasize something is that if you look at automotive where the growth rate is definitely taking a haircut as a result of slowdown particularly in China, but also it's been - actually, geographically, almost every region was down this quarter. But I really don't want to - I want to avoid putting too much stock on a single quarter-on-quarter deviation and really focus, as Michael did, on sort of the macro view that in these areas where we have invested and we have new greenfield opportunities, we're still having a very high level of customer engagement. We're still achieving at the same pace our design win activity. And there have been delays in some of our customers going into markets, but we're not losing any competitive position out of it. And particularly, in the areas that we've said are going to be growth areas, for example, ADAS and lighting and infotainment and automotive, those are on track. Obviously, you saw the initial results in the comms market with the 5G. So I think that the basic cadence of the business remains very strong. And it's just a matter of - and I think we're going to be very well positioned when the market returns to a more normal level.
Quinn Bolton: Understood, a second question, if the market is down 4% to 5% this year, and you can grow 10 to 15 points faster, it seems like that should get you somewhere between 5% to 10% year-on-year growth, which, if I'm doing my numbers right, kind of puts you around where the Street consensus is looking for 2019. But I guess, Street consensus probably had you growing at your normal rate of seasonality in the third quarter. And that's I think typically your biggest quarter-on-quarter increase. And then the Street is actually up a little bit in December, which is an atypical pattern. You mentioned in the prepared comments that you still see - you saw limited visibility. The industry is still sort of not yet fully recovered. So I guess I'm trying to get a sense, do you think then expectation for normal seasonality in Q3 makes sense? Or would you say that may be aggressive where you stand today?
Bernie Blegen: Yeah. Again, if you use Q2 as an example, even Q1 as an example, our normal seasonality for Q1 would be down sequentially by four percentage points. So we came down at about 7.9% or 8%. So there is a four percentage point delta from our normal sequential movement. And then if you look at what we've guided here, again if you look back the last four or five years, the growth between Q1 to Q2 would have us going up somewhere in the neighborhood of 10% to 12% - 11% just call it. And we've guided revenue to grow at a slower 7% rate. And again, I referenced that as being a more gradual, broad-based recovery in the macro environment. So I probably suggest that the sequential growth rates for the second half of the year are probably - are likely to also be about four percentage points below their seasonal norms.
Michael Hsing: All this, Quinn, are still unknown. And some of our products, some of the applications and market segments, we see pull in. And other ones push out. So as Bernie said in the script is it's uncertain. And so in terms of what's the numbers, okay, why don't you make a number lower, and let us beat it.
Quinn Bolton: Understood and then last question for me. In the first half of the year, it looks like your benefiting, from a revenue perspective, from this residential gateway business. It is a lower-margin business for you. Can you give us any thoughts how long do you see residential gateways continuing at sort of an elevated level, which was maybe part of the reason why margins are lower than where they were second half of last year or third quarter of last year?
Michael Hsing: Yeah. Okay. These are - okay, I want revenues now. I want revenues. And in this kind of things, a half a year ago, we're a little bit aggressive on it, and that's reflecting now. Okay. And we also try it to consumers, but it didn't have any effect. Okay and so we didn't increase - we're still losing - we still have a - this quarter, we have it significantly lower than last year, right? And - but it's not because of if we lower the price, okay, we can't - could not get more market share. And so we made a decision to stay as is. Okay. At least, we don't lose our bigger, major sockets in the consumer side. Come back to the comms, to the router business, we're still aggressive. And this period - and it still makes very good money but the margin is lowered. As we gradually - everything else recovers, speed ups or the new product in a ramp-up. And we can go less aggressive on that.
Bernie Blegen: Yeah. And I think specific to the residential gateway, you'll remember that products stepped up in sales beginning in Q3 of '18. And if we hold with our forecast, we'll pretty much fulfill that opportunity by the end of Q2. So I think that there is an opportunity within communications to see a step up in the more favorable product mix. But again, Michael has said it three times, all there is - right now, there remains uncertainty. And so it's really hard to say how our margins are going to improve in the near term. I think when we look longer term, certainly there will be an accelerated impact on our margins. But timing that right now again is uncertain as timing the return to normal for revenue.
Michael Hsing: Yeah. Actually, there's other reason why we do this, okay? We want to ensure our supply have a continued - have a continuity. And so we actually are doing a part of it for our wafer fab and we ensure they are constantly loading.
Quinn Bolton: Got it. Thank you.
Michael Hsing: Okay.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Bernie Blegen for any closing remarks.
Bernie Blegen: Great, I'd like to thank you all for joining us for this conference call. I look forward to talking to you again during our second quarter conference call, which would likely be at the end of July. Thank you, and have a nice day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-02-13 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Monolithic Power Systems Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator instructions] Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I'd now like to introduce your host for today's conference Mr. Bernie Blegen, Chief Financial Officer. Sir, please go ahead.
Bernie Blegen: Good afternoon and welcome to the fourth quarter 2018 Monolithic Power Systems' conference call. In the course of today's conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty which could cause results to differ materially from management's current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q4 earnings release and in our SEC filings including our Form 10-K filed on March 1, 2018, and Form 10-Q filed on November 2, 2018, both of which are accessible through our website, www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today's call. We'll be discussing gross margin, operating expense, R&D and SG&A expense, operating income, interest and other income, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and on a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the Q4 2017, Q3 2018 and Q4 2018 earnings releases, as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our website. I'd also like to remind you that today's conference call is being webcast live over the Internet and will be available for replay on our website for one year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. I'd like to begin today's comments with the two highlights of what was a very successful year for MPS. For the full year 2018, MPS achieved record revenue of $582.4 million, 23.7% higher than revenue from 2017. So $111 million increase in year-over-year revenue was the largest annual gain in the company's history. The 23.7% annual increase was the highest growth rate for MPS since the company redirected its focus in 2010 to the industrial, cloud computing, automotive and high-end consumer markets. Although we cannot escape the current macro-economic conditions, we see momentum in these segments continuing strong for the next several years. This was the sixth consecutive year of double-digit growth. 2018 was a significant year for MPS. On the technology front we widened our lead with BCD 5 solidly in volume production and with the development of BCD 6, a 55 nanometer process designed on a 12 inch wafer. Both of these advancements will significantly increase our product functionality, improve energy efficiency, reduce our solution size, ease our customers adoption efforts and keep our product cost competitive. In addition, we were increasing production capacity both in 12 inch and 8 inch wafer in anticipation of future revenue growth. On the customer front, MPS penetrated a number of new Tier 1 companies in the automotive and cloud server markets, generating initial and meaningful revenue. More importantly, we are co-developing next generation products with a number of these Tier 1 companies that will revolutionalize their industries. We expect these partnerships to drive substantial technological advancements and represent an important source of MPS's future revenue growth. A few examples include, developing specific leading edge system solutions, using QSMod technologies for GPU based artificial intelligence and machine learning applications, using MPS's 48 volt QSMod Technology for both cloud based and automotive applications, working with automotive companies to develop specific solutions for smart driving systems and unique lighting applications with a 2020 target for market introduction. Developing in mechanical relay replacement servicing the IoT and automotive markets, using MPS's high current high density process technology for improve reliability in a compact form. And we completed the integration of high current programmable power modules for communications application such as 5G networks. The target market applications for these modules are base stations and switchers, which require compact and reliable solutions. In addition to these exciting core development projects, 2018 was important as we launched our e-commerce website allowing engineers to design their own customized solutions from their desktop. This catalog of programmable solutions will greatly enhance our customer's time to market, lower their total cost of ownership and optimize the efficiency of their designs. Now let's look at our full year 2018 revenue by market segment compared with 2017. Computing and storage up 57.9%, automotive up 48.6%, industrial up 40.7% and communications revenue up 11.8%, consumer revenue was down 3.0%. Full year computing and storage revenue grew $58.3 million to $159.1 million in 2018. This increased primarily reflected strong sales growth for cloud computing, SSD storage, high-end notebooks and initial GPU power management sales. Computing and storage revenue represented 27.3% of MPS's total revenue in 2018, compared with 21.4% in 2017. Automotive revenue grew $26.2 million to $80.1 million in 2018. This growth primarily represented increased sales of infotainment, safety and connectivity application products. Automotive represented 13.8% of MPS's full year 2018 revenue compared with 11.4% in 2017. Industrial revenue grew $25.6 million to $88.5 million in 2018. This growth reflected sales for applications in power sources, security and industrial meters. Industrial revenue represented 15.2% of MPS's full year 2018 revenue compared with 13.4% in 2017. Communications revenue grew $7.0 million to $70.6 million. This improvement was primarily due to higher sales of our legacy home router and wireless gateway products. More importantly, though, we see initial ramping in the 5G market segment. Communications revenue represented 12.1% of our 2018 revenue compared with 13.5% in 2017. Switching to Q4, while we started to see the impact of macroeconomic headwinds in Q4, MPS still had a record fourth quarter with revenue of $153.5 million, 4.0% lower than revenue generated in the third quarter of 2018 that's 18.6% higher than the comparable quarter of 2017. By market segment revenue for industrial grew 66.6% over the same period of 2017. Computing and storage grew 63.2% and automotive grew 40.2%. Communications revenue - communications grew 27.1%, due primarily to increase revenue from MPS's legacy home router and wireless gateway products. Fourth quarter revenue for consumer fell 25.9% from the prior year. MPS experienced continued weakness in high volume consumer related businesses, with especially the soft demand in the Greater China region. In the fourth quarter, MPS continue to see strong design win momentum. However, many customers concerned about the economic outlook and trade policies delayed their production ramps for new products in automotive, computing and industrial which resulted in a less desirable sales product mix. As a result, fourth quarter 2018 non-GAAP gross margin was 55.6% 50 basis points lower than the third quarter of 2018 and 10 basis points lower than the fourth quarter of 2017. Our non-GAAP operating income was $46.6 million compared to $49.2 million reported in the prior quarter and $38.2 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2017. Fourth quarter 2018 GAAP gross margin was 55.1%, 50 basis points lower than the third quarter of 2018, but 10 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2017. Our GAAP operating income was $33.1 million compared to $33.5 million reported in the third quarter of 2018 and $25.1 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2017. Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $51.5 million in the fourth quarter compared with $55.5 million in the third quarter of 2018 and $46.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Our non-GAAP fourth quarter 2018 operating expenses were $38.7 million, down from the $40.5 million we spent in the third quarter of 2018 and up from the $33.9 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2017. On both the GAAP and a non-GAAP basis, fourth quarter litigation expenses were $409,000 compared with $343,000 expense in Q3 2018 and a $340,000 expense in Q4 2017. The difference between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed are stock compensation expense and income or loss from an unfunded deferred compensation plan. Total stock compensation expense including $504,000 charged to cost of goods sold for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $14.8 million compared with $14.8 million recorded in the third quarter of 2018. Switching to the bottom line, fourth quarter 2018 GAAP net income was $27.6 million or $0.61 per fully diluted share compared with $0.71 per share in the third quarter of 2018 and $0.27 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017. Q4 non-GAAP net income was $44.6 million or $0.99 per fully diluted share compared with $1.06 per share in the third quarter of 2018 and $0.82 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q4 2018 were $45.1 million. Now let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $380.5 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to $353.1 million at the end of the third quarter of 2018. For the quarter MPS generated operating cash flow of about $47.6 million compared with Q3 2018 operating cash flow of $52.2 million. Fourth quarter 2018 capital spending totaled $4.5 million. Accounts receivable ended the fourth quarter of 2018 at $55.2 million or 33 days sales outstanding compared with a $59.9 million or 34 days reported at the end of the third quarter of 2018 and the $38.0 million or 27 days reported in the fourth quarter of 2017. Our internal inventories at the end of the fourth quarter of 2018 were $136.4 million, down slightly from the $136.8 million at the end of the third quarter of 2018. Days of inventory rose to 180 days at the end of Q4 2018 from the 175 days at the end of third quarter of 2018. I would now like to turn to the outlook. First, MPS is announcing a 33% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.40 per share from $0.30 per share for shareholders of record as of March 29, 2019. We are forecasting Q1 2019 revenue in the range of $138 million to $144 million. We also expect the following. GAAP gross margin in the range of 54.8% to 55.4%, non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.3% to 55.9%, total stock-based compensation expense of $17.6 million to $19.6 million, including approximately $600,000 that would be charged to cost of goods sold; GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses between $55 million and $59 million. Non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense to be in the range of $38 million to $40 million. This estimate excludes stock compensation and litigation expenses. Our income is - our other income is expected to be in the range of $1.4 million to $1.6 million before foreign exchange gains or losses; fully diluted shares to be in the range of 44.7 million to 45.7 million shares. In conclusion, despite uncertainty in the macro economy, we expect to continue winning market share in the cloud computing, automotive and telecommunications market. We believe the future is bright. I will now open the phone lines for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Ross Seymore: Hi guys. Congrats on the solid execution. Michael or Bernie, just wanted to get your view on the macro environment. You guys have a lot of company specifics where you can take share, but you're not immune the tide is rising or if it's falling like it is right now. So any color on the linearity of demand you saw and how you view 2019 growth potential relative to what the overall market is doing versus what sort of incremental share gains you guys can take in any number of product areas where you have new design wins?
Michael Hsing: Ross, okay, so good question. All the MPS's growth is from the new product and then - you in the new market segment that Bernie mentioned the automotive and industrials and computing. And in later - in especially in the Q4 last year we see slowing down dramatically. And we asked around our customers and all due to the - it seems to me is all due to the economy uncertainty in the futures. And however in the middle of all of these we see not all the product though stopped, and delayed that their introductions. But some of their end product still introduced or still we have a replacement we gave some market shares. And in 2019 we still expect to grow and we'll have very healthy years, but the percentage - the growth whether the same as the last couple years that we cannot tell.
Bernie Blegen: And if I could add to that Ross, that what we're observing, again, only from our specific position is that the design wins are in place, our end customers are interested in going to market, but there's just not the right conditions for them to invest in that type of new product ramp. And so, I don't have any view as far as how long this will last for when we start to see the improvements come around. But I do - I believe very confidently that we're well positioned to take full advantage of that turnaround.
Ross Seymore: Thanks for all that color. I guess, as my follow-up just on the inventory side, I know you guys have talked about increasing your own internal inventory to be ready for those ramps. So, I guess, a two part question, one is, is that still the case or should that inventory come down if those ramps continue to be delayed? And then two, could you give us an update on what the channel inventory situation is and what your expectations are for that as well?
Michael Hsing: Ross I like that question. The inventory I think we see it there's a lag. Clearly it is very valid. And in this kind of a transitional market conditions we watch very carefully. So that's why I like that question. And of course there's a delay and we see if it's - of course demand is slowing down, we control our - the inventory will come down can we control very highly. Now Bernie you can answer a more on the numbers.
Bernie Blegen: On the second side of that question as far as how the channel performed is what we do is we fill orders based upon our customer demand and that's 90% distributor related. And then, the distributors are creating that demand with those orders on us based on the information they're getting from their customers. And the slowdown occurred during the quarter, so we ended up in a position where the - in terms of both dollars and days that the channel inventories did increase and managing that going forward some of the management of that is reflected in our guidance for Q1.
Ross Seymore: Got it. Thanks guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from line of Quinn Bolton with Needham. Your line is now open.
Quinn Bolton: Hey, guys. I'll apologize because I missed most of the prepared comments, but obviously a slightly weaker guide from March. Just wondering as you look into the full year you typically see a much stronger second and third quarter in terms of seasonality, is there any reason to think some of the near-term effects you've seen that are hitting Q1 extend into Q2, Q3 or should we be thinking about a more traditional seasonal pattern as we get out to the June and September quarters?
Bernie Blegen: Yes, I think when we responded to Ross on this is that we really don't have good visibility, there's a lot of uncertainty relative to the out quarters. So when we look more short-term at Q1 even - let me go back to our Q4 for a second. We've put up some very significant numbers in all of our groups except for consumer, which was most price sensitively impacted by trade and tariffs and the macro particularly in Greater China. So the point that we also observed is that a lot of the new product ramps that our customers were building expectations around have been pushed out in this period in time. And so, it's hard for us to say concretely how that's going to affect our overall growth rate for the year or when do we expect a turnaround to begin.
Quinn Bolton: Okay, great. And then just a second question again I'll apologize. Did you sort of give a backlog number, I think you for most of the past three, four years you tended to be at 80 or so percent of guidance in backlog started in the quarter. Are we in that metric range for the March quarter?
Bernie Blegen: Yes, we are.
Quinn Bolton: Great, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rick Schafer with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.
Rick Schafer: Yes, thanks and nice result in a tough environment guys. I guess, I was hoping to understand gross margin at least in the near-term just a little better I know it's obviously softer. I mean, is the primary driver that's just simply mix. I mean, I would have assumed a better mix in 1Q, but are we - Bernie, if you could provide maybe a little more color there what your expectations are by segment maybe it almost seems like consumer is going to be a bigger contributor to mix in the first quarter. And then, the second part of that question is just how fast - if you guys can give any color on how fast that gross margin might rebound?
Bernie Blegen: Sure. So when we look at Q4 let's just start with that. That was clearly mix, because when you look at the influx of revenue into the communications that was predominantly lower margin business and we discussed that in Q3 as well. So the continuation is the same. But then you had some of our high margin and it was pretty broad based. For example SSD, power management for GPUs and a couple of things in industrial that underperformed expectations. And so as a result, those are very high margin and it was - the offset was against lower margin business and that accounted for the 50 basis points. When we look at Q1, we still have some overhang of mix issues. It's not all of it. And even though we don't have a specific number, we are anticipating that we will need to look at our inventory provisions in a different light with lower demand. Again, we've talked in the past that our inventory has a long shelf life and we believe that all the products are ultimately going to be sellable. But the mechanic of how we determine our inventory provision is based upon near-term demand. And that may not support or may support a higher inventory provision. And as far as looking forward, I don't have guidance beyond, but obviously with the new products that when they start to ramp as Michael was describing. Those will contribute very positively and immediately to our gross margin.
Michael Hsing: What foresee going forward if all the new product delays and okay and the margin will stay as close as of now. We don't see a dramatic change. Well, dramatic change is all relative and now we have 0.5% change look it is pretty small to me. And - but we analyze it and that is against our very consistent result in last four, five quarters and that is due to the mix. And all the new product, new revenue high quality revenue gets delayed. And going forward we expect to grow the gross margin very consistently as the economy recovered.
Rick Schafer: Got it. Thanks for all that color. And then just shifting gears quickly to server, you've talked I know in the past about the potential server content for you guys around 50 today, but going to 70 next year. And I'm just curious, because you were talking about 48 volt in your prepared remarks. How much of that 50 to 70 captures any content gains associated with 48 volt core power market share for gains for you guys? I mean is 48 volt a material content driver for MPS?
Michael Hsing: Yes. We actually expected in Q1 2019 and obviously it's actually number is a much smaller I'm like I mean we - so all - actually as we see it, it's not in the first half anyway will be in the second half of 2018 in early part of 2020.
Rick Schafer: Got it, thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from a line of William Stein with SunTrust. Your line is now open.
William Stein: Great, thanks for taking my question. Based on the backlog and the order patterns would you expect or I should say it seems to me that we'd expect lower than maybe typical seasonality heading into Q2. Is that the right way to think about the model given that you maybe you sort of started seeing this weakness a little bit later than others and seems to be at least a couple quarters of weakness for what everyone else is seeing?
Bernie Blegen: Yes, I don't see there being a quick catalyst that would create a quick turnaround. So I think while we only guide one quarter ahead that I could support that thesis.
William Stein: Okay. And then as it relates to inventory Bernie, I think you mentioned that channel inventory on days and dollars were up again in the quarter. Does your guidance for Q1 combined with what you let's say expect to sell through? Would that support lower dollars and days at the end of Q1 or something different?
Bernie Blegen: It's more likely that we will have been down in dollars, but probably close to flat in days because you have a smaller denominator.
William Stein: Great, thanks, Bernie.
Bernie Blegen: Thank you, Will.
Operator: Our next question comes from line of Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Your line is now open.
Tore Svanberg: Yes, thank you and congratulations on the record year. I'll start here from the macro stuff and I'm pretty interested in BCD 6. Could you elaborate a little bit more what that means for products going forward? I mean, you talked about 55 nanometer and 12 inch wafers, but any other color you could add?
Michael Hsing: Yes. Okay. These are - actually as usual. With every other years and every year we introduce, we develop a newer technologies and that is really our foundation for the future of growth. And so the BCD 6, we said BCD 5 we including memories and now we will include much denser logics. And so now we mentioned - Bernie, mentioned it is a 55 nanometers and we will have those type of logics design. So you can think of that way. We really put entire systems almost single chip, which means we included the microcontroller. And that will give access to lot more market segments and lot more capability.
Bernie Blegen: And then from simply a cost point of view, there is a lower unit cost involved with this process and this geometry and how we choose to deploy that cost advantage will basically depend upon the end market. So for example in consumer that will extend our ability to be price competitive in other markets it'll allow us to improve our gross margins and in others still it'll make us able to with the technological advantage to compete in markets that we hadn't previously been able to enter into.
Tore Svanberg: Thank you for that color. And also you mentioned obviously e-commerce and your website up and running last year. Could you give us some color on how the feedback has been so far, how the learning curve going for customers.
Michael Hsing: Yes, we - yes you call a website. Yes, up and running. But I said we're still learning. As expected actually, this is the very new frontier to everybody it's an - nobody attempted that before. And we still try to figure out why the - when we give the floppy disk it is a lot more effective than we go through a website. So we still try to figure out, there's something obviously is not quite right. But the product itself when we give a traditional ways and give them all the tools and give them CDs and give them download the program everybody likes that. And we see more and more customers would rather use a fixed product and then they choose a programmable parts and they're going - we see a clear direction. And - but how effectively using the website, we're still trying to figure out.
Tore Svanberg: Very good, one last question. Yes, go ahead, Bernie.
Bernie Blegen: I just wanted to caution that I think we've tried to set our expectations around the fact that we would have zero revenue in 2018, zero revenue in 2019 that's not entirely true because we are generating revenue. But then, we'll have a good slow ramp in 2020 and 2021 and it's really 2022 is when we expect it to contribute materially.
Michael Hsing: Are you talking about the e-commerce?
Bernie Blegen: Yes.
Michael Hsing: Yes. And that's strictly sales through a website. And now we see the early - actually we do see some revenues, some meaningful revenues. But in terms of a programmable site and why people just don't use the online tools whether the online tools are not good enough or whether have ordering pattern where that's too difficult for them to order. And in that respect, we haven't generated any revenues on a programmable parts revenue from our website.
Tore Svanberg: Now that's very fair. Just one last question. You mentioned communications coming back, it sounds like that's more kind of your legacy business. Should we assume that the new 5G products will kind of get the gross margin going again and the communications revenue?
Michael Hsing: Absolutely. As I said in - I remember the last year some quarters and I think it's Q2 I mentioned that and we will get some communication revenues and we see the opportunities. And it's even though a lower margin, but is good dollars. And the same time I mention I haven't given up as on the higher margin communications. Once we introduce the right product and we did have it in the - we did have in last year and we just haven't just released it. And now we designed it and when 5G happens we will be on the way.
Tore Svanberg: Very good. Thank you again for the color.
Michael Hsing: All right, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with Cowen. Your line is now open.
Matthew Ramsay: Thank you, good afternoon. Bernie, I wondered if you - I guess this is maybe a little bit of a different way to ask Rick's question from earlier around mix in gross margins, but maybe perhaps you could give us a little bit of color by division about how you're thinking a sequential growth or decline in the different business units might be going into Q1. I think that would be helpful. Thank you.
Bernie Blegen: Yeah sure. When we look at mix obviously the traditional way to sort of view it is that consumer is lower and also the legacy comps business is on the lower end. And just as far as the transition from Q4 to Q1 we've guided at about flat gross margin, but the mix is less bad in Q1 than in Q4 because we continue to see growth in our computing and automotive. And then there's some declines in industrial and that you have to have as a backdrop that industrial has the last two quarters really outperformed any of its historic patterns. So that's not coming as a total surprise. And then you have consumer that's doing a little bit of an exaggerated step down from Q4 to Q1. So that's really the mix that we're looking at is computing and automotive are continuing to perform - outperform expectations. And we've got some declines or exposure to both high end low margin opportunities.
Matthew Ramsay: Got it, that's helpful on the mix. I guess, if we look forward in the computing and storage business, if you could remind us again about exactly the mix and exposure to the computing side and the storage side. It seems like there's some catalysts on obviously on the computing side from a share perspective and 48 volt, but this has been a pretty ugly environment on the storage side from a macro perspective. So some update on the mix and how you're thinking about those two different segments there recovering as we go through the year would be helpful? Thank you.
Bernie Blegen: Sure, so storage is a significant part of our business, but it's declined as a percent only because it hasn't grown at the same rate as what we've seen on the compute side. And there was - if you look at last year 2018 SSD in particular ramped very early and sustained that growth all the way through the mid-part of Q3 before starting to decline. In that area I see sort of a stabilization and currently storage if you look at Q4 for example is about a third of that line item. Then when you look at the computing, obviously we've had significant run up in our server and workstation. So that's in an elevated level. And then, as we were talking about earlier is that some initial sales related to GPUs are falling off as that market or those customers take a pause.
Matthew Ramsay: Thanks for the color. I appreciate it.
Bernie Blegen: Thanks
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alessandra Vecchi with William Blair. Your line is now open.
Alessandra Vecchi: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just on the extension of the end markets or segments in Q1. When you guys commented that you saw sort of new product launches delayed. Was there any particular vertical you're seeing that in? Is it a delay in for the new smart meter industrial products? Is it a delay in automotive products, if you could just give a little bit of color on that?
Michael Hsing: So actually, Bernie mentioned it in the earlier. And we see a pretty much across the board automotive, industrials as well as computing. And is that answer your questions?
Alessandra Vecchi: Yes. Does apologies if I missed it.
Michael Hsing: No. It's okay.
Alessandra Vecchi: All my other questions were answered.
Michael Hsing: Okay, thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of William Stein with SunTrust. Your line is now open.
William Stein: Thanks for taking the follow-up guys. Any update on the e-motion product revenue traction?
Michael Hsing: Yes. We're afraid of this is too much of a - and yes, we actually starting January pretty meaningful revenue. And the new integrated solutions and as you see it our website, we sell the reference design including the models. And we receive very good feedback on these.
William Stein: Great efforts.
Michael Hsing: But the revenue still it's early ramp is only a ramp, but it's ramping very high percentage.
Bernie Blegen: Will, thanks for giving us a chance to respond, we actually had an internal discussion on whether we had too many items out there. So we're not shying away from it. It's just that we're competing against a lot of other opportunities to talk about.
William Stein: I understand. One other opportunity you mentioned a couple times tonight is 48 volt. I think there's one small semi company that's pretty well known to have a big share in that market. And we're also aware that one of the main consumers is GPUs. Are you seeing revenue for that product today or is it more a couple quarters out? And is it - of course we know automotive is moving in that direction too, but in which market do you expect to generate revenues first how close are we?
Michael Hsing: Actually both and automotive is being in a 48 volts already in the high end cars. I think now it trickle down. And last year we expected to have a - in the second half of 2019 and as we see it probably still going to happen because these are high end product. I think they still are going to launch because the demand still there. Is regardless of the market.
William Stein: Your product, that's competitive and ready and recognizing revenue in the back half of this year?
Michael Hsing: I believe so that in terms of what is impacted to our revenue that's difficult to say now and I think these are high - these IR - these AR systems and you always need somewhere it's just a matter of how many.
William Stein: Got it, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Caso with Raymond James. Your line is now open.
Chris Caso: Yes, thank you. Good evening. Just one question for me, Bernie, could you clarify one of the comments you made earlier on the inventory provisions. You said you need to take another look on that is the right interpretation of that just changing the quarterly reserves that you typically make. What's about the magnitude is there any impact on margins from that?
Bernie Blegen: Yes, I haven't specifically calculated any exposure to what we've done in the forecast for the guidance is just provide a little bit of a step up and the rationale behind it is that we have a mechanical way of determining that number, which is based upon the next six months demand. So it's sort of inferred that if your six month demand looks to be going down that that could increase your likelihood of having an exposure. That's not to call out any specific product or end market, it's just sort of being generally conservative in the guidance we're providing.
Michael Hsing: Yes, as of today we don't see any dramatic change. And it's all small numbers of change. When Bernie is talking about when the market dramatically changes, again it's like in last year December at the end of the quarter. And then well it may changes again. So we at this times we see is pretty normal now.
Chris Caso: Got it. Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Your line is now open.
Tore Svanberg: Yes, thank you. I just had a quick follow up and back to BCD 6. I think you've talked about having a $17 billion SAM and I'm just wondering what BCD 6 does to that SAM number?
Michael Hsing: Yes, we haven't got to the point yet. That's very good questions and certainly we see in our - in the application that we targeted we can integrate a lot of mini micro control - micro controller features.
Tore Svanberg: And just to be clear, so those micros you would develop yourself, right. I mean you wouldn't buy off the shelf ones?
Michael Hsing: It depends on applications. Some of the - and as we know now, we rebranded and - but we do have our firmware in the micro. And as of - into the total integrated solutions and first of all - so our total integration has a clear reason, has a cost effective and - or by size limitations. And if they integrate it and then we have to - we are not going to give a grown up developed microcontrollers. And those are not cost effective for us and those are we most likely is licensing.
Tore Svanberg: Sounds good. Thank you very much.
Michael Hsing: Okay, thank you.
Operator: And I'm showing no further questions in queue at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks.
Bernie Blegen: I'd like to thank you all for joining us for the conference call and look forward to talking you again during our first quarter 2019 conference call, which will likely be in April. Thank you. Have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Monolithic Power Systems Incorporated's Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all lines are on a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be provided at that time. And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Bernie Blegen, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to the third quarter 2018 Monolithic Power Systems' conference call. In the course of today's conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty which could cause results to differ materially from management's current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q3 earnings release and in our SEC filings included in our Form 10-K filed on March 1, 2018, and Form 10-Q filed on August 2, 2018, both of which are accessible through our website, www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today's call. We'll be discussing gross margin, operating expense, R&D and SG&A expense, operating income, interest and other income, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and on a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the Q3 2017, Q2 2018 and Q3 2018 earnings releases, as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our website. I'd also like to remind you that today's conference call is being webcast live over the Internet and will be available for replay on our website for one year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. Let me start by telling everyone that our Q3 2018 quarterly revenue of $160.0 million established another record for MPS, our fifth high watermark for quarterly revenue in the last six quarters. Likewise non-GAAP gross margin grew 10 basis points sequentially, representing the 12th consecutive quarter MPS' non-GAAP gross margin has either expanded or matched the prior quarter's performance. As expected, we reached the $160 million revenue milestone, reflecting strength in each of our targeted market segments. Q3 revenue for computing and storage, up 64% year-over-year; automotive up 54%; and industrial up 52%. During the quarter, MPS did experience some unexpected softness in high volume consumer-related businesses, especially in the Greater China region. However, we still see high demand for these products and remain optimistic in our prospects for high-end consumer products. We also gained market share in low end communications segment. We will stay opportunistic in these high volume businesses and focus on growing higher margin products. Looking at our revenue by end market. In our computing and storage market, revenue of $47.7 million increased $18.6 million, or 64.2% year-over-year. Growth in the market was broad based when compared to the year ago quarter with all applications, high-end notebooks, cloud computing and storage increasing at rates well above the market average. Computing and storage revenue represented 30% of MPS' third quarter 2018 revenue compared with 23% in Q3 2017. Third quarter 2018 industrial revenue of $24.9 million increased $8.5 million, or 52.1% from the third quarter of 2017 primarily due to increased sales for applications and power sources, meters and security. This market represented 16% of our total third quarter revenue versus 13% in the prior year. Third quarter automotive revenue of $19.8 million grew $6.9 million, or 53.9% over the same period of 2017 as a result of increased sales of infotainment, safety and connectivity application products. Automotive is MPS' largest TAM opportunity at $7 billion and we are in the early stages of penetrating this market. In the years ahead, we plan to offer a number of new products for applications in body control, lighting, infotainment, ADAS and battery management. Automotive revenue was 12% of MPS' total Q3 2018 revenue compared with 12% for Q3 2017. Third quarter communications revenue of $19.2 million, increased $3.8 million, or 24.6% over the same period 2017. This represents the combination of share gains in our legacy markets and initial ramping in products for the 5G network. Revenue from consumer markets of $48.5 million, decreased $6.8 million, or 12.4% from the third quarter of 2017. Consumer revenue accounted for 30% of our total Q3 revenue compared with 43% in the prior year. While the loss of revenue in these high volume consumer markets is likely a reflection of geopolitical or trade policy changes, we did not lose projects and continued to gain market share. GAAP gross margin was 55.6%, 10 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2018 and 60 basis points higher than the third quarter of 2017. Our GAAP operating income was $33.5 million compared to $24.9 million reported in the second quarter of 2018 and $23.8 million reported in the third quarter of 2017. For the third quarter of 2018, non-GAAP gross margin was 56.1%, 10 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2018 and 40 basis points higher than the third quarter of 2017. Our non-GAAP operating income was $49.2 million compared to $41.4 million reported in the prior quarter and $38.9 million reported in the third quarter of 2017. Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $55.5 million in third quarter compared with $52.7 million in the second quarter of 2018 and $47.0 million in the third quarter of 2017. Our non-GAAP third quarter 2018 operating expenses were $40.5 million, up from the $36.9 million we set in the second quarter of 2018 and up from $32.9 million reported in the third quarter of 2017. On both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis, third quarter litigation expenses were $343,000 compared with a $639,000 expense in Q2 of 2018 and a $327,000 expense in Q3 2017. The difference between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are stock compensation expense and income or loss from an unfunded deferred compensation plan. Total stock compensation including $471,000 charged to cost of goods sold for the third quarter of 2018 was $14.8 million compared with $15.9 million recorded in the second quarter of 2018. Switching to the bottom line, third quarter 2018 GAAP net income was $31.6 million, or $0.71 per fully diluted share compared with $0.55 per share in the second quarter of 2018 and $0.54 per share in the third quarter of 2017. Q3 non-GAAP net income was $47.3 million, or $1.06 per fully diluted share compared with $0.90 per share in the second quarter of 2018 and $0.84 per share in the third quarter of 2017. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q3 2018 were $44.7 million. Now let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $353.1 million at the end of the third quarter of 2018 compared to $318.7 million at the end of the second quarter of 2018. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $52.2 million compared with Q2 2018 operating cash flow of $25.4 million. Third quarter 2018 capital spending totaled $5.1 million. Accounts receivable ended the third quarter of 2018 at $59.9 million, or 34 days of sales outstanding compared with $53.5 million or 35 days reported at the end of the second quarter of 2018 and the $50.8 million, or 36 days reported in the third quarter of 2017. Our internal inventories at the end of the third quarter of 2018 were $136.8 million, up from the $128.9 million at the end of the second quarter of 2018. Days of inventory decreased to 175 days at the end of Q3 2018 from the 189 days at the end of the second quarter of 2018. Days of inventory are in our new range reflecting changing customer requirements particularly in automotive and computing and our new product introductions. Turning now to our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2018. We are forecasting Q4 revenue in the range of $151 million to $157 million. We also expect the following, GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.2% to 56.2%; non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.6% to 56.6%; total stock-based compensation expense of $13.5 million to $15.5 million, including approximately $500,000 that would be charged to cost of goods sold; GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses between $50.6 million and $55.6 million; non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to be in the range of $37.6 million to $40.6 million. This estimate excludes stock compensation and litigation expenses; other income is expected to range from $1 million to $1.2 million before foreign exchange gains or losses; fully diluted shares to be in the range of 44.6 million to 45.6 million shares. In conclusion, as expected, we continued to execute according to our plans of diversification in both products and geographical markets. We grew in greenfield segments while gaining share in high-value products in consumer and communications amongst the uncertainty in the market and geopolitical environment. I will now open the phone lines up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Matt Ramsay with Cowen. Your line is now open.
Matthew D. Ramsay - Cowen & Co. LLC: Good afternoon, guys, and congratulations on a strong set of results with a lot of uncertainty out there. The question that we've been getting the most often is, there's a lot of new content growth and market share gains that are embedded into the long-term forecasts that investors have for your company across a number of businesses. Maybe Michael, you could talk about at a high level how you're progressing there and then just juxtapose that against a lot of concerns about a weaker macro environment. I know that folks have an expectation of 20% growth for your company over the next couple of years and we're just trying to understand the risks associated with that versus the opportunities for share gains. Thank you.
Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: All right, okay. As you know, MPS, we're not in a position to answer what the macro position is and we only heard from you guys. And we have a very small percentage of market share, particularly in those greenfield market segments such as auto, in data centers as well as the industrial side. And we have a very little market segment. Those segments should be relatively immune to what the market condition is and we expect it to grow according to our plan, and the next few years we are all set.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: I think one-point to add to that is that, we're continuing to be very aggressive as far as securing new design wins. And that as we said in our prepared comments, that while there has been a downturn that's reflected most in our consumer business, we didn't lose market share, in fact we continue to make gains.
Matthew D. Ramsay - Cowen & Co. LLC: No. That commentary is really, really helpful. And I guess, as a follow up, I've spent a decent amount of time with my team digging into the programmable aspect of many of your solutions as you sort of bring programmability into the portfolio. Michael, maybe you could talk a little bit about at a high level, what percentage of the products that you're shipping now and winning designs with, and then I guess second, winning designs with are programmable in nature today, and how you might see that trend going forward and what that might mean for market share? Thank you.
Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: All right. Okay. At this point, still probably single-digit percentage of our total revenues and we expect to quadruple in the next couple of years. And probably, most likely in the four or five years and a 100% of our products will be programmable.
Matthew D. Ramsay - Cowen & Co. LLC: Got it. No, that's really helpful and I'll jump back into queue, if you don't mind. My congratulations and well done. Cheers.
Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Schafer with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.
Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Thanks. I'll add my congratulations guys on a nice quarter. So maybe obviously auto and industrial, each up 50% plus in the quarter. I think the auto business is .tracking to something north of $80 million this year. Mostly it's been infotainment, and I think now you're starting to see lighting and motor control start to ramp. Maybe you could walk us through what that next leg of growth there looks like. I know Michael you talk a lot about having two, three years of really solid visibility there. I'm curious as ADAS and BMS wins ramp, kind of, a, what the timeline looks there and then what we could see for a margin impact? I guess when would we start to see sort of a noticeable margin impact within that auto business?
Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Even as I talk about infotainment, we still scratch the surface. We just start to periphery and as we just went through the auto business, the deep dive in the auto segments and we're just starting that. Even in those – in the infotainment. And for next couple of years, and we have all these products in designing such as the lighting, including headlights and also as Bernie said earlier, the body controls (19:04) models and any kind of moving pieces in a car. We have electronic control and we have those product design. In ADAS, I see it in three years out and all these activities and we have to pick and choose which product we want to do and we just don't have enough people and our name is out, our product reputation is out and we are proven to be a quality supply. And so the margin will stay the same as now or even be higher.
Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Got it. Thanks. And maybe switching gears to e-commerce. I know it's something that I think a lot of people care about with you guys. Maybe start with any customer feedback or what the feedback has been from customers so far. I know you've talked about adding hundreds of customers there. I know you've also talked about I believe first revenues or material revenues sort of in 2020. I guess I'm curious, do smaller customers that e-commerce would be targeting, I mean do they need to go through a full call, like some of your more established larger customers? And I guess what I'm getting at is could we see revenues in e-commerce kind of pull forward? Could we see those start to hit before 2020?
Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Very possible, particularly those are smaller customers in industrial shops. They buy 10,000 to 20,000 units a year. And those are the ones – those are the customers in a – if we have – if we prove to be a quality supply, and they will stay with us for years and so those ones just starting now. So in terms of how their feedback is, so far our website still – it's not – we still have a lot more to do and particularly in the e-commerce market segments and how do we do digital marketing and we start to do it this year and early next year. You will see some significant changes. In terms of the current feedback, so far we hand them a floppy disk and they download it – almost every one of them, they're very happy. They want to see more these type of products and, well, I can't say every one of them and we have in recent months we gain a few, more than a few hundred customers and most of them said they wanted this kind of a product.
Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: And have you seen any competitive response from some of the larger HPA guys?
Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: I think (22:37) we address the very segment in the market and we don't see any other players and that they do a similar thing as we do.
Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay, thanks a lot, Michael. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Quinn Bolton with Needham. Your line is now open.
Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: Hi, guys. Congratulations again on the very steady execution. Michael, Bernie, just wanted to sort of address, I guess one of the biggest investor fears I hear is kind of the order rates declining in China region. Can you give us any sense whether those order rates which sound like they started to decline late summer, whether that stabilized or are they still sort of on a downward trend and maybe just address the sort of where you are in terms of starting backlog looking into the fourth quarter of 2018, I think the last few quarters you'd gotten in to the quarter with nearly 100% of plan in backlog and then maybe a couple of product follow-ups? Thanks.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Sure. I think that you can see from the Q3 numbers that, and again the comments that we referenced that in the Greater China market that we did see a downturn in demand, particularly for consumer and so as a result of that, we are sort of monitoring to see if that branches out into our other end markets or if there are any changes in ordering pattern. You referenced also our last three quarters as far as what our experience has been with backlog going into the quarter, and in fact what we've seen in this quarter is that we've sort of returned to a more normalized level where we're not at the accelerated pattern that we've been experiencing previously but is really again return to a more normalized backlog for this time in the quarter. So it's something that we have to continue to monitor and certainly as there are different developments, we have demonstrated the ability to respond to that. But I think the thing that is most encouraging for us is that the targeted areas that we focused on, again the automotive, the computing and storage and the industrial, where they have long ordering visibility that those remain very solid and that we're just seeing gains that are significantly better than market.
Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: Great. And then maybe Michael, could you just address, you know, as we look into the end of 2018 and 2019, Intel will be launching their Cascade Lake platform by the end of the year, and then the new Whitley or Cooper Lake platform, maybe second half of 2019. I know Pearly (25:50) was a big uptick for you in terms of server content. How do you feel about your position with Cascade Lake and Whitley or Cooper Lake over the next 12 months?
Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: I think that we – I expected that I think we grow just – we don't expect it to have anything different, again, in all the designing activity and all the new product release and we expected that same as the last couple of quarters and I think, we even grow faster. Then most of revenue in this world in the next 2019, all the way through 2022.
Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: So a steady – sort of a steady ramp in server power management over that 2019 to 2022 timeframe?
Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Yes. And the others in a similar way rate of before.
Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: Got it. Okay. Thank you.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Quinn?
Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: Oh, go ahead, Bernie.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: No. I was going to say that what you were referencing is that Intel has been adjusting their product release schedule around a couple of different issues. And obviously, that's something we need to adapt to. We don't see it as a negative to or an impediment to the growth that Michael is referring to.
Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: I care less about couple of...
Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: Yes.
Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: ...plus/minus, a couple of quarters.
Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: Yes.
Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: And that's out of our controls but the direction of growth and we cover not only from traditional servers, all these new AR systems and the new type of servers, we cover all of them.
Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi guys. Congrats on the resultant guide in this tough environment. Just wanted to get into the inventory in the channel side and dovetail that into the backlog question that was asked a bit ago here. Well, Bernie you said that the backlog coverage has returned to normal. Over the course of this year, correct me if I'm wrong, but have you guys been shipping to the elevated backlog? Have you been controlling it? And where does channel inventory stand today?
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Sure. So, in the reference that you're talking to is between Q1 and Q2 that we'd actually had a decline in terms of channel inventory, in terms of days and as we look ahead here both as far as how we finished Q3 and in Q4, a lot of the sales commitments that we have for both quarters are related to commitments that were made upwards of four to six months ago. And so, we are continuing to deliver against that but with the amount of uncertainty that is in the market, the timing of when that gets drawn from the channel is a little bit changed. And so, we went up a little bit in Q3. And I don't know, I don't have a forecast for how Q4 is looking, whether they'll go up or down a little bit. But again it's something that we have to continue to monitor.
Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I guess similarly to that, as the backlog falls, the fear people have for the whole market and companies like yourself is, what goes from 100% coverage plus to something that's normal, then the next step is a further step down. I know you guys have a great secular trend over the course of a number of years, but how do you guys mitigate that risk as we look into say the first half of next year?
Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Yeah, okay. The inventories (30:09) questions now, Ross. We have a lot of growth in the new market segments and it changes the pattern how we do inventories in auto, industrials and telecom. Now the 5G networks, although the revenue is small they'll start to ramping and also the – as well as the data centers and the cloud computings. We really need a lot of inventory to cover the ramp. And regarding all these traditional high volume business and those businesses we can go in or out within half years, so we're not worried about the inventory.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: So we're basically prepared to be able to service the targeted markets and we believe that as you look at the first half of 2019 that they are less impacted by the price sensitivities that might occur as a result of the tariffs or geopolitical trade policies. And then as Michael just said, that on the areas that are more affected, we have the ability to course correct and as we demonstrated in Q3 even within the quarter, to be able to achieve our revenue goals.
Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Yes, high inventory, I will say again is my favorite now, okay, high inventory in a company like the MPS, we have to build a reputation, regardless of the condition we'll ship and we will ship our product and that we are – we're the newcomer. We have a record of reliability as well as a continuation of delivery. We never have that kind of problem. Any one glitch that caused a lot more problems, a much bigger market cap hit than a few million dollars being a few days of inventory.
Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. I guess as my last question, as you guys look back to the last cycle and kind of late 2015 and early 2016, there was barely a blip for MPS, you still in 2016 grew I think 16%, 17% year-over-year way above the analog market as a whole. If you just compare and contrast the positioning of MPS today versus what it was looking like back three years ago, can you just walk through some of the puts and takes as you see it?
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Sure. I think that obviously with all of the new product releases that we've had that really started to ramp beginning in the second half of 2017 and now we are in full swing. We have a much different portfolio that we're able to manage. And so, from that regard, I think that the diversification both in terms of products and markets and geographies, allows us an awful lot of flexibility that we didn't have back at the second half of 2015. Having said that, I would hate to try and draw a parallel between 2015, which ended up being a rather short-term and pretty much an issue specific to the semiconductor industry and what we're observing today. I don't think that people have enough visibility or confidence as to how long this current environment might last.
Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Congrats, guys. Thank you.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Thank you.
Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from William Stein with SunTrust. Your line is now open.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to make sure I understand the sort of the narrative around end markets and demand trends. So consumer came in light as customers backed off orders in that end market that you think is attributable to tariffs. But you made up more than the difference in the comms' end market. I want to make sure I have that right and also understand better about what drove that upside in comms, is that something that perhaps if the consumer end market would have been fine, that you would have posted meaningful upside to the quarter or was this something that sort of came and surprised you to the upside or was there a lot of extra work that it took to drive this to allow you to deliver good results as you usually do? Helping me understand that would be great. Thank you.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Thanks, Will. There's a couple of observations. If you look at consumer sequentially from Q2 to Q3, this was a lower increase than we historically experience, and it was fairly broad-based as far as the number of areas that were impacted. Interestingly that's in traditional consumer or high value consumer end markets, we actually performed pretty well. And then as far as the ability to course correct within a quarter even with relatively short lead time, we play opportunistically in a lot of different markets. And historically, we have not taken on the comms business. This is referring to our legacy gateway and router business because it tends to be lower margin. And in this quarter, we were able to really just pivot. So it was not a lot of effort in order to be able to accept opportunities that we have an opportunity to quote on and bring that in within the quarter. So as I look ahead, I think the most encouraging thing is that we can have that opportunity. We see the comms business is actually lining up in very good shape for Q4. But I think one of the most encouraging things that might have been a slight upside surprise is that we started to see some very initial sales on the 5G side.
Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: The comm business as in the last few quarters, we are flat or slightly down. And so we have refresh, okay, and we're getting some market shares. But there's a significant portion of it, we see the 5G network and start to ramp. And those product we're designing back in a couple of years ago.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: A follow up, if I can. When people ask about what's perhaps something that investors don't understand about Monolithic, one of the answers I've heard you give is that well consensus for next year is up 16% and we think long-term growth is at 20%. Would you still endorse a 20% growth number for 2019 or would you think that's too optimistic given the geopolitical and other risks?
Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: I think that – we will clearly beat whatever your forecast is for the next year industrial growth, okay. We will beat it by 15 points or higher.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: I think that when we look at next year as far as our confidence in 20%, that remains very consistent and solid. Again, one of the things that we want to be known for is our consistency of execution. And that, we can support that again with the amount of visibility we have particularly in these targeted areas that have the longer design cycles and longer ordering patterns. Now having said that, we're not immune to the macro and certainly in the first half of the year, we feel reasonably confident that we have the shots on goal to be successful. We don't have clear visibility on how that's going to play out in the early stages of the year.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Your line is now open.
Tore Egil Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes. Thank you and congratulations on the record operating margin. A few questions here. So, first of all, I know you have some operations in China and certainly, your supply chain is there, any changes to that strategy at all? I mean, I know it's really early days, right? But just given some of the macro political turmoil, any changes to the thinking at all about your operations in China at this point?
Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: When we have diversified, and we have a lot of resources from – in China. But we started – two years ago we started diversify in the different political regions. And in terms of R&D, mostly on these development jobs and all these other geopolitical issues and that is out of our controls, if we see the one region down, the other region is up, okay, and that's the area we really want to focus on and diversify on our presence.
Tore Egil Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Very good.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: And, Tore – go ahead.
Tore Egil Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: No, no, go ahead. Finish the answer, yeah.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Yeah, I was just going to say that on the supply chain issues right now, Michael's exactly right. We don't have control or visibility as far as what the next steps in the process. And again, to the extent that we diversify in the end markets that we sell into and the different customers we have, we would probably adapt similar profile longer term for our supply chain as well.
Tore Egil Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: That's very fair. And a question on 5G. So you're starting to see some revenue contribution there. Is that power management that's based on Intelli-phase or QSMod just like in the data center market or are these different types of power products?
Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: And other types of product in a different network segment. And as well, it's what you said that it is based on the Intelli-phase. And those products in a high-powered computing segment hub of 5G.
Tore Egil Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Very good. And I think you may have already answered this question, Michael, but as far as your lead times, since you obviously are so focused on making sure the deliveries are there, I assume your lead times are still very stable. They were stable in the first half. They're stable now?
Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Yes. The lead times are very stable. Bernie can add on, okay.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Yeah. We've had no change in the lead times in all phases of production, whether it's wafer packaging test. Everything is going very consistently.
Tore Egil Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Very good. Just one last question, you generated almost $50 million in free cash flow this quarter. I mean, I know sort of your approach to capital management, but just kind of based on where the stock price is, any thought about how to put that free cash flow to use?
Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Well, either we're going to increase the dividend or looking for some technology company to acquire. So, I'm not going to buy another company for revenue increase.
Tore Egil Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Sounds good. Congratulations again on all the record results this quarter. Thank you.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alessandra Vecchi with William Blair. Your line is now open.
Alessandra Vecchi - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi guys, congratulations on a great quarter.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Thanks, Alex.
Alessandra Vecchi - William Blair & Co. LLC: Just to go in a little bit more on the consumer side and the weakness you've been seeing there, I think historically you guys have said that of your consumer revenue about 50% of it is traditional, I think 30% of it's high value and 20% of it's gaming. Are you seeing the weakness in gaming as well or is it only in that 50% traditional bucket, and if it's in the traditional bucket, should we consider the whole 50% weak or is only parts of that? Just sort of trying to quantify where consumer could go from here given that seems to be the one bucket that's the most at risk in the short term.
Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Yeah, I hate to say that in the last couple of times when we talked about gaming, our customer is not happy, okay. And one time I said it wasn't my favorite topic and our customer heard that too so really it's my – there is a lot of money to be made with 100% of support. But here is the – for that we got and we see high volumes in – we're not talking about what kind of gaming, okay. And then we see a bit softness in these high volume ones, and other than that and we see the connected devices or the IoT if you will, okay. And the variety of other gadgets and we see in our designing, we see the market demand still very similar.
Alessandra Vecchi - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And then similarly just in terms of the Q4, you guys traditionally don't give us any sort of granularity on the directional segment or the direction of the different segments. But if you had to save on the segment from Q4, what's strongest to weakest. Should we still think about computing and storage as the strongest and then maybe industrial and optical or how has that shifted?
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Yeah, again, I think if you look at the results, clearly what we saw in computing and storage, automotive, industrial, those weren't onetime drivers. This is all about the secular expansion that we've been discussing now for several years and we're now seeing the results come in full term. And so I don't see anything in the outlook that would indicate a diminution of those growth rates. And then as far as how we manage the margin with the consumer, that's something that we're adept at being able to do. So I think that as we look at Q4, we feel very confident not just in the number in total, but also the individual markets as far as we're going to source that growth.
Alessandra Vecchi - William Blair & Co. LLC: Understand. That's very helpful. Okay. I think that's it for me.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Thanks, Alex.
Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Caso with Raymond James. Your line is now open.
Chris Caso - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Yes, thank you. Just first question with regard to inventory levels. Can you talk about what your visibility is both to the distribution channel and to OEM inventories? And I know that through the year you guys have been taking steps to try to discourage customers, prevent customers from building excess inventory. Could you speak to some of those actions and your level of visibility and confidence in the inventory levels?
Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Yeah, my favorite question. Inventories, I tried to convince you all of you guys, okay, it's good for us to increase. And now I think we are pretty normal.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: And then as far as inventory in the channels, again, I'd just refer to an earlier response is that, in the prior three quarters we had experienced a pattern of over ordering and this is reflected in higher than normal historic backlog levels at certain points in the quarter. And while we've seen a moderation of that, that is changed because there is a certain level of uncertainty, and we want to make sure that we're really satisfying real demand as opposed to creating a problem for us down the road. Now, having said that, with the channel and we did a very thorough assessment of it at the end of Q3 as well as what we expect to be the sell through in Q4. And that all got taken into account as we gave our guidance for Q4 in total. So right now, we were feeling that we're getting timely feedback and we're managing it accordingly.
Chris Caso - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: All right, great. And I guess just following on from that. Could you talk about what you consider to be normal seasonal patterns in Q1? And I know there's not a lot of visibility right now and that you're probably doing a lot of work on that. But are there any aspects that we should take into consideration with regard to Q1 based on what you're seeing right now?
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Yeah. We only provide guidance one quarter ahead. And so, I don't want to overreach with any comment. But if you traditionally looked at with the exception of last year which was an unusual set of circumstances because we had greenfield opportunities particularly in the compute and storage that were introduced, that we've traditionally had a step down from Q4 to Q1 of between 3% to 4%.
Chris Caso - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Got it. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And we do have follow up from Quinn Bolton with Needham. Your line is now open.
Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: Hey. Bernie, you kind of addressed it in answering Chris' question, but just I guess I wanted to ask specifically, as you look into your distribution channels. I think there's especially in uncertain environments, a tendency for the distributors to reduce their inventories into calendar year-end. And so I guess when you look at your fourth quarter forecast, you said you took into account sort of the supply chain in the disti channel. Are you expecting them to reduce their days of inventory in the fourth quarter? Or do you expect them to sort of keep a constant days inventory on hand, any guidance you could provide us would be helpful?
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Yeah, the formula sort of works that the channel tries to reduce the dollar value of inventory in Q4. But the denominator as far as the quarterly revenue in Q4 is less than Q3. So, my expectation is that the dollars will be at or below the Q3 level and the days may be at or maybe even a little above in Q4 and that's really a arithmetic exercise rather than anything that we're concerned about.
Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. I show no further questions in queue so I'd like to turn the conference back over to Bernie Blegen for closing remarks.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Thank you. I'd like to thank you all for joining us for this conference call. And I look forward to talking to you again in our fourth quarter conference call, which will likely be in February. Thank you and have a nice day.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you very much for your participation. You may all disconnect. Have a wonderful day.

===== 2018 Q2  (2018-07-26 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Monolithic Power Systems Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Later, we will conduct a question-answer-session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, today’s conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference Mr. Bernie Blegen, Chief Financial Officer. Sir, please go ahead.
Bernie Blegen: Thank you very much. Good afternoon and welcome to the second quarter 2018 Monolithic Power Systems conference call. Michael Hsing, CEO and founder of MPS is with me on today's call. In the course of today's conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management's current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor Statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q2 earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on March 1, 2018 and Form 10-Q filed on May 8, 2018 which are accessible through our website, www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today's call. We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, R&D and SG&A expense, operating income, interest and other income, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the Q2 2017, Q1 2018, and Q2 2018 releases as well to the reconciling tables that are posted on our website. I would also like to remind you that today's conference call is being webcast live over the Internet , and will be available for replay on our website for one year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. In the second quarter of 2018, MPS set a new high watermark in quarterly revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share. MPS’s Q2 revenue of $139.8 million was 8.2% higher than revenue in the first quarter 2018 and 24.6% higher than the comparable quarter in 2017. MPS’s sales momentum continues to build as we generate superior results from our R&D investments targeting the computing, automotive and industrial markets. Looking at our revenue by market. In our computing and storage market, revenue of $37.0 million increased $12.5 million or 51.1% year-over-year. Growth in this market was broadly when compared to the year ago quarter, with all applications, cloud computing, storage and high-end notebooks increasing at a rate well above the market. Computing and storage revenue represented 26.4% of MPS's second quarter 2018 revenue. Second quarter automotive revenue of $20.3 million grew 58.2% over the same period of 2017, fueled by product sales for infotainment, safety and connectivity application products. Automotive revenue was 14.6% of MPS's total second quarter 2018 revenue. In our consumer markets revenue of $47.8 million increase 8.9% over the second quarter of 2017 and represented 34.2% of our second quarter 2018 revenue. The year-over-year revenue increase reflected gains in home appliances, IoT-related applications and specialty lighting. Second quarter 2018 industrial revenue of $19.1 million increase 27.2% from the second quarter 2017 due primarily to increased sales of industrial power supplies. Industrial represented 13.7% of our total second quarter 2018 revenue. GAAP gross margin was 55.5%, 10 basis points higher than the first quarter of 2018 and 80 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2017. Our GAAP operating income was $24.9 million compared to $22.0 million reported in the first quarter of 2018 and $15.0 million reported in the second quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP gross margin for the second quarter of 2018 was 56.0%, 10 basis points higher than the first quarter of 2018 and 40 basis points higher than the second quarter from a year ago. Our non-GAAP operating income was $41.4 million compared to $37.2 million reported in the prior quarter and $31.2 million reported in the second quarter of 2017. Let’s review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $52.7 million in the second quarter of 2018, compared with $49.5 million in the second quarter of 2018 and $46.5 million in the second quarter of 2017. Our non-GAAP second quarter 2018 operating expenses were $36.9 million, up from $35.0 million we spent in the first quarter of 2018 and up from the $31.2 million reported in the second quarter of 2017. The differences between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are stock compensation expense and income or loss on an unfunded deferred compensation plan. For the second quarter of 2018, total stock compensation expense, including approximately $480,000 charge to cost of goods sold was $15.9 million, compared with $15.0 million recorded in the first quarter of 2018. Switching to the bottom line. Second quarter 2018 GAAP net income was $24.2 million or $0.55 per fully diluted share, compared with $21.9 million or $0.49 per share in the first quarter of 2018 and $15.0 million or $0.35 per share in the second quarter of 2017. Q2 non-GAAP net income was $40.0 million or $0.90 per fully diluted share, compared with $35.0 million or $0.79 per share in the first quarter of 2018 and $29.5 million or $0.68 per share in the second quarter of 2017. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q2 2018 were $44 .4 million. Now, let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $318.7 million at the end of the second quarter of 2018, compared to $312.5 million at the end of the first quarter of 2018. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $25.4 million compared with Q1 2018 operating cash flow of $16.3 million. Second quarter 2018 capital spending totaled $5.6 million. Accounts receivable ended the second quarter of 2018 at $53.5 million, representing 35 days of sales outstanding which was 1 day higher than the 34 days reported above that at the end of the first quarter of 2018, and at the end of the second quarter of 2017. Our internal inventories at the end of the second quarter of 2018 were $128.9 million, up from the $111.9 million in the first quarter of 2018. Days of inventory increased to 189 days at the end of Q2 2018 from the 177 days at the end of the first quarter of 2018. The increase in inventory days is due to build up in advance of seasonally high Q3 revenue, changing customer requirements, particularly in automotive, computing and gaming applications, and hedging for potential upside in the second half of 2018. I would now like to turn to our outlook for the third quarter of 2018. We are forecasting Q3 revenue in the range of $155.5 million to $161.5 million. We are also expecting -- we also expect the following: GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.2% to 56.2%; non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.6% to 56.6%; total stock-based compensation expense at $15 million to $17 million including approximately $500,000 that will be charged to cost of goods sold; GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses between $52.3 million and $57.3 million; non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to be in the range of $37.8 million to $40.8 million. In anticipation of higher revenue in the next two to three years, we are stepping up investment in our foundry capabilities. We're actively qualifying two 12-inch fabs and are in the process of developing advanced technologies. Other income is expected to be in the range from $600,000 to $1 million before foreign exchange gains and losses. Fully diluted shares to be in the range of 44.0 million to 45.0 million shares before share buyback. We are continuing to execute our long-term business strategy which we believe will maximize long-term shareholder value. I'll now open the phone lines for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst: [Technical Difficulty]Thanks for letting me ask the question. [Technical Difficulty] I just want to focus in on the auto business a little bit. It’s kind of grown from being your smallest business line to now larger than both comm and industrial. At the analyst day, you guys detailed that you see auto growing in a 40 to 50% CAGR. Auto grew about a 60, 65% CAGR from 2013 to 2017. Is it fair to think of auto growing like at about maybe 40% CAGR going forward through 2021? I guess, how do you guys think about the growth going forward?
Bernie Blegen: Sure. At the Analyst Day that was on June 7th, we characterized growth for the next three years of being in the range between 40% to 50% in any given year. And on a quarterly basis, because there's sort of a step function with how revenue increases here that it could be between 30 and 60%. So, I think that you're in the right ballpark for your CAGR.
Unidentified Analyst: All right. I appreciate that. And next, I'd like to ask about the inventory dynamics you guys had this quarter. I understand you guys had prepared remarks, but I'd love to hear you guys elaborate a little bit more on this. Inventory is up 39% year-on-year, that's ahead of revenues for actually the sixth straight quarter. Maybe there's some mix dynamic there, I understand with the auto maybe some of your parts have a longer life cycle and maybe require more of a build. But, is there anything else that you'd like to elaborate on why inventories continue to be outgrowing revenues.
Bernie Blegen: Actually, you gave a pretty complete answer for me there. In that, we’re…
Michael Hsing: What we really said in earnings, one of those is that we're hedging the potential future growth. And I can give you more color is that we have so many products introduced in the market, they start to ramp. A lot of them we still haven’t seen the revenue yet. And during the ramp, you don’t want you to see any hiccup, either the number of the products or the quantity issues, and we don't have any history of it. And so, we would be very cautious. We use the cash wisely. And in terms of MPS in history, we don’t ride a lot of inventory. And so, if you want talk about inventory, this is how we manage it. And we have a long life cycles. And as long as we see it grow, growth the top line, grow the EPS. I don’t care the rest of it.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company. Your line is now open.
Quinn Bolton: Hey, guys. Congratulations on the nice results for June, and particularly strong guide for September. I just wanted to start with the September quarter. Is there anything in particular, any one end market where you’re seeing particular strength leading to that guide, or is it pretty broad-based? And I’ve got a couple of follow-ups.
Michael Hsing: It’s pretty much of broad-based, all the growth areas we cover, in the last few quarters the story remains same, we’re very -- with the very beginning. And all the product ramping is across the board.
Quinn Bolton: Do you guys still feel pretty comfortable with hitting that 8% to 10% share of the server power management market by -- or for all of 2018.
Bernie Blegen: Yes. Our expectations for the server market have really have not changed in the 18 months since we started discussing on those terms. We’re seeing very positive results and very good acceptance and continuation of good volume.
Quinn Bolton: And I just wanted to ask, some others in the industry have been constrained by the supply of ceramic capacitors and passive devices. And just wondering, if you’ve seen those same constraints. If so, are you doing anything to try to avoid some of those constrains, possibly purchasing passive devices that you can sell as part of your solution to the customers or any thoughts on the supply of passives and whether it’s impacting your business?
Michael Hsing: Yes. It does impact our business. And a lot of products ramping are just not as high as we expected. And we’re looking heavily at design around without using the capacitors.
Quinn Bolton: And then lastly, for you Bernie, you mentioned the step-up in spending here to qualify two 12-inch boundaries. It sounds like that might be a two to three-year phenomena. Does that take you above the OpEx as a percent of sales in that range of 50% to 60%, or do you still think you can kind of target that 50% to 60% OpEx growth as a percent of revenue growth?
Bernie Blegen: I think, for a brief period of time here, and I don’t know how many quarters necessarily that’s going to be. But, while we’re ramping and qualifying the two fabs, we will be beyond what our model is. But we’re very conscious of the need to get operating leverage and return spending down to the 50% to 60% of revenue growth. But, I’d say that probably for the next four to five quarters, maybe six, we’ll probably be above that level.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Rick Schafer with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.
Rick Schafer: I guess, maybe I’ll start off with the ecommerce question, maybe an update on the progress there with that effort. I know, you are already adding some customers. I’m just curious what feedback has been. Maybe if you could quantify what that opportunity looks like for you guys over the next couple of years. I know that’s tough, but put some kind of -- quantify somehow I guess. Give us a TAM, kind of what you -- how you guys look at that?
Michael Hsing: Well, I can answer your first question first. The website is up, and it still looks pretty shitty, but we will improve it later. And we do have orders come from our own website. And the programmable modules that we are pushing out there and trajectory -- we cannot even predict, because this is from nothing to something. And we look at the numbers. And in last couple of months, it’s better than I expected. So, we keep evaluating. So, stay tuned.
Rick Schafer: Okay. But for now, I assume -- we are keeping it out of the model for now I guess?
Bernie Blegen: Yes. We…
Michael Hsing: Yes, keep it out of that model.
Bernie Blegen: We kept revenue expectations, maybe conscious effort to keep them low for ‘18 and ‘19. And really, what we're trying to do is get up to speed and what it takes to market and successfully manage the ecommerce experience. And during this time, we will also be adding more products and getting traction with customer acceptance.
Rick Schafer: Got it. Then, maybe switch gears to 48 volt core power. I know, in the next couple of years, you guys have talked about 48 volt coming to GPU and CPU. I guess, maybe if you could walk us through what the timing looks like of that? Who you are likely to compete with there? I think GPU probably ramps before CPU. So, maybe what has to happen for that to go?
Michael Hsing: Yes. We expect hitting the main stream in the early or mid 2019. And we have been looking at it -- we have been developing that product for last three years. And we see this as an eminent solution for the future of servers. I can't answer who do we compete with, because there is no such a solution out there. And maybe there is a few. And our solution will be hit -- mass produced and easy to use. And we see -- in the last few years, we see we have many design wins.
Bernie Blegen: And just to add real quickly, as Michael said that we’ve had this project under development for three years. And I think that there are a couple of data points in the market today that validate the timing of having our solution released in the 2019 was a good set of circumstances for us. We're in the right place at the right time with the 48 volt solution.
Rick Schafer: Got it. And then, just a quick clarification question, if I could, on 300 millimeter. Where do you guys stand today? I mean, do you have any design wins on 300 millimeter or is that still on the comm? And then, maybe if you could update us on the ramp of any design wins at 55 or 65 nanometer?
Michael Hsing: These are some of the stuff we're hitting the market very, very soon, and I don’t know it is the first shipment or we certainly sampling it.
Bernie Blegen: Slightly different development track where the 55 effort will probably have design wins early in 2019 and the 300 millimeter will probably be more out in the 2020.
Operator: Your next question comes from William Stein with SunTrust. Your line is now open.
William Stein: Great, thanks for taking my questions. Congrats on the very good results and outlook. I wanted to return to the comment about hedging for potential upside in the second half. Is there a particular end market that that's weighted towards? And likewise, would you anticipate a sort of the variability in potential upside to be more of a Q3 event or is there something special in Q4 that we should think about? And then, I have a follow-up, if I can.
Bernie Blegen: Yes. I think that as we said on the call that there's really three or four key areas that are driving a lot of our business. And within that what we've tried to do is we're working within a range of expectations for any one of those. And generally, what we’ve done is we've modeled in our revenue expectations the midpoint or below, but we've provided the inventory at the upper end of the range that has been provided to us by the OEM or from the end customer. So, it is really could be any one of the opportunities in computing and storage or automotive in particular where we could experience a pop.
William Stein: Thanks, Bernie. I appreciate that. And maybe backing up, you offered initial take on e-commerce. I wonder if there's any change in the customer traction relative to the E Motion product.
Michael Hsing: It's a family -- E Motion, a lot of them I see, we are rather selling the ICs and we're selling the total solution. And it is a lot better way, a lot easier way to generating revenues or to service our customers that we learned from -- I learned from the last couple of years. And so, I see this is the same kind of -- ramping [ph] to the same kind of things.
Bernie Blegen: And on E Motion, that is starting to ramp very nicely right now, and we've seen a lot of design wins that we have, not just in ‘18 and ‘19 but even ‘20 and ‘21 that we're already going to be benefiting from. So, that is an initiative that we started in earnest about four years ago, and that's how long it takes for these things to ramp, whereas the e-commerce platform and the field programmability offered on it, we're just in the very early stages of that.
William Stein: Great. Thanks for that clarification and congrats again on the good results and outlook.
Bernie Blegen: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Your line is open.
Tore Svanberg: Thank you. Congratulations on hitting all those records. First question, the 12-inch fab, I understand the OpEx of top of it. But, how should we think about that impacting your gross margins over time? Because I would think that that could potentially be pretty accretive to your gross margin.
Michael Hsing: Yes. Tore, you covered us for a long time and you know that our patterns is that we move from early days to go to 16-inch [ph] and then we go to 8-inch, with the first 8-inch was a 0.35 micron fab. And until these are 180 nanometer fabs, depreciated further, then we moved there. So, each step we move to a new foundry or new advanced fab that it doesn’t impact the margin immediately. And so, those 12-inch fabs are still expensive. But three, four years later, that will be cheaper. So, we just follow our history, we repeat and repeat the same thing. By that time we have the superior technologies and good cost.
Tore Svanberg: Very good. And I believe last quarter your ASPs were of sort of in the high single digits. Is there a number you could share with us for this quarter?
Bernie Blegen: Not at this point. But what I can tell you is that the ASP delta has a lot to do with our mix of business. And many of these new opportunities that we’re going into have ASPs that are 2, 3 and 4 times what some of our legacy products, particularly in consumer used to be. So, I think that you're going to see missing bias as the higher percent of our businesses is with these newer opportunities.
Tore Svanberg: And just last question on automotive, it sounds like there could be some pretty major upside there next -- in the second half of the year. If we think about the confidence you have in the car, so far I think it’s been primarily in lighting and also in some of the USB powers stuff like that. Is there some new incremental content other areas that could come already in the second half of this year?
Bernie Blegen: Actually as far as the technology that we’ve introduced in the automotive, it really is centered around the infotainment, the USB-C ports and the body controls. Interesting, the lighting, we’re just at the very early stages of that. And so, over the course of the next 12 months, I think you’re going to see the ramping in the body control and then little bit after that in lighting.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Vecchi with William Blair. Your line is now open.
Alex Vecchi: I guess, just moving back to the increased expenses on the fabs. Bernie, you said that was gone for four to six quarters, and you guys just gave a 2021 sort of operating margin target at your analyst day. I assume you’re still -- those targets are still intact and these increased expenses were obviously planned at that point.
Bernie Blegen: Yes. What we have been looking to do, and we’ve been sort of trying to provide some soft guidance on both the timing and order of magnitude. And now, we are starting to see those investments translate into the P&L here. But, the overall commitment to manage our core business outside of -- I’m not going to describe these as onetime costs necessarily, but this is a project-related. And those will wind down and that will allow us to get to the targets that we set for ourselves.
Michael Hsing: Here we see the opportunity to grow and we will grow in the next two, three years. And we have a lot of opportunity. So, we made a decision, so we are going to increase it. And to increase our expenditures and investments rather to -- in a new fab. So that we don’t have -- we won't have the capacity issues. And the same, I’ll keep our technology advance forward. And just look at last year and early this year, MPS did not have capacity constraint. We grow as normal. So, we spend our money wisely. And as long as we grow -- again, I only care the topline and EPS. I care the rest of it less.
Bernie Blegen: And then, as far as characterizing what we provided at the analyst day, those are guidelines. So, for example, in the revenue, we want to be able to grow at 20%. And in this case, with the midpoint of the guidance that we’ve offered for Q3, as well as what we've done in Q1 and Q2, we are several percentage points above that this year. So, you really have to look at the guidelines that we've offered in the business model as sometimes it will be above it, sometimes will be below it. And then, the thing to focus on is we only provide guidance one quarter ahead at a time.
Michael Hsing: To be fair, okay, if we grow less, we will spend less. And now, this -- we are accelerating our growth. We cannot grow in the thin air.
Alex Vecchi: Understood. Are you guys seeing sort of the seasonality of your business change as you become more broad-based? I mean, obviously, your Q3 is sort of in line with normal seasonal. I know don’t guide Q4. But given some of the upside opportunities you guys have been describing, how should we think about seasonality as we look out into the out year as well?
Bernie Blegen: Yes. I’d say that by and large, we are looking to maintain to maintain seasonality, the way we've been historically. Now, having said that, Q1 came in higher, there was a lower step down from Q4 to Q1 than we had experienced. And as a result of that, the increase from Q2 -- from Q1 was also lower than we've historically done by about 3 percentage points. But then, in the guide that we’ve given here for Q3, that's almost right down the middle of how we performed in the past.
Michael Hsing: Yes. Our seasonality is changed, in the last year -- as business changed, and also we are in a higher growth period. So, the last year, we had four consecutive -- I think is it right? Four consecutive growth, it never happened since 2004-2005. And so, I can’t tell you what is our seasonality anymore.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay of Cowen. Your line is now open.
Josh Buchalter: Hi. This is Josh Buchalter on behalf of Matt. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the great results again. Firstly, I'd just like to dig a little bit more on the storage and compute bucket. Is there any more granularity you could provide on some of the moving parts within the quarter and maybe the guide, given your large socket wins there?
Bernie Blegen: Again, it’s a story of -- we have too many riches, because all of the major product lines that we’ve gone after in the computing and storage are doing very, very well. And in the guide for Q3, that just reflects a continuation. And so, it’s a situation where a lot of the technology that we invested in developing are now coming into the market. So, if you focus on the servers for example, that transition has rolled out almost identical how we expected it. And right now, we don't see any headwinds. In fact it's continuation of tailwinds.
Josh Buchalter: And then, you provided an update on E Motion and ecommerce. I was hoping maybe you could provide the same on field programmability.
Michael Hsing: No. This is tied together, the ecommerce of course is wider than we do some of the products that are not programmable. And currently, I think that we sell most of the products that is kind of fixed, and because the website was late. And now we have the capability to reprogram the product, reconfigure the product. So, these are the things to me, ecommerce and we -- feel programmable.
Bernie Blegen: And I think that as we look at the continuing demands in this area is that we're going to take even larger number of our product catalogue today and reengineer it around field programmability, which offers our customers the best ease of use and time to market.
Operator: I'm showing no further questions in queue at this time. I’d like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks.
Bernie Blegen: I'd like to thank you all for joining us on this conference call and look forward to talking to you again during our third quarter conference call, which will likely be at the end of October. Thank you, and have a nice day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

===== 2018 Q1  (2018-04-30 18:00:00) =====
Executives: Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer Michael Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Analysts: Quinn Bolton - Needham & Company Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co William Stein - SunTrust Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank Tore Svanberg - Stifel Chris Caso - Raymond James David Wong - Wells Fargo
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Monolithic Power Systems Inc. Q1 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-answer-session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would like to introduce your host for today's conference Bernie Blegen, Chief Financial Officer. You may begin.
Bernie Blegen: Great, thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to the first quarter 2018 Monolithic Power Systems conference call. Michael Hsing, CEO and founder of MPS is with me on today's call. In the course of today's conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risks and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management's current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor Statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q1 earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on March 1, 2018 which is accessible through our website, www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today's call. We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, R&D and SG&A expense, operating income, interest and other income, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table of that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the Q1, 2017; Q4, 2017 and Q1, 2018 releases, as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our website. I'd also like to remind you that today's conference call is being webcast live over the Internet, and will be available for replay on our website for one year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. MPS had yet another record first quarter with revenue of $129.2 million, 28.7% higher than the comparable quarter in 2017. MPS continues to benefit from our technology leadership and diversified multi market strategy. Looking at our revenue by market, compared with the first quarter of 2017, revenue from consumer markets increased $11.5 million, or 32.4%. The year-over-year revenue increase reflected solid improvements and high value consumer markets including home appliances, power chargers and lighting, as well as increases in certain traditional consumer revenue categories. Consumer revenue of $47.1 million represented 36.5% of our Q1 revenue. In our computing and storage market, revenue of $31.0 million increased $10.4 million, or 50.2% year-over-year reflecting strong sales growth for cloud computing, SSD storage and high end notebooks. Computing and storage revenue represented 24.0% of MPS' first quarter 2018 revenue. First quarter 2018 automotive revenue of $17.7 million grew 43.8% over the same period of 2017. This growth primarily represented increased sales of infotainment, safety and connectivity application products. Automotive revenue represented 13.7% of MPS' first quarter 2018 revenue. First quarter 2018 industrial revenue of $17.6 million increased 14.3% from the first quarter of 2017, reflecting gains of smart meters, security and power sources. Industrial revenue accounted for 13.6% of our total first quarter revenue. In Q1, MPS adopted the revenue recognition standard generally referred to as TOPIC606. Its adoption had a negligible impact on Q1 revenue. GAAP gross margin was 55.4%, 40 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2017 and 80 basis points higher than the first quarter of 2017. Our GAAP operating income was $22.0 million, compared to $13.6 million reported in the first quarter of 2017. For the first quarter of 2018, non-GAAP gross margin was 55.9%, 20 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2017 and 40 basis points higher than the first quarter of 2017. Our non-GAAP operating income was $37.2 million, compared to $26.5 million reported in the first quarter of 2017. Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $49.5 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared with $41.3 million in the first quarter of 2017. Our non-GAAP first quarter 2018 operating expenses were $35.0 million, up from the $29.2 million reported in the first quarter of 2017. The differences between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses to the quarters discussed here are, stock compensation expense and income or loss on an unfunded deferred compensation plan. For the first quarter of 2018, total stock compensation expense including approximately $433,000 charged cost of goods sold was $15.0 million, compared with $11.7 million recorded in the first quarter of 2017. Switching to the bottom line, first quarter 2018 GAAP net income was $21.9 million, or $0.49 per fully diluted share, compared with $0.33 per share in the first quarter of 2017. First quarter 2018 non-GAAP net income was $35.0 million, or $0.79 per fully diluted share, compared with $0.58 per share in the first quarter of 2017. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q1, 2018 were $44.3 million. Now let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $312.5 million at the end of the first quarter of 2018, compared to $304.3 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017. In the quarter MPS generated operating cash flow of about $16.3 million, compared with operating cash flow of $21.9 million in the first quarter of 2017. First quarter 2018 capital spending totaled $7.4 million. Accounts receivable ended the first quarter of 2018 at $48.2 million, or 34 days of sales outstanding, which was one day lower than the 35 days posted in the first quarter of 2017. Our internal inventories at the end of the first quarter of 2018 were $111.9 million, up from the $99.3 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017. Inventories increased in anticipation of sales growth during the second half of 2018 especially for the computing, consumer and automotive markets. Days of inventory increased to 177 days at the end of Q1, 2018, compared with 157 days at the end of the first quarter of 2017. I would now like to turn to our outlook for the second quarter of 2018. We are forecasting Q2 revenue in the range of $135 million to $141 million. We also expect the following: GAAP gross margin in the range of 54.9% to 55.9%. Non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.4% to 56.4%. Total stock based compensation expense of $15.2 million to $17.2 million, including approximately $500,000 that would be charged to cost of goods sold. Litigation expenses ranging between $300,000 to $500,000. GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses between $48.4 million and $53.4 million. Non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to be in the range of $33.7 million to $36.7 million. This estimate excludes stock compensation and litigation expenses. Interest and other income is expected to range from $600,000 to $700,000 before foreign exchange gains or losses. Fully diluted shares to be in the range of 43.9 million to 44.9 million shares. In conclusion, we continue to grow and continue to enhance shareholder value. I will now open the phone lines for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Quinn Bolton from Needham. Your line is now open.
Quinn Bolton: Hi, guys, nice results. Michael and Bernie wanted to start with the power management business specifically for the Purley cycle. Can you give us an update on when the QSMod solutions for CPU power begin to ramp? Does that start this quarter?
Michael Hsing: I think if we see it starting last couple of quarters and just slowly. There are all these activity, yes, now that we see a lot more.
Bernie Blegen: Yes and I think that in addition to Purley, we certainly increased the number of design wins that we have on this cycle with some of our other products, the point of load in the E-Fuse. And so as we look ahead, we see a continuing momentum.
Quinn Bolton: Did you guys still think you're on track to pick up those 45 points of share that you'd previously talked about?
Bernie Blegen: Yes, well, we only talk about results for the next quarter of forecasts; we don't see anything that's changing that assumption.
Quinn Bolton: Okay.
Michael Hsing: This is a very beginning - at the very beginning early for MPS. All the opportunities still developing here.
Quinn Bolton: Okay and then the second question just kind of it looks like your inventories are up in anticipation of sort of higher second-half sales, but I think the last couple of quarters you've said that the things in the supply chain are tight. You were worried about double ordering and I think that was particularly something that you're worried about heading into the fourth quarter. Can you just give us an update on your backlog coverage? Do you think you've seen - have you been able to sort of shake out any potential excess from the order books?
Bernie Blegen: Yes. I think that it's prudent to be cautious as far as interpreting the ordering trends that we're seeing. In each of the last three quarters, the bookings and backlog going into the quarter have been running higher than they traditionally have. And so as a result of that we wanted to a, be able to make sure that we have adequate inventory in order to be able to meet real demand, but by the same token we're trying to manage what we observe as far as inventory in the channel to make sure that that doesn't increase and come at the expense of future growth. So when we looked at the channel inventory at the end of Q1, it was very consistent, in fact, it was down a few days more we've been a year ago.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Rick Schafer from Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.
Rick Schafer: Thanks and congrats on another nice quarter, guys. So your auto business maybe my first question, your auto business has been doubling annually I guess the last few years. I think it was up close to [50%] [ph]. I think you highlighted Bernie in your remarks this past quarter. Can you talk about the growth expectation for 2018 as much as you much color as you can give there? And maybe provide some color on what's driving that growth? I mean it seems like ADAS becoming a bigger incremental driver. So as mix kind of maybe favors ADAS going forward. Can you talk about what that does to maybe gross margin in that segment?
Bernie Blegen: Sure. When we look at automotive right now we are certainly benefiting from significant growth, but still we represent such a small portion of what the total available market is to us. So a lot of what we're seeing right now is been any gains in infotainment and then we've also seen some gains in body controls and also in certain of the networking applications. And we look forward to opportunities in ADAS In particular, although I don't think that those will be of a material nature to us until for another couple of years.
Rick Schafer: Got it, thanks. Second question, 12 volt to 48 volt transition that's sort of already underway in auto. Can you talk about that opportunity as it relates to GPU and CPU core power? Is that something else that we should think about as being sort of a couple years from now but before it's really a growth driver? And who do you expect to compete with there? Who do you see also going after the 48 volt market for CPU, GPU?
Michael Hsing: I think a 48 volts market is an inevitable and as CPU or GPU power increases that's the only way to get the current down, to get the efficiency up and thing is that it's all, well none of the our competitors they are publishing papers, but we have solutions now.
Rick Schafer: And Michael any key competitors you see there. I mean it would be the sort of the TIs and the Infineons of the world or who would it be do you think at 48 volt?
Michael Hsing: I don't think, we don't have a see a real solution out there, okay other than existing 48 volts, and 48 volts which is a very expensive as far as I know. And I think we are first few companies, first company that has our own solution as semiconductor players.
Rick Schafer: Got it and then if I could sneak one last question and just maybe a quick update on your 300 millimeter design efforts and I don't know how to frame that I mean any expectation or what your expectations are for 300 millimeter revenue contribution this year? Or is it more of a - I know I'm asking a lot of far out questions I mean is it more of 2019, 2020 kind of thing.
Michael Hsing: And I think it's 2019, 2020 kind of things. And I mean I don't rule out, and at the end of the year we have some small volume productions happening.
Rick Schafer: Michael is it targeting any particular like specific verticals or is it just kind of across your basket of verticals?
Michael Hsing: I think it's across a basket of vertical. Now we with 12 inch and we integrate a lot more features in there and as we talk about a lot of programming capability, a lot of memories and along with the increase of a power density and I think we'll be putting a power solution as MPS name, the Monolithic Power System, we're going to put a sub power systems on a single chip in 12 inch - 12 inches just widen our capability.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from William Stein from SunTrust. Your line is now open.
William Stein: Great, thanks. I'd like to sort of contrast the growth rate it in light of your inventory building the quarter. I mean you've been a rapid growth company for some time. You've accelerated the year-over-year growth in the last couple quarters now, which is great and inventories are increasing. Should we expect that acceleration to continue and to see even higher year-over-year growth rates as we've progress through the year? That's what the inventory build would imply. So it's not a hoping maybe we can reconcile it a little bit. Thank you.
Michael Hsing: Yes, that's a good reading. Okay, I mean of course we're not sayings and okay we're going to accelerating more but the way I certainly anticipated that. Okay, if there's opportunity there.
William Stein: And for investors that sort of looks at this outsize growth rate and recognizes it's pretty unusual, pretty unique in semis. Can you help us maybe review the reasons that you're seeing the design wins maybe from a technology perspective or just from the design wins that you've won recently that you can talk about that would exemplify why you're seeing such rapid growth?
Michael Hsing: Well, it's a - if we're talking about all the design wins and okay we can go for hours. And I frankly I don't even know. I can remember three or four things. Look I mean just-- this is truly a broad-based growth and we're not using our standard product and using our configurable software, we can go into a many different field, that's actually reality, yes, and that's the beauty of it. I can't say which one has a more growth and now you're talking about server, locking and talking about autos, and these are much a very high concentrated market segment that we can talk about it. But a lot of others actually grow more than these areas. So I can't really talk about it in a - in fact, lot of smaller customers using our solution that really excites me. That means okay we're pushing a margin even higher, and we provides the service. Our customers really want that even though we have outrageous margins. So that's kind of things I'm getting excited.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Ross Seymore: Hi, guys. Congrats on the quarter and guide and the comments you said earlier Bernie about the inventory up because you saw opportunities in the second half. I think you said in computing, consumer and automotive. Without going into specific customers and sockets et cetera can you just talk a little bit about the applications into which you're putting those parts to the back half of the year? And just what sort of dollar content penetration, market penetration just some numbers around those to give us a little more color to help investors feel comfortable at the inventory level?
Bernie Blegen: Sure. So when we look at a lot of the growth that we've started to enjoy probably beginning in Q3 of 2017. We were basically introducing new products and new markets for new customers. And the demands of these customers are significant meaning that we didn't want to come out of the gate with our new release, new product releases and not be able to sustain the growth because of being constrained in any way. So I think you recall that last year we invested in bringing up a fourth fab in order to aid capacity. So really this has been pretty consistent, as far as an overarching supply chain management philosophy to position us to be able to achieve as Michael said, should a demand be there, this accelerated rate of revenue growth. And we believe that we have actually targeted so when we look at the inventory levels, they're targeted in some of the highest growth revenue areas. And right now it's also in the quarter pretty well evenly split between raw materials work and process and finished goods meaning that what we've done is have a very balanced approach to how we're making those investments.
Michael Hsing: Yes. Ross you don't have to worry about these inventories, look I mean we increase it and I know this our invest - our investors - some of the investors kind of sensitive okay and I'm a kind of irritated okay. We grow this much and we need it real, a real inventory to back it up and on top of it all these products, a new product, because anything goes wrong we have something to back it up. And also provides with some industrial automotive even computing company, they want inventory, they want okay we are the new players and we guarantee they're supplied. So that's why we're doing it. And so last reason is I don't worry about inventory, our product cycles the last for 10 years and we never - we don't have a problems until have a huge write-off.
Ross Seymore: That is very helpful. My second question and I'm going to try not to irritate you further if that one happened to this might do worse but the guidance on an absolute dollar basis the guidance is great, on year-over-year the guidance is great, sequentially though that's less growth than you guys I mean I have to go back many, many, many years. Is there anything that's changing in the very near term, the bridge between now and the second half growth that's less than normal? Is there something that's changed just with the move to ASC 606 as far as the seasonality? Just trying to figure out or you're just being conservative like you tend to do over time for consistency benefits. Just try to figure out what went into the guidance in those regards.
Bernie Blegen: Sure I can help out with this. So if you look at generally speaking we have a fairly large or pronounced fall-off in revenue between Q4 to Q1. And that didn't occur, so the base that we're starting out with Q1 revenue is much higher than the seasonal norm would normally have provided for. And some of that represented that we had some late deliveries in Q1 that aided our performance in the quarter, but then also creates an issue with the comparable Q2 number. So I would say that we do have a profile to always be able to meet expectations. And in fact do a little bit better and there is a change in seasonality relative to what our historic norm has been with Q1. And none of that is related in any way to the 606 the new revenue recognition standard.
Michael Hsing: Yes, well, I think Ross you cover us as things the IPO right. And you see that seasonality change and from a consumer centric to broad-based announcing okay. And last year, we see a four quarters consecutive growth. That's the first time I think a first time ever in 2006. That was the last time so this is the second time. And I think at this time is a really changed from - or the business change. And that's a less irritated question.
Ross Seymore: Oh, I am glad I didn't annoy too terribly, so congrats again guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Tore Svanberg from Stifel. Your line is now open.
Tore Svanberg: Yes, thank you and congratulations on the consistency. First question could you update us on ecommerce and your programmable products or is that business model starting to contribute to revenue yet or is that still more of a second half event?
Michael Hsing: Well, I think our web e-commerce website is up and I think that's the only the first step and regarding to revenue, no, okay and but the business model it's more - the more I visit customers, these are smaller customers and the more I really excited. I think of this is a we were hitting flashing point, sometimes this year or next year, as we provide a more color - now it's the time provide more content, working with full on the website. How we serve to all these, time to - very quick time-to-market product or underserved customers. And the business models are truly really believe more and more I believe when I visit those smaller customers. And I see a lot more opportunity and now we have a delivered more content. We have the website but although the programming portion is still not there yet, but as we - as I talk about we hand them a floppy disk, they can program it on their own now.
Tore Svanberg: That's really helpful and on that same topic and as that business models start to materialize. I mean wouldn't that mean that inventory days will be higher anyway just because these are programmable parts.
Michael Hsing: I haven't really thought about this or probably because we have a third-party product and as our part of our solutions okay. And so that probably will be a higher inventory in the futures.
Bernie Blegen: And sorry part of the benefit of being able to go to the 12 inch wafer is that we can have larger production runs and get better cost economics that certainly benefit this mass customization market.
Tore Svanberg: Okay, great and I had a follow-up question on the on the 48 volt. So are you going to be BCBHV process for that or is it something else?
Michael Hsing: No, that's correct. And we have a very efficient solutions and I think as a lot of people seen it and we're presenting a papers. We have a real we have a real product now okay. And these are - this product family is a very cost effective, and I think as a 48 volt we're really betting on it, that's our future.
Tore Svanberg: Okay, very good, just one last question. I know there have been some talks in the industry about shortages especially for raw wafers. Is that something that you're seeing and have you secured enough capacity there for your growth going forward?
Michael Hsing: We don't have a shortage and we don't have a shortage. In last year we expand a fab and that this year we expand fab again. And we don't see shortages okay. We have a lot of inventory. So, no. we don't have a shortage issues. And two other ones I heard a lot of stories okay out there. I can't confirm.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Caso from Raymond James. Your line is now open.
Chris Caso: Yes, thank you, good evening. Just a another question following on to the seasonality question and is there anything in particularly we should be thinking about seasonality with respect to individual segments embedded in the Q guidance was automotive and computing carrying much of the sequential growth in Q1? Does that continue into Q2 or do you see a bit more broad-based revenue growth as you go in Q2?
Michael Hsing: I can give you something as well. See it again in what I believe the business that we focus on a very long term and in a very broad-based and these are designing activities. And I have designing activities turn into a revenue takes about three or four years. And we see all these activities and we see all these activity turning to our revenues. And I think from now on we will have a very consistent growth. And that's really what we want to see it in a steady state, in a growth - maybe steady to have a bad connotation, somebody going to pick up okay we're slowing down, we're not okay. So I think as a consistent is the key. And from next couple of quarters and we don't see it much of a difference from last year I guess yes.
Bernie Blegen: I mean one of the things that we work to do is even though we're on a high growth relative to our industry is we want to be predictable. And I don't think there's anything boring about that.
Chris Caso: Well as follow-on to that given that what appears to be strong industry conditions, strong revenues for you guys. To what extent are you able to be somewhat selective in the business that that you take from a quarter-to-quarter basis? That I'm sure that there's some margin discrepancies up among some of the things that you sell given the business conditions right now are you able to be a little bit more selective in that business? And if so, what's does that mean?
Bernie Blegen: One of the things that we benefited from is we've seen this shift in our business mix is that there's longer lead times and so as a result of that we're able to have very consistent 10 to 20 basis points improvement in our gross margin quarter-over-quarter and what that allows us to do is find the mix that allows us to accelerate our rate of revenue growth. So it's really having that visibility in that lead time that allows us to be able to manage the business in this manner.
Chris Caso: Great. If I just one quick follow on in computing, Intel made some changes to the roadmap on 10 nanometer pushing, some of that out I know that you guys have had some design wins on that. Is any material effect on your business going forward?
Bernie Blegen: No. We are - we keep an eye on what Intel is doing but as far as a delay and a release or a change in their roadmap, it does not - is not going to impact us.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is from David Wong from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
David Wong: Thanks very much. Michael can you run through some of the R&D projects currently underway that you're most excited about?
Michael Hsing: Oh, it's of emotions and I just visit a couple of customers when I came in these are really need our help and they will glad to see us okay. These are from what do you call it the mill the packaging sorter to warehouse management, to massage chairs, to a hospital bed okay and they have a different kind of a design and each design take them half year or three months to half year. And we can't go in there with our standard product, standard module, and sometimes they want to buy us - our bio modules and we buy from a third party. We produce several standard product and we use a program to change it either significantly change our business. We sell in instead of a few dollars a chip now we sell $20-$30 module now. And our customers or those customers really want this product. And so they do not have to go through a design. So that's kind of thing to get me excited.
Bernie Blegen: I think just to add to that sort of two things that all of our R&D is focused on right now is really the ease of use, and that we're really focused on selling our customers solutions as opposed to just an individual IC.
David Wong: Okay, great and our one thing just confirmed Bernie I think last earnings call you talked-- you said that adoption of ASC 606 has negligible revenue recognition impact on Q1 revenues and that's still true going into the next quarter. Is that correct?
Bernie Blegen: That is correct.
Michael Hsing: We just sell two modules right. We never have sell-through models.
Bernie Blegen: Yes. We only --our business we had very a small portion of it that was on sell-through.
Michael Hsing: Since the beginning of the company inception, company will always build sell-through models.
Bernie Blegen: Correct.
Michael Hsing: You buy a product, you owned it. We don't have -
Operator: Thank you. At this time, I'm showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Bernie Blegen, Chief Financial Officer for closing remarks.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Monolithic Power Systems Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-answer-session and instructions will be provided at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. Now I would like to turn the conference over to Monolithic's, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Bernie Blegen. Please go ahead.
Bernie Blegen: Thank you very much. Good afternoon and welcome to the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017 Monolithic Power Systems conference call. Michael Hsing, CEO and founder of MPS is with me on today's call. In the course of today's conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risks and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management's current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor Statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q4 earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on March 1, 2017 and Form 10-Q filed on November 6, 2017 both of which are accessible through our website, www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today's call. We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, R&D and SG&A expense, operating income, interest and other income, pre-tax income, net income and earnings on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table of that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the Q1 through Q4 releases for both 2016 and 2017, as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our website. I'd also like to remind you that today's conference call is being webcast live over the Internet, and will be available for replay on our website for one year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. Continuing with our now five year trend, we are pleased to announce 2017 with another record year for revenue. Full year revenue of $470.9 million was up 21.2% from 2016. The year-over-year growth was nearly double that of the analog semiconductor industry, which SIA estimates grew 10.9% over the prior year. Looking at our 2017 over 2016, revenue growth by market segments, automotive revenue up 58.7%, computing and storage up 25.1%, consumer up 23.4% and industrial revenue up 12.9%, communications revenue essentially flat between years. Let me speak to highlights by market segment. Full year automotive revenue grew $19.9 million to $53.9 million in 2017. This growth primarily represented increased sales of infotainment, safety and connectivity application products. Automotive is MPS's largest SAM opportunity at $6 billion, and we are in the early stages of penetrating this market. In the years ahead, we plan to offer a number of new products will application in infotainment, body controls, lighting, EV batteries and Ados. Automotive revenue represented 11.4% of MPS's full year 2017 revenue compared with 8.7% for 2016. Compute and storage revenue grew $20.2 million to $100.8 million in 2017. This growth reflected strong sales growth for cloud computing, SSD storage and high-end notebooks. Compute and storage revenue represented 21.4% of MPS's total revenue in 2017. Consumer revenue grew $36.0 million to $189.8 million in 2017. This growth reflected games in gaming and high-value consumer markets, including home appliances and battery management systems. Consumer revenue represented 40.3% of MPS's full year 2017 revenue. Industrial revenue grew $7.2 million to $62.9 million in 2017. This growth reflected sales for applications and power sources, point of sales system and industrial meters. Industrial revenue represented 13.4% of MPS's full year 2017 revenue. Turning back to our overall financial performance. On a GAAP basis, full year 2017 gross margin of 54.8% expanded 50 basis points from the prior year. GAAP pre-tax income grew 44.8% over 2016 to $82.9 million. On a per share basis, GAAP net earnings of $1.50 were 19% higher in 2016. The enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 resulted in a one-time GAAP tax expense of $13.5 million or $0.31 per share. This new tax legislation also allows MPS to repatriate foreign sourced earnings. The one-time charge increased our 2017 tax rate from 5.1% to 21.4%. On a non-GAAP basis, full year gross margin of 55.6% expanded 40 basis points from the prior year. Non-GAAP pretax income of $137.9 million grew 32.4% over 2016. MPS achieved record full year non-GAAP earnings of $2.93 per share, which was 27.4% higher than 2016. Switching to Q4. MPS had a record fourth quarter with revenue of $129.4 million, 24.9% higher than the comparable quarter in 2016 and slightly higher than revenue generated in the prior quarter. Looking at our 2017 over 2016 fourth quarter revenue growth by market segment, automotive up 57.7%, consumer up 44.6%, compute and storage up 14.0% and industrial up 6.7%. Fourth quarter revenue for the communication segment fell 7.0% from the prior-year period. Fourth quarter GAAP gross margin was 55.0%, matching the prior quarter of 2017 and 50 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2016. Our GAAP pre-tax income was $26.7 million compared to the $25.1 million reported in the prior quarter of 2017 and $18.4 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2016. For the fourth quarter of 2017, non-GAAP gross margin was 55.7%, matching the prior quarter of 2017 and 30 basis points higher than the fourth quarter from a year ago. Our non-GAAP pre-tax income was $39.2 million compared to the $39.5 million reported in the prior quarter and the $29.7 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2016. Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $46.1 million in the fourth quarter compared with $47.0 million in the third quarter of 2017. On a non-GAAP basis, fourth quarter 2017 operating expenses were $33.9 million, $1 million up from the $32.9 million expense in the third quarter, primarily reflecting, an increase in R&D, new product spending. Fourth quarter 2017 operating expenses were up $5.5 million from the $28.4 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2016. From both and the GAAP and a non-GAAP basis, fourth quarter litigation expenses were $340,000. The difference between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarter discussed here are stock compensation expenses and expenses from an unfunded deferred compensation plan. Stock comp expense was $11.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with $14.0 million in the prior quarter of 2017 and $10.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Switching to the bottom line. Q4 GAAP net income was $12.1 million or $0.27 per fully diluted share compared with $0.54 per share in the previous quarter of 2017 and $0.39 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016. The current quarter GAAP results included the one-time expense of $13.5 million or $0.31 per fully diluted share resulting from the newly passed tax legislation. Q4 non-GAAP net income was $36.3 million or $0.82 per fully diluted share compared with $0.84 per share in the previous quarter of 2017 and $0.65 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016. Now let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $304.3 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017, $620,000 less than the prior quarter of 2017. For Q4 2017 operating cash flow was $53.4 million, and for the full year 2017, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $133.8 million. Cash proceeds from employee's stock option exercises and the ESPP were $20,000 in Q4 and $2.9 million for all of 2017. Q4 2017 capital equipment purchases were $40.7 million, and for the full year, were $65.8 million. Dividend payments were $8.7 million for the quarter and $33.9 million for the year. Fourth quarter accounts receivable was $38.0 million or 27 days of sales outstanding, which was lower than the 36 days we reported at the end of the prior quarter of 2017. This decrease was due to a higher proportion of the quarter sales being recorded in the first two months of Q4 compared with the prior quarter. Fourth quarter of 2017 day sales outstanding were three days lower than the 30 days in the fourth quarter of 2016. Our internal inventories at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017 were $99.3 million, down slightly from the $99.9 million at the end of the prior quarter. Days of inventory decreased from - to 155 days at the end of Q4 from 156 days at the end of Q3 2017. I would now like to turn to our outlook. First and foremost, MPS is announcing a 50% increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.20 per share to $0.30 per share for shareholders of record as of March 30, 2018. During the next year, MPS will look for future opportunities return value to our shareholders. As of January 1, 2018, MPS adopted ASC 606. This new accounting standard, which modifies the revenue recognition role will have a minimal impact on our Q1 revenue. Looking at Q1, we are forecasting revenue in the range of $122 million to $128 million. We also expect the following, GAAP gross margin in the range of 54.8% to 55.8%; non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.3% to 56. 3%; total stock-based compensation expense of $13.9 million to $15.9 million, including approximately $400,000 that will be charged to cost of goods sold; litigation expenses of $250,000 to $350,000; non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to be in the range of $32.1 million to 35.1% million. This estimate excludes stock compensation and litigation expenses. Other income of $600,000 to $700,000 before foreign exchange gains or losses. Fully diluted shares to be in the range of 43.9 to 44.9 million shares. Our tax rate for 2018 is expected to be between 5% and 10% on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. In conclusion, we continue to grow and continue to enhance shareholder value. I'll now open the microphone for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company. Your line is open.
Quinn Bolton: Hi, Michael, hi, Bernie. Congratulations on another record and nice to see the 50% increase in dividend. Michael and Bernie just a couple of questions. First on the compute business quarter-on-quarter, looks like it was down sequentially despite the ramp of Purley. I wonder if could give us an update on the Purley ramp and superpower management for you guys? And then, Bernie, it looks like CapEx was up significant in the fourth quarter, can you give a little bit of detail on what you were spending that CapEx on?
Bernie Blegen: Sure. Let me start up with your first question as far as what we're observing in computing and storage in the Q3 to Q4. So interestingly, we had a very good continuation of growth in our cloud computing, which is supposed to be associated with the server business, and that was offset by declines in both the storage and notebook. So I think that - versus our expectation internally as far as what the opportunity for servers are, we are tracking at or in fact, a little bit ahead of what we expected to be. And the business that we'll had to date has been primarily in some of the lower dollar categories, and we expect to see are in telophase our QSMod side of the business, which is higher dollars to pick up early in 2018. With regard to the cap spending, we've made some purchases of office space in the quarter, and we picked up two offices, one for $25 million and the other for $15 million. And believe that this is a good way to secure capacity at a fixed price that will benefit the - accretive to earnings over the years to come.
Quinn Bolton: Great. And then Maybe just one sort of forward-looking question, as you look into 2018, could you size or maybe rank quarter for us, what you see is perhaps some of the biggest incremental revenue drivers heading into this year?
Bernie Blegen: Sure. I'm going to address it on a percentage basis. And so the dollars maybe a little bit different. But automotive, as I've been saying in the recent past is expected to grow in any quarter-over-quarter between 30% to 60%. And that was consistent the experience that we had in 2017. So that - the design wins and the visibility that we have in the long-term, we believe that for 2018 and 2019 and 2020, automotive…
Michael Hsing: The growth on each market segment, if you look at our last two or three years, and you looking forward in our K [ph] that's just plus or minus fewer percentage on the each market segments. And the trend will be very similar. 2018 and 2019, 2020 that we see as a pretty much all set. The percentage is just only a few percentage change.
Quinn Bolton: Understood. Great. Thank you.
Bernie Blegen: Thank you, Quinn.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from William Stein with SunTrust. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, guys. This is John for Will. Thanks for taking my question. Nice quarter. I'm just wondering if you guys had an update on web based e-commerce analog for the masses project.
Michael Hsing: Well, I see it's - it's delayed again. I promised it in January, it didn't happen. I think that we rather have a very good user experience to launch it first. And rather than - and a mediocre one. And so I made a very hard decision not to do it and not to launch it. And you will see the probably in a - now I don't have a creditability on that. I postponed it several times already, and like I promised, I postponed it several times, and hopefully it will be in Q2.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And thank for that.
Bernie Blegen: Just to add to that. I think Michael has a lot of credibility typically when you look at the results we turned in that 2017 and going forward. And that secondary point is -
Michael Hsing: Well, this is one area I buck it up.
Bernie Blegen: We will manage that in the transcript. The expectations set as far as zero revenue generation as a result of e-commerce in 2018 and 2019. So to the extent that we have a successful launch and we're able to incorporate customer feedback into making quick adaptations of that platform, I think it's time well spend.
Unidentified Analyst: Very helpful.
Michael Hsing: But on the other bucket, I do emphasize that's the direction we're really going.
Unidentified Analyst: Yeah.
Michael Hsing: And that doesn't - the delay doesn't cause any doubt. And as a matter of fact, all the testings that can be without the website, it's doing really, really well. And we in the last few months, every months we increase 600, 700 customers, and those customers whenever low off even.
Michael Hsing: No marketing just coming over and trying some.
Bernie Blegen: That's right. Yeah. So the train - even I can't imagine with our own website and these acquired - acquired customers from our distributors and from other sites. And I can't imagine from our own site, the marketing all other effort we will put it in and it will be a phenomenal growth.
Unidentified Analyst: It's really helpful detail. Thank you. Just as a follow-up, if you could give you any update on customer order patterns, are you getting any sense for double ordering given the strength of the revenue growth?
Bernie Blegen: Yes, it's a concern that we had going into Q4 because we had very high level of backlog compared to what historical norms have been. And going into Q1 that has remained also on high side and what we're very conscience of is that we don't want to either participate in double ordering, or where we're selling demand with inventories just going to sit in the channel, excuse me. And as a result, we've been very cautious as far as meeting customer demands that we believe in excess of what they need to keep-up - keep their facilities going. So in the end of Q4, I think we did a very good job because we were able to generate the revenue we did and that increase the days in the channel.
Unidentified Analyst: Very helpful. Thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Jeriel Ong: Thanks for letting me ask question. This is Jeriel Ong on behalf of Ross. So just wondering to get some clarity on the tax rate, so it appears the semi industry you reported so far that presently pay a higher tax than you, and you reported an increase in their tax - ongoing tax rate going forward. So with your 7.5% rate, it appears you guys are guiding to a rate that flat, I assume on an ongoing basis. Could you walk me how you guys derived with your tax guidance?
Michael Hsing: Well, you look at our outlook and thanks for our last year effort, we bought a lot of buildings. These are tax free.
Bernie Blegen: So let me try and clarify that. So there are two components to the tax, the transition of the toll tax, which we recorded in Q4. That's what Michel is referring to. Because we've invested in a lot of property, we actually had a lower blended tax rate that we had to pay there. Going forward, as far as how we can guide to the 5% to 10% rate, there is a step up as far as the guilty [ph] tax, but we have some discrete items that can offset that. And so as a result, for 2018, we won't see a change in our tax rate from what we reported in the current year.
Jeriel Ong: Got it. That's really helpful. And I think next question I guess, switching over to automotive, it was really strong in 4Q and strong in 2017 in general, north of 50% growth rate, what's driving the strength from like a various infotainment or lighting, et cetera perspective? And staying at this rate in 2018?
Michael Hsing: Yes, it's fair that the growth rate it will not changes much. Okay, but don't follow me them exactly what the rate. It would be very similar to this year. Which applications or which segments, I think in the next couple of years we're going to expand lot more segments. Now the lighting, infotainment and the safeties, and we will have a lot more safety products come out. And as Bernie said in his script, we have an ADAS and also the…
Bernie Blegen: Battery.
Michael Hsing: Battery management, as well as the connectivity.
Jeriel Ong: Yeah.
Michael Hsing: And those areas have a very little revenue or some of the item have no revenue, only sampling cut. And we expect to have a very high percentage growth in dollar amount growth that in 2019, '20 and '21.
Bernie Blegen: And one more point is that, we've getting good penetration in all the major geographies known for automotive.
Jeriel Ong: All right. If I could squeeze one last one, just clarity on the CapEx spend. You mentioned it was office space, so is this more capacity to manufacture goods or is this some office space for workers. I'm trying to …
Bernie Blegen: Well, I think it's everything. Everything so for the factories [ph] and for engineering facility, for automotive, quality control systems and everything.
Michael Hsing: And down the road software as well. Software design.
Bernie Blegen: Yeah.
Jeriel Ong: All right. Thank you.
Bernie Blegen: Thank you.
Michael Hsing: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel, Nicolaus. Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. This is actually Jerome calling in for Tore. Let me add my congratulations again to you, another great quarter. Just want to follow-up briefly on the automotive segment. You mentioned connectivity. Can you give us a little bit more detail on what this piece is, is it USB tech stuff or is it serial [ph] tech stuff?
Bernie Blegen: Michael, Connectivity?
Michael Hsing: On the automotive?
Bernie Blegen: Yes.
Michael Hsing: Could you repeat the question. I was looking at people.
Unidentified Analyst: Just wanted a little bit more incentive what the connectivity portion of this business was related to?
Michael Hsing: Yes, okay, sorry, I've been in the [indiscernible] I wasn't paying attention. The connectivity for the car and lot of ADAS and a lot of safety things and safety cameras such as the cameras, the LIDARs [ph] and these will be connected to the cloud. And those are the areas we really focused on it. And those are our customers' requirements.
Unidentified Analyst: So it's more of a card to you - infrastructure cloud connectivity versus in car connectivity system?
Michael Hsing: Actually both. In the connectivity between the - all these sensors to the control units, and the control units to the cloud and these all add up to all this self-learning capability. And that's the area we are really focused on it and that's where we receive huge requirements and for joint development with these larger automotive companies.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. That's very helpful. Second question, in terms of your industrial market, can you give us an update in terms how E Motion is doing and how you are penetrating that and also with medical?
Michael Hsing: Yes, emotion, it's not emotion - E Motion product line in the past and other - a lot of people asked me, okay, the product didn't do well and actually it's doing really well. This year, we will generate somewhere between $8 million to $12 million business. And we develop at the newer product the integrated - fully integrated…
Bernie Blegen: Modules.
Michael Hsing: The modules and we receive how many request, it's beyond my belief actually. And those will do well in the 2018 and 2019 particularly.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. And just one question more on the longer-term on the outlook, you've done obviously very well using - leveraging your DC/DC process, expanding to multi markets and applications. And as you look out three to five-plus years, can you still - there is something you can still ride or do you intend to invest in may be adjacent processes - there something could be new?
Michael Hsing: Well, that's a good question. As we said, in the last conference call, we will move - we started the two 12-inch wafer fab. So we migrate from a 6-inch, 8-inch, now the 12-inch. And on the each upgrade, we add a lot more new features. And so you can think about it, okay, now we can integrate microcontrollers and is not inconceivable, we even put a Wi-Fi system on it.
Unidentified Analyst: Very good. Thank you very much for this insight.
Operator: Thank you. We do have a follow-up question from William Stein with SunTrust. Your line is now open.
William Stein: Thanks for letting me ask follow-up guys. Just on 2018, given that you are guiding for 25% growth in Q1, and given like the multiple growth drivers you have coming on Purley gaming, notebooks, is there any reason we shouldn't think that calendar '18 can grow in the low 20% range year-over-year?
Bernie Blegen: We don't offer a specific guidance for - beyond one quarter. But the way I can respond to it is that we've been promoting our strategic business model now for about last four years. If you look at 2017, we had revenue growth of 20%, which map 21% which was little better than our model. We had gross margin increased at 40 basis points for the full year, which is consistent with our margin - with our model. And our operating expenses came in between 50% and 60% of what our revenue growth was. And I think what we've done is, we've achieved the model and expect to continue along that line. The one thing that will offer just some concern is that there are risk factors associated with introducing new products to new customers and particularly, in what is becoming a sort of a more clouded longer-term outlook as far as what the economy is going to do. So we've tend to believe that we're capable of achieving our model, but I add just cautionary note that there are risk factors and say you might build in little bit of cushion when looking at full year outlook might be.
William Stein: Got it. Understood.
Michael Hsing: Let me comment on your question. Okay. In early 2005, 2006, and again we had a model like a got 20% to 30%, and we never achieved that. We achieved close to 18%, 19% in between 15% to 20%. And I was very criticized by that - some of the shareholders, and I spend too much money and not grow enough. Okay. I can't figure out 20% or not 20%. In 2006 - 2016 in the first quarter, I made an announcement, or some people asked me, if we're going to achieve the models. I said that okay, it will be 2017, and we did it okay. Now since you ask for this year again, I think as a - I can't predict in a couple of percentage difference. But we will grow double or triple than the industrial growth. If the industrial growth negative 5%, okay, we'll be three times - okay, well, we grow from somewhere 10% to 15% range.
Bernie Blegen: Yeah. And that's if the industry grows 5%, that we will grow 10% to 15%.
Michael Hsing: Yeah.
William Stein: Yeah. I got it. Thank you.
Michael Hsing: Yeah.
William Stein: And just a housekeeping question, are you guys having an Analyst Day this year?
Bernie Blegen: We are planning on it. But we haven't announced a date yet.
Michael Hsing: We will plan in to it - and because our website stuck up, so, okay, we delayed it.
William Stein: Okay. Thanks very much guys.
Operator: Thank you. We have another question from John Vinh with KeyBanc Capital. You're now - line is now open.
John Vinh: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Hey, Bernie, last year you came in at the high end of kind of OpEx as a percentage of sales growth. I think at the - high-end of the 60% range. What's your sense in terms of how we should be thinking about OpEx growth this year as a percentage of sales? You've got to 50% to 60% model, could we get a little bit more leverage and be at the lower end of the range or how should we be thinking about that?
Bernie Blegen: When I say the 50% to 60% range, that's really focused on R&D and SG&A, and does not include litigation, which can be a little hard to manage. So for 2017, my calculations show this for the full year being at 58% of our revenue growth rate. When you look ahead here, I think we've got three drivers that we're going to invest in. Automotive in particular, we want to continue to fuel that revenue growth through sales and marketing as well as a QA and some - also some R&D specific to it the. On top of that, Michael also mentioned to you, as far as our investment in 12-inch fabs, that's going to be continuing for about five to six quarters beginning in Q2 - beginning in earnest in Q2. And then finally, with the launch of the website in the e-commerce platform, we are going to make a big investment in marketing to be able to really launch that successfully and get the word out. So I think that in that - and I don't have a firm number yet, but we want to be able to strike and make these investments and that will put us, at a minimum, at the high end of that range.
Michael Hsing: Yeah. But Bernie is talking about lot of investment. Okay. But if you look in our history, we never had a wide spending…
Bernie Blegen: Yeah.
Michael Hsing: And we will - if we spend, we'll spend a couple of more percent. That's - that will be it. And we don't have a wide - open pocket spending bracket, will never happen in the entire MPS history. And - so there's 50% - 60% to 61%, 62%, so that's probably - I don't see we go beyond that.
John Vinh: Yeah. Great. And then my follow-up is just on growth question. I know you guys are trying to avoid guiding specific - to a specific number 2018 again, but if I think about the computing segment, you've got kind of uplift, higher ASPs in QSMod and then you get the full year's benefit of the Purley ramp. And then on consumer you've got obviously the full benefit of a full year's worth of a gaming consoles ramp or you've kind of increased your market shares. Is there any reason to think that the growth rates of these two segments could be positively bias, slightly higher in 2018 versus 2017?
Bernie Blegen: I think Michael did a good job responding to that, saying that if you look at the growth profile of 2017 and plus or minus a couple of percentage points off of what we enjoyed there, that's pretty much what we're expecting for '18 as well.
Michael Hsing: Well, it's a gaming, and I can't openly fit it. It's not my favorite topic. And it goes up by a quarter a lot, and then next couple of quarters it comes down again. And I want to manage a very, very smooth growth and that can - and sustainable growth. And so since you mention of for gaming, of course, there is a lot of dollars to be made. And these are very opportunistic. So that's why we have a few percentage variations.
Bernie Blegen: But on the gaming, and I think it's very important to offer that we're fully committed to the gaming platforms, and but there are limited opportunities for growth. And so we have to be able to make sure that the market understands that we are positioned for the long term there, and to be able to enjoy the benefits of future design wins to help accelerate that growth.
John Vinh: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Wong with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Amit Chandra: Yes. Hi. This is Amit Chandra dialing in for David. Thanks for me letting me ask a question. Bernie, for the December quarter, could you share with us what percentage of your cash flows are onshore versus offshore? And should we expect the majority of offshore cash to be brought back to the U.S. post tax reform? And what are your priorities for uses of cash in 2018?
Bernie Blegen: So at the end of the year, we had about 40% of our cash is onshore, 60% was offshore. We are continuing to evaluate what the impact of the new tax reform means for us. We took an initial step by increasing the dividend this quarter, and we're going to use the remainder of this year to consider other opportunities where we increase shareholder value even through dividends or acquisitions or perhaps even a stock buyback. But right now, we haven't firmed up any specific plans around that.
Amit Chandra: Okay. Great. And then as a follow-up, in your high end notebook business can you maybe talk about the product cycles that you expect better upcoming in 2018 to drive that business higher?
Bernie Blegen: Yeah, I'd say that the notebook business, a lot of that has to do with customer adoption. And we have a couple of very good prospects that we've been designed with. And we're looking at various scenarios as far as what the timing and the unit volumes could be. One of the things that you may be aware of is that Cannon Lake was cancelled and the next opportunity for a new design will be, I believe it's called Whiskey Lake, which is supposed to be in mid 2019. So I think we feel very, very well positioned there. We have very good new adoptions that are occurring right now, but that the product cycle from Intel got moved out by a year.
Michael Hsing: Well, since you mentioned, notebook is not my favorite either. And these are kind of low-margin but the way Bernie emphasize high value notebook. And those are generally their sales are retailing price like $1200 or $1300 and above. And some of the models they pay it. And so they appreciate our technology, as those are product that we deliver…
Bernie Blegen: That we want to go after.
Michael Hsing: Yes.
Amit Chandra: Okay. And then one final one for me, for your E-Fuse opportunities, can you talk about that in 2018?
Bernie Blegen: Sure. E-Fuse tends to be lower dollar content, but what they been very helpful for us is being able to open the door for opportunities that we haven't else wise had.
Michael Hsing: Are you talking about server area or talking about all the area?
Bernie Blegen: Broadly.
Amit Chandra: Yes, broadly speaking.
Michael Hsing: The server area is - the MPS become a single source and adoption in some very large customers. And our product now is realized - just start to realize by all the large first tier makers. And those are not small lower dollar, very high margin and what we are more excited about in all. And the trend is to replace the blowup fuse and use an electronic fuse, so that's where the MPS opportunity lies.
Bernie Blegen: There is also an opportunity in the communications network as well. And that should start to roll out here at the end of 2018.
Amit Chandra: Okay, great. Thank you very much, gentlemen. Appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. I show no further questions in queue. So I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Blegen for closing remarks.
Bernie Blegen: Thank you very much. So thank you for joining us on the conference call. And I look forward to talking to you again during our first quarter conference call, which is likely to be at the end of April. Thank you, and have nice day.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you very much for your participation. You may all disconnect. Have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Monolithic Power Systems Inc. Q3 2017 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions]. And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce Mr. Bernie Blegen. Sir, you may begin.
Bernie Blegen: Thank you very much. Good afternoon and welcome to the third quarter 2017 Monolithic Power Systems conference call. In the course of today's conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risks and uncertainty which could cause results to differ materially from management's current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q3 earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on March 1, 2017 and Form 10-Q filed on July 31, 2017, both of which are accessible through our website, www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today's call. We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, R&D and SG&A expense, operating income, interest and other income, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and on a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the Q3 2016, Q2 2017 and Q3 2017 earnings releases as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our website. I would also like to remind you that today's conference call is being webcast live over the Internet and will be available for replay on our website for one year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. This was a record quarter for MPS with revenue of $128.9 million, up 14.9% from the previous record set in Q2 of this year and up 21.1% from the comparable quarter in 2016. In addition to the continued strong sales momentum in cloud computing and automotive, this quarter's results included the first full quarter of revenue from our power management solutions for gaming consoles. Looking at revenue by end market. Revenue from consumer markets increased 26.8% over the third quarter of 2016 to $55.3 million. The year-over-year revenue increase reflected sales gains in high-end consumer applications. Consumer revenue accounted for 42.9% of our total Q3 revenue compared with 41.0% in the prior year. Third quarter automotive revenue of $12.9 million grew 48.8% over the same period of 2016 as a result of increased sales of infotainment, safety and connectivity application products. Automotive is MPS' largest SAM opportunity at $6 billion and we are in the early stages of penetrating this market. In the years ahead, we plan to offer a number of new products for applications in body controls, lighting, infotainment and ADAS. Automotive revenue was 10.0% of MPS' total Q3 2017 revenue compared with 8.1% for Q3 2016. In our computing and storage market, revenue of $29.0 million increased $5.6 million or 23.7% year-over-year, reflecting strong sales growth for cloud computing. MPS has experienced a significant increase in product sales reflecting both new design wins and increased dollar content. Computing and storage revenue represented 22.5% of MPS' third quarter 2017 revenue compared with 22.0% in Q3 2016. Third quarter 2017 industrial revenue of $16.3 million increased 12.6% from the third quarter of 2016, primarily due to increased sales for AC/DC power applications. This market represented 12.7% of our total third quarter revenue versus 13.6% for the prior year. GAAP gross margin was 55.0%, 30 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2017 and 60 basis points higher than the third quarter of 2016. Our GAAP operating income was $23.8 million compared to $15.0 million reported in the second quarter of 2017 and $15.0 million reported in the third quarter of 2016. For the third quarter of 2017, non-GAAP gross margin was 55.7%, 10 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2017 and 40 basis points higher than the third quarter of 2016. Our non-GAAP operating income was $38.9 million compared to $31.2 million reported in the prior quarter and $29.4 million reported in the third quarter of 2016. Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $47.0 million in the third quarter compared with $46.5 million in the second quarter of 2017 and $42.9 million in the third quarter of 2016. Our non-GAAP third quarter 2017 operating expenses were $32.9 million, up from the $31.2 million we spent in the second quarter of 2017 and up from the $29.4 million reported in the third quarter of 2016. The year-over-year increase in operating expenses primarily reflects investment in new product introductions and staff additions in support of targeted sales and marketing efforts. On both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis, third quarter litigation expenses were $327,000 compared with a $290,000 expense in Q2 2017 and a $55,000 expense in Q3 of 2016. The differences between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are stock compensation expense and income or loss from an unfunded deferred compensation plan. Total stock compensation expense, including $453,000 charged to cost of goods sold for the third quarter of 2017 was $14.0 million compared with $15.1 million recorded in the second quarter of 2017. Switching to the bottomline. Third quarter 2017 GAAP net income was $23.6 million or $0.54 per fully diluted share compared with $0.35 per share in the second quarter of 2017 and $0.34 per share in the third quarter of 2016. Q3 non-GAAP net income was $36.6 million or $0.84 per fully diluted share compared with $0.68 per share in the second quarter of 2017 and $0.66 per share in the third quarter of 2016. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q3 2017 were 43.5 million. Now let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $305.0 million at the end of the third quarter of 2017 compared to $283.0 million at the end of the second quarter of 2017. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $33.7 million compared to Q2 2017 operating cash flow of $24.9 million. Third quarter 2017 capital spending totaled $4.6 million. Accounts receivable ended the third quarter of 2017 at $50.8 million or 36 days of sales outstanding compared with the $42.0 million or 34 days reported at the end of the second quarter of 2017. Days of sales outstandings in the third quarter of 2017 were eight days higher than the 28 days reported in the third quarter of 2016. Our internal inventories at the end of the third quarter of 2017 were $99.9 million, up from the $92.7 million at the end of the second quarter of 2017. Days of inventory decreased to 156 days at the end of Q3 2017 from the 166 days at the end of the second quarter of 2017, but were higher than the 133 days reported at the end of the third quarter of 2016. I would now like to turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2017. We are forecasting Q4 revenue in the range of $123 million to $129 million. We also expect the following: GAAP gross margin in the range of 54.4% to 55.4%, non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.2% to 56.2%, total stock-based compensation expense of $13 million to $15 million including approximately $500,000 that would be charged to cost of goods sold, litigation expenses ranging between $250,000 to $350,000, GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses between $44 million and $48 million, non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to be in the range of $31.5 million to $33.5 million. This estimate excludes stock compensation and litigation expenses. Other income is as expected in the range from $600,000 to $700,000 before foreign exchange gains or losses. Fully diluted shares to be in the range of 43.7 million to 44.7 million shares before any share buyback. In conclusion, thanks to acceptance of our new product offerings and with our shareholder support, we will continue to invest and deliver outstanding products to our customers and consistent results to our shareholders. I will now open the phone lines for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Anil Doradla with William Blair. Your line is now open.
Anil Doradla: Good evening Michael and Bernie and congrats once again. It looks like it's in auto mode and looks pretty exciting. Now a couple of questions. So obviously, you are talking about the data center and some of these design wins, Michael. But can you give us some update on kind of the pipeline of design wins and kind of the opportunity that you have here.
Michael Hsing: We have many of them and some are small, some of them big. Of course, the bigger one now, we don't want to disclose that on the Internet or to anybody. And so overall, I can tell you is everything is doing well. We are doing expected or better than what we expected.
Anil Doradla: And on the e-commerce platform, I know this is something that you guys have been looking at a little bit longer term. But any updates here?
Michael Hsing: On the e-commerce? Well, it's a bigger project and obviously you haven't seen our new website launched yet. But we still expect that at the end of the year. The key is all the contents. And we are working very hard with the limited resources. But it's going to be some time next year. So may be you will see something new.
Bernie Blegen: And again, Anil, here. Just to set expectations is, we are probably most excited as far as developing the new sales and marketing channel through this e-commerce platform, particularly as it relates to our field programmable power modules. But we have wanted to keep expectations at a relative level. So in the initial stages here, we are going to be taking customer feedback as far as their user experience and also how valuable they find the content and then we are going to integrate the website in order to be able to take into account that feedback. And we are really looking for sales to really start to ramp in probably about another two years out. But we do believe that we will be able to go live with this by the end of this year.
Michael Hsing: Well, that's well said. I think the user experience is everything and we don't want to have some things crippled out, just to put it out there. And we go at this very cautiously. And I think to enter this market with the breadth of a product behind it, user experience is everything. But I think we are still pretty much on-time. And next year, you will see a first line of product we put out there and then we gradually loading, put out on the other products. The first line of product that we talk about before is a programmable DC-to-DC converter modules.
Anil Doradla: Great. Congrats once again from my end.
Bernie Blegen: Thank you Anil.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Jerry Li: Hi. This is Jerry Li on, on behalf of Ross Seymore. Thanks for letting us ask a question. Just a few from me and the first one, just want to go into a little more detail about your recently disclosed automotive group. So the year-on-year growth appears to be declining every quarter. And just want to get a sense of, what is the rate that do you think this business could grow over the next two or three years?
Michael Hsing: I think, as Bernie said and we are addressing this, when the current product serve the market, is about $60 billion. So we are at the very, very beginning. So I can't quantify exactly what that number is. But the growth rate will be kind of similar to the current growth rate, maybe okay, over a couple of hundred million dollars or we slow it down a little bit. But I just give you, all these numbers I am just pulling out from my hairs.
Bernie Blegen: Actually, he's got a good head of hair, too.
Michael Hsing: I do have a lot of hair.
Bernie Blegen: So just to add to that, I think that the exciting part for us is that we are able to work across so many different verticals within automotive and certainly across all the different geographies with the different OEMs. So we see this as an opportunity that has legs for growth for the next several years.
Jerry Li: Got it. That makes sense. It's only 10% of your revenues anyway. So you would think that other guys are at 20%. So there's definitely room for growth.
Michael Hsing: I think, yes, well said too. In our other market segments grows pretty consistent speed in the last five or six years. And automotive, it grows slightly faster, but it's start from a very small numbers. And once you get to $100 million to $200 million levels in that and again, I think the growth rate will be very, very similar to the rest of the quarter average.
Bernie Blegen: Yes.
Jerry Li: That makes sense. Thanks so much. Moving onto storage and computing. The segment, at least for the third quarter, it came in slightly below our model. Could you talk about how the Purley ramp is trending and the impact to your company and how long you expect that to last?
Bernie Blegen: Yes. I think that the opportunities for us in the compute and storage are very exciting. And I don't think that you can look at an individual quarter and sort of use that as a milestone for the success of what we are seeing. I think that we were very clear that we have two opportunities that are driving this new growth, particularly in the cloud computing and that has to do with increasing the number of overall design wins. And then also we are adding significant dollar content into the second half of the year sales. So from our perspective, actually the rollout has been almost exactly to plan and the prospects as far as what we see in the next two years seem similarly positive.
Michael Hsing: Well, it's not quite exactly that plain. I think it would delay it a year or two or so. But overall, cloud computing is very similar to automotive business, except we have only a few players in there. And other players are dominant in the market and we are not. We just entered. Our customer just accepted the last couple years, just barely accept our product. And this year, particularly, is really a good year for us. We have a new product introduced to this market segment and we are ahead of everybody else. And now it will give us the next couple years a very good growth.
Jerry Li: Appreciate the responses. Thanks guys.
Michael Hsing: Okay.
Bernie Blegen: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Your line is now open.
Tore Svanberg: Yes. Thank you and I think we are all excited about the growth, but I am actually going to congratulate you on your 30% operating margin. So, well done there.
Michael Hsing: Thank you.
Bernie Blegen: You are the first to notice that. That was why we did it.
Tore Svanberg: Well done. So my first question, Michael, you said that your design win pipeline is better than expected. Could you maybe elaborate a little bit on that? I mean, are you starting to see more customers coming to you? Or is it just because you have been able to introduce more new products?
Michael Hsing: I think in every segment is slightly different. In automotive, we are more recognized and all the top-tier companies we are engaged now with, before we have meetings and now, we engage you on the product level. And they open up for MPS to quoting the new product development, which is for 2019, 2020, 2021 revenue. And in the cloud computing, I think we are ahead of a lot other people. And we introduce the products and meet all the order requirements or exceeded all these requirements and very simple to use. And that attracts the customers open to us in the first tiers and the customers first tiers of server makers now really open up.
Tore Svanberg: That's very helpful. And could you update us a little bit on your new foundry partner? I know you probably don't want to mention who it is, but maybe just give us an update on how that's going? Are you up and running? Is it starting to contribute to revenues yet?
Bernie Blegen: Yes. So I think that you are familiar that we began to invest with this partnership back in late 2015 and early 2016 and through the following 18 months was a period of investment for us. And actually the results have been quite good. We are pleasantly surprised and it comes at a time where certainly there are some concerns in the industry as far as capacity at the moment and we are not experiencing that at all. So I think that as far as the partner, that was very timely as far as when we added them, but also looking at the long term relationship and being able to develop new technologies together, we are very encouraged.
Tore Svanberg: Very good. Just one last question and back to Michael. I know you don't want to talk too much about your process technologies, but you must be working on the next one. And I know, obviously you have been integrating more and more capabilities with that process. So is there anything that you care to share with us as far as what you are working on for the next-generation process?
Michael Hsing: Yes. We are moving on to a 12-inch fab. So that obviously will not be ready for production next year. So we are looking for 2019, 2020, which also these 12-inch trading edge of most of the band circuit, not even talking about most of the bands, CMOS. So we will be keep upgrading our MPS capabilities.
Tore Svanberg: Very good. Thank you very much and congratulations again.
Michael Hsing: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company. Your line is now open.
Quinn Bolton: Hi guys. I will add my congrats on getting back to a 20% growth rate for the first time since, I think, early 2015. Good to see that two-handle. Wanted to ask first, just as I look at automotive business, it looks like you have kind of been hovering in a range of the low $12 million to the higher $12 million per quarter range. So it looks like it's seeing a little bit of a flattening out here on a sequential basis over the last couple of quarters. On a year-over-year basis, it's still growing pretty nicely. How should we think about the growth in that business? Does it kind of come in phases? Or should we think it can be a more steady quarter-to-quarter type grower?
Michael Hsing: I will say the steady state. But you said it, okay, we are kind of flattening out and we didn't grow as much, okay. I haven't really looked into deeply. Maybe Bernie can answer the question.
Bernie Blegen: Yes. I think that in the past, we have discussed the fact that while we are not immune to the macroeconomics because we are so small and new to the market, we have seen basically a step function in the growth here where we will have a series of new product introductions that might be timed around a particular model year and then that step function of growth occurs and then you get a couple quarters where you don't necessarily see the same rate of increase quarter-over-quarter. But certainly year-over-year, we have been generating results in excess of 40% annual growth year-over-year. So I think that it's not a perfect linear. It's not like a math equation. But I think a step function with the upward direction is the way to look at it.
Quinn Bolton: Okay. So last year, it looks like you guys kind of hit that step function in the December and March quarters. Is that a fair way to think about maybe you kind of see that step function up with each new model year and you tend to see maybe a little bit better sequential growth December into March? Or is it not necessarily timed to the same seasonality each year?
Michael Hsing: Yes. I think as I have to say that before the product, I am looking at the behavior of the product line. In last year or the year before that, all these revenue we generated from the non-automotive product and we requalify as automotive. In particular, from this year, the new revenue generated, these are all specifically designed for automotive application. And going forward, these products, all the new revenues, all from this particular design for automotive products. So I would say, there's more consistent growth.
Quinn Bolton: Okay. Great. And then just looking at the sequential growth, you guys had a nice jump in the consumer revs as well as the compute. Just wanted to confirm, is that game console, the new game console included in the consumer? And then, similarly on the compute, was that mostly coming from the cloud computing or the server power management launch? Or did you see broader growth in the compute segment in the September quarter?
Bernie Blegen: Yes, you are correct that the power management solution for gaming --
Michael Hsing: The game console is my least favorite. That's my least favorite topic.
Bernie Blegen: But it is in the consumer group. And then as far as the growth in compute and storage, I think that most of that was with servers and workstation which we refer to more broadly as cloud computing.
Quinn Bolton: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Rick Schafer with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.
Rick Schafer: Hi guys. I will add my congratulations as well for this nice quarter. I guess I just had a couple of follow-up questions on some topics that were raised earlier. The first is just on your e-commerce site. Could you maybe provide us a sense of how big that S&B opportunity is for you guys? Is there like a framework or some guidepost we could use to kind of think about how big that opportunity is for you guys?
Michael Hsing: I think it will be a few billion dollars. Because you think about all these company, that market size is all about underserved market. And you really require the FAE, like a field application engineer, hand-holding on it. And secondly, it's a fast-time to market segment. And so we, initially I think that will trickle down the initial design, that will not sustain it. But our e-commerce model, our modules is open bill of materials. And customers initially buy our modules for plug-and-play purpose and later on we get the production they can buy our chip and they can source in their own component. So by modules itself, okay, you add all these together, the modules, all these customers, smaller customers, I think that total market is a few billion dollars for MPS. And we add more programmable capability and put on the Internet, I think that we should have a very good chance. I am very optimistic about it.
Rick Schafer: Okay. And should we think of the ramp there, once it starts to go as sort of more of a linear ramp? Or do you think there's any kind of a step function there or anything as new features on the site come online or adoption takes hold? Or is it just too soon to kind of know how that's going to roll?
Michael Hsing: Well, first thing, like we already launched, okay. It's not on the Internet. We just sent them, as I stated before. I told you before, we send them a floppy disc, okay, right. And so it's well received now when it came. And once you introduce it on the Internet, I wish the step function, but it's too early to call it.
Rick Schafer: Okay. And then just a quick follow up on the auto business. Maybe if I would asked the question a little different way, but I think you have said in the past that your auto SAM is roughly $200 a car today. I believe that's correct.
Michael Hsing: Actually, it's a little less than that. It's a $145 or $150.
Rick Schafer: Okay. So how does that compare with your actual average content then today? And then maybe what is that going to look like in the next, I don't know, year or so based on the design wins that you guys see coming down the pipe?
Bernie Blegen: Well, again, let me take a quick stab at this. When you look at the potential of analog and sensor electronics in each automobile, you win an individual application or a socket. It's not like you get a 100% adoption in that. So in the area that we have been launching, which has been a combination of infotainment inclusive of USB ports, I think that we have actually seen very, very good penetration, but it's spread out with just a few dollars of content per individual automobile. And then as we do additional vertical product releases and go into the lighting, the body and controls and ADAS, then I think you will see opportunities for multiple adoptions which will, by nature, increase the dollar content per car.
Rick Schafer: Got it. And then maybe just my last question is, you guys have been growing cash so nicely. Maybe Bernie or Michael, if you guys could discuss sort of what the top uses of cash here are for you guys? I mean, is it more apt we are going to see a raise in the dividend at some point? Are you looking more at buyback? Or sort of how you are thinking about uses of cash? Thanks.
Michael Hsing: We are looking for all the scenarios, all scenarios being considered. And as we always said it, we are looking for some small tuck-in type complementary technology company.
Rick Schafer: Got it. Thanks guys.
Michael Hsing: Okay.
Bernie Blegen: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Amit Chandra with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Amit Chandra: Hi. Thank you. Good afternoon gentlemen. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Bernie, just a quick follow up. With inventory increasing sequentially each quarter in 2017 to support your strong second half product ramp, when do you expect inventory levels to start to normalize? Would that be in the March quarter of 2018?
Bernie Blegen: Yes. Let me process this. But the reason that we have invested in inventories is because we had some very unique new business opportunities as far as developing power management solutions for cloud computing, for gaming and for high-end PCs. And during a time where capacity has been a question mark, we have actually been able to do a really good job, a very good job of meeting our customers' demands. But obviously, our intention is not to stay at an elevated level, but as you said, to normalize. In the past that we have tried to target a range between 135 to 155 days for inventory and I would see us being able to bring that back more into, not a historic level, but within that range, probably in Q2 or Q3 of next year.
Amit Chandra: Okay. That's helpful. And then as a follow up, you guys are guiding to really strong year-over-year growth in the December quarter. Just out of curiosity, is that driven more so by the Purley product ramp? Or more by the Kaby Lake processor transition? Or is it mostly the new game console business? Or a combination of all three? Or is there something another --?
Michael Hsing: A combination of more than three. Combination of all above that we said in this conference and also that Bernie said in his script and don't forget about consumer. And we grow percentage-wise, it's not big, but the revenue side, they are pretty sizable.
Amit Chandra: Okay.
Bernie Blegen: If I can add one comment that is, we are really trying to be a diversified company and the way that we differentiate ourselves is with unique technology. And so I think that what you are seeing as far as the acceleration of our rate of revenue growth, it's been acceptance of that technology by our customers for their applications.
Amit Chandra: Okay. Great. And Michael, one final one for me. Can you give us a sense of how your single chip solution for battery management content is tracking for electric vehicles?
Michael Hsing: Yes. It's on schedule. And we do some field testing now.
Amit Chandra: Okay. Thank you very much and congrats on the quarter.
Michael Hsing: Thank you.
Bernie Blegen: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of William Stein with SunTrust. Your line is now open.
William Stein: Great. Thanks for squeezing me in. Congrats on the great results and outlook. I joined a little late, so I apologize if this is already asked. But I would love to get an update on e.Motion. If you could remind us how big that business is for you now? And are there design wins that are coming into the market and generating revenue currently and over the next couple of quarters and any sort of elaboration on that business would be helpful. Thank you.
Michael Hsing: Yes. Okay. Thanks for raising the question. In the last few earnings calls and I say all this didn't grow as expected because I didn't look at it. And actually this product line grows really well. And we will have more than a few million dollar business in next years. And also the fully integrated product and we are launching, actually we have a lot more focus as a launch as a module and as a small model. And we will sell with the models and so we are partnered with a couple of model companies and with our module behind the models. And so first we introduce we have many design wins since this March and I think that we will have a lot more. And you are talking about really a revolution ideas to replace stem models, replacing all the BSP controls and as well as optical sensors. And so the acceptance will be very for particular applications. But once we, for a few larger segments start it and like robots and like warehouse robots, I think that will widely spread.
William Stein: Maybe just one level deeper in the same topic. I think the somewhat unusual go-to-market approach is you are trying to get these components designed in by OEMs, who would have otherwise went to motor companies to buy a motor. And I think you are, correct me if I am wrong, but I think you are going to customers and telling them basically, build your own motor or a better motor using our components. Is that right? Are you seeing sort of acceptance based on either performance or pricing or both?
Michael Hsing: I think go-to-market segment, it's like the MPS selling DC-to-DC. Now we are selling modules. We are selling our modules for underserved customers and for time to market. And for the higher, when the volume reach high they can source in there, the MPS IC. You can buy MPS IC. For the model, for this e.Motion product line, we will do it very similar, except in that case, now we do a model. So we partnership with the model makers. Really depend on customers' needs. Where they can buy our modules, they can buy our chip. And the key is, I think that at this time and the customers have a hard time to understand that. They are like, why, okay, how to use this product? Because we get rid of the optical encoders. And it has a new way of controlling the models. So we help them to design their modules and also we help them to select the models with our model maker partners.
William Stein: Great. Thank you.
Bernie Blegen: Okay. All right.
Michael Hsing: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And that does conclude today's Q&A session. I would like to return the call to Mr. Bernie Blegen for any closing remarks.
Bernie Blegen: Thank you. I would like to thank you all for joining us for this conference call and look forward to talking to you again during our fourth quarter conference call, which will likely be in early February. Thank you. Have a nice day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

===== 2017 Q2  (2017-07-26 17:00:00) =====
Executives: Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.
Analysts: Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Monolithic Power Systems Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-answer-session and instructions will follow at that time. And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the floor over to Bernie Blegen, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Thank you very much. Good afternoon and welcome to the second quarter 2017 Monolithic Power Systems conference call. Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS, is with me on today's call. In the course of today's conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risks and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management's current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor Statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q2 earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on March 1, 2017, and Form 10-Q filed on May 5 2017, both of which are accessible through our website, www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today's call. We'll be discussing gross margin, operating expense, R&D and SG&A expense, operating income, interest and other income, net income, and earnings, on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the Q2 2016, Q1 2017 and Q2 2017 releases, as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our website. I'd also like to remind you that today's conference call is being webcast live over the Internet and will be available for replay on our website for one year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. MPS had a record quarter with revenue of $112.2 million, 11.8% higher than revenue generated in the first quarter of 2017 and 19.3% higher than the comparable quarter in 2016. MPS continues to benefit from technology leadership in our diversified multi-market strategy. Looking in our revenue by market, in our computing and storage market, revenue of $24.5 million increased $6.2 million, or 33.7% year-over-year, reflecting strong sales growth for SSD storage, cloud computing and high-end notebooks. Computing and storage revenue represented 21.8% of MPS's second quarter 2017 revenue. Second quarter automotive revenue reported separately from industrial for the first time of $12.9 million grew 55.7% over the same period of 2016, fueled by product sales for applications in infotainment and lighting. Automotive revenue was 11.5% of MPS's total Q2 2017 revenue. Revenue from consumer markets increased 14.6% over the second quarter of 2016 to $43.9 million and represented 39.1% of our Q2 revenue. The year-over-year revenue increase reflected solid improvements in high-value consumer markets, including gaming and home appliances. Second quarter 2017 communications revenue of $15.9 million increased 9.0% from the second quarter of 2016, and represented 14.2% of our total second quarter revenue. GAAP gross margin was 54.7%, 10 basis points higher than the first quarter of 2017 and 60 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2016. Our GAAP operating income was $15.0 million compared with $13.6 million reported in the first quarter of 2017, and $11.5 million reported in the second quarter of 2016. For the second quarter of 2017, non-GAAP gross margin was 55.6%, 10 basis points higher than the first quarter of 2017 and 50 basis points higher than the second quarter from a year ago. Our non-GAAP operating income was $31.2 million compared to $26.5 million reported in the prior quarter and $24.1 million reported in the second quarter of 2016. Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $46.5 million in the second quarter compared with $41.3 million in the first quarter of 2017, and $39.4 million in the second quarter of 2016. Our non-GAAP second quarter 2017 operating expenses were $31.2 million, up from the $29.2 million we spent in the first quarter of 2017, and up from the $27.2 million reported in the second quarter of 2016. On both a GAAP and on a non-GAAP basis, second quarter litigation expenses were $290,000 compared with $286,000 expense in Q1 of 2017. The differences between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are stock compensation expense and income or loss on an unfunded deferred compensation plan. Total stock compensation, including approximately $450,000 charged to cost of goods sold for the second quarter of 2017, was $15.1 million compared with $11.7 million recorded in the first quarter of 2017. Switching to the bottom line, second quarter 2017 GAAP net income was $15.0 million or $0.35 per fully diluted share compared with $0.33 per share in the first quarter of 2017 and $0.27 per share in the second quarter of 2016. Q2 non-GAAP net income was $29.5 million or $0.68 per fully diluted share compared with $0.58 per share in the first quarter of 2017 and $0.54 per share in the second quarter of 2016. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q2 2017 were 43.4 million. Now, let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $283 million at the end of the second quarter of 2017 compared to $284 million at the end of the first quarter of 2017. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $24.9 million compared with Q1 2017 operating cash flow of $21.9 million. Second quarter 2017 capital spending totaled $17.1 million. Accounts receivable ended the second quarter of 2017 at $42 million, or 34 days of days sales outstanding compared with the $38.1 million or 35 days reported at the end of the first quarter of 2017. Both quarters experienced a modest increase over historic norm due to a higher proportion of the quarter sales being recorded in the third month of the quarter. Days sales outstanding for the second quarter of 2017 were four days higher than the 30 days posted in the second quarter of 2016. Our internal inventories at the end of the second quarter of 2017 were $92.7 million, up from the $78.5 million at the end of the first quarter of 2017. Days of inventory increased to 166 days at the end of Q2 2017 from 157 days at the end of the first quarter of 2017 and 147 days at the end of the second quarter of 2016. I would like to turn to our outlook for the third quarter of 2017. We are forecasting Q3 revenue in the range of $124 million to $128 million. We also expect the following: GAAP gross margin in the range of 54.4% to 55.4%; non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.2% to 56.2%; total stock-based compensation expense of $13 million to $15 million, including approximately $450,000 that would be charged to cost of goods sold; litigation expenses ranging between $250,000 to $350,000, GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses between $43.8 million and $47.8 million; non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to be in the range of $31.2 million to $33.2 million. This estimate excludes stock compensation and litigation expenses. Other income is expected to be in the range from $650,000 to $750,000 before foreign exchange gains or losses; fully diluted shares to be in the range of 43 million to 44 million shares before share buyback. In conclusion, we continue to execute against our long-term business strategy and believe the success of our new product development will further propel MPS's future growth. I will now open the phone lines for questions.
Operator: Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg with Stifel.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes. Thank you and congratulations on the record quarter. My first question is on the outlook for the September quarter. Could you maybe talk a little bit about what are some of the main growth drivers for the quarter? I know you have a couple of specific product cycles coming up, but if you could just add some color there that's be great.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Sure, Tore. Thank you very much. So, as you know, Q3 tends to be a seasonal quarter for consumer and we're seeing good traction and are good anticipating good demand actually in several of our different product lines – market segments there. In addition, we believe that automotive is going to continue to do very well. And then also, we have a number of areas in computing that are going to be continuing strong into Q3.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Very good. And I noticed that your inventory days, I think you said around (12:26) 165 days now. So is it purely a reflection of the demand that is coming here in the second half of the year or is this more sort of a long-term project for you to keep the inventories – or the inventory days just as elevated?
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Yeah. I think that about a little over a year ago that we started slowly elevate our inventory levels as we introduced a lot of new products design for new markets. And then, as we're looking at entering the second half of the year, there have been concerns about fab capacity and so we wanted to get ahead of that so that we were able to meet demand. And so that's reflected in our inventory as they stand today. We expect them to exit the quarter probably about the same – similar level, but then come down probably in the subsequent quarters.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Very good. One last question – yeah, Michael.
Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Another factor is that we – all these greenfield market segments, which are of a much higher levels and a higher quality than in the past, five years ago, those are more consumer oriented, not in the industrial, automotive and cloud computing. And those customers require us to carry high inventory.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Very good. And last question also for you, Michael. Could you give us an update on the website and if we're going to see a launch here pretty soon?
Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Yes. If you're looking at our website now, they've really changed. And MPS is transitioning from selling ICs, now we're selling solutions. Okay. Of course, it's based on IC. And we will sell a lot more higher content other than MPS product and that's included in our solutions. Now, you look – lock (14:40) on our MPS website, you will see it. However, MPS in the past, always a hardware company, now, we are doing a lot more software and a lot more Internet development. And it's a little bit slow than I thought, but our website will be launched in the second half of this year. In addition, what we have now, actually, is a bigger part of e-commerce business, is that the interacting with the users, and that the users start to order parts, and also configure parts from our website. You see it in the later second half of the year.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Sounds good and congratulations again.
Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Thank you.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Thanks, Tore.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company.
Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Let me echo the congratulations on the record quarter and the nice outlook. Just wanted to come back to automotive, obviously, you guys are seeing strength. I think one of your larger competitors, Maxim, was talking about perhaps a little bit of a slowdown in their market. So, wondering what's sort of giving you sort of a better outlook than perhaps some of your peers? Do you think it's just strength of your design wins going to production? Are there pockets of automotive where you're perhaps seeing strength where maybe competitors are not as well positioned? Just any thoughts you might have on that. And then, I've got a couple of follow-up questions.
Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Yeah. Quinn, it's Michael. In automotive segment, we are so new and we haven't really scratched the surface. So our growth should be regardless what the automotive industrial condition is. So our revenues, our opportunity is – the ratio is very, very high in that case. So we have a lot of opportunity to grow.
Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay, great. And then, just looking at the compute strength, Purley was just launched a couple of weeks ago, obviously, that's a big power management cycle for you. Wondering, now that we've had the official launch of Purley, how you're looking at the ramp in the server power management into the second half of 2017 and into 2018 as well?
Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: I think that now you see that we move the needles. We'll move the revenue noticeable. And in the next years, we'll probably grow at a similar rate or even higher.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: And I think one of the interesting components here is that we're getting significant contribution from storage, primarily SSD, as well as the high-end notebooks, and we're only at the very early stages of the Purley conversion. So to echo Michael's point here, we see this being able to develop over the course of the next 12 months.
Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay, great. And then just lastly sort of capital returns. You guys have done a very nice job growing EPS, reported $0.68 this quarter. Cash dividend has been sort of flat at about $0.20 a quarter since I think the first quarter of 2015. Any changes in how you're thinking about that dividend and whether there's a chance that we could see that moving higher over the next few quarters?
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Quinn, we continue to look at our capital allocation model and it's something that we're mindful of, as far as what our investor feedback is, as well as what we think is best as far as the cash management for the company. So, at this point, again, it's under evaluation, but there's no firm direction.
Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: Great. And then just, sorry, last quick clarification, Bernie. The CapEx seem to be much higher this quarter than in a typical quarter for MPS. Was there a big outlay for testers, or what was behind that jump in CapEx? I assume it's probably temporary.
Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Well, we have a lot of automotive qualification, and as well as industrial and cloud computing, and a lot of qualification equipment we had to buy.
Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: Got it. Thanks, guys.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: We've also, as you know, been buying office space over time and that contributed as well.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Anil Doradla with William Blair.
Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Congrats from my side to Michael and Bernie. First question, if you look at Q1 and Q2, it was close to 19% year-over-year growth. If I look at the high-end of your guidance, that suggest about a 20% year-over-year growth. Now, I know, Michael and Bernie, you guys have talked about aspiring to get to 20%. And without talking too much about Q4 and everything, but just qualitatively, could we even potentially exit this year at a 20%? I mean, is that realistic or maybe that's more kind of a – it spills over into next year?
Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: That's very possible. As I said about a year ago or so, this year, we'll see some of the greenfield market segment that we entered in the last two or three years, or three or four years ago, and this year, we start to see the revenues. So it's only got a few percentage change. It doesn't mean to me a lot.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Yeah. I think that the substance that we're really looking at, and while certainly the 20% number is a number that we've had in our long-term guidance, but it's really the quality of the new product launches and how successful that they're being viewed that we're very interested in. And all of the initial signs, as far as both the demand and acceptance in the market, has been very, very positive.
Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Yeah. I don't look at whether 19.5% or the 18%, 21%. These are – the 20% seems to me as a psychological barrier and that I don't get it. Okay.
Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Right, right. Well, it is definitely impressive. And as a follow-up, I mean, Michael, you talked about the e-commerce platform. Obviously, there's some resources and energy are being allocated to that. So, Bernie, whenever you have the e-commerce development platform, is that part of the R&D spending or is that part of its SG&A? And if I look at the next 12 months, how should I be looking, qualitatively, the growth of SG&A versus R&D? Should SG&A revert to a higher growth rates than R&D, given some of these initiatives? Just a qualitative kind of feel.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Sure. The e-commerce is part of our R&D spend. And I think that you're fairly comfortable with our management of operating expenses. And while we have significant opportunities ahead of us that we want to invest in, including the e-commerce platform, I think that we've always demonstrated a strong discipline, particularly on the G&A side.
Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great, and congrats once again, guys.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rick Schafer with Oppenheimer.
Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Thanks. I'll add my congratulations to you guys. I guess, my first question is, could you talk a little bit about your new gaming business and how it'll impact seasonality in your consumer segment in the second half? I mean should we expect sort of the typical fourth quarter slowdown, or is there still enough ramp left to kind of blow through that a little bit? Or could you just give us some color maybe on the consumer segment?
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Yeah. Again, we don't offer guidance more than one quarter ahead. So I'm not going to try and add too much color that we would give way any thinking there. But I will say that there's nothing currently – when I look at what the analysts and how you have us modeled out, there's nothing in that cycle that gives me pause.
Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then within computing and storage, if you had to, how would you rank the growth, maybe the second half or in 2018, if you're ranking growth sort of between server and notebook and the SSD business?
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Well, I think that it's hard to actually rank them, because a lot of the parts have so much similarity that we kind of make a very educated guess as far as which end market they go into. But I think that server, which has just been introduced right now with Purley, probably would be the number one grower over the course of the next 12 to 15 months. And then, SSD really has only been limited by NAND availability because that transition away from HDD has been very clear and apparent in the marketplace, so we see that continuing to go. And then high-end notebooks, we have such an underpenetrated position that we see that all as upside. And probably that would be sort of my rough ordering of it.
Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay.
Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Probably number one is the server.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Yeah.
Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Products we're selling to servers and computing and desktop, I mean, not that are workstations, and the servers and the high-end PCs, these are very much – a lot of them are convoluted. But I would correct Bernie that, on the SSDs, they are different product. So if we rank them, I think of servers on the highest and then probably SSDs (25:19) second.
Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Yeah, got it. Thanks for that color, and then maybe just one follow-up on server. Can you talk about any new server customers that come on with Purley? And maybe would they be primarily point of load and E-Fuse-type customers or could they take QS MOD sort of out of the gates as well? Thanks.
Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Yeah. Our servers, they're just the very beginning.
Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay.
Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: And the significant growth will be in 2018 and 2019 for MPS.
Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Got it. Thanks, Michael.
Operator: Thank you. [Operating Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.
Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, guys. Just sticking on the computing side. Mike, earlier you said a comment about the business staying strong growth rate wise and maybe even accelerating going forward. Without pegging you down to anything too specific, were you referring to the growth rate kind of this year going into next year or was that a comment that was more specific about the year-over-year growth rate in the second quarter alone?
Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: No. I'm talking about year-over-year growth rate and – not growth rate, the absolute numbers, and will be a significant portion of MPS revenues. So I'm looking at what kind of product. This year is mainly ramping up from a point of load, E-Fuse and some portion of core power. In the next couple of years, the core powers will start to ramp. And now, we have all the first tier customers.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: We're in the very early stages, particularly, in the server workstation as far as being able to grow and develop that market.
Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. And I guess following on with the new product side of things, you've talked about the OpEx being a little bit higher because you have so many new products coming on, so many new end markets you are gravitating towards. Do you expect in general for these markets to generate revenue in kind of a consistent steady – might improve a little bit or slow a little bit year-over-year, but more of a steady pattern? Or is there going to be a time where you're going to have numbers that are significantly above what we view as seasonal patterns because these new products really kick in? And it's not meant to be a single quarter comment, Bernie, because you don't want to comment on 4Q or any other thing beyond that.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: No, no, no. I think that one of the things that we're known for here is our level of predictability even managing a level of higher growth – significantly higher growth than the market is enjoying. And within that, we're not looking for seismic shifts that create a hockey stick, but what we want to do is a groundswell where we continue to grow. And we look at it over a two or three year horizon, not just how can we get to next quarter.
Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Ross, look at the market segment that we entered, and we really announced about five years ago. And those are very slow – a slow changing market, and customer will not design us in and the design us out in a couple of years. Not in five, six years, these are 10 years plus. And that takes – the cycles take that long. So nothing changes very quickly. So once we roll-out all these products, the doors are open to MPS now and we need to grab all these sockets. So we will see some acceleration in growth, but very steady state.
Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got you. I guess my follow-up or my final question is one on the gross margin. You guys have had a steady, predictable execution on that to use your words, Bernie. With these new markets kicking in and becoming a bigger percentage of your revenue over the course of the back half of this year and even more so in the next year, year and a half, does that change any of that kind of 10 basis points per quarter trend? Has it accelerated, decelerated, any change whatsoever?
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: The advantage of some of these new markets that we're developing in, they have much longer lead times. And so what we're able to do is, as we're looking even two quarters out, we have a very strong sense of what the sales mix is going to be. And if there's an opportunity to introduce lower margin business as a means of accelerating revenue growth and also continuing to increase gross margin by 10 to 20 basis points quarter-over-quarter, that's what we're trying to do. So, if we have the good fortune of having very high margin business come through, what we'll probably do is level that out with lower margin business in order to get a higher overall growth rate.
Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to Monolithic management for any closing comments.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Great. I'd like to thank you all for joining us for this conference call and look forward to talking to you again during our third quarter conference call, which will likely be at the end of October. Thank you. Have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Bernie Blegen: Thank you very much. Good afternoon, and welcome to the first quarter 2017 Monolithic Power Systems’ conference call. Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS, is with me on today’s call. In the course of today’s conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management’s current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor Statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q1 earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on March 1, 2017, which is accessible through our website, www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today’s call. We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, R&D and SG&A expense, operating income, interest and other income, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and on a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the Q1 2016, Q4 2016 and Q1 2017 releases, as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our website. I’d also like to remind you that today’s conference call is being webcast live over the Internet and will be available for replay on our website for one year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. MPS had a record first quarter with revenue of $100.4 million, 3.1% lower than revenue generated in the fourth quarter of 2016, 18.8% higher than the comparable quarter in 2016. MPS continues to benefit from technological leadership and our diversified multi-market strategy. Looking at our revenue by market, first quarter 2017 industrial revenue of $27.7 million grew 50.2% over the same period of 2016, fueled by product sales for applications in automotive, power sources, and smart meters. Industrial revenue as a percentage of total Q1 2017 revenue grew to 27.6%. In our computing and storage market, revenue of $20.6 million increased, $5.2 million or 33.9% year-over-year reflecting strong sales growth for SSD storage, cloud computing and high-end notebooks. Computing and storage revenue represented 20.5% of MPS’ first quarter 2017 revenue. Revenue from consumer markets increased 5.3% over the first quarter of 2016 to $35.6 million and represented 35.5% of our Q1 revenue. The year-over-year revenue increase reflected solid improvements in high value consumer markets including home appliances and lighting tempered by lower sales for set-top boxes. First quarter 2017 communication revenue of $16.4 million decreased 2.5% from the first quarter of 2016 and represented 16.4% of our total first quarter revenue. GAAP gross margin was 54.6%, 10 basis points higher than the prior quarter of 2016 and 70 basis points higher than the first quarter of 2016. Our GAAP operating income was $13.6 million, compared to $17.5 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $10.4 million reported in the first quarter of 2016. For the first quarter of 2017, non-GAAP gross margin was 55.5%, 10 basis points higher than the prior quarter of 2016 and 50 basis points higher than the first quarter from a year ago. Our non-GAAP operating income was $26.5 million, compared to $29.0 million reported in the prior quarter and $20.0 million reported in the first quarter of 2016. Turning to automotive, macro economic trends in the industry appear soft. However, our market penetration is in the very early stages. And we believe our future growth will be largely driven by gaining market share. Accordingly we expect revenue for the next several years continue to grow at a rate significantly above market as MPS’ footprint and automotive is relatively small by the market size and opportunities are tremendous. Growth trends in automotive electronic applications align well with MPS technology as consumers demand higher connectivity and access to more intelligent content. More importantly, the proliferation of sensors and multi-core processors for autonomous driving capabilities provide MPS with increased available dollar content for each vehicle. These trends will have a strong positive influence on our business prospects over the long-term. In addition to continued momentum from automotive, we expect to layer on new revenue streams in 2017 and in the years ahead. Beginning in Q2 2017 product ramps for MPS’ superior digital power solutions will drive growth in applications for cloud computing, gaming council and high-end notebooks. We expect our digital power solutions will be further adapted in 2017 and 2018 for use in field programmable applications, networking and automotive. Let’s review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $41.3 million in the first quarter, compared with $39.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $35.1 million in the first quarter of 2016. Our non-GAAP first quarter 2017 operating expenses were $29.2 million, up from the $28.4 million we spent in the fourth quarter and up from the $26.4 million reported in the first quarter of 2016. On both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis, first quarter litigation expenses were $286,000, compared with a $322,000 net credit in Q4 2016, a portion of a Q4 2016 IP settlement was recorded as income in that quarters litigation expenses and a similar adjustment was not repeated in the first quarter of this year. The differences between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are stock compensation and income or loss on an unfunded deferred compensation plan. Total stock compensation including approximately $400,000 that was charged cost of goods sold, for the first quarter of 2017 was a $11.7 million compared with $10.7 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016. Switching to the bottom line. First quarter 2017 GAAP net income was $14.5 million or $0.33 per fully diluted share, compared with $0.39 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $0.25 per share in the first quarter of 2016. Q1 non-GAAP net income was $25.2 million or $0.58 per fully diluted share, compared with $0.65 per share in the previous quarter of 2016 and $0.45 per share in the first quarter of 2016. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q1 2017 were $43.3 million, which included a one-time increase of approximately 500,000 shares upon adoption of the new accounting standards for stock compensation. Now let’s look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $284 million at the end of the first quarter of 2017, compared to $273.6 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2016. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $21.9 million, compared with Q4 2016 operating cash flow of $31.0 million. First quarter 2017 capital spending totaled $3.4 million. Accounts receivable ended the first quarter of 2017 at $38.1 million or 35 days of sales outstanding, which was slightly higher than the $34.2 million or 30 days reported at the end of the first quarter of 2016. This modest increase was due to a higher proportion of the quarter sales being recorded in the third month of Q1 compared with the prior quarter. Day sales outstanding for the first quarter of 2017 were four days higher than the 31 days posted in the first quarter of 2016. Our internal inventories at the end of the first quarter of 2017 were $78.5 million, up from the $71.5 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2016. Days in inventory increased to 157 days at the end of Q1 2017 from 138 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2016 and 145 days at the end of the first quarter of 2016. I would now like to turn to our outlook for the second quarter of 2017. We are forecasting Q2 revenue in the range of $109 million to $113 million. We also expect the following: GAAP gross margin in the range of 54.1% to 55.1%; non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.0% to 56.0%; total stock-based compensation expense of $12.5 million to $14.5 million, including approximately $400,000 that would be charged to cost of goods sold; litigation expenses ranging between $200,000 to $300,000; GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses between $42.0 million and $46.0 million; non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to be in the range of $29.9 million to $31.9 million. This estimate excludes stock compensation and litigation expenses; other income is expected to be in the range from $400,000 to $500,000 before foreign exchange, gains or losses; fully diluted shares to be in the range of 42.9 million to 43.9 million shares before share buyback. In conclusion, we continue to grow and continue to enhance shareholder value. I will now open the phone lines for questions.
Operator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Quinn Bolton of Needham. Your line is open.
Quinn Bolton: Hey guys, congratulations on the nice result. So I just wanted to start up with some of the revenue drivers for 2017-2018, it just sounds like the transition share gains on game console related devices and then server power management are kind of the three near-term next 12 months drivers. And just in terms of the timing kind of it feels like probably notebooks first, game consoles maybe starts to ramp late here in Q2 and then servers closer to year-end and just wanted to see if that’s kind of the right timing from your perspective in terms of the ramp of those three opportunities.
Bernie Blegen: Hi, Quinn. Thank you very much. I think that the way that you’ve sequenced those opportunities is correct and let me just add a little bit of color. So the notebook opportunities, we expect to be sort of steady and consistent growth. It’s not as if there’s a big bang that’s going to occur in one quarter and then grow from there. When we look at gaming, obviously, that’s driven around the holiday season, so we would expect that with the adoption of the gaming console business that that should be weighted more heavily into Q3 although it may have a tail into Q4 as well. And then certainly with the servers as we’ve discussed in the past much of that while we’ve continued to see good revenue growth, much of the next layer of growth we believe is expected with the Grantley the Purley transition, which is expected to the second half. And there again, we see good games to come for as we are designed into new platforms and also we branched out into dual OEMs and that would include both our POL and our E-Fuse products. And then we believe over time that we’ll see adoption rates for our VCORE power management solution that we called QS Mod as that goes from that tier-2 to tier-1 and in particularly the cloud providers.
Quinn Bolton: And on these cloud providers, they tend to be sort of earlier adaptors in the sort of server upgrade cycle. Did that that kind of ramp do you think maybe enters the tailwind of 2017? I know Intel often provides early access to some of those Hyper-Scale guys or do you think that’s still kind of more closer to year end and in to early 2018 for that Hyper-Scale Cloud opportunity.
Bernie Blegen: I think that when we look at the MPS is overall energy efficiency solutions, they really do bases for growth in the cloud based data centers. And yes, they do have earlier adoption rates.
Michael Hsing: Quinn, this is Michael. All these are the Company’s strategies, we don’t really care which market segment, how we time it and how we time it and that relates to growing our MPS revenues. So these – we actually in opposite, we don’t want to – we want to disassociated with or we are tied to Xbox, or we are tied to whatever the game – whatever the game console, in game platforms and in the game – in the Intel’s of when we were to release – release productions for whatever the process so yes. These are just our opportunity and that we only want to getting show our gross margin in the steady growth. And our customers facing – whatever the – whichever the product is, I can – we don’t contact and it’s all within a plus minus six, seven months, as I said earlier.
Quinn Bolton: Okay, great. And then just…
Bernie Blegen: I’m sorry just a finishing thought on Michael there, one of the interesting characteristics as Michael has just laid it out as well is that it provides for a steady growth ramp both for the second half of 2017, as well as throughout 2018.
Quinn Bolton: Great. And then just the follow up question about JV, you’ve talked about sort of some general macro economic weakness in the automotive sector, but share gains would allow you sort of over the next several years to grow faster than the market. And I’m just kind of wondering, do you think that there’s any point in time where macroeconomic conditions can change the near-term outlook, I mean, does macro change so quickly that it can fetch your quarter-to-quarter revenue ramp on automotive or do you think the share gains are really the driving factor there and even with soft macro environment sort of steady share gains that you have for more consistent growth. Just trying to get your sense on whether or not, we should be thinking automotive could be lumpy.
Michael Hsing: For the automotive Quinn in MPS as you know, we entered a market about four or five years ago, and four or five years ago our revenue almost is zero. And even two, three years ago very teeny-tiny. And it takes a long time to get the revenue. And so design cycle is about three to four years. And we our total ten in Automotive is about $6 billion, probably now is more than that. And so what is our percentage is less than a percent. So it’s a total greenfield for us to grow. As I see it in the next few years all the design win activities happen in the last couple of years. So it’s all designing. Unless they cancelled a car, they canceled their entire cars and are now going to move to a production market and of course the very effective MPS revenue. But it’s highly unlikely they’ll not introduce a car any more. So, we yes that’s why we said lucky. Is we – and also at the same time we’re gaining share. We’re gaining share we’re entering other applications and we’re winning other sockets. So the overall for us it’s very optimistic.
Quinn Bolton: Great, that’s great. Now Samsung Galaxy Note7 automobiles coming into marketing anytime soon. And thanks and congratulations.
Michael Hsing: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Rick Schafer: Thanks and I’ll add my congratulations on another nice quarter. Maybe just a quick follow-up on [indiscernible] I’m just curious which your guys thoughts are and how you see that mix migration and what it looks like over the next 12 months to 18 months. I mean, are we going to – is it a relatively rapid crossover possibly like the first half of 2018 or is it going to take a little while longer for that mix to shift?
Michael Hsing: I don’t think it’s going to be are very sharp cross over. So that will be a gradual, a gradual change. So our revenue as I said in the last few quarters so the second half this year we start to gradually see revenue coming.
Bernie Blegen: And I think I would add to that a lot of the initial revenue will come from similar dollar content hence we have in the in the Grantley cycle. And that is based on the POL and the eFUSE opportunities. And then we’ll continue to gradually layer in our next generation as far as power management the QS Mod, over the next, the course of the next two years. So I think that Michael is summed it up nicely that we see it steady ramping in that for us.
Rick Schafer: Okay. Thanks.
Bernie Blegen: Again, the opportunity for us in a car computing is well over $1 billion. And we have a very few, I don’t know what is the percentage – it’s less than the couple of percent.
Rick Schafer: And maybe just a follow-on to that then I mean how do you guys feel like you’re positioned with ARM servers for co-power or Point of Load or eFUSE do you expect any revenue are you working on any projects along those lines in the next, same kind timeframe next 12, 18 months?
Michael Hsing: Of course, we want to cover everything like if we entered the market okay, without taking our technologies and we can be easily adapted into different platforms. And so we are working on it all these other solutions of them and a lot of them where we have it now.
Rick Schafer: Okay. And then maybe just on switching gears to e-commerce and the initiative there maybe could, first I guess is the website live and is it up and running, I know you talked about sort of March, April timeframe for launch maybe if you could remind us or kind of frame out how big that opportunity is in terms of potential new customers and when we might start to see revenues from that effort?
Bernie Blegen: Yes, I will open up by saying that e-commerce solution and the opportunity that is afforded through ask field programmability and we’ve been viewing that really the second half of 2018 and 2019 as far as when the revenue ramp begins. So to answer your question specifically, this quarter we did have a rollout of basically an upgrade over our all website. And then we’re expecting in about another 3 to 4 months time that will go up at the first generation of the next-gen website which will have an e-commerce component.
Rick Schafer: Got it. Okay thanks, guys.
Michael Hsing: Just an update, okay its very I call it baby steps I mean it’s just we show – we have other components in all the interactive and the e-commerce question haven’t really kicking yet and I hope in the next few months the new website will be live.
Rick Schafer: Got it. Thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Your question please.
Matt O’Connor: Hey, guys, this is actually Matt on Ross’ behalf. Congrats on the results once again, but I’m curious about two in-markets in particular, comms and storage and computing. It looks like they – you’re just a tad bit softer than at least we expected. Was there anything beyond your prepared remarks that could explain the directionality of those two? And it sounds like that you’re pretty optimistic about both of them in the second half, but anything you could talk about one in the near-term and anything over and beyond what was already answered from the previous caller concerning the long-term?
Bernie Blegen: Yes. So let me address just focusing quarter – year-over-year on the quarter’s performance. So the computing – storage and computing revenue for that market went up 34% year-over-year and a lot of it was driven by storage SSD in particular. And if I could offer sort of a thought is that storage for us has been somewhat constrained because lack of availability of NAND. And we had a very good bump and we expect that to continue for the next several quarters as there have been certain of the larger suppliers that have been able to extend greater availability, and so that’s removed a bottleneck for us. And then as far as the server and the notebook; notebook, we are benefiting as we transition from Skylake to Kaby Lake, and that is going to increase the number of OEMs that we serve, it actually increases it by building five or six. And we expect that to ramp incrementally right now, but have continued growth through the remainder of this year and well into next year. And likewise, I think we’ve already addressed the server which is going to be driven by the Grantley Proleague conversion. On the comms market, I think we sort of had a very consistent theme that we are very enthusiastic of the opportunity there, we believe that the field programmable solutions for power management that we have are ideally suited, particularly for high voltage opportunities in the wireless infrastructure, but that is a long-term proposition. And so, quarter-to-quarter we expect the comms market to sort of increase or decrease by a margin of about $1 million until we really start to get some attraction in next generation products and new customers.
Michael Hsing: Yes, as I’ve said, we’re going to introduce some acquainted product and that killer product is out, will be introduced. And I expected to have a next couple years that we’re going to grow that business significantly.
Matt O’Connor: Okay, great. And on the OpEx front, could you give any rough color on this second half outlook. It sounds like again we talked about the growth drivers on OCM, but just a rough idea of what OpEx should do in the second half of the year.
Bernie Blegen: Sure. I think that we said in the last call that, we expect to be within our financial model growing operating expenses in this year at a rate that is represents 50% to 60% the rate of revenue growth. In Q1, we actually came in middle, low end of that point. And I sort of say that we’re targeting plus or minus 2 percentage points of the midpoint of that for the full year.
Matt O’Connor: Okay. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Your question please.
Tore Svanberg: Yes. Thank you and congratulations on another consistent quarter. My first question is for you Michael on all the consolidation we’ve seen so far especially our power and management companies. I’m just wondering if it seems that changed in the marketplace whether it’s pricing or capacity because it seems like your competitors are getting global got the recorder how so, any thoughts on that would be helpful. Thanks.
Michael Hsing: I think of the – we gained a lot of large, but these are first here customers in the recent years. I think of that attribute to, I was there to first our technologies and that came – and secondly I came out I think that yes I do agree there is some effect. And our customers need a multiple sources and the source of that kind of dried out. And the some it kind of forced them to looking into another supplied. And a combination we’re both I think we gain a lot of recognition in the last couple of years. And particular, these are very well established at first year customers in auto and a industrial side.
Tore Svanberg: Yes, that’s helpful. And on the high end note books other than the process or change, is it anything about the power management architecture there that’s along you to gain some incremental share.
Michael Hsing: I think of for the high end note books I get where we are – consider now we can provide a total solutions and for the power management. And so obviously – and other peripheral we can gain some more shares. But we don’t want to associate that to MPS is a notebook company. And we only address that those are small vary thing, vary portable and long battery running times.
Tore Svanberg: Yes. And then on the industrial side, which obviously have the strongest growth the last 12 months, any further thoughts on the distribution strategy. There seems to be some mixed strategies out there, some companies are relying less on distributors, some are kind of stepping them up. What do you stand as far as leveraging the distribution channel in the industrial market?
Michael Hsing: Yes. We’re in the past [indiscernible] sales guys are really have a hard work as opining the pavements to get our customers attentions. And all these distributors just frankly just ignore us. And then now they’re run out of source they come to us too. And so I think as where we’re going to futures in the next couple years there will huge benefit to MPS.
Tore Svanberg: Yes. Very good just one last question for Bernie, Bernie the inventory days were not, but little bit sequentially I understand it tends to do that in the March quarter but anything else going on there basically just getting ready for a strong period in Q2, Q3.
Bernie Blegen: Sorry. That’s exactly I think that as you look at the market that the fab capacity is being mentioned as a concern for some people. And I believe we’ve positioned ourselves very well to manage the growth that we expect to get in the second half of this year.
Tore Svanberg: Very good. Again congratulations for the consistency. Thank you.
Bernie Blegen: Thank you, Tore.
Operator: Thank you. At this time I like to turn the call back over to Mr. Blegen for any closing remarks, sir.
Bernie Blegen: Sure, thank you. I’d like to thank you all for joining us for this conference call and look forward to talking to you again during our second quarter conference call, which will likely be at the end of July. Thank you and have a nice day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude your program. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

Analysts: Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC Vincent Celentano - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Matt Diamond - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Monolithic Power Systems' Q4 2016 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this call will be recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Bernie Blegen, Chief Financial Officer. You may begin.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Good afternoon, and welcome to the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016 Monolithic Power Systems' conference call. Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS, is with me on today's call. In the course of today's conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management's current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor Statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q4 earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on February 29, 2016, and Form 10-Q filed on November 3, 2016, both of which are accessible through our website, www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today's call. We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, R&D and SG&A expense, operating income, interest and other income, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the Q1 through Q4 releases for 2015 and 2016, as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our website. I'd also like to remind you that today's conference call is being webcast live over the Internet and will be available for replay on our website for one year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. Let's begin with a top-level summary of 2016 revenue. Our full-year revenue was $388.7 million, up 16.7% from the $333.1 million MPS reported for 2015. This year-over-year growth compared favorably with the analog industry which SIA estimates grew 5.8% over the prior year. On a GAAP basis, full-year 2016 gross margin of 54.3% expanded 20 basis points from the prior year. GAAP operating income grew to $54.4 million, representing a 32.6% increase over 2015. Finally, MPS recorded GAAP EPS of $1.26. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margin expanded 20 basis points from the prior year to 55.2%. Non-GAAP operating income of $102.6 million grew 25.6% over 2015. MPS achieved record non-GAAP full-year earnings of $2.30 per share, 21.7% higher than 2015. Diving into year-over-year revenue growth by market segment. Full-year computing and storage revenue was up 42.4% and industrial revenue grew 35.1%. Full-year consumer revenue was up 6.0% over 2015 and communications revenue was essentially flat between years. Let me speak to highlights by market segment. In computing and storage, full-year 2016 revenue of $80.6 million increased $24.0 million year-over-year, reflecting strong sales growth for cloud computing, SSD storage and high-end PCs. Computing and storage revenue represented 20.7% of MPS's total revenue in 2016. In the industrial market segment, revenue grew $23.2 million to $89.6 million, fueled by product sales for applications in automotive, security, smart meters and power sources. Industrial revenue as a percentage of total revenue grew to 23.1% in 2016. Revenue from consumer markets increased to $153.7 million and represented 39.6% of our total revenue. The year-over-year revenue increase was driven primarily by gains in high-value consumer markets, including home appliances and battery management systems. While MPS has consistently achieved high rates of revenue growth, we believe our technology lead is widening, and we are in the early stages of expanding our addressable market. With increasing visibility into long-term design engagements, we believe MPS is uniquely positioned to deliver sustainable, profitable growth. As a case in point, with our superior digital power solutions, we continue to successfully win and gain share for high-end, space-limited notebook solutions. As Intel transitions to the Purley server cycle later this year, we believe MPS' energy-efficient solutions positions us for growth in cloud-based data centers. In gaming, our QS Mod solutions are being adopted by a major gaming OEM for its high-end console. In addition, we believe the significant automotive design win momentum experienced during the past four years will continue to drive industrial revenue growth. Finally, we have completed development of a high-voltage SOI process technology, which will enable us to grow into a number of new market segments. In the next few quarters, we will be introducing a number of products utilizing this technology for the medical market. Switching to Q4, MPS had a record fourth quarter with revenue of $103.6 million, 2.7% lower than revenue generated in the prior quarter, but 19.2% higher than the comparable quarter in 2015. By market segment, revenue for computing and storage grew 60.8%, and industrial revenue rose 40.5% over the same period of 2015. Quarterly revenue for the communications segment increased 7.6% over the prior-year period, while consumer revenue was essentially flat with the prior-year period. GAAP gross margin was 54.5%, 10 basis points higher than the prior quarter of 2016 and 50 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2015. Our GAAP operating income was $17.5 million, compared to $15.0 million reported in the prior quarter of 2016 and $11.8 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2015. For the fourth quarter of 2016, non-GAAP gross margin was 55.4%, 10 basis points higher than the prior quarter of 2016 and 40 basis points higher than the fourth quarter from a year ago. Our non-GAAP operating income was $29.0 million, compared to the $29.4 million reported in the prior quarter and the $22.5 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2015. Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $39.0 million in the fourth quarter, compared with $42.9 million in the third quarter of 2016. Our non-GAAP fourth quarter 2016 operating expenses were $28.4 million, down from the $29.4 million we spent in the third quarter and up from the $25.3 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2015. On both a GAAP and on a non-GAAP basis, fourth quarter litigation expenses represented a $321,000 net credit, as a portion of a $3 million IP settlement was recorded as income. The remainder of this settlement will be recorded as income over the next several years. The differences between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarters being discussed here are stock compensation expense and income or loss on an unfunded deferred compensation plan, as well as a write-off of contingent consideration recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015. Stock comp expense was $10.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared with $13.1 million in the prior quarter of 2016. Switching to the bottom line. Q4 GAAP net income was $16.6 million or $0.39 per fully diluted share, compared with $0.34 per share in the previous quarter of 2016 and $0.24 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015. Q4 non-GAAP net income was $27.5 million or $0.65 per fully diluted share, compared with $0.66 per share in the previous quarter of 2016 and $0.51 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015. Now let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $273.6 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2016, above the $264.4 million at the end of the prior quarter of 2016. For the full-year 2016, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $107.8 million and for Q4 2016 operating cash flow was $31.0 million. Cash proceeds from employee stock option exercises contributed about $1.3 million for all of 2016 and $153,000 in Q4. These cash flows were partially offset by $8.1 million to purchase capital equipment in Q4 of 2016. Accounts receivable ended the fourth quarter at $34.2 million or 30 days of sales outstanding, which was slightly higher than the $33.4 million or 28 days reported at the end of the prior quarter of 2016. This modest increase was due to a higher proportion of the quarter's sales being recorded in the third month of Q4 compared with the prior quarter. Fourth quarter 2016 days sales outstanding were 2 days lower than the 30 days posted in the fourth quarter of 2015. Our internal inventories at the end of the fourth quarter of 2016 were $71.5 million, up from the $70.7 million at the end of the prior quarter. Days of inventory increased to 138 days at the end of Q4 from the 133 days at the end of the third quarter of 2016. I would like to turn to our outlook for the first quarter of 2017. We are forecasting Q1 revenue in the range of $98 million to $102 million. We also expect the following: GAAP gross margin in the range of 53.8% to 54.8%; non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 54.8% to 55.8%; total stock-based compensation expense of $12.1 million to $14.1 million, including approximately $400,000 that would be charged to cost of goods sold; litigation expenses of $150,000 to $250,000; non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to be in the range of $28.3 million to $30.3 million, this estimate excludes stock compensation and litigation expenses; other income of $300,000 to $400,000 before foreign currency exchange, gains or losses; fully diluted shares to be in the range of 42.8 million to 43.8 million shares before any share buyback. In conclusion, in the last several years, MPS has focused on investing in new products and targeted markets. Starting this year, we believe MPS will begin to benefit from those investments, which will translate to strong revenue growth in 2018 and beyond. I'll now open the microphone for questions.
Operator: And our first question comes from Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company. Your line is open.
Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Congratulations on the nice results and outlook. Wanted to start, Michael and Bernie, on the notebook business. We just had the formal launch of Kaby Lake at CES, and so wondering if you could sort of give us your outlook now that that processor formally launched. And a sort of related question, Intel I think is planning yet another fourth generation – I'm sorry, 14-nanometer processor to be introduced in the second half of the year. I think with Kaby Lake, you guys picked up market share. As we look forward to that eighth-generation core processor Intel was talking about introducing towards the end of the year, do you think you might be poised for additional share gains on those client platforms?
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Sure. Quinn, thank you very much for the question. So, as we look at 2017 and 2018, certainly going into the Kaby Lake, we've benefited significantly by having the reference design, and we've been able to see a lot of very good traction for our power solutions, because, as we mentioned in the script, of the overall efficiency and the small form factor. So, as we look at the current year, we continue to see sort of a similar growth rate as we've experienced in the previous generation of Intel products. Now, as we look out to the product, which I believe you're referring to of Intel's next generation Cannonlake, which I believe may come out at the end of this year or in the early part of 2018, we go from not only being a reference design, but also we have been designed into their core product, which is a significant enhancement over our previous position. So we remain very optimistic in that relationship for the high-end notebooks.
Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Quinn, this is Michael Hsing. Let me add on. I'm very aware, like any other investors, that notebook is associated with lower margins. And however, we develop those based on the QS Mod, that technology. We develop those product and these are very unique ones. And we're only focused on size constraint, and that requires a very – notebook has a longer run time, which is very highly efficient. And also, it's a time to market because our product is very easy to use. So we only focus on those high-end market. As I see the notebook market segment, it's only one of the product line and we're not really concentrated on it. We really focus on a balanced growth in the overall MPS.
Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: Thanks for the additional color. I sort of wanted to move on to the new process technology that you just announced on the call, the high-voltage SOI process. And, Bernie, I think in the script you mentioned some medical products. I guess I would have thought that there could be applications for low-power SOI in other perhaps industrial or perhaps even comm, other related markets. So wondering is there a particular application or use case within medical? Or do you see that really is just the first market and you've got opportunities well beyond the medical market for that SOI process?
Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: You mentioned exactly right. There are other market segments that MPS couldn't – within the industrials, even autos and medicals, and for some of the product segments, we couldn't adjust it. And we think long and hard that's the high-voltage SOI is the best, it's the best way. So we took us a couple of years to develop that technology, and the first few products will be in the medical market segment.
Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: And, Michael, is that with one of the existing four foundries? Or will that be a process that require the new foundry engagement?
Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: We – both actually. This product is in the new foundry, yeah.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: New foundry.
Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay. Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Smigie with Raymond James. Your line is open.
Vincent Celentano - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks. This is Vince Celentano on for Steve. So, right now infotainment is your biggest part of revenue within auto. Is that more so due to Monolithic deciding that this is the area that you're best positioned to take share in? Or is it more of a matter of infotainment having the highest content opportunity? If it's the latter, what would you say are your next largest content opportunities within auto?
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: There are a number of opportunities that were designed into in automotive. I think that our initial footprint, when we started out in the area four years ago, was definitely in the infotainment. And now we've moved into many of the lighting systems, a lot of the systems that are either in the body or designed into sensors. We're into some of the light ADOS areas. So I don't think that we're necessarily restricted in any way, and that I think we have a broad set of offerings for automotive. And, as we referenced, we've had design wins and a lot of momentum that we expect to continue out into 2018 and 2019.
Vincent Celentano - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. And last quarter you mentioned that server was 10% to 15% of computing in 2015. Is there a way you can give us an update on what 2016 was, and what your expectations are for growth in 2017?
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: So I think that, with server, we feel very positive and optimistic. And that optimism is due to a lot of the reference designs that we have, in addition to the fact that, in the next generation Purley, we are going to be not just increasing the number of OEMs that we'll be working with, but also we'll be increasing the dollar content of going from something in the mid-teens up to the high $40 on a per-server basis. So we see, as the rollout occurs here in the second half of the year, that we should get some good momentum. And that we really should see some sales gains occurring in the early part of 2018.
Vincent Celentano - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Schafer with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Thanks. I'll add my congratulations, guys. Maybe a quick follow-up on server since we were just talking about it. Could you maybe walk us through or talk about the competitive landscape and what kind of visibility you guys have regarding market share on Purley, specifically later this year and as we look into 2018?
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Well, I think to begin with, on the servers, this is an area where we had essentially zero market share as recent as a couple of years ago. So this is almost a continuing greenfield opportunity for us. Obviously, there's a couple of very dominant players in this market who are very well established as far as their relationships, as well as the technology. The feedback that we've been receiving, particularly in the area of cloud computing that we're most interested in being able to take advantage of, has been very positive. We think that we have a unique offering that sufficiently differentiates ourself in order to be able to get the design win and also to command very attractive ASPs and margins.
Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. So, no hints on are there any visibility on what kind of market share you might kind of have there coming?
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: I think in a earlier call that we allowed for the potential of being between 10% and 20%. And again, I think that's a long-term opportunity and what we want to do is, remember, there's well-established competitors here and that we're starting from a very small space.
Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. Okay.
Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Yeah. Let me add something. Okay. And we can divide it into what the market share means, okay? And you see our servers are pretty steady growth and we will see the acceleration end of this year and next year. So which are these areas, okay? And a few years ago, our point of below (25:25) product penetrated into server. Now it's widely adopted and across the board. And two years ago, we introduced the electronic fuse and now became almost the sole source for some of the first-tier server makers. And from a core power, we penetrated, in the last couple years, we penetrated these second-tier server makers and now we're growing the revenues. And also, last year we penetrated a few first-tiers. However, we emphasize not on the bulk of the volumes and for a common footprint. We're not participate in that because those are lower margin product. We only concentrate on the highly efficient, high frequency. So those servers require that. And we believe in the longer term, that's the market trend. And we will get a majority (26:41) we will get a high percentage of our market shares in 2018 and in 2019.
Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Got it. That's really helpful, Michael. And then maybe as a follow-up, any update – I didn't hear you guys mention it in your prepared remarks, any update on the timing of your new website launch and where we are now with your new e-commerce initiative? And maybe as part of that answer, is there any way to help us quantify what that dollar opportunity or what that potential could be there, and what that ramp might look like?
Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: The programmable modules we're launching already. And you will see our – we're still selling through the traditional channels. However, the new website was delayed a little bit. But it will be either in March or in April, we will see the new website.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: And if I could add to this, there's sort of a continuum here where what we're beginning to see is good traction with regard to our pre-design modules where they're generating a good amount of money, a good amount of revenue on a quarterly basis. And then what we expect to do is introduce the new website, and that will be how we'll launch the field programmable modules as well. So I think that everything is tracking exactly as we had hoped it would.
Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Got it. And if I could just sneak one last one in. Just any update that you guys could give us on the Intersil lawsuit would be great. Thanks a lot.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Sure.
Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: We can't comment too much, okay, because that's in the courtroom in the legal proceedings. And that's the only thing we said, okay, MPS will defend vigorously our IP.
Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Matt Diamond - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, guys. This is actually Matt Diamond on Ross's behalf. I'll echo the congrats on the solid results. My question's been alluded to by some previous callers but I just want to ask it a little more directly. There was some talk in the script about the visibility into longer-term design engagements, one of which being server. I'm curious if you could give us the rough timing of the magnitude of those random – the high-end notebook solutions were mentioned, the gaming with QS Mod, and more generally the auto design win momentum. Is there any way to roughly time when that acceleration should happen? Or is it just the general framework that we should be thinking about, or thinking about that framework in general?
Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: We think in the second half of this year, in the server side the revenue will ramp, all the designing activity. Even though the core power, we still will gain a significant amount of market shares, okay? And those may not be in mainstreams, but we have in other – I'm talking about other first tiers. But it's a giant step for MPS.
Matt Diamond - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And the timing of gaming and auto, should we think of that then the same way as in the second half? Or would the timing differ?
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Well, I think as far as automotive, that's a continuation of the momentum that we've been generating in each of the last three prior years. Whereas gaming, I think that we have some new opportunities that will be additive and we should look for those to start to kick-in in Q3 of this year.
Matt Diamond - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And on the OpEx front, I know last year was an investment year. Could you give us your initial outlook for spending plans later in 2017? Obviously, we have the 1Q guide, but any initial color on OpEx for the rest of the year would be helpful.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Yeah. So I think you're familiar with what our long-term model is, and we want to grow operating expenses at a rate that is 50% to 60% that of our revenue growth rate. Certainly, in 2016, we've mentioned that we had some excellent opportunities as far as generating new product investments as well as sales and marketing resources, as well as the investment in our fourth fab. And we expect to continue to invest in all three of those initiatives, albeit at a lower rate of growth in 2017. And we do not plan to add head count at the same level as we did in 2016.
Matt Diamond - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Anil Doradla from William Blair. Your line is open.
Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Close enough. It's Doradla. So...
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: I was going to help out.
Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Michael and Bernie, congrats on my end, too. So, 2017, clearly a very inflection year in some ways, right? You've got, like, these three, four product segments. You talked about the server's second half. You've got the programmable stuff, you've got autos kicking in. So, when we step back, I think you've given some color, but if you were to sum it up really 2017 in general, it sounds like a pickup in the second half, primarily driven by the server. And how should I be looking at some of the programmable stuff? So, if you can help us understand kind of the objects of first half/second half big picture, that would be great.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Sure. I think just the way you positioned that comment is actually very helpful to understanding the dynamics here. We actually have three, four, five unique opportunities that are coming on-stream in 2017. And when we look at the timing and the order of magnitude for them, I think it's good to be a little bit cautious only because there are certain events that aren't 100% in our control and those that are we have some level of execution risk. So, as we look ahead to 2018, we believe that those elements will all have sorted itself out and that we'll be able to fully capitalize on the – take advantage of these opportunities.
Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Yeah. Let me add on. To me, the 2017 is done. All the designing products, okay, I don't think our customer can change it. And it will take an extraordinary effort to change that. And so when the revenue happens, okay, particularly in the cloud computing, but some of the notebooks, some of the servers and some of the data centers, and these are depending our customers. And also, the third-party really the product is like Intel's processors. And so to me, these all done within plus or minus of a few months. So, related to other market segments like auto, this is very steady-state growth. We seen a lot more designing activities in the last couple of years. That all will translate into revenues second half of 2017 and 2018. And at the same time, don't forget we still have a high-end consumer business. IC and IoT will grow this year tremendously.
Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Right. So sounds like from the investment community point of view, I think we should be focused on the server opportunity in 2017. That seems to be the most perhaps material delta as the year progresses.
Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Frankly, I see very similar growth rate.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Yeah.
Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: And the company designed it that way, very balanced growth, and with growth in the high rate.
Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Right. Okay.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Yeah. I'd have to agree with Michael there that I think that you'd be limiting the message to focus solely on servers. I mean we're, again, very excited about that opportunity, but not at the expense of what we're seeing with the high-end notebooks, what we're seeing with the gaming opportunity. And Michael brought to light what we're seeing with appliances through the Internet of Things and high-end consumer.
Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. And finally, Bernie, your guidance of 54.8% to 55.8% on the gross margin front similar to what you guided, I think, in the December quarter. But given that the mix and the mix shift seems to be moving towards some of these higher margin businesses, is that guidance based on just conservativeness? I mean, I'm thinking that the gross margin should trend upwards as the year goes by.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Yeah. I think that if you look at how we progressed gross margin in 2016, we went up 10 to 20 basis points quarter-over-quarter. So we ended up with gross margin in Q4 that was 40 basis points higher than the year before. And I would expect a similar trend line to occur. You are right that a lot of the new revenue growth is at higher margins. And we're also seeing some of the investments we made, particularly with the new fab, that those should also generate improvements to gross margin. But the thing that we want to manage first and foremost is very predictable, modest, as I said, 10 to 20 basis points increases in gross margin, and to the extent that we can afford to add in lower margin business to accelerate revenue growth, that's really what our business model is based around.
Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks a lot, guys.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Your line is open.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes. Michael, Bernie, congratulations on another solid growth year. First question is on the high-voltage SOI process. Should we think about the competitive advantage share being similar to some of your other processes, meaning being able to integrate many components? Or are there other elements to the advantage as well?
Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Exactly. And including other components down the road. And we think that this is really a game change, okay? We take a look at the other opportunities and the technology that we targeted. And so we will be able to deliver signal much more cleaner. And also, we integrate a lot more than a silicon technology is capable.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Very good. And my second question is on your module business. So could you just update us where you stand there? And are you in production already on the programmable module products?
Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: It is in production now. And sales volumes are very little and just at the initial stage. And these are mostly for industrial applications and also smaller customers, variety of them, and including some of the small customers in the consumer space. And so we really emphasize the website which we'll launch in March or April.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: And I think that there's also a longer-term opportunity in the communications market for the field programmability. So it's sort of an interesting product family where we're trying to encourage more of these low-end, small volume industrial and consumer opportunities, but at the same time we see a longer-term opportunity in the wireless infrastructure for the comms market.
Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Yeah. Forgot about the programmable product for telecom, for the infrastructures. And that we launched a product, and again you can see on the YouTube, you can see on our website, you can parallel all of them from 20 amps to all the way to 1,000 amps. And in the APAC show (40:49) in March, we will demonstrate something like 1,000 amps or 2,000 amps solutions. And those are one of a kind and well, well received among telecom companies.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And maybe on the topic of communications, it was flat year-over-year. And sort of in the spirit of balanced growth, how should we think about the communications market for you this year? Do you expect some growth? Or will it still maybe lag a little bit some of the other end markets?
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: I think, at this point, and again let's talk about the nature of the market, you've got the gateway wireless, which tends to be a little bit low end and has some characteristics that are similar to consumer. And then you have the higher-end network, which, as we were just talking, we believe has great promise for us. We're very committed to that part of the market. As we are just introducing the products now, and while the feedback has been very positive from the telco companies, it's like any product release, it takes time. And this tends to be a lumpy marketplace where you can – if you win a large customer, you can have a significant order. But the time it takes to win the trust and win the relationship and demonstrate the value of your technology, it makes it a little hard to predict. So I think the way we've tended to look at the comms market is it can be any quarter plus or minus $1 million, and there will be a point of inflection but it's probably later in 2018.
Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Yes. Very much agree.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Fair enough. Just one last question. We're hearing about some foundry capacity getting tight. You're obviously expecting another good growth year this year. Do you feel like you have, with all your foundry partners, you have all the capacity in place for another good growth year this year?
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Yes. We've made the investment in order to be able to manage the growth for 2018-2019 and even beyond that. And it's not just on pure capacity, but as we're referencing as far as a partner to help us with the new technology, we feel very, very well-positioned.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Very good. Congrats again. Thank you.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Thank you.
Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And we have a follow-up from Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company. Your line is open.
Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: Hi, guys. Just wanted to sort of follow up on some of these new product drivers. You've got high-end notebooks ramping nicely through the year. You've got the new game console. You've got Purley power management. A lot of those seem like they're pretty back-end loaded into the second half of the year. You typically have pretty strong seasonality with the third quarter typically the peak. I guess what I'm trying to get a sense of is do you think that these new opportunities and the timing of those ramps could change seasonal patterns this year and into 2018? Or is it best to sort of think that those products ramp, but probably don't ramp to such a degree that it's going to change your typical seasonal pattern?
Michael R. Hsing - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Yeah. That's a very good question, so that we are also puzzled (44:37). MPS like a trend has a start about four, five years ago, have a transition also like into more diverse market segments. And last year, I hope that we had every quarter's consecutive growth, okay, but we think with a lack of Q4. But Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4 is shy just a little. And so, obviously, the pattern is changing and what we'll see probably this year is a very similar or even I can hope – I still hope we can have a consecutive quarter-to-quarter growth for four or five quarters in a row.
Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you, Michael.
Operator: Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. Bernie Blegen for any closing remarks.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.: Great. I would like to thank you all for joining us for this conference call and look forward to talking to you again during our first quarter conference call, which will be most likely at the end of April. Thank you and have a nice day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Monolithic Power Systems' Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the floor over to Bernie Blegen, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.
Bernie Blegen: Thank you, Karen [ph]. Good afternoon and welcome to the third quarter 2016 Monolithic Power Systems conference call. In the course of today's conference call we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risks and uncertainty which could cause results to differ materially from management's current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor Statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor Statements contained in the Q3 earnings release and in our SEC filings, including Form 10-K filed on February 29, 2016 which is accessible through our website, www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today's call. We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, operating income, interest and other income, net income, and earnings on both a GAAP and on a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the Q3 2016, Q2 2016 and Q3 2016 releases, as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our website. I'd also like to remind you that today's conference call is being webcast live over the internet and will be available for replay on our website for one year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. Revenue for the third quarter was $106.5 million, up 16.7% from a year ago. Non-GAAP gross margin at 55.3% was 20 basis points higher from the prior year, and non-GAAP operating income was $29.4 million, up 24% year over year. Our growth in third quarter revenue over the prior year was due primarily to a 30% gain in computing and storage revenue and continued growth in our industrial market segment where revenue increased 22.8%. In our computing segment, revenue increased to $23.5 million compared with the $18.0 million reported in the prior year, reflecting strength in high-performance notebooks and servers. In our computing and storage market segment, much of the revenue increase is attributable to market validation of our power management solution based on MPS's digitally designed quantum state modulation or QS Mod. Digital design allows our power management module to deliver the precise amount of power even as processor requirements go from peak to minimal in as little as a few nanoseconds. This is critical as cloud computing servers include a number of power-hungry features such as quad-core processors. The increasing power requirements of these features introduces difficult trade-offs for OEM power supply designers. In order to meet these dynamic power requirements while maintaining a small form factor, designs must be extremely energy efficient and plays a premium on reducing component count, complexity and size. We believe these characteristics, characteristics which are specific to our proprietary digitally designed QS Mod products are valuable to OEM designers. As the server market transitions from Intel's Grantley family to Purley in about one year's time, we expect this significant design win activity we have enjoyed to date to translate into market share and revenue gains. In our industrial segment, sales rose to $23.2 million, compared with $18.9 million reported in the prior year, fueled by increased product sales for automotive and smart meters. Over the past few years, MPS has been recognized by tier 1 OEM automotive customers as a high-quality and reliable supplier. We expect our future growth in automotive will be supported by the attractiveness of our superior efficiency and ease of use. We will continue to invest in our quality and customer support capabilities as we enjoy gains within this market segment. In our consumer segment, revenue increased 10.5% to $43.6 million, compared with $39.5 million in Q3 of 2015. A majority of this increase was driven by sales gains in IoT and home appliances. As we look ahead, we see continued improvement in IoT, home and appliances, gaming and other selective high-value consumer opportunities. In our communication market segment, revenue of $16.2 million rose $1.4 million from the year-ago quarter, reflecting gains in gateway revenue. Finally, development of our E.MOTION product family is continuing, with customers evaluating our single-chip prototype. We are further refining the software and firmware and optimizing its performance based on specific customer demand. We remain positive about this game-changing E.MOTION technology. Turning back to the financials. Compared with the prior quarter, Q3 2016 revenue increased $12.4 million or 13%, reflecting revenue gains in computing, consumer and communications. Revenue mix for the quarter was 41% consumer, 22% industrial, 22% computing, and 15% communications. Q3 non-GAAP net income was $27.5 million or $0.66 per fully diluted share, compared with $0.55 per share in Q3 2015 and $0.54 per share in the previous quarter. This result is computed with an estimated tax rate of 7.5%. Let's review our operating expenses. As indicated on last quarter's call, we expect an increase in operating expenses this quarter as we ramped investment in new product development, incurred costs associated with the development of our fourth fab, and capitalized on new business opportunities through strategic sales and marketing investments. As such, our non-GAAP third quarter 2016 operating expenses of $29.4 million were $1.7 million higher than the $27.7 million we spent in the second quarter of 2016. Our third quarter 2016 GAAP operating expenses of $42.9 million were $3.5 million higher than GAAP operating expenses reported in the second quarter. The difference between non-GAAP and GAAP operating expenses for these quarters is stock compensation and an unfunded deferred compensation plan. Stock comp expense increased $1.8 million between quarters, reflecting a catch-up adjustment for the performance-based element of our MPSU program. Now let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $264.4 million at the end of the third quarter of 2016, up $15.2 million from the $249.2 million at the end of the prior quarter. Third quarter cash flow from operations was $33.3 million, compared with $12.8 million reported in the prior quarter. This increase in cash flow reflected a decrease in net working capital and other long-term assets. Spending on capital equipment and office-based totaled $11.1 million. We paid $8.2 million in dividends in third quarter. Accounts receivable ended the third quarter at $33.3 million, up from the $31.4 million at the end of the prior quarter. Days of sales outstanding were 28 days -- days of sales outstanding were 28 days in the third quarter of 2016, which was 2 days lower than the year-ago quarter and 2 days lower than the 30 days reported in the second quarter of 2016. Our internal inventories at the end of the second quarter were $70.7 million, higher than the $69.9 million at the end of the prior quarter. Days in inventory at the end of Q3 of 133 days decreased 14 days from 147 days at the end of Q2. Inventory in our distribution channel decreased from the Q2 2016 level, reflecting an overall increase in end-customer demand. I would like now to turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2016. We are forecasting Q4 revenue in the range of $101 million to $105 million. We also expect the following. Non-GAAP gross margin will be in the range of 54.8% to 55.8%. GAAP gross margin will be in the range of 53.9% to 54.9%. Total stock-based compensation expense will be between $11.8 million to $13.8 million. Litigation expenses will be between $100,000 to $200,000. Non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense will be in the range of $27.3 million to $29.3 million. This estimate excludes stock compensation and litigation expenses. Interest and other income should be between $200,000 to $300,000 before foreign exchange gains and losses. Fully diluted shares will be in the range of 42.0 million to 43.0 million shares. In conclusion, thanks to acceptance of our new product offerings and with our shareholder support, we will continue to invest and deliver outstanding products for our customers and consistent results to our shareholders. I'll now open the phone lines for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Anil Doradla from William Blair.
Anil Doradla - William Blair: Hey guys. Good job and congrats. So I had a couple of questions. So, can you go over the compute strength, especially in the context of Purley and what's going on? Has there been any change? And if so, what are the key reasons here?
Bernie Blegen: Thank you, Anil. So as far as the current quarter performance, we really saw the growth drivers to be sort of evenly split between our performance in high-end notebooks as well as in the server model. And as we look out ahead, those should be continued sources of strength, well into next year, before the Purley cycle transitions. So at this point, as far as the adoption rate and the ramp activity that we've been expecting, we don't see any changes.
Anil Doradla - William Blair: Okay, great. And on automotive, can you give some qualitative idea of the contribution? I know you've had somewhere, anywhere between I think one-third or something like that. How much of -- is auto as part of the industrial today?
Bernie Blegen: Sure. So I usually wait until I get a full year of activity before we sort of break out the segmentation. So you are correct that, at the end of last year, automotive accounted for about a third of industrial, which would represent about 7% of our total. It has been growing at an attractive double-digit rate, high double-digit rate, albeit not as fast as it had in 2014 and 2015 when it doubled.
Anil Doradla - William Blair: Great, guys.
Michael Hsing: This is Michael. This is Michael.
Anil Doradla - William Blair: Hi, Michael.
Michael Hsing: Yeah. Both automotive and computing segments are -- where MPS just entered only two or three years in the market. Three years ago we have a zero revenues and now we have a fraction of the total market size. So the opportunity for growth is very big.
Anil Doradla - William Blair: Excellent. Congrats guys, and looking forward to a great 2017.
Bernie Blegen: Thank you.
Michael Hsing: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rich Schafer from Oppenheimer.
Rich Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co.: Thanks guys, and great quarter. I had a couple of questions. Maybe the first one, I haven't asked this one before, but I know we focus a lot on your opportunities with all your new products, your new markets you're getting into and penetrating. But if we look at your business by customer, can you comment on any significant new opportunities there? Any sort of potential 10% type customers that you see over the next year or two?
Michael Hsing: We don't see it. We have -- we gained more than 10% of number of -- 10% of customers. As a matter of fact, we don't have any. And in the last few years we tried to hard to diversify the company product portfolio and also customer portfolio -- customer profile. And we found out in the last few years that we expand our customer base by, I don't have exact numbers, by four, five times. And probably even more. And so it's a lot more than diversified now. And I will continue our -- in the future, I will continue to see the same trend.
Rich Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co.: Okay.
Bernie Blegen: And probably add to that, very quickly, is that we're able to demonstrate in a lot of different market segments where we've been introduced to new customers and we've started out with some relatively low-end offerings and then we've been able to incorporate their feedback into our design and sort of go up as far as the amount of dollar content that we sell into them. So I think that in addition to just the pure acquisition of new customers that Michael referenced, we've also been able to do a good job of capitalizing on those relationships and growing them.
Rich Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co.: Okay. And then just a follow-up on storage, I mean it's up very big again for you guys. I mean, are we already beginning to see the benefit of the ASP bump you guys enjoy with the new PCIe and SAS PMICs, or is this something else that's driving the growth and that's still going to be an incremental leg-up?
Bernie Blegen: I think that in storage, and again I referenced this in the previous call, is that, you're exactly correct that we have very good opportunities there and it is as we increase the dollar content. The real story in the segment has to do again with the notebooks and servers. In storage we have sort of a mixed view as you've got some gains accruing in SSD and then some sort of mixed signals in the HDD market. So I think that you're going to see a very positive trend for that segment that's going to be at or just below our corporate average, but really the near-term growth drivers are in the servers and in the notebooks.
Rich Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co.: Got it. And then my last question, and I know Michael will laugh [ph], I know he says he can't grow the company out of thin air, but fourth quarter OpEx seems a little higher than we expected. I mean, what drives that in 4Q? And when can we expect OpEx growth to probably drop closer to your target range, closer to 50% of top line? Thanks.
Michael Hsing: Well, I'll let Bernie to answer that question.
Bernie Blegen: I'd be happy to. Thank you very much, Michael. So as far as the operating expenses, I think that two of the big growth drivers there have been our investment in new products as well as an increase in investment in sales and marketing. And much of this has been achieved through headcount acquisitions. While the pace of those headcount additions is probably going to slow, we'll need to annualize those costs next year, and then on top of that, we will continue to make selective net headcount additions. So the punch line in this is that we're probably going to look at a flattening in our rate of growth and returning to, you know, our expense model, but we don't expect to go, you know, see a decrease in the growth of -- the rate of growth of the operating expenses.
Rich Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co.: Got it. Thanks guys.
Michael Hsing: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank: Hey guys. I wanted to ask a little bit of a longer-term question. On the last call you talked about getting your revenue growth maybe at or above even 20% the back half of next year. It sounds like you have a lot of good drivers just from tonight's call that you've already talked about. But if we put it in a 2017 as a whole perspective, what do you think will be the biggest tailwinds from a product cycle point of view? And are there any headwinds?
Michael Hsing: I don't see any headwinds and all these products, like servers and like power modules and among the other things, okay, we talk about it, and a lot of them, especially from a computing side, is not really up to MPS, okay? We did what we can and all the seats are planted [ph]. And we see the initial results. And the higher growth, okay, as we expected -- high growth rate and we expected next few years, is all depending on the whether the adoption rate of new models. And this is the same as in all the other area. We have many design win activities and many projects under qualifications, and whether it's -- if we're going the same trend and the growth rate will be much higher than the corporate average in all the segments.
Bernie Blegen: And just to add to that, is that I think you did a good job of saying that the two near-term growth drivers are firmly in place and we're seeing good execution. And then as we look to next year, we believe that the ramp of new product introductions, in particular with the new server opportunity, as well as the modules start to ramp, will be additive to that.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank: I guess that's a perfect lead-in to my follow-up. When you were talking about the near-term trends, the positive trends in the computing side of things, you mentioned a good roadmap of growth up until Purley. Talk a little bit about what happens again when Purley launches? Because, correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe that actually should be a further acceleration as opposed to what could have been perceived in your answer prior as something changing to the negative.
Bernie Blegen: Exactly right. Thank you, giving me the chance to clarify that point. Is that, as we looked at the last two to three years, we've developed relationships with many of the tier 1 and tier 2 server providers. And in the Grantley, the current version, we've sold low dollar content for point of load and for e-fuses [ph]. And as we looked to the transition to the Purley sometime in the fall of next year, we expect also to be able to complement those sales with our V-core [ph] solution. So our dollar content per server will go from $13 per box up to $49 per box. So we're very optimistic with the design wins that we've already seen converting into market share and revenue gains.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank: Great. Thank you.
Michael Hsing: Okay, let me, okay, add on this. I don't have -- in terms of a high growth rate in the 2017, okay. As I said it earlier, we expected that. In this near term, and I don't have any crystal ball as everybody else, but I'm very firmly believe and in the future, 2017, 2018, 2019, when everything is in place.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank: Great. Thanks again.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Quinn Bolton from Needham.
Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co.: Hi, Michael; hi, Bernie. Just wanted to ask one on the OpEx. You guys have been ramping or spending on ramp in a fourth foundry. And I think on the last call you had said that most of those incremental expenses would be wrapped up by the third quarter. Just wanted to see if you could give us an update on the fourth foundry spending?
Bernie Blegen: Sure. The fourth foundry has been developing quite nicely and in fact almost entirely according to plan. So we're actually very pleased with the development. Now the news that's additive to that is that we've made the decision to be able to transfer more new products into the fourth fab because we find that it's -- the capacity is there to take advantage of, as well as there are certain cost advantages that we've been able to take advantage of. So on that basis, we would see that we're going to continue to invest into next year, albeit at a lower rate, but still there'll be, you know, additional wafer spend and map sets as we bring the new products up in the next two to three quarters.
Michael Hsing: Yeah. Overall we just do it as we promised. We grow revenues, okay, and we grow the OpEx, less than 60% of the revenue growth. And so last year, everybody criticized us, we go 61%, okay, [inaudible] just 1%. Next year we'll be in the model.
Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co.: Great. Okay. And then I was wondering, I think you guys -- you talked about your high-value consumer opportunities for a while. I think one of those being gaming. It sounds like you guys have had some success on that front. Just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color as you look into 2017, how important gaming could be next year.
Bernie Blegen: Sure. I think that we've been consistent there as far as once again it's an area where there's three primary gaming companies and we've been developing relationships primarily with two of them, although not to the exclusion of the third. And once again I think we've seen that we've started out with sort of lower-value content and then been able to further develop those relationships and increase the content. So as we look ahead to design wins that we have solidified for next year, we seem very positive for continuing growth in gaming.
Michael Hsing: The gaming is just like any other segment. We have -- we clearly see our advantage in being, as a matter of fact, in all computing segments. Gaming is a part of it and use a lot of computing power and it's very opportunistic, and we will get the market.
Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co.: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg from Stifel.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel Nicolaus: Yes, thank you, and congratulations on another record quarter. You want a trick-or-treat question? Sorry, bad joke. So, first question, can we dig into automotive a little bit more? You talked about your dollar [ph] content in server. But if we look at automotive, my understanding is so far most of the growth has been coming from LED lighting. At what point do you start to see really an inflection point as far as dollar [ph] content in automotive and what are some of the technologies or components that would come from?
Bernie Blegen: Sure. I think that I'm going to answer this from the inverse as far as some of the areas that were probably not as receptive to go into, and then I can develop the more optimistic form of the answer, is that automotive is an area that we want to be measured where we invest our technology. We're doing a very good job as far as developing our QA and our reliability, but there are areas in the automobile such as the powered train and the ADAS that may not be as high a value to us when you take into account what the risk potential could be. So we'll continue to expand in our areas that we have much more strength as far as the infotainment, as in the body lighting and audio systems, and in certain aspects, both safety as well as in the networking. But we're also making sort of a cautious approach to automotive so that we make sure that we are able to uphold what's best for the company as well as for our shareholders.
Michael Hsing: Yeah, the automotive, we will be criticized that if we spend money to build up the infrastructures for all these safeties [inaudible]. And now we just play what we can. And we're not explaining the budget.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay, that's helpful. And a question on the quantum state modulation technology. Obviously that's giving you great success for design wins in the server market. Is there any other areas out there that we should keep an eye on as far as where that technology is applied and you're gaining some design wins?
Michael Hsing: Yeah. As we said -- as I said the last quarter, we didn't do well in the communication area. So, although we gained some high-value targets and we exchanged with low to more in the high value content in the revenue stream. I said we will release some good killer products in the market segment, and that's a quantum state, QS Mod, like we'll have a series of products we're going to announce in this quarter. And if you go to Electronica, we will show it there.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel Nicolaus: Very good. One last question, you've obviously talked in the past about programmable power modules. I was just hoping to get an update there, because that technology is sort of thought of being used to go after the industrial market. And just want to understand your success there so far, especially with the sales strategy.
Michael Hsing: It is slow process, okay. We gain market -- many segments of the market accepted it, that from IoT, from industrials, autos and communication segment, even computing, that's in the service, right? And the revenue is ramping but it's still small. It's not that small anymore, but it's ramping. It hasn't really moved the needle yet, the entire company's revenue. That, I expected that will be next few years you will see a significant revenue contributors.
Bernie Blegen: And just to sort of complete the thought, what differentiates us is both the power management technology, but as importantly, it's the energy efficiency and the ease of use. And we think that, as we look forward to the adoption rates, particularly as we convert from the predesigned modules into field programmability, we see significant opportunities. We're very committed to this market.
Michael Hsing: The product that we're going to announce is -- we'll have any current up to 500 amp current, up to 500 amp. And everything can be modulized and require a very or no -- very minimal or no design work.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel Nicolaus: Very good. Congratulations again guys.
Michael Hsing: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Wong from Wells Fargo.
David Wong - Wells Fargo Securities: Thanks so much. Can you give us a rough idea of what proportion of your storage division, storage and computing division, is servers? And was the year-over-year growth in server in the September quarter?
Bernie Blegen: Sure. The servers, again using the full year numbers, the -- I'm sorry, did you say storage or servers?
David Wong - Wells Fargo Securities: Servers. Yes, what proportion is servers?
Bernie Blegen: Okay. So again using last year as sort of the baseline for it, servers only accounted for between 10% and 15% of the market segment, and the growth of servers is not quite triple digits but it's in the very high double digits this year.
David Wong - Wells Fargo Securities: Great. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie from Raymond James.
Steve Smigie - Raymond James: Great. Thanks guys. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about computing in Q3 and Q4 or all storage and computing, in the sense that, thinking what we saw with Intel, had a very strong quarter, but then the guidance is a little bit below expectations. It sounds like overall the business is looking really great, but I just want to try to make sure I have expectations right for Q4. Would it be fair to say that Q3 is maybe a little bit stronger than expected and so Q4 might be down a little bit more than seasonal or something like that?
Bernie Blegen: So if you look at Intel, they're looking at the desktop and the notebook market in total, both the high end and low end. And we're benefiting from sort of an upswing that's occurring currently with both the adoption of our technology into the high-end notebooks, as well as the development of pretty strong performance in the high-end notebook market. So that's what differentiates ourselves I think from their story. And we did have a good performance in Q3 which actually fell in line with our expectations, and we don't necessarily see that same falloff in Q4.
Steve Smigie - Raymond James: Okay, great. And then within industrial, you guys mentioned the strength in metering as you did last quarter. Can you talk about how big that is? And I'm assuming overall industrials is still pretty disperse and that's just kind of one example, but I was kind of wondering how impactful metering is to that overall business at this point.
Bernie Blegen: Sure. Metering has actually been growing very, very well. And while we tend to focus primarily on the automotive part of the story of industrial, meter is growing at a rate that is significantly above our corporate average and it's not from an insubstantial base. So when you look industrial, again, as you said, we are very diversified because we also have sources coming -- revenue sources coming from meter as well as security and point-of-sale systems, and all three of those lines are developing quite nicely.
Steve Smigie - Raymond James: Okay. And last question was just, could you give some sense sequentially how you might expect each of the segments to perform?
Bernie Blegen: Sequentially, I think if you look at our guidance here, revenue is decreasing in Q4 a little less than normal seasonal average. And really that reflects the diversification because we're seeing sort of flattish performance in the communications and computing. You have a normal sort of seasonal down in consumer and we still see good growth in industrial.
Steve Smigie - Raymond James: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is a follow-up from the line of Tore Svanberg from Stifel. He just left the queue. With no additional questions at this time, I would like to turn the conference back over to Bernie Blegen for closing comments.
Bernie Blegen: I'd like to thank you all for joining us on the conference call and look forward to talking to you again in the fourth quarter conference call. Thank you and have a happy Halloween.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

===== 2016 Q2  (2016-07-25 17:00:00) =====
Executives: Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer
Analysts: Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker) Matt Diamond - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC Melissa A. Fairbanks - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Monolithic Power Systems' Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the meeting over to Michael Hsing, CEO of Monolithic Power Systems. Please go ahead, sir.
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Good afternoon and welcome to second quarter's 2016 Monolithic Power conference call. First of all, let me introduce you to MPS' new CFO, Bernie Blegen. As you already know, Bernie has been with the MPS as our Corporate Controller for the past five years. It's our philosophy that we give our internal candidate the first opportunity to rise to the rank. In the past two quarters, Bernie has been well received by our shareholders after having worked with many of you. So now please join with me to congratulate Bernie on his new role. Now I pass to Bernie.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer: Michael, thank you very much, and I want to thank you for all the support and the confidence that you've shown in me. I am excited about the new responsibilities and being part of MPS' future growth. I also look forward to working closely with many of you on the phone with us today. Turning now to the Safe Harbor disclosures. In the course of today's conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management's current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q2 earnings release, and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on February 29, 2016, which is accessible through our website, www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today's call. We will be discussing gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, interest and other income, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the Q2 2015, Q1 2016 and Q2 2016 releases, as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted to our website. I'd also like to remind you that today's conference call is being webcast live over the Internet, and will be available for replay on our website for one year along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. MPS is pleased to announce our financial results for the second quarter as follows. Our second quarter revenue of $94.1 million was on the high-end of our guidance and represented a 15.6% increase from the prior year quarter. MPS' non-GAAP gross margin of 55.1% was 10 basis points higher than the prior year. Second quarter non-GAAP operating income was $24.1 million, up 21.5% from the same quarter in 2015. The quarterly revenue increase over the prior year was fueled primarily by growth in our industrial and computing markets. Looking at year-over-year revenue growth by market segment, computing revenue grew 45% from 2015, industrial was up 41% and consumer revenue was higher by 8%. Second quarter communication revenue fell 14% from the prior year. Let me speak to the results of each end market. In our industrial segment, sales rose to $22.9 million compared with $16.2 million reported in the prior year, fueled by increased product sales in automotive, smart meters and a variety of industrial equipment. Although the design cycle can take three or more years, the multi-billion dollar industrial market offers us a significant growth opportunity. Over the past few years, MPS has been recognized by Tier 1 OEM customers as a high quality and reliable supplier. We expect our future growth will be well supported by our expanding product pipeline built on MPS' well-known technologies, which deliver superior efficiency and ease-of-use. We will continue to invest in our quality and customer support capabilities. Gains in this market will be key to MPS' sustainable long-term growth model. In our computing segment, revenue increased to $18.3 million compared with $12.6 million reported in the prior year reflecting strength in servers, storage, and high-performance notebooks. This growth represents an early validation of our QS Mod product family, which we expect will gain traction during the next design cycles for cloud servers. Looking ahead, we have been continuing to gain designing momentum in the broader computing market. In our consumer segment, revenue increased to $38.3 million compared with $35.5 million driven primarily by gains in high-value consumer products. In our communication segment, revenue of $14.6 million fell $2.4 million from the $17.0 million reported in the year ago quarter. In the last six quarters, revenue in our communication segment has been fluctuating within a range of $3 million due to changes in our customers' new project launch schedule. Q1 2016 demand was on the high side, and in this quarter we saw weaker demand. While in this low-end market our near-term revenue trend is flattish, we are excited about our long-term prospects as we're about to launch our premium FPPM modules to address central office, cell phone towers, and data centers. These modules are an ideal fit for the infrastructure market. Turning now to our E.MOTION products development, customers have begun evaluating our single chip prototypes. We are further refining the software and firmware and optimizing its performance, based on specific customer demand. We remain positive about this game changing E.MOTION technologies. Turning back to the financials. Compared with the prior quarter, Q2 2016 revenue increased $9.6 million or 11% as revenue gains in the industrial, computing and consumer segments were partially offset by a decrease in our communication revenue. Revenue mix for the quarter was 41% consumer, 24% industrial, 19% computing and 16% communication. That represents a shift from the prior quarter with a two percentage point increase in the contribution from industrial and a four point reduction in the communication market. Non-GAAP gross margin of 55.1% was up 10 basis points from the prior quarter. Non-GAAP operating income was $24.1 million compared with the $20.0 million reported in the prior quarter. Q2 non-GAAP net income was $22.6 million or $0.54 per fully diluted share compared with $0.45 per share in the previous quarter. Let's review our operating expenses. As we indicated on last quarter's call, we expected a slight increase in operating expenses this quarter, as we began to ramp investments in new product development, bring up our fourth fab and capitalize on new business opportunities through strategic sales and marketing investments. As such, our non-GAAP second quarter 2016 operating expenses of $27.7 million were $1.3 million higher than the $26.4 million we spent in the first quarter of 2016. As our business grows, our operating expenses may fluctuate in the short-term, but we remain committed to operating within our financial model. Our second quarter 2016 GAAP operating expenses of $39.4 million were $4.3 million higher than the GAAP operating expenses recorded in the first quarter. The difference between non-GAAP and GAAP operating expenses for these quarters is stock compensation and an unfunded deferred compensation plan. Stock comp expenses increased $2.8 million between quarters, reflecting a one-time $2.9 million expense reversal recorded in Q1. Switching to the bottom-line, on a non-GAAP basis, our Q2 net income was $22.6 million or $0.54 per fully diluted share. This result is computed with an estimated tax rate of 7.5%. Q2 2016 GAAP net income was $11.2 million or $0.27 per fully diluted share. Now let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $249.2 million at the end of second quarter of 2016, down $7.7 million from the $256.9 million at the end of the prior quarter. Second quarter cash flow from operations was $12.8 million compared with $27.1 million reported in the prior quarter. This decrease in cash flow reflected an increase in net working capital and other long-term assets. Spending on capital equipment and office space totaled $12.6 million. We paid $8.5 million in dividends in second quarter. Accounts receivable ended the second quarter at $31.4 million, up from the $28.8 million at the end of the prior quarter. Days of sales outstanding were 30 days in the second quarter of 2016, which was the same as the year ago quarter and one day lower than the 31 days reported in the first quarter 2016. Our internal inventories at the end of the second quarter were $69.9 million, higher than the $62.3 million at the end of the prior quarter. Days of inventory at the end of Q2 of 147 days increased slightly from the 145 days at the end of Q1. Inventory in our distribution channel decreased from the Q1 2016 level, reflecting an overall increase in end customer demand. I would now like to turn to our outlook for the third quarter of 2016. We are forecasting Q3 revenue in the range of $104 million to $108 million. We also expect the following. Non-GAAP gross margin will be in the range of 54.8% to 55.8%. GAAP gross margin will be in the range of 54.0% to 55.0%. Total stock-based compensation expense will be between $10.7 million to $12.7 million. Litigation expenses of $100,000 to $300,000. Non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to be in the range of $28.3 million to $30.3 million. This estimate excludes stock compensation and litigation expenses. Interest in other income of $200,000 to $300,000 before foreign exchange gains or losses, fully diluted shares to be in the range of 41.4 million to 42.4 million shares. In conclusion, as we continue to execute against our long-term business strategy, we believe the success of our new product development will further propel MPS' future growth. I'll now open the phone lines for questions.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Rick Schafer from Oppenheimer.
Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hi. Congrats on the job Bernie and congrats on a nice quarter you guys.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer: Rick, thanks so much.
Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks. So I had a couple of questions. So first really on the comps business. I know it's kind of been treading water. I know you said, plus or minus $3 million for the last 18 months or so. Can maybe we get a little more color on what's being going on with mix over that 18 months? I mean have we seen mix improvement maybe away from gateway and maybe more towards the networking side of things? And then maybe some color on when we might see stabilization ahead of the sort of FPPM ramp?
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer: Sure. And I think that you focused on a very key element there is that, while we have been sort of treading water with the market segment in total, there's been a pronounced shift as we've been moving increasingly towards the telecom and away from the gateway and the wireless per se. So as far as looking at the trend lines going forward, we see that displacement continuing, but again there isn't necessarily a point of inflection until we get the new product releases that we expect to start coming out in the middle second half of 2017.
Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. So we should sort of keep thinking that this is sort of a lumpy business for the next few quarters?
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. As we speaking, so we – traditional gateway business in the – this was MPS traditional business. And as we are speaking, we are changing the content in the last few years by 50%. And so the legacy business is only about 50% of that total. All the other ones has a much higher margin and that we are gradually changing it. As you know, the telecom business, it takes a while and these are the products we offer the better performers, but not really our outstanding. They must have it. The next generation product, we feel like that there's a lot of wow factors in it; and a lot of people that want those product. And I think it will lead MPS in the particularly, in the telecom areas, in the new directions.
Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then as my follow-up, maybe this is a weird question, but your auto business is obviously – I think it's doubled the last couple – each of the last couple years, I think it's on track to do that again this year and starting to get to be a real material contributor to revenues. I mean, maybe a weird comparison, but does that kind of – how do you think of that in terms of your server business? I mean does that have the same type of dollar potential of your server business, and maybe just it's a year or 18 months kind of behind the automotive ramp. If we look out two years or three years, I mean, are we talking about something that could be up $50 million business or more?
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: I think the $50 million for a server was a – it's a failure.
Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay.
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: We're looking for a lot, lot, lot higher numbers.
Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer: I think that you've touched on a good point there as far as the parallel between the two, and that we're little further ahead in the automotive as far as how we were able to make the long-term commitment to the market that it takes to get designed in, and we're seeing those benefits now. And likewise, we've just released particularly the QS MOD products that are ideally suited to the servers going forward. And with the next design cycle for the Intel processors, we expect to pick up an awful lot of that business and market share.
Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And if I could just sneak one more in, you guys. Any update on the ramp at your new foundry, and what percent of costs are in now versus what's left out there, Bernie?
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. I think that we've been very consistent as far as how we portrayed this, that we had about a $2 million investment to make in this year. We'll have cycled through the majority of that by the end of Q3, and there may be a little bit of tail into Q4, but as I said in the previous call, we've already started taking the material deliveries from the fab.
Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.
Matt Diamond - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, guys. This is actually Matt Diamond on Ross' behalf. Congrats on the solid quarter. I wanted to ask, why is the CapEx notably higher year-over-year. Could you give us any specificity on what's driving that?
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer: Sure. We have a couple of things that are going on. We have a relatively consistent spend rate that has to do with the testing equipment, mainly in our Chengdu facility. This time we also purchased a office space for our Shenzhen location. And so, the two of those events are really costing the bump up, but when you look at the office space investment, we are doing that on a basis that expands our capacity as far as the number of people that we can have in that office, and we're doing that on the basis that is less dilutive than if we had continued to rent.
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: The operating cost was the higher, so they helped the EPS.
Matt Diamond - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Understood. And that actually feeds into my next question. I heard the answer to the ramp of the fourth foundry, but is there anything else to call out in your 3Q OpEx guide as far as any other operating costs or anything more specific there would be helpful?
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer: No. As we referenced in the script here, we did a fair amount of staffing in Q3. Some of that was related to new product investment. A lot of it was also related to sales and marketing resources. So when you look at the operating expense growth, which we again tried to project last quarter, you see sort of the one-time expense that's going to ramp down in the fab investment, and then we will not be necessarily doing a repeat of the level of investment that we're making going forward, so that's going to get trending out as our revenues continue to increase.
Matt Diamond - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. And one last one...
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. We – this was the case here that you can't grow the company out of thin air. And we managed the growth, we managed the gross margin, however in the expense, maybe it's not – there's a lot of conditional, and we have opportunity to hide people and also it's time to upgrade the fab, and that's we talked to – or we communicated to our shareholders in many quarters ago. This year it will go up a little bit, but however, we're still operating within our margin and within our business model, and we will continue to do the same.
Matt Diamond - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. And I'm sorry one last one, just to go full circle a little bit on the CapEx side. Any direction you could give us on what CapEx is going to be going forward?
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer: Sure. The model as far as looking at additional opportunities in order to replace leased office space with purchased is continuing. So if you look at our office locations, you can see there's probably two or three candidates that still remain as opportunities for us to invest in.
Matt Diamond - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Quinn Bolton from Needham & Company.
Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: Hi, guys. First, let me offer my congrats to you Bernie on the promotion to CFO. I wanted to just follow-up on that OpEx question. You look at the fourth quarter, and understand you're not going to give us a fourth quarter guide, but just want to make sure I understand sort of the dynamics. Obviously, you've talked about some of the increased staffing levels to fund new R&D plus some strategic sales and marketing, but it also sounds like the fourth foundry is contributing to some of that higher OpEx in Q3. Just kind of wondering as you look to Q4, you wrap up that foundry expense which I think is kind of one-time in nature, do you see potentially then a flattening out for a quarter or two? Is that foundry spending comes out of the OpEx model and we get back kind of more in line with your longer-term plan?
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Obviously with our longer-term plan and if you look at our spending, I know the Wall Street doesn't look in the past. But if you look at our past, some year we spend high, other one we spend almost – don't spend at-all, and don't increase the spending at all. So that's the nature of the business. And to answer your questions, after fourth quarter or so, I think that we go back to our long-term plan, and then we end up well below at the lower end of our model.
Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: Yeah.
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: And as we hire a few more people, we still need absorbent. We cannot just continue to hide. We need to absorb and we reorganized the teams a little bit and that's the nature our business is. This year it happened to have a few good people available, we can hide. And we are very picky to hide people and we only choose a few good guys.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer: Quinn, I think you see...
Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: Got it.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer: ... this is very sound, in that flattening to down as far as – because we no longer have the need for the further investment in the fab.
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: And also hiring.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, and hiring is going to slowdown.
Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: (25:14). Got it. Good. And just wanted to follow-up on a couple of the product questions. First, Bernie in his script talked about seeing server strength or really server storage and high-end notebook strength. Just wondering if you could break out was it across the board? I know the Broadwell server platform is ramping now and I think you've had some content gains. Just wondering, if you could comment perhaps more specifically on the server outlook, especially you made comments about the QS MOD? And then last question, just a follow-up on Rick's question about the communications business. If half of the business now was no longer gateway, are there one or two product areas where most of that infrastructure or non-gateway business is targeted, or is it fairly well diversified outside of gateways in the comm bucket? Thanks.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer: Okay. So to give a little bit more granularity, first on the storage and computing. We're looking at – first off let's talk to storage which has enjoyed some significant growth particularly in SSD, but that's been counterbalanced by what we've been seeing with the HDD marketplace. So, I think the overall trend line in storage remains very positive. But I think that when you look at our near-term prospects, it's going to be overshadowed by the opportunity that we see in both the notebooks, where we are starting to graduate to, looking ahead to the next-generation of servers from the Skylake to Kaby Lake, both in terms of – there're more opportunities where we are getting designed in and we see that actually Kaby Lake is getting a little bit of delay. And that actually works to our benefit because it's giving us more of an opportunity to be able to get designed in for the Kaby Lake release, which should be out in the 2017-ish there. But on the servers, I think that's a very consistent story where we had been able to gain content and dollar value that we've been selling in, particularly to the Tier 1s within the current Grantley cycle. And those relationships as well as the their understanding of what our technology does particularly with QS MOD which has really been gaining traction, probably on par ahead of what we've expected. And so I'd say that the two growth drivers for those areas would be the notebooks and the servers, and that would come about evenly and we may get some net pick up from storage, but again, you've got two offsetting dynamics there.
Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: Understood. Thanks for the additional color, Bernie.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. When you look at your second question, as far as the communications, one of the things that we are seeing better traction on is as far as the network or telecom business. And again, as Michael pointed out during our first comments, that it is kind of a lumpy business. It takes a long time to get designed in. And even though we see some initial opportunities particularly in the next probably two quarters to three quarters, it'll really be when the next set of products are released that we see the uplift there. And then as far as on the gateway, you know a coloring item there that we've discussed in the past is that we sort of play some of the low margin business opportunistically. So, in a quarter like this where we had visibility of the types of gains that we had in both the industrial and computing, we really didn't have to draw much from that market space. And so as the consequence, it really was not just a – it didn't grow, but it actually had expense decrease.
Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Melissa Fairbanks from Raymond James.
Melissa A. Fairbanks - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hi, guys. It's Melissa Fairbanks for Steve Smigie. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could give us some color on what you're expecting for mix in the September quarter. Do you have any comments on seasonality or what we should look at between the segments?
Melissa A. Fairbanks - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Sure, Melissa. Thank you for that. So I think that in our traditional model, Q3 would've been colored by a ramp of consumer. And you know we are getting some benefit from that. And particularly, in some of the high value – what we refer to as high-value consumer opportunities such as gaming which is really starting to generate some additional revenue as we go into the holiday season, but I think that in fairness, the growth drivers are really coming out of what we're seeing in the computing and the industrial and automotive market segments for us.
Melissa A. Fairbanks - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Perfect. Thanks. And within industrial, you have highlighted the automotive opportunities. Looking longer-term, are there any areas within ADAS that you feel well-positioned to compete in?
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. We feel that. As we said it in some of the small meters and also other industrial equipment and the security side. These area we are very...
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Optimistic.
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: ... optimistic, yeah.
Melissa A. Fairbanks - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, great.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer: Let me add one more thing to that, is that even though automotive is both the largest individual contributor as well as the largest growth driver, it's kind of unfortunate that these other areas that Michael just mentioned get overshadowed by comparison, because cumulatively they're a little bit smaller than automotive, but their growth rates remain very attractive and we believe that there will continue to be growth drivers not just for the remainder of this year, but well into 2017 and 2018.
Melissa A. Fairbanks - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks very much.
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. We don't want to be known as a automotive company. And we want to have a very balanced growth across all the segments.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg from Stifel.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes. Thank you. Congratulations on your new role, Bernie and congratulations to your company for the solid execution. Just a few questions here. For the last few quarters, you've been growing the top-line 15%, 16% year-over-year. Michael, I know you're quite ambitious and your targets are higher than that. So based on your current visibility, when do you think you could start to potentially see some acceleration above that growth rate?
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: I think as we – yeah, it's above this growth rate as I talked about it in the early quarters. And then I think it happened in the second half of – starting second half of next year and we will break out more than 20% gross. And I see it as not only from automotive as we keep talking about, like I mean automotive then in – but we do have other areas, like servers, even consumers – in the consumer segment. We see a variety of a designing activities and our products are proven to be the choice for all these segments. And we look it overall, I think our three years, four years – our planning, okay, it will happen in the next year, in a year and a half.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer: And just to reiterate a couple of the growth drivers that I think you're talking about, that we've talked about is continuation of strength in automotive as well as in the other industrial categories. The computing really as far as looking at the Grantley conversion to Purley, the design win activity that we have there. Likewise, with Skylake going to Kaby Lake. We also have the introduction of the modules which we'll really be ramping and taking off. And we also have our battery management systems which are scheduled to come out there. So you really have a number of opportunities that are all hitting the market at about the same time, and that's what gives rise to our optimism.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Very good. And you mentioned the inventory in the channel was down sequentially. I don't know if you could put any numbers or data on that? And do you feel like at this point maybe the channel is carrying out the true lean of your products?
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer: No. What was interesting is, generally speaking, the channel is investing as you're looking at going into Q3. And midway through the quarter, that was our experience. And then in the last month we saw a couple of geographic pockets that had higher demand than we'd expected, and we obviously manage or dip the inventory between a range of 30 days to 45 days, and we're sort of in the middle of that, right now, having come down about 10% on days.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Very good. And on visibility, I think the consistent theme lately has been your backlog has started to grow; maybe not just the 90-day backlog but even beyond that. Could you maybe elaborate a little bit on that, and how that's helping you sort of manage the business?
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer: Sure. So as we've had the experience of being able to transition away from consumer, which tends to rely much heavily on turns business. We have been able to finish the quarter with visibility that's as long as four months to six months out, and that's been one of the side benefits that we've enjoyed as we've picked up more of the industrial, but also computing that both those demand longer lead times. So as a result, it gives us the confidence to be able to project our revenues as well as our gross margin and then sort of establish the base financial model around that as much as you know four months to six months ahead of time. So, at least in the environment that we're enjoying right now where there's a minimum of either economic headwinds or any other variables, it's led to a very stable and predictable alignment for which has to manage high level of growth.
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: So in our turns business when we go in the quarter, it's much, much lower than that of a few years ago, even two years ago.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer: And I can finish just by adding the comment that when we look at Q3, we're not in a dissimilar position from where we were in Q2. And I even say that recognizing that we're releasing our earnings to you today about a week ahead of when we did it last quarter.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: That's helpful. And if I could just add one comment. Looks like, taking your guidance, you're going to be doing close to 28% operating margin in the September quarter. So I wouldn't be too apologetic about the higher OpEx, so great job guys. Thank you very much.
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, thank you very much. Now you make my day.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you for that comment.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anil Doradla from William Blair & Co.
Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey guys. Bernie, congrats on your appointment and wishing you the best of success in this new position. I had a couple of questions. So Michael, when I look at telecom, obviously there's been quite a big effort from you to transition into telecom; big metal infrastructure products. We've seen the performance over the last, call it, four quarters, showing kind of year-over-year decline. Bernie talked about certain near-term dynamics where you kind of pulled back on it. But when I look back at the telecom business, I mean how has this played out with respect to your prior expectations maybe a couple of years ago? Has it been basically a macro driven event, or has it been cancellation of products that you're designed in? I mean how would you characterize from your point of view, your exposure to these big metal projects, so to speak?
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: All right. Okay. I'll give you a straight answer. One thing is – okay, four years ago we laid out our plans we're going to do this, this and that, and telecom was a part of it. We have other low-hanging fruits, and we got it. And telecom is sort of neglected. And so I had to say that. And as a result, that reflects what's been there today. Although in the telecom content, we're using other product, mainly these are – such as point of load and the other ones, the power of Ethernet and we grow some market shares. And these are much higher values than gateway business, but my take on it is we have to have a killer product. And while releasing this killer product and that's a family (40:56). And we address this telecom market. It is very easy to use and very high efficiencies and a very compact size. And I think that we're going to be – these products would be far better than everybody else in the market now. And we expect it to have a very, very good growth. However, the telecom as you know – again it kind of is even slower than automotive, and their product cycles, we have to meet with it, but long-term perspectives of it very good.
Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: So the killer product Michael that you're talking about is that that module that Bernie and you mentioned. Is that the killer product or is it yet to come?
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: No. It is FPPM – based on the FPPM technologies and targeted telecom applications.
Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And this will be more of a 2017 event or from actually material contribution...
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: I think some of them – it can convert into a 2017 or 2018.
Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. There's going to be some alignment. Again, the telecom industry is going to go from four to five. And during that transition, we'll probably pick up more design opportunities.
Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: So is it fair to say Michael till this killer product comes out, the way telecom will behave would be kind of plus, minus in this range, nothing spectacular, but it kind of work its way, chug its way through, so to speak?
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: I mean for the dollar amount, yes our case is similar, but the content probably grow to a higher margin area, less of a point low for gateway, but the gateway businesses are pretty quick. And within the half year, we can turn it on and turn it off. So we judge our growth and we judge the fab capacities.
Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you. And on the automotive side, what is the contribution. Is it – can you break down what was the percentage of revenues from automotive during the quarter?
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer: I'm sorry. You mean, as far as the automotive as a percent of the industrial group?
Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Oh, industrial or total revenue whatever you want to say.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer: Okay.
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. It's about – oh yeah.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. What we intend to do there is do that on sort of an annualized basis.
Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer: So what I indicated previously is that, at last year it represented a little over a third of the industrial group and it's growing, you know, I think not quite a doubling but at a very high double-digit growth rate when the group itself is growing at, you know, in the 40%s.
Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Very good. And the server, obviously, a big effort on server starting from Grantley. Grantley was the first push. It worked out okay, but nothing spectacular, I think. But now with these new rounds of servers obviously you've got a more bigger platform, more content. So Michael, when you step back and look at the current version of the rollout, can you quantify the number of design wins, the total design win dollars. Anything that we could kind of appreciate, how good you guys are doing on that front?
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: We don't release design win activities and we don't release the particular project to design wins, meaning we don't as our competitors are looking at us very carefully.
Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Right.
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: And very closely. And however, so I'm not going to say look we have – in the last half years, all these first tiers really opened up all the opportunity to MPS, and lot of them are very highly visible project. MPS won it.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer: So I can add to it. I think Anil you did a good job at helping us by saying that the dollar content per server is going to go up significantly because we now have a very competitive VCORE solution. And the design wins that we're enjoying are reflective of all the content that we have and they're broad-based as far as the number of tier one and tier two server OEMs that we're working with.
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: But all this revenue we generated now more than 70%-80% or maybe not. Yeah 70%-80% – at least about 70% as well from a point of load for ease-of-use. And the core power is just start to ramp now. And as you see that what the market size is, okay, and there is only a very few players, and MPS can be a significant player there.
Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: All right. And Michael finally if I – don't mind me squeezing in on the Brushless motor control. It's obviously a topic you guys are very excited about. We've had some ups and downs on it. Can you give us any kind of update on the Brushless motor control? Where you guys are? What the market is? How the market is behaving? And when can we see any kind of a good ramp in that business?
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. I don't say it as it is up and down. I think there is everything as expected. And then, I think, in the last quarter said that we delayed that chip for a couple of months. Now we have it in our – in the Bernie's script we said it, okay, we sampled our chip. We have the chip product. And a couple of customers, okay they want – and they start to evaluating it. And actually we're working with them very closely on it. The first time the chip is functioning well, and meet our expectations. That's a very complex product and both we and our customers, they're surprised, even working.
Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Very good. So revenues from this would be 2016 or 2017 from this new sample chip?
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer: We're generating revenue currently and we're actually starting to get a good ramp, but I think we try to set the expectations out into 2017 and 2018.
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: 2017-2018 – more in 2018.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah.
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: And I have a very high expectation on this technology as you know, and that will really a revolution change the way we do and manage the E.MOTION, okay or generate energy.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer: Okay.
Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Right. Well, great. And we're looking forward to it and Bernie once again, congrats.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Amit Chanda from Wells Fargo.
Amit Chanda - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi. Hi, this is Amit Chanda dialing in for David Wong. Thanks for taking my question. Michael, could you talk about your e-commerce effort to sell your modules how that process is coming along? Are a lot of your customers using that channel to help grow your module business at the moment?
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well we haven't just set-up a website, we're just starting to selling the modules so we haven't – clearly you look at our website hasn't launched it yet.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer: The e-commerce rollout is initially expected to help with demand creation as far as being able to reach areas of the market that we could not cost-effectively do. So when you look at the initial opportunity when we launch what we're expecting to be able to do is right now there's a very high service component in order to be able to get design wins. And if we have to add one Fae in order to get one account, what we want to get to is to lower our sales and marketing investment, because we're able to attract and get customers designed in through the e-commerce solution. So it's going be something that we'll be introducing and then it's going to evolve and develop. But it won't be an immediate click the switch and have all our business transitioned to that platform.
Amit Chanda - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. And when do you expect to have that fully launched by?
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. We have – you will see our website changing in the next couple of months or so.
Amit Chanda - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Okay. Okay. And then as a follow-up question regarding automotive, can you provide us with an update on when you might penetrate the powertrain business specifically?
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: I think that we want to avoid the powertrain.
Amit Chanda - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Okay.
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: The powertrain and a lot of them are single failure components. Can we – those area we want to avoid it. And of course, if they want to buy, okay, we won't buy any of these liabilities that came in and but we are focused on the infotainment, lighting, camera and... A – [009PNL-E Bernie Blegen]>: Networking.
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: ... networking the call – networking even something ignition area – in summa safety arena where we will engage with all business, but the powertrain's no.
Amit Chanda - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. And then on average, can you give us a sense for what Monolithic's dollar content is tracking within automotive at the moment?
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer: Well, it's very variable.
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: I think as average of – on analyst day, we said we have a model pulling up, it's like somewhere the $1.40.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, is the opportunity.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer: And I don't think that we increased somewhat – I don't think it has no significant change for the year.
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay, great. Thank you, gentlemen. Appreciate it.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over Monolithic management for any additional comments.
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: All right.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you. I'd like to thank you all for joining us for this conference call and look forward to talking to you again at our third quarter conference call. Thank you. Have a nice day.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone have a good day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Quarter 2016 Monolithic Power Systems Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this call will be recorded. I'd now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Bernie Blegen, Interim Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Interim Chief Financial Officer: Good afternoon, and welcome to the first quarter 2016 Monolithic Power Systems conference call. Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS, is on the call with me today. For those of you, who I haven't been introduced to yet, my name is Bernie Blegen. I've been with Monolithic Power Systems now for four-and-a-half years, working largely in the background with Meera, as the Corporate Controller. For those of you, again that I haven't met, I look forward to getting introduced to you in the next quarter or two. In the course of today's conference call, we'll make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management's current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q1 earnings release, and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on February 29, 2016, which is accessible through our website, www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today's call. We will be discussing gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, other income, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to Q1 2015, Q4 2015 and Q1 2016 releases as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our website. I'd also like to remind you that today's conference call is being webcast over the Internet, and will be available for replay on website for one year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. MPS is pleased to announce record first quarter revenue of $84.5 million. Our first quarter revenue was on the high-end of our guidance, and represented a 14.9% increase from the prior year quarter. This was our 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year revenue growth. This consistent revenue growth is a result of our diversification strategy and investments in targeted market segments. As we have become established among the first tier suppliers to the major OEM customers in these new markets, we have encountered even more exciting opportunities that if we invest now, will enable our growth to accelerate in the next few years. We want to capitalize on these new businesses by investing strategically, while being mindful of the need to operate in our long-term model. These efforts will enhance our market position, and accelerate MPS' revenue growth. Turning back to the financials, this revenue increase over the prior year was fueled by growth from our Industrial, Computing and Consumer segment. MPS' non-GAAP gross margin also expanded 20 basis points year-over-year to 55.0%. Looking at revenue growth by market segment; Industrial was up 38.3% from 2015. Computing revenue grew 35.2%, and Consumer revenue was higher by 7.5%. First quarter Communication revenue fell 2.8% from the prior year. Let me speak to the results of each end market. In the Industrial market, sales rose to $18.4 million fueled by product sales for applications in Automotive, Security and Point-of-Sale Equipment. Computing revenue increased to $15.4 million reflecting strength in notebooks, servers and storage. Revenue from Consumer markets increased from a year-ago quarter to $33.8 million, driven primarily by gains in high-value consumer markets like home appliances and battery management as well as in GPS devices. Communication revenue fell $0.5 million to $16.9 million largely due to lower wireless revenue. Compared with the prior quarter, Q1 2016 revenue decreased $2.4 million or 2.8% on seasonally lower revenue in the Consumer segment, with each of the other three segments improving. Non-GAAP gross margin of 55.0% matched the prior quarter. Non-GAAP operating income was $20.0 million compared with the $22.5 million reported in the prior quarter. Q1 non-GAAP net income was $18.7 million or $0.45 per fully diluted share compared with $0.51 per share in the previous quarter. Let's review our operating expenses. Our non-GAAP first quarter 2016 operating expenses were $26.4 million, $1.1 million higher than the $25.3 million we spent in the fourth quarter of 2015, mainly due to increased compensation costs reflecting pay raises, staff additions and higher payroll taxes. Our first quarter 2016 GAAP operating expenses of $35.1 million matched GAAP operating expenses recorded in the fourth quarter. The difference between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for these two quarters is stock compensation expense, expense on an unfunded deferred compensation plan and the write-off of an acquisition earn-out liability in Q4 of 2015. Stock comp expense included in operating expenses was $8.5 million in the first quarter compared with $12.0 million in the prior quarter. This between quarter decline in stock comp primarily reflected a one-time $2.9 million expense reversal associated with our prior CFO's retirement. We expect stock comp to normalize once a permanent CFO replacement is in place. Investment expense related to the deferred comp plan increased GAAP operating expenses by $157,000 in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $290,000 of expense in the fourth quarter. Turning to other income. First quarter non-GAAP other income of $241,000 was $117,000 lower than the prior quarter, primarily due to foreign exchange transaction losses resulting from a weakening of the dollar. Switching to the bottom line. On a non-GAAP basis, our Q1 net income was $18.7 million or $0.45 per fully diluted share. This result is computed with an estimated tax rate of 7.5%. Q1 2016 GAAP net income was $10.6 million or $0.25 per fully diluted share. Now, let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $256.9 million at the end of the first quarter of 2016, up $16.6 million from the $240.3 million at the end of the prior quarter. This increase in cash reflected cash flow from operations of $27.1 million offset by the $8.0 million quarterly dividend payment, and the $4.3 million spent on capital equipment and office space. No shares were purchased during the quarter under our stock buyback program. Q1 cash proceeds from employee stock option exercises and employee stock plan purchases contributed another $1.7 million. Accounts receivable ended the quarter at $28.8 million, down from the $30.8 million at the end of the prior quarter. Days of sales outstanding were 31 days in both the first quarter 2016 and in the year-ago quarter, compared with 32 days in the fourth quarter of 2015. Our internal inventories at the end of the first quarter were $62.3 million, lower than the $63.2 million at the end of the prior quarter. Days of inventory, however, increased slightly to 145 days at the end of Q1 from the 144 days at the end of Q4. Inventory on our distribution channel increased from the Q4 2015 level reflecting the seasonal build. Prior to this, inventory in the channel had declined in each of the three prior quarters. I would like now to turn to our outlook for the second quarter of 2016. We are forecasting Q2 revenue in the range of $91 million to $95 million. We also expect the following. Non-GAAP gross margin will be in the range of 54.6% to 55.6%. GAAP gross margin will be the range of 53.6% to 54.6%, total stock-based compensation expense of $10.4 million to $12.4 million including approximately $400,000 that would be charged to cost of goods sold, litigation expenses of $100,000 to $200,000, non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense to be in the range of $26.1 million to $28.1 million, this estimate excludes stock compensation and litigation expenses, other income of $200,000 to $300,000 before foreign exchange gains or losses, fully diluted shares to be in the range of 41.2 million to 42.2 million share before share buyback. In conclusion, we continue to grow and we continue to invest for further growth. I'll now open the phone lines for questions.
Operator: Thank you. And our first question comes from Tore Svanberg from Stifel. Your line is open.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes, thank you, and congratulations on the results. And Bernie, welcome to these public calls. My first question is on your relative visibility, I know you typically don't give the booking and backlog numbers, but just given all the macro backdrops out there, how would you classify your current visibility either sequentially or year-over-year?
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Interim Chief Financial Officer: Sure. When we look at the backlog going into the quarter, as well as the momentum that we carried in from the prior quarter, we feel that we're in comparable shape to when we were going into either Q1 of last – or Q2 of last year or Q1 of this year. So, all-in-all I feel, we're in pretty good shape.
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: And...
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I...
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: I'd just add on, like I mean, given in the last few years, and then when we go into the quarters, and has a more and a more less term business, and a more and more booked (12:41) and although we don't release the numbers, but the trend is very good for our long-term business.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Very good. And my second question is in relation to your Communications business, I recognize, you're doing exceptionally well in all other three. Now, this one, it's down year-over-year, but it was up 7% sequentially. So you think, we're starting to see the reversal of the Communications business, and if so, what would be driving that?
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Let me answer that. And the short answer is, no. That came in, because a lot of those Communication business during – in the wireless LAN, that's from the legacy product. And although we're doing pretty well, and those are business we're very opportunistic to gain revenues and margin dollars. However, we're going to reverse that, and it will be a lot more sustainable market, I see it in a couple of years down the road. We are now releasing the product for telecom market segment, and I really believe these are winners, and we will take shares in the large – this market segment.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Very good. Just one last question from me, either Michael or Bernie, could you just give us an update on your module business, and maybe your programmable module business? I know you probably can't give us any specific numbers, but maybe where some of the design wins are coming, and are you starting to see revenue already in the programmable modules or is that a bit too early? Thank you.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Interim Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. So I can take some of the numbers there, and then I can defer to Michael as far as the programmable. In general, the modules business is on track with what we were expecting, and what we presented at the Analyst Day earlier. We've introduced a number of products, and we've obtained a number of very positive reviews and several design wins which are generating good revenue right now, obviously with the longer-term growth opportunities coming later this year and into 2017.
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: The programmable modules, and as we talked about in the last Analyst Call, those are products that – at the time we talked about it, is about a year, a year and half away. So we haven't really, really generated any revenue yet, but we're starting sample rate in those modules. And from the last time in, I know in the history of MPS, we didn't talk about all the products until we generate revenue. However, our business model changes, and also particular changes in anything what we do now will affect two years or three years later. So in the last year, Analyst Day, we talk about all the products that would generate revenue two years or three years down the road.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Sounds good, and congratulations on another stellar quarter. Thank you.
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Tore.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Schafer with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey, thanks. And I'll add my congratulations to you guys on a nice quarter. A couple of questions, I guess, maybe the first one is, could you give us an update on the progress ramping your new foundry, and maybe the timing and linearity of the associated expenses, I think you talked about a couple, $2 million or $3 million, I think, Bernie, in the incremental expenses? And another question I had on that is, this foundry just going to be for BCD5 or is it going to run all Monolithic processes.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Interim Chief Financial Officer: Thanks for the good words on the quarter. So, the progress on the foundry is coming along quite well. In fact, we've already started to take some deliveries of wafer from it, and we have several products that are actually in production. We're if I could characterize it probably at about the mid-point of bringing up all the products that we want to, and it is not restricted to only the BCD5, but also a couple of the earlier versions as well.
Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Got it. And as the follow-up, what will that bring total wafer capacity up to for you guys now that you've got the fourth foundry running, I mean, is it – and is it going to create any sort of bottlenecks with Chengdu or do you just simply outsource that overflow?
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Interim Chief Financial Officer: I'll answer your second question first, is that, we outsource the overflow, we've been very successful in migrating to that, adding that into or complementing that as our business model. And then, rather that talk specifically in wafer volume, I think we've said in the past that, in terms of revenue, with three fabs we had about a little over $100 million of capacity per quarter, and now we're going up to about $125 million to $130 million per quarter?
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, and also the overall manufactured capacity, we transfer out in low-end product, but those are traditional products; high volume, we go to a testing house, and for packaging in testing, we are in-house or we're more developed or more high in a very high quality products, and those are – we have a much better control, much worthwhile in the long term.
Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Got it. And then just one final one from me, it's on E.MOTION. Obviously, a new product that's kind of changing the way motor makers and system designers are designing products, so maybe just, kind of provide some color on or talk about, what's your go-to-market strategy is with the sort of brand new product category, if you will, or brand new product? I mean, it's a $2 billion opportunity or more, I think you've talked about in the past. I mean, how do you scale that business, I guess, with limited resources?
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: It is true, there's limited resources, like I mean, but as Bernie said in the script, we mindfully invested, and not affecting our long-term growth model – I'm not giving you any – but are really excited about this technology. And as you see it, we generate, already generate pretty meaningful revenue from Sensima's existing product. And once we put their products in our – are qualified and now we transfer into our own foundry, and the volumes are going to increase quite a bit. However, those products are still in Consumers' area, and as expected, and you have a fast ramp it's always in those Consumer area. And now, the more exciting thing is for the future, we changed the way our, the behavior of – design engineer behaviors, all these machine design, these are equipment designer, it takes time. And but we introduced all these ideas in the products and concepts and we're designing and some of them we're co-designing with all these first tier customers, and those, I'm very confident those revenue will come.
Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Got it. Thanks, guys.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Interim Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Rick.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Matt Diamond - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, guys. This is actually Matt Diamond on the line for Ross. Congrats again on the great quarter, and thanks for letting me ask a question. I'm curious on the end market breakdown this quarter, was there any one that didn't align with your own expectations and if it or they didn't what ramifications those surprises might have for 2Q?
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Interim Chief Financial Officer: No, no. I think that there were a lot of positives that we take away from this quarter relative to both how we performed in Q4 as well as against our expectations. The growth that we're seeing in Industrial, and particularly a lot of that is driven through automotive, but also our high value opportunities in the power sourcing and in security are ramping very nicely. And I think, going back to the point that we made in the script is that, I think that we've done a good job of being able to get introduced to a lot of high-value opportunities, and now what we want to do is be able to capitalize further to both continue and accelerate that growth. Likewise, when we look at the Computing, we saw very good opportunities in the high-end notebook and a continuation of progress in Storage as well. So in the Computing and Storage, in fact it was a pretty balanced approach. We didn't have any categories that fell short of our expectation. So when I sum it up, I think we've touched on Communications, that went down in Q3 of last year, but as we pointed out, it's trending nicely, and we have good opportunities there.
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, we don't – to answer your questions, do we have – expected a gain or loss, and again, MPS' revenues are very much expected, and are very stable. And we know in a few quarters out, what gain, what losses, okay. Of course we do have a – play a lot of opportunistic games in those traditional legacy product, but we do see, and expect the things as Bernie said in the script. We encounter a lot of demand for the new product from the first tier OEMs.
Matt Diamond - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Excellent. And just in the second half of the year – you may have already answered the question, how do you feel about new products heading into the second half of the year, should there be any expected acceleration there, or any way to ballpark that would be helpful.
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: It's pretty much set. In our revenues, we focus on two years or three years out, and those customers design us in (24:33) and work with us on those products, and if they don't cancel the product or delay the product the revenue is there. And now we don't see a significant difference, and it's pretty much as we expected.
Matt Diamond - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Excellent. Thanks so much, guys.
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay, thank you.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Interim Chief Financial Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Smigie from Raymond James. Your line is open.
J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thanks a lot, guys. I'll add my congratulations to the good numbers there. Michael, I just wanted to follow-up with your answer earlier in the call on Communications, you talked about new products coming out. I just couldn't understand, was that for higher-end Communications equipment or was that a new set of products for more the home router type equipment, and is that quite a load or what type of product would that be that you think's going to be a pretty good one?
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, if we're defending our own point of law (25:36) in home router systems, then it has to be at a lower cost. And of course we develop those product, we release those products to defend our segment, still very good money to be made there. And what I'm more excited about is that, the new line of our product, and you know we released very high power density product into servers in the Computing segment. Those similar type of products go for Communications, these are for infrastructures. And servers and infrastructures are somewhat related, and those products we redesigned for the infrastructure, these products are coming out. That's kind of product I really talk about.
J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, right, that sounds great. On the auto side, any thoughts to what growth might look like for auto for the year, now that we're sort of decently in, and you probably have good visibility on designs, and what you think auto could potentially grow into 2017?
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: In autos, and as expected, we said it, in the last couple of years, we see the very consistent of a growth, and a ramp and we don't see any different. Now the opportunity is that, we've seen a lot more now, and we need a lot of more new product for that.
J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And do you think that you'll keep focused on the areas where you already have success or investment or would you move over and circle to powertrain, as well, I don't think you have any real presence right now. If I could just throw one last question in, you guys have been investing, you mentioned again, here on the press release, can you talk a little bit about how you see OpEx spending in the back half of the year, is it anything different what you guys already communicated or is it pick up, slow down, a little bit from what you were originally thinking? Thanks.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Interim Chief Financial Officer: So, as far as – I'll take your first question on automotive, is that, certainly being – we're such a small component in selling into that huge market opportunity that we have tremendous upside both in terms as far as introducing new content to the cars as well as expanding on the designs that we've already had built in. So we're very excited about automotive, obviously. And then as far as like what we are trying to signal as far as the sales and marketing expenses is that, there's just a real opportunity to continue this growth. We've done, we've already made the investment in R&D as far as the design, the process technology, and now the fabs, and so in order to complete the rollout to be successful is to invest appropriately in sales and marketing.
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: So that's on the expenses side, we do have to sensibly invest, and we, again in the last conference call, we talk about, we balanced our short-term shareholders. Nobody admit it, we have short-term investors, and some are short-term, what I mean is okay, for one-year or two-year guys versus a four-years or five years guy, we balance those interests, because whatever we do in this year has nothing to do with the revenue generation for next year, so it's two years or three years out. So we balance those shareholder interests. And when talking about powertrains, I'll answer you very specifically. Yes, we're going to get in there, and now before we get in there, we need to put our house in shape for these are quality controlled, these are very critical components, and we need to upgrade our production control.
J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay great, congrats again. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Quinn Bolton with Needham. Your line is open.
Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: Hey, Michael, just wanted to follow-up on that last question about the long-term opportunities by investing in new products and sales and marketing to-date. It sounds like you're not changing your sort of target to grow OpEx at a rate of 50% to 60% of sales. One, I just wanted to confirm that, and second to the extent that, that is still accurate, at what point would you consider making larger investments now, how big would some of those future opportunities be for you to say start to spend at a growth rate more than 50% or 60% of sales...?
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, that's a very good question. Okay, and once I talk about investment, everybody get nervous, okay. Here is – we're not going to – okay here's our long-term target, okay, 50%, 60% of our growth – of the OpEx growth from the revenue growth. And we're going to stick with our models, and we've been (31:13) one year's below a little bit, below one year, a little bit higher, but I would say the long-term, our long-term is about two years or three years, and we'll be average out in a similar range. We're not going to have big gigantic jump, and we'll surprise everybody, we won't do that kind of thing.
Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: Got it. Okay, let me try and just ask, on the E.MOTION product, I believe that you were scheduled to be taping out the fully integrated E.MOTION part sometime here in the first half, just wondering if you can give us an update if that's still on track?
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, we have – actually, well, the product was delayed a little bit. And we said, in the release in May, it doesn't look like we're going to release in May, and we have – all the engineers are bogged down with some of the details, and okay, what I think to me these are very minor things, but however we're delayed. But the products that we're working with these are large customers for very fast revenue – I mean talking about fast revenue is still a year, and a year-and-a-half away. And those products, and engineers want to make final changes before – to satisfy those large customers, and I don't have a big argument about it. And those – however we're releasing the product in the next couple of months and all the existing Sensima's products, and as I said earlier, we generate pretty good revenue now.
Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: Great. And then just one for Bernie, you mentioned the sales or disti inventory did increase here for the first quarter, for the first time in the last three quarters or the previous three quarters, I should say were down. Can you give us some sense how much inventory did you build in the first quarter, and any expectations for what disti inventories will do in the second quarter, is that another quarter typically when you see the channel build seasonally?
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Interim Chief Financial Officer: There's two components to that. So, yes, we did experience a dollar increase as far as inventory in the channel, but as significantly is, we're calculating the days off of a lower denominator with the lower revenue. So in fact the pattern conformed pretty much to the normal seasonal that we've seen. For Q2 we're actually going in with the expectation of not increasing the channel inventory in terms of days keep maintaining those generally about flat maybe a day increase or so, but we don't expect that to be material.
Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: But on a dollar basis it probably goes up a touch, just reflecting the higher revenue base?
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Interim Chief Financial Officer: Yeah.
Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: Great. Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Anil Doradla with William Blair & Company. Your line is open.
Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi Michael, Bernie, congrats from my end too. I had a couple of questions. What was the contribution of automotives during this quarter, can you give us some sense, I know you don't break it down, but can you give us some sense what the revenue contribution was?
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Interim Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, I think that, what we've said in the past is that, of the Industrial, it comprises about a third of that segment, and now auto is starting to increase as a percentage of that segment as their sales are growing faster than the remainder of that market.
Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay, great. And one for you Michael, you talked about programmability, it sounds like the revenues would be some time in next year, couple of questions around that. Is it second half of next year, and more importantly obviously this is a big important trend within our management sector. Can you talk about the competitive landscape, are people catching on the programmable solutions, when do you think competition is going to come in?
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: I don't see, and all of the – lot of people are talking about. And some people talk about, and they have products for those Industrial market segments. But these are still very much semiconductor-related, and not – it's a very similar to what they have before. And MPS' product is significantly different, and designed for ease of a use. In those revenues, and I expected, yeah we do see fast revenues in – from when we release it, and also we have to release it with the softwares and also on the Internet.
Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: So, the revenue contribution is this going to be more like Q3 or do you think it's going to be more of a Q2 contribution?
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: I will say that, at this time, I'll say that, it's like second half of the year.
Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay, very good. Once again, congrats from my side.
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Interim Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, again.
Operator: Thank you. And we have a follow-up from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Your line is open.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes, thank you. Looking at the cash flows, I think they were almost at record levels, I was just wondering if there was any sort of one-time items that helped those cash flows or should we assume for operating cash flow to hover around 30% of revenue going forward as well?
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Interim Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, there was no one-item per se. What we had seen is that working capital in each of the three prior quarters had consumed cash and in this quarter it actually turned to be beneficial as receivables in particular went down.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Very good. And last question, on your Consumer revenues, so obviously high value Consumer continues to drive the growth there. I was just wondering within battery management, how sizable that business is becoming. I believe you said at the last Analyst Day that, that would be one of the biggest growth driver of the Consumer business, and just trying to understand relatively how big that has gotten now? Thank you.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Interim Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. So when we look at the battery management, currently it's still relatively small, relative to the overall opportunity, but it is growing significantly more than any of our other market segments in Consumer.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you, again.
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: All right, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. Bernie Blegen, for closing remarks.
Theodore Bernie Blegen - Interim Chief Financial Officer: Great, thank you very much. I'd like to thank you all for joining us on this conference call, and look forward to talking to you again in July at our second quarter conference call. Thank you. Have a nice day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

===== 2015 Q4  (2016-02-04 17:00:00) =====

Analysts: Joe Hodes - William Blair & Co. Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. Matt Diamond - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Vincent Celentano - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. David Wong - Wells Fargo Securities
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Monolithic Power Systems Q4 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I'd now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Meera Rao, Chief Financial Officer. Ma'am, please go ahead.
Meera Rao: Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2015 Monolithic Power Systems conference call. Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS, is with me on today's call. In the course of today's conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management's current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q4 earnings release and in our SEC filings, including a Form 10-K filed on March 2, 2015, and a Form 10-Q filed on October 28, 2015, which is accessible through our website, www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today's call. We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, operating income, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the Q1 through Q4 releases for both 2014 and 2015 as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our website. I'd also like to remind you that today's conference call is being webcast live over the Internet and will be available for replay on our website for one year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. Let's begin with a summary of 2015. We continued to perform as we have in the past few years. We are pleased to announce record annual revenue of $333.1 million. Our full year organic revenue growth of 17.9% clearly outperformed the analog industry, which SIA estimates grew 1.9% over the prior year. For 2015, MPS's non-GAAP gross margin expanded 40 basis points from the prior year to 55%. Further, our non-GAAP operating income grew to $81.7 million, representing a 34.8% increase over 2014 after excluding the one-time $9.5 million litigation judgment received in the prior year. We achieved record non-GAAP EPS of $1.89, 32% over 2014, again, excluding the litigation judgment. Diving into year-over-year revenue growth by market segment, industrial was up 35.3%, storage and computing revenue grew 22.6% and consumer also increased 18.2% over 2014. Let me speak to the results of each end market. In industrial and automotive markets, sales rose to $66.3 million, fueled by product sales for applications in automotive, smart meters, security and power sources. We are thrilled that industrial revenue as a percentage of total revenue surged from 6.7% in 2011 to 19.9% in 2015. With significant design win momentum in industrial and automotive, we expect to see continued growth in 2016 and beyond. Revenue from consumer markets increased to $145.1 million, driven primarily by high value consumer markets like battery management, home appliances, gaming and LED lighting. Computing revenue was up $10.5 million from the prior year to $56.6 million, mainly due to growth in cloud computing, high-end PCs and storage. Communications revenue grew slightly to $65.1 million compared to $64.6 million in 2014. Growth in networking and telecom was partially offset by a decline in the traditional gateway business. Switching to Q4, MPS had a record fourth quarter with revenue of $86.9 million, representing year-over-year growth of 14.8%. This is our 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year quarterly revenue growth. Non-GAAP gross margin was 55%, 10 basis points lower than the prior quarter, but 10 basis points higher than the fourth quarter from a year ago. Our non-GAAP operating income was $22.5 million compared to the $23.8 million reported in the prior quarter and $18.3 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2014. Q4 non-GAAP net income was $21.1 million or $0.51 per fully diluted share compared with $0.55 per share in the previous quarter and $0.43 per share in the fourth quarter of 2014. Let's review our operating expenses. Our non-GAAP fourth quarter 2015 operating expenses were $25.3 million, down from the $26.5 million we spent in the third quarter. Our Q4 expenses were below expectations, primarily due to new product costs being delayed to Q1 2016. We have also begun investing in our infrastructure as the industrial and automotive market opportunity continues to grow. Our GAAP operating expenses were $35.1 million in the fourth quarter compared with $36.1 million in the third quarter. The differences between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for these quarters are stock compensation expense, income or loss on an unfunded deferred compensation plan, as well as a write-off of an acquisition earn-out liability in Q4. Stock comp expense was $12 million in the fourth quarter compared with $10.2 million in the prior quarter. Since 2014, we have implemented pay-for-performance equity programs. This increase in expense is due to MPS's revenue performing better than expected compared to the analog industry during this period. Q4 GAAP operating expense also included a $2.5 million credit resulting from an acquisition-related earn-out liability. In addition, Q4 GAAP operating expense included $300,000 of investment expense related to an unfunded deferred compensation plan compared to an investment gain of $500,000 in the prior quarter. Switching to the bottom line. On a non-GAAP basis, our Q4 net income was $21.1 million or $0.51 per fully diluted share. This result is computed with an estimated tax rate of 7.5%. Q4 2015 GAAP net income was $10.1 million or $0.24 per fully diluted share. Now, let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $240.3 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2015, above the $235 million at the end of the prior quarter. In Q4, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $21.7 million. Cash proceeds from employee stock option exercises contributed another $900,000. These cash inflows were partially offset by $8.6 million to purchase office space and capital equipment. In Q4, we funded the $8.1 million quarterly dividend declared in the prior quarter. We also spent about $600,000 to purchase 11,000 shares under our stock buyback program. Accounts receivable ended the fourth quarter at $30.8 million, slightly higher than the $30.5 million at the end of the prior quarter due to higher sales in the third month of Q4 compared with the prior quarter. Days of sales outstanding were up to 32 days in the fourth quarter from the 30 days in the prior quarter and the 31 days in the year-ago quarter. Internal revenues at the end of the fourth quarter were $63.2 million, down from the $67.3 million at the end of the prior quarter. Days of inventory decreased to 144 days at the end of Q4 from the 147 days at the end of Q3. Days of inventory in the distributed channel decreased for the third consecutive quarter. I would now like to turn to our outlook for the first quarter of 2016. We are forecasting Q1 revenue in the range of $81 million to $85 million. We also expect the following: non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 54.5% to 55.5%; GAAP gross margin in the range of 53.5% to 54.5%; total stock-based compensation expense of $11 million to $13 million, including approximately $350,000 that would be charged to cost of goods sold; litigation expenses of $150,000 to $250,000; non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense to be in the range of $25.4 million to $26.4 million, this estimate excludes stock compensation and litigation expenses; other income of $200,000 to $300,000 before foreign exchange gains or losses; fully diluted shares to be in the range of 41.2 million to 42 million shares before share buyback – sorry, fully diluted shares to be in the range of 41.2 million to 42.2 million shares before share buyback. Our board has approved a $50 million stock buyback program over a one year period beginning this quarter. We're pleased to report that we've achieved all of the share price targets that were set for the 2013 MSU program. Accordingly, at the end of 2015, we've established another MSU program with a new set of share price target which includes an initial range from $71.36 to $95.57. The program spans six years with a four year performance period. In conclusion, in 2015, we continued to deliver and we have great expectations for the future. I'll now open the microphone for questions. [Operator Instructions]
Operator: Our first question comes from the line of Anil Doradla with William Blair. Your line is now open.
Joe Hodes: Hi. This is Joe Hodes in for Anil. Congratulations on another great quarter. I'm wondering if you can give us anymore color regarding the industrial segment, given some weakness you're seeing in the overall environment. I guess, in other words, what products are driving your success and how much of that is automotive? Thanks.
Meera Rao: We are not seeing any particular weakness. And if you look at our trend, even last year, we didn't see much weakness in Q4. And this is a quarter where we continue to see momentum in industrial areas, including automotive. And one thing to keep in mind is these are all early revenues. We are not a big player yet. So if there is any macro weakness playing in automotive, you wouldn't expect to see it in our numbers.
Joe Hodes: Okay. Thank you. Okay. And then I'm moving to new products. What can we expect from the brushless motion control in 2016?
Michael Hsing: We have a lot of design win activities and we have some small. In terms of revenue, we'll have some revenues, but we expect to have in the 2017 and beyond the product start really in the growth.
Joe Hodes: So late 2016, probably?
Michael Hsing: Yeah. And even starting now, we have revenues.
Joe Hodes: Okay. All right. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rick Schafer with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.
Rick Schafer: Yeah. Thanks and congrats on a nice quarter, you guys. It's tough out there.
Meera Rao: Thank you.
Rick Schafer: Maybe I've got a question on your auto business. I mean I think you've seen your auto business double annually for the last couple of years. What's that trajectory look like this year? Can we kind of stay on that same kind of slope? And maybe part of that question is, is this auto growth primarily going to be coming from sort of infotainment where you guys are pretty strong now or is it going to be coming from a combination of areas? I mean are you going to be ramping in areas like drive train or ADAS or other areas within the auto?
Michael Hsing: Yeah. Rick, thanks for the comment. And the growth in the automotive is pretty consistent because unless the auto company cancel the design of a car, okay, cancel the entire project, that doesn't happen very often. So we have many design wins and started a couple years ago. And also, with the right product and particularly for design for automotives, we are very optimistic for the next period. And related to what kind of a product – what kind of application in the car, except in the engine, except under the hood, we are almost everywhere now. Meera, you can -
Meera Rao: That was my point basically that except for the power train that we started in infotainment but then we've gone into the body, into safety, into various different applications.
Rick Schafer: Got it. And then by region, is there anything – I mean I know you guys are strong in Europe. Have you seen -looking at your backlog like you said, Michael, you've got good visibility there. Are you starting to see areas like Japan or North America or any other place start to pick up?
Michael Hsing: North America, China, Korea, definitely picking up, other than Japan. In Japan, we have some. And they are much slower than any other region. It is not because the market is stagnant. It is because of MPS's salespeople. We already corrected that in the last – two years ago.
Rick Schafer: Got it. Got it. And then my second question is on E.MOTION. I'm curious like what milestones we should be looking at this year. It sounds like revenues would be pretty small. But I guess maybe my real question is what's sort of the biggest hurdle to that business ramping? I think we've talked about it being a $2 billion or greater TAM. I mean is the biggest hurdle just scale? I mean do you guys – would you ever license that IP or would you ever think you need a partner to ramp that business? Or I guess maybe just if you could give some color on what that business looks like in the next year or two years?
Michael Hsing: Yeah. Next couple of years still we'll see a slow growth and you will see accelerating after probably 2017 or so. And all of these things that we're talking about really changing how you design the – how do you control the motion, how you design the model drivers. And these ones is really a long-term. And MPS doesn't focus on a very short-term business. If anything goes up fast then it comes down fast. And so we focus on these longer-terms in the sustainable market segments. And so far, there is no surprises and everything has followed plan. I mean, everything is executed well. So we generally have some revenues from some strategic customers and we work with them closely. And the larger market segments will – and our revenue will come in the 2017.
Rick Schafer: And, Michael, would it mean anything to think about like what your two-year or three-year backlog is for that business or is it just way too soon to think of it that way?
Michael Hsing: No, it is not. Okay. We focus on the – as we said, okay, industrial robot, that segment is growing and also the very mature market is the printer market. And using our technology can revolutionize the way of printing. So, not only in the office paper printing, also textiles and fabrics and photos, all of these. It can increase the speed just dramatically. And these are the market, TAM is easily is over $1 billion, okay, just for this printing segment.
Rick Schafer: Got it. Thanks a lot.
Michael Hsing: Okay.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Your line is now open.
Tore Svanberg: Yes. Thank you and congratulations on the results. A few questions. First of all, I know you typically don't discuss backlog or bookings or anything like that, but could you just talk about your relative visibility now versus perhaps a year ago?
Meera Rao: I think our visibility now is the same as it was about a year ago. We had good bookings coming into the quarter, continue to see – orders continue. We had good resales last quarter. So we are actually seeing good activity from a backlog standpoint.
Michael Hsing: Tore, you know us for – you've covered us for many years and, of course, since the beginning. And you know that our turns business is less and less and especially in the last couple years, okay. Going through the quarters is now much more predictable now.
Tore Svanberg: Yes. Which I think also explains the very consistent performance for the last few years. My second question has to do with SSD. How will that play out for you this year? I know last year that was a pretty strong business for you. And are we – I assume now we are for sure – we have crossed over SSD versus HDD as far as your power management revenue?
Meera Rao: The SSD – we have all the designs that we have. There's additional sockets with existing customers and we have a new customer who started buying our SSD products last year. So with all that, we do expect SSD to continue to grow. And yes, SSD is now the bigger part of – has crossed over HDD at this point.
Tore Svanberg: Okay. And moving on to your server business, I know Grantley or VR12.5 and also Purley are going to be strong catalysts for you. Any updates there as far as timing is concerned?
Michael Hsing: I think they are – ramp up, all right.
Meera Rao: Purley is Q3, Q4 of 2017.
Michael Hsing: Yeah.
Meera Rao: And as far as I know that schedule is still on. The design cycle for Purley is still going on. And as we told you at the Analyst Day, we are seeing very good progress over there. We are much stronger in Purley than we were in Grantley.
Michael Hsing: Yeah. All these cycles we designed in a couple years ago and nothing has changed. And they are just waiting for the cycles to begin. But more exciting thing is that we gained a lot more socket and we established as a player in that segment.
Tore Svanberg: Great. Just one last question from me on battery management. I know you have a single chip solution there and you've already gotten some good traction but any new applications that you could share with us that you have penetrated with your single chip solution for battery management?
Michael Hsing: Well, we have a lot of things going on, I mean. But the one in the analog space that really pay attention to it hasn't released it yet. And we are still working on it. But everything else is just normal.
Tore Svanberg: Okay. Actually I did have one last question. Could you just clarify a little bit what you said about the stock option program, especially on the pricing?
Meera Rao: Sure. We had an MSU plan that had been set before that had price targets that ranged from $43, I think, to $40 to $56. And since we have achieved all those price targets, we now have a new program. And that has got the initial range of – the target prices is from $71.36 to $95.57. So there is a four-year performance period for this. And then between vesting and sales restrictions, it extends another two years.
Tore Svanberg: Okay. So this is basically just an update to the older version?
Meera Rao: I mean it's conceptually. But I think there are more – it's a new plan, but, yeah, it's not an extension, but it is a new plan.
Tore Svanberg: Got it. Great. Thank you so much, guys.
Meera Rao: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company. Your line is now open.
Quinn Bolton: Hey. Just a follow-up actually on Tore's last question there. You had restricted stock plan. Does the stock have to hit those levels for those RSUs to vest or to be awarded?
Meera Rao: Yeah. They have to be at that, I think, for an average of 20 trading days for it – consecutive trading days for it to be earned. But then, even if it's earned, it doesn't vest until the fifth year and sixth year.
Quinn Bolton: Okay.
Meera Rao: There are operational goals as well. This time, there are operational goals in addition to the price targets that have to be met.
Michael Hsing: First how we set it up is – I know, Quinn, you just covered us not very long ago. We had a program and the stocks during the close is about at $30 levels. And we set up the programs for some $40 to high $50s. And that program is only – had only one measurement and it's the stock price. And when the stock hit, then we have some period of vesting. And now, this time, we have a similar program and they're using stock's price as one element but we also add also the performance element to it.
Quinn Bolton: Understood. But I was just trying to confirm that you're aligning management employees RSUs with shareholders and that the stock has to go up for those RSUs to divest or to be earned.
Meera Rao: Absolutely.
Michael Hsing: Absolutely. That's what.
Quinn Bolton: That's what I was trying to confirm. Okay. Great.
Michael Hsing: Yeah.
Quinn Bolton: And then just looking to the business – I apologize because I missed some of the prepared comments. But it looks like the computing or storage and computing was probably down by the greatest percentage sequentially. I know you have very strong third quarter which I think reflected the ramp of a new SSD program. Should we think December is kind of just coming back more of a normal run rate or is there something in particular that happened in storage and computing in the December quarter?
Meera Rao: If you remember the beginning at the last earnings call, we had called out the fact that we were seeing some weakness in the SSD. We had expected to see some seasonal decline in the SSD for client, but we had also seen some softness in demand, both HDD and SSD enterprise. And I think it's more a reflection of what was happening in the macro and how it impacted some of our customers in those markets.
Quinn Bolton: Based on answers to some of the earlier questions, it sounds like your backlog and bookings activity has been fairly healthy. It didn't sound like you were seeing much impact from weaker macroeconomic conditions. Is that storage and the HDD, SSD comments really the only place where you'd seen any impact from macroeconomic conditions on the business?
Meera Rao: That's the only one that I could see anything clearly. I mean the rest of it – we're kind of listening to more to what our peers have to say about macro because we are still seeing good bookings and billings.
Quinn Bolton: Got it. Great. And I just wanted to ask. I know you had a lot of longer terms drivers in E.MOTION and it's early ramp that really starts to kick into more significant revenue contributors in 2017 and beyond. But as you look at 2016, can you sort of list for us on a product basis maybe what some – maybe the top two or three growth drivers would be for 2016, again, from a product perspective?
Meera Rao: Sure.
Michael Hsing: I can comment on it. And this year's 2016 revenue, especially all these growth drivers and these products are released about two years to three years ago. One is obviously in the auto segment and the other one the cloud computing, the high end computing. That's including some workstations and high end notebooks and also the servers and data centers. And other one is the industrial and industrial is not as good as the last year's. It's similar, right.
Meera Rao: Industrial is going to be doing very well.
Michael Hsing: The industrial is about -
Meera Rao: Yeah.
Michael Hsing: And so we have many actually. And we have many segments. What else? The consumer side – the high-end consumer business and we released a lot of product for mobile and for ultra-low power application and also a variety of product for the Internet of Things now nobody talk about anymore. Those products actually we started to do in 2011. Those products are actually doing really well now, because we see many applications in the connectivity that requires those products. And this year we're doing really well. Any other segment I forgot?
Meera Rao: No. The three I would emphasize would be industrial, storage and cloud computing and consumer, particularly the high-end consumer.
Michael Hsing: And also auto, right?
Meera Rao: Auto is included in industrial.
Michael Hsing: Okay.
Quinn Bolton: And, sorry, last question from me just on the high value consumer. I think last quarter you said that that was approaching 40% of the total consumer bucket. Did that reach 40% or does that continue to increase here in the December quarter and as you look into the March quarter?
Michael Hsing: I don't know the percentage of total revenue. We don't know – I don't know what that number is because the other segment will grow faster and consumer probably grow the slowest. But revenue-wide, I don't see what decrease was. We'll continue to grow.
Meera Rao: Year-over-year, I would say that the high value consumer is continuing to be a bigger portion of our consumer revenue. But if you're comparing quarter-over-quarter, there would – since Q3 was a much stronger – seasonally stronger quarter for consumer that would impact our high value consumer revenue as well. But year-over-year what we're seeing is even if you look at a quarter or year-over-year, we are seeing bigger portion of consumer revenue coming from the high value consumer market.
Quinn Bolton: Okay. So you continue to mix that high value consumer. It's what I was trying to get at.
Meera Rao: Yeah.
Michael Hsing: Yes.
Quinn Bolton: Thank you.
Michael Hsing: Thank you. Yeah.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Matt Diamond: Hey, guys. This is actually Matt Diamond on Ross' behalf. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Your comms business is upsided really nicely it seems. I'm just curious to get your thoughts on the stability of the comms market. We've heard from some of your peers that things seem to be stabilizing and I just like to get your own thoughts on what to potentially expect for the first quarter and beyond?
Meera Rao: Sure. In comms, I would say networking and telecom was relatively flat with the prior quarter. Most of the upside that we saw was in the gateway business where we had – if you remember a quarter before, we had seen weakness. So if I look out into Q1, I kind of expect from a networking and telecom that it will be flat. And Q1, on the gateway business, it would depend upon how the macro plays out. If you remember, the gateway is an area where it's not a strategic focus. It's something that we play in opportunistically depending upon the margins for the orders that we receive. So my expectation is that the gateway business is going to be flat, maybe even slightly down.
Matt Diamond: Understood. And you mentioned some OpEx commentary about new products cost being pushed out to the first quarter. I don't want to make you guide beyond the first quarter but directionally is there anything abnormal or irregular to call out about OpEx for the rest of 2016?
Meera Rao: Sure. What we were talking about there is, remember, we had been talking about the new foundry that's coming up. And we had identified the cost of bringing up the new foundry at $3 million. This is between the MOSFET cost as well as the wafer development loss. And we ended up spending only about a $0.5 million in 2015. So we'll be spending about $2.5 million in 2016 on that. The other thing that we also commented is that we have begun our investments in industrial and automotive markets. And so that is going to be something that's going to be driving OpEx expenses this year.
Matt Diamond: Great. Thanks very much.
Michael Hsing: Yeah. Let me comment on the expense side. It is clearly – okay, we have a very outstanding product for automotive and industrial. And it's – our quality is exceptional. However, we need investment in the systems – in the quality systems. And those one – MPS just have those products just by brilliant design engineers and our peoples. Now, we need to invest in the infrastructures. And there's a lot to be done in there which will overall elevate the company's quality. And so, in 2016, it's time we should do that. But we do – and it depend on how much – how much is really depending on what MPS's growth rate. And during the Analyst Day last year, I said that with our growth – our OpEx always grows a little more than half of what the revenue growth. So this year's will be just slightly higher and also we are really controlled depending on the revenue growth.
Meera Rao: And just a reminder, we talked about revenue growth. Our OpEx growth rate would be 50% to 60% of the revenue growth rate. And while we expect to be a little higher this year, that does not include – that 50% to 60% we were talking about does not include the new product cost for the new foundry coming up.
Matt Diamond: Got it. It makes total sense. Thanks very much. I appreciate the clarity.
Meera Rao: You're welcome.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie with Raymond James. Your line is now open.
Vincent Celentano: Thanks. This is Vince Celentano on for Steve. So I start with your LED business. It looks like it's up almost 20% year-over-year in the quarter. Can you talk a little about what's led that outperformance so far and where you see that market going in 2016?
Michael Hsing: If you see these fast trending products, we are very just opportunistic. And it may come in. It may be more, may be even less. Okay. But these are not our core interest. But we do have underlying very solid LED product customers. These are really for the decorating lighting, industrial lightings. And if we have a fast-grow revenue, we're just very opportunistic to take those revenues if we have the capacities.
Vincent Celentano: Okay. Great. Thanks. And then, can you give any color on upcoming DC5 as far as how it compares to DC4 either in performance or does it target different applications? And then more broadly, how do you see BCD as far as how it compares to competing solutions?
Michael Hsing: While competing with a competing solution, I don't see anybody that's come in and have anywhere close to what MPS have. We are leading by far. Okay. In the past talking about a few years, a couple years, I think that's even much further now. And so BCD5 and we have a first few products in the market. We are launching it now in the market, meaning with all of the probable features in it.
Meera Rao: One of the key things I'd also add for BCD5 that makes it special is that we've also added memory and digital capability.
Vincent Celentano: Okay. Great. Very helpful. Thank you. [Operator Instructions]
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Wong with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
David Wong: Thanks very much. Just a clarification of your earlier answer. You noted slight growth in communications for the full year 2015 but communications revenues if I calculate correctly were down about 10% year-over-year in the second half of the year. So was all this driven by declines in the traditional gateway or did telecom and networking or any other sub-segments of comms also dropped in the second half?
Michael Hsing: I wish we have all the other infrastructure business. We don't have that much, okay. So the rest of it was explained already.
Meera Rao: Also, to add to that, the networking and telecom area has been doing well right through the year. So the weakness in the second half was more attributable to the gateway business which is an area like I said we only play in opportunistically. If the prices are attractive then we will take that business. Otherwise we may not take it in a particular period.
David Wong: Okay. Great. Thanks.
Operator: And I'm showing no further questions on the phone lines at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Meera for closing remarks.
Meera Rao: I'd like to thank you all for joining us for this call and look forward to talking to you at the Q1 earnings call. Have a nice day. Bye-bye.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program. And you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. Q3 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct the question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder this conference is being recorded. I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Meera Rao, Chief Financial Officer. Ma'am, please begin.
Meera Rao - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to the third quarter 2015 Monolithic Power Systems conference call. Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS is with me on today's call. Over the course of today's conference call, we will make future projections and statements that involve risks and uncertainty, which can cause results to differ materially from management's current news and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that can cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q3 earnings release as well as in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on March 2, 2015, and a Form 10-Q filed on August 3, 2015 which are accessible through our website, www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today's call. Today, we will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, operating income, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to a measure the financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC, is a table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures and GAAP financial measures. Investors should refer to the Q1 through Q3 releases for 2014 and 2015, as well as the reconciling tables posted on our website. I'd also like to remind you that today's conference call is being webcast live over the Internet and will be available on our website for one year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. Once again, MPS delivered record-breaking quarterly revenue of $91.2 million, representing a 16.4% increase from the third quarter of 2014. For nine consecutive quarters, MPS has enjoyed double-digit, year-over-year quarterly revenue growth. In addition, MPS's non-GAAP gross margin expanded 20 basis points year-over-year to 55.1%. Our non-GAAP operating income of $23.8 million grew 21.3% from the year-ago quarter. Our third quarter operating margin also rose from 25% in the year-ago quarter to 26.1% in the third quarter of 2015. More importantly, non-GAAP earnings of $0.55 per share represented an all-time record and grew 19.6% over the third quarter of 2014. Looking at year-over-year quarterly revenue growth by market segment, computing and storage revenue was up 40.9%, industrial grew 36.9% and consumer revenue also increased by 11%. Let me speak to the results of each end market. Storage and computing revenue rose to $18 million driven by growth in cloud computing, high-end PCs and storage. In the industrial market, revenue grew to $18.9 million fueled by product sales for applications in automotive and power sources. Revenue from consumer markets increased to $39.5 million, largely attributable to growth in high-value consumer markets like home appliances and battery management. Revenue in the communications market of $14.8 million was down on lower networking and telecom revenues. Turning to the financials. Our revenue for the third quarter was $91.2 million, which was above the midpoint of our guidance. Compared with the second quarter of 2015, our revenue increased $9.8 million primarily due to growth in computing, industrial and consumer markets. This sequential growth of 12% was well above industry average. Looking at our revenue by end market, computing revenue grew sharply by $5.4 million from the second quarter on strong growth in SSD storage, as well as growth in high-end PC markets and servers. Consumer revenue increased by $4 million due to increasing demand from our newer high-value markets such as gaming, home appliances and battery management as well as from the markets we have traditionally served. Fueled by higher demand in the automotive and power sources market, industrial revenue, which represents 20.7% of our revenue in the third quarter, ramped up $2.6 million from the previous quarter. Communications revenue declined by $2.2 million due to soft demand primarily in our traditional gateway markets. Moving on to gross margin. Our third quarter non-GAAP gross margin increased 10 basis points over the prior quarter to 55.1%. On a GAAP basis, our gross margin was 54.2% in both Q2 and Q3 with the only difference between the GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin being stock comp expense and charges for acquisition-related amortization. Let's review operating expenses. Our non-GAAP operating expenses for the third quarter of 2015 increased approximately $1.5 million to $26.5 million. In the third quarter, GAAP operating expenses were $36.1 million compared to $34 million in the second quarter. The difference between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for these quarters is stock compensation expense, as well as expense or income on an unfunded deferred compensation plan. Stock comp was $10.2 million in Q3 compared to $9.2 million in the prior quarter. Q3 GAAP operating expenses benefited from a $500,000 increase in investment income related to the deferred comp plan. In the prior quarter, GAAP operating expenses included $100,000 of investment income related to the deferred comp plan. Switching to the bottom line. On a non-GAAP basis, our Q3 net income was $22.4 million or $0.55 per fully diluted share. This result is computed with an estimated tax rate of 7.5%. Q3 2015 GAAP net income was $11.2 million or $0.28 per fully diluted share. During Q2, MPS resolved the tax issues arising from the IRS's audit of the 2005 to 2007 tax years, we recorded a net one-time charge of $1.6 million for tax and $1.1 million in interest related to prior years in the second quarter of 2015. Now let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $235 million at the end of the third quarter of 2015, slightly below the $236.4 million at the end of the prior quarter. This reduction in cash was attributable primarily to the $13.6 million we spent to purchase 284,000 shares under our stock buyback program, payment of an $8 million quarterly dividend and $2 million of capital equipment purchases. In Q3, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $21 million. Cash proceeds from employee stock plan purchases and from the exercise of employee stock options contributed another $1.3 million. Accounts receivable ended the third quarter at $30.5 million, up from the $26.8 million at the end of the prior quarter on higher third quarter revenues. Days of sales outstanding were 30 days in both the second quarter and third quarter of 2015. Our internal inventories at the end of the third quarter were $67.3 million compared with the $65 million at the end of the prior quarter. Days of inventory decreased from 159 days at the end of Q2 to 147 days at the end of Q3. Days of inventory in the distributor channel decreased for the second consecutive quarter. I would now like to turn to outlook for the fourth quarter of 2015. Despite the softness in the economy, MPS expects to achieve a record fourth quarter. Our revenue guidance is in the range of $84 million to $88 million. At the midpoint of the guidance we are projecting 13.6% growth over the comparable quarter from a year ago and a 17.6% growth for the year. We also expect the following: Non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 54.6% to 55.6%, GAAP gross margin in the range of 53.9% to 54.9%. Total stock-based compensation expense of $9.5 million to $10.5 million, including approximately $300,000 that would be charged to cost of goods. Litigation expenses of $200,000 to $400,000, non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense in the range of $25 million to $26 million. This estimate excludes stock compensation and litigation expenses. Other income of $200,000 to $300,000 before foreign exchange gains or losses. Fully diluted shares in the range of 41.1 million shares to 41.5 million shares before share buyback. In conclusion, as expected we outperformed the market. I'll now open the microphone for questions.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Your line is open.
Tore E. Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes, thank you. My first question on your consumer business. I know the high value segment has become a larger and larger percentage of that business. Could you give us a ballpark on where you are with the high value as percentage of the consumer bucket?
Meera Rao - Chief Financial Officer: It's more than a third of our consumer revenue, approaching 40%, I would say in the third quarter.
Tore E. Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, very good. Okay, and...
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, Tore, the application is a variety of Internet of Things (13:11), okay. If it's related to Internet and also some wearable stuff in sports cameras, and that kind of things, and we see there's a lot more activity in recent years.
Tore E. Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Very good. And the strength you're seeing in server storage, it sounds like that's primarily SSD related. So when we think about the opportunity that you have in the server market, especially on things like core power, that hasn't even started right just yet, right?
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: The core power we have a few customers from last year, we start to ramp, and the bulk of a core power ramp would be end of the next year, the early 2017.
Tore E. Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, very good. And, Meera, I think you mentioned that distribution inventories were down again this quarter. Could you maybe add some color there, how low can they possibly go, and what types of visibility discussions are you having with some of your end customers at this point?
Meera Rao - Chief Financial Officer: Sure. As we have done in the past, anytime we hear any suggestions of macro weakness, we typically hold inventory in the channel and that's what we have done now for two quarters in a row. And as you're aware, if we continuously keep it down, there's sometimes panic of shortage, so we'll continue to watch inventory in the channel and manage it as low as we can without generating any panic.
Tore E. Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Sounds good. Congratulations on the results. Very impressive. Thank you.
Meera Rao - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you.
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Matt Diamond - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, guys, this is actually Matt on Ross' behalf. Congrats on the great results as well.
Meera Rao - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you.
Matt Diamond - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I wanted to ask you about the comms market. I know that it was mentioned that softness in the traditional gateway market happened in 3Q, but if you could extrapolate a little bit further on that, just to get a better idea of how long the weakness is expected to persist and what could catalyze its rebounding?
Meera Rao - Chief Financial Officer: Most of the traditional market is – the traditional gateway market is something that's got lower gross margins, so it's not a market that we pursue aggressively. So if the demand is low, we just let it play out. We are more strategically focused on other markets, which have higher gross margin profile.
Matt Diamond - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Duly noted. And the OpEx plan, it was mentioned last quarter that there's a little bit of a step-up given the ramp in the fourth foundry. I just wanted to calibrate that for the fourth quarter. Should we still expect – heading into 2016, rather, should we still expect a little bit of alleviated OpEx heading into 1Q or has something occurred to change that?
Meera Rao - Chief Financial Officer: No. One of the things you would have noticed is we have reduced our OpEx a little bit this quarter on the fourth foundry, and you'll see that spill over into the first half of next year. So we continue to invest in our fourth foundry.
Matt Diamond - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Excellent. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Smigie of Raymond James. Your line is open.
J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thanks a lot and add my congratulations on pretty good results in a pretty tough environment. I was hoping you could comment a little bit on how you think about seasonality going into the first calendar quarter. I mean, you have a very nice guide here which to me looks better than seasonal, so does that mean we should be a little bit more cautious on the March quarter before you got some big ramps next year?
Meera Rao - Chief Financial Officer: You know, at this point we don't give guidances for Q1, so we tend to look at – seasonally, we are typically down 5% to 10%, then it's a question of how much growth do we have to offset it and more importantly what's the macro. So at this point, I can't give any color on Q1.
J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, great. But overall as you pointed out, you guys have been getting double-digit growth year-over-year for quite a while. Is it fair to think that calendar 2016, we could probably see continued double-digit growth there, could that be 15% or something even higher like we saw this year?
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: I think the growth will be accelerating and if not like 16% (18:10), will be in 17%s (18:12), and we are really targeting more than 20% growth, and you see the results, just the recent results, this is at the beginning, and since last couple years we released all the right product to the right customers and the result in two or three – in a couple of years – well, two years or three years since last years and that will really accelerate MPS growth.
J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, great. And last question was just, can you give any new color on motion control programmability? Any new color there would be great? Thanks.
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: The motion controls products we'll release in the first half of next year, and this is the product, not the same as what we do before and before we always have fixed products and you have design wins and once when the product is ready and now there's all – F (19:28) solution based and a lot of them is based on FPGAs and even before we have a product ready, and we could engage with a lot of those customers. And so we have a lot of tremendous design activity going on now.
J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thanks. And then any color on – update on color on the programmability that you mentioned at Analyst Day?
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. The other one is the module ones and the power modules and also the FPB, FPPM (20:07) and Field Programmable Power Modules and the Field Programmable Power IC, FPPC (20:12). And those are still very much on schedule. As we're speaking we're releasing many products now.
J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Wong of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thank you very much. Could you give us some idea as to how your R&D expenses might trend out next few quarters and what your highest priorities will be in terms of new projects that you're investing in?
Meera Rao - Chief Financial Officer: So in terms of R&D, as well as sales and marketing, we will continue to invest because everything that we do in terms of resources we bring on board next year actually sets us up even better for growth a year or two out. So we will continue to do that, but we expect at the end of the day, they'll be leverage to the bottom line. Places where we'll spend on R&D, one is going to be the fourth foundry, the bring up the foundry. The second is going to be on differentiated products, which are targeting at different markets, some of which we have discussed in the past, some of which we will be discussing over the next year or two.
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Overall, the R&D growth, okay, and expenses growth will be much less than the revenue growth and you see our history.
David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Great. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham & Company. Your line is open.
Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: Hi, guys. Let me second (21:52) my congratulations. Just wanted to come back, Meera, looking at the breakout by end market, the compute (21:58) was up nicely and telco down to the lowest level in probably five quarters or six quarters. Just trying to get a sense on the compute side, do you think that SSD strength continues or was there sort of some, one-time business that you are able to take advantage of in the quarter? And then similarly on telco, I know that the telco market has been fairly weak, especially in some of the wireless comm infrastructure. But some of your peers have started to say, they're starting to see some uptick in comm infrastructure, wondering if you're seeing any pickup there.
Meera Rao - Chief Financial Officer: Sure. When we look at computing, in storage, SSD storage, we had a new design win that started ramping up for us in Q3 and that was part of the growth. In Q4, as far as storage is concerned, I see two things playing out. We typically sell our SSD products both to enterprise as well as high-end client, and there's usually seasonal weakness in both Q4 and Q1 on the high-end PC side of it. The second I think, overall, there is some softness in both HDD and SSD, particularly as we go into Q4. In terms of our communications, a lot of the weakness that we're seeing there has been in our gateway business. These are things like modems, routers, LAN cards that are sold to the home and the home office. There's also a little bit of weakness, I would say, in the networking and telecom side of the business, and there it's a mix of wired markets as well as wireless, so we're seeing a little bit, but I'd say more of the weakness is in the gateway side of the house.
Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: And just sort of two follow-on questions, can you give us any sense what percent gateways might be of the overall comm bucket? And then if you take a step back looking out at the broader business, across all end markets, obviously, the economy seemed to take a little bit of a breather. Over the summer, we saw a lot of the analog, mixed signal group indicating order softness. To the extent that you saw that slowdown late summer, would you say things have stabilized now or orderly times still fairly short and difficult to predict? I mean, a couple of your peers have said think we're through the worst of it, wondering if you might be able to make a similar comment.
Meera Rao - Chief Financial Officer: In terms of the auto momentum, we typically record (24:37) six weeks to eight weeks lead time to our customers, except for a few new products, which might have a slightly longer one, and we have not seen any change from that standpoint. I mean, we are – I guess, we are in so many different markets that we never feel comfortable quite calling the macro. We depend upon our larger, more stable competitors to call them macro for us. So if I were to say markets where we have seen some weakness, I would say it's in the traditional gateway business for the home, home office. I'd also say there's some in storage. Beyond that, I couldn't really comment about the macro.
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: That's the beauty of the MPS, we are in a position we don't know, so okay (25:25). Everything is a good opportunity for MPS.
Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Ruben Roy of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.
Ruben Roy - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Thank you. I had a follow-up on that last discussion topic as it relates to the distributor channel inventory. Meera, you talked about the inventory down for second consecutive quarter and you answered a question around that. I'm just wondering, what's going on in Bisbee (25:57)? Is that being actively managed down for any reason, would you say? Have you guys seen any change in the way distributors want to hold inventory at this point based on what they're seeing from the macro? And also I don't think I caught it, but can you give us the range, historical range in weeks that you typically see in distribution and where you are within that range at this point? Thank you.
Meera Rao - Chief Financial Officer: Sure. Our typical range is about 30 days to 45 days of inventory. And we typically prefer to hold in the upper half of that, so we have not seen any particular push from distributors to hold less. This has been more something that we have actively managed and we have done in prior years as well, whenever we start seeing signs of a macro weakness, we start managing the inventory and the channel to the best we can so that the days come down and that's what you see played out for the second time.
Ruben Roy - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Okay.
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, hi, Ruben. I try to convince our shareholders that our inventory is not really like a traditional mature semiconductor company. It's indicating of a future business. I'm guess I'm losing the battles. This is the growth (27:33) company, and we have a lot of product released, and what kind of inventory holds and it really depend on what kind of product that we released. So that's how I can best put it. So slight inventory change, okay, it doesn't mean our futures.
Meera Rao - Chief Financial Officer: Yes. Add on to that, in terms of the inventory, the internal inventories that we hold, we are now at about 147 days. Internal model is about 135 days to 155 days, and we expect in the next few quarters, there'll be more around the 150 days for all the reasons that Michael talked about, particularly the new products, as well as inventory needed to support our strategic customers.
Ruben Roy - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Right. Yeah, that's helpful. I was trying to see – get to whether or not anything had changed in distribution behavior, but I understand what you're saying, Michael. So thank you for that. Just a quick follow-up. In terms of the end market mix, obviously, there's some near-term issues going on in communications and you had a new design win ramping within storage. But as you look out into next year, would you say that the mix would be sort of similar to historical levels with communications still sort of in the low to mid-20%s as a percentage of revenue, and maybe if you could comment on if there are any changes that you're seeing with mix as you look ahead to 2016 based on design wins, et cetera, if any of that may impact gross margin. Thank you.
Meera Rao - Chief Financial Officer: So, when we look out into 2016, I'd expect to see growth in computing, consumer, and industrial markets. Communications, I'm guessing, is going to be mostly flat. And all the revenue drivers are essentially all the different drivers we have talked about in the past. I continue to believe that industrial is going to see strong growth next year with automotive markets leading the way, but you'd also expect to see growth in smart meters, in security, in power sources. In consumer, we expect to see the newer high value markets continue to grow and in the computing section, it would be SSDs, servers, as well as high (30:13), and a module business would also continue to grow and AC-DC, which is distributed among all these markets, would also be growing next year. So, we expect to see multiple areas of growth.
Ruben Roy - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Okay. Thank you, Meera.
Meera Rao - Chief Financial Officer: You're welcome.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Rick Schafer from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Rick E. Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey, thanks. Michael, you mentioned strong design win momentum for e-motion (30:44). Can you talk a little bit about the number of design wins, or quantify the number of design wins you guys have so far. I know it's a new product and it's early days, but just to give a sense of maybe what that equates to in terms of dollars of backlog or any kind of color around that you could give?
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. I'm so far as you know, we talked about, we have a separate chips now, (31:08), and a real e-motion (31:10) chip that we're going to release next year, and those we use – now use a programmable third-party product and that's FPGAs to do the feasibility study in our customers' systems. And so, it's hard to quantify in a dollar sense (31:42), but the SANS (31:44) portion of it we have a – we generate revenues, and I don't know what is the revenue numbers now. It's not small. Well, small means, in our case, it's still – now, small means it's still some millings (31:58), okay, and for the entire next years.
Rick E. Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And maybe a follow-up to that is, are there any hints of competition? I mean what are you seeing from the legacy guys? How are they responding in that space, or are they responding?
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay, to them it's shocking and the good or bad and the good things is, wow, you can do this. And then now is the bad thing is really a behavior change. Okay. People change the design their system in a different way. And they don't have to use the encoders (32:46). They don't have to use the step models, and they don't have to use a brushed model anymore. And there's a momentum, think the brushless models, whether encoders (33:02) costs very, very high, and now when you look at this solution, its cost is so low. And overall they had to get over this barrier somehow in terms of how they design in their system. And so obviously, and it is a large market segment in like a printers and some of the traditional robots and they were adopting a first, and so still these are design cycles – is a one year or just a couple of years.
Rick E. Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And I know you've talked in the past about sales and marketing, maybe as a gating factor on your growth. I mean, this sounds like a perfect example, where you're going to have to help kind of get people over the hump or get people comfortable with the new solution as compelling as it is. I mean, should we read anything into that in terms of like looking into 2016, 2017, should we expect to see some of your sales and marketing expenses maybe take a step up as a percent of revenues or any change, I guess, maybe to the model you've been running? I think, Meera, correct me, but I think you've been running overall OpEx at sort of 50%, 60% of your top-line growth. But just basically looking to see if any of that was going to change.
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: That's a very sensitive question, (34:34), yeah. And let me answer in that way. Our long-term shareholder, everything what we do is affect us three years, four years out. So, for the long-term investors and have the same kind of a length and so then our company's goals is perfectly lined up with our investors, but other long term is shorter than three years, four years, like one year to two years, then it's a not quite aligned with it. We published the models and we're going to grow the OpEx in slightly less than half of a revenue growth, which to me doesn't quite make sense and – but we balanced our shareholders' interest there.
Rick E. Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): All right. Thanks, Michael.
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay. I give you very political answer, so that's how we do it.
Rick E. Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Right. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Anil Doradla of William Blair. Your line is open.
Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey, guys, congrats on the great results.
Meera Rao - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you.
Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Couple questions. On the auto side, Meera and Michael, can you remind us how much is the contribution as part of industrial? And also with the recent controversy on Volkswagen, does that have any impact? I know you guys are very small on this overall market, but would love to hear some feedback on that because we get questions by clients on that.
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, we are very small and secondly, we're not in engine (36:21), okay.
Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: And on the auto side?
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: It doesn't really affect us, okay, in terms of automotive. We're more into lighting, infotainment, and more the lightings, all kinds of lightings, okay. You have security, okay, you have lightings and illuminations, and okay (36:47), also the dashboards and we have – the other one is the camera side, and okay (36:55). So we have a lot of design activities, and it really doesn't affect.
Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: And what is the contribution, Meera, of auto to the overall industrial?
Meera Rao - Chief Financial Officer: I'd say among the four growth drivers in industrial, it's the biggest.
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: So we don't give a percentage out. Okay. And next year we have to break out. Okay.
Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Okay. So it's going to be material up (37:24), that's good to know.
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah.
Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Now, typically on the telecom side when we look at the big metal guys, when we go to the slump or weakness, we've historically seen based on precedence call it a three quarter air pocket and we come back. Now, Meera and Michael, based on your experience, with even the gateway business, I mean, I'm thinking it should be shorter air pockets, but do you have any experience with the duration of softness once you get into the space from MPS's point of view, any perspective?
Meera Rao - Chief Financial Officer: I mean, we have seen it be one quarter like we did last year. The two years prior to that, it was each two quarters. Before that, it has been three. When it comes to macro weaknesses and stuff, we just don't feel comfortable. I can look at it afterwards and say what we saw. I want to emphasize again that the gateway business is low margin and we just play in opportunistically. So we don't spend a lot of time doing any soul searching in the space.
Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And finally, Michael, on the – I saw some press release from TI, some product, now it was not brushless, it was around brush, but it was around sensing, could have been one of those small ancillary press releases. But coming back to your (38:48) – I think someone asked a question related to that. What is competition doing on it? Are they trying to beef up their assets in this space, or they're totally clueless or they're not focusing on it?
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: They are (38:59), I think they do some current sensing. The current sensing and I don't know if you refer that one. I know – there's a product release and there's a current (39:08) – integrated with a current sensing. The current sensing – the model (39:13) driver, we released two years ago. These are...
Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay.
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Our sensing is the sensing that rotor of the models and that's a Siemens (39:26) technology. So it's entirely different.
Meera Rao - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. So e-motion product stocking (39:31) is much more advanced than the products that you were just talking about.
Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Very good. And congrats once again.
Meera Rao - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you.
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Your line is open.
Tore E. Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes, thank you. I just had a few follow-ups. First of all, your business has been remarkably stable here the last few quarters, stable meaning you have very consistent double-digit growth year-over-year. Now, you probably turned quite a bit of each quarter, but it just seems remarkably stable. So is that mainly because, the new markets that you're getting into have longer lead-times, or is it mainly just because you have multiple design wins hitting all at the same time?
Meera Rao - Chief Financial Officer: I think it's a combination, right. I mean, we have multiple growth drivers, we are playing in different markets, some markets we are growing market share. So, as a result of all that, we have actually continued to see growth. I mean, that is the key reason why we were focusing so much on diversification. It helps us at a time like this. Yes, we see weakness in a few markets, but we kind of see growth in a whole lot of other markets and that's, I think, what's really helping us at times like this. It really showcases the strength of the diversification model.
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah.
Tore E. Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Very good. And not the – yeah, go ahead, Michael.
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, Tore, I might – as I added, okay (41:06), and give you a longer story. Four years ago, we sell up this model, two years ago, we – and four years ago, we are changing – we changed our focus, and then we start knocking on the door for these new customers. And two years ago, we were in the door. And two years later, we have a lot more product. And what I see is why we are not – why we are now in a grow 15%, 18% a year, why not faster? And all the products that we released in the last couple of years, it will indicate in 2017 and 2018 will grow faster. So, this is at the beginning.
Tore E. Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Very good. And not to nitpick on the P&L but, Meera, in the other income line, it seems like maybe there was a negative impact. Was that from foreign exchange, and how should we think about that for the following quarters?
Meera Rao - Chief Financial Officer: So we actually had a positive effect to interest income line from foreign currency. This is more on payments, our payments to our subsidiaries, there's a foreign exchange difference and it turned out to be positive. So typically when we give guidance, we guide it to a $0 of gain or loss because we don't know until each quarter plays out whether it's a gain or a loss. We have had quarters of loss, and we have had quarters of gain. So what we guide to specifically is the pure interest income portion of it.
Tore E. Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Sounds good. Great. Thank you very much.
Meera Rao - Chief Financial Officer: You're welcome.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Smigie of Raymond James. Your line is open.
J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thanks for the opportunity for the follow-up. Just, you gave a great answer, Meera, earlier on how the segments would perform in the coming year. Any sense that you could give us more short term just how you think Q4 each of the (43:35) segments will do sequentially?
Meera Rao - Chief Financial Officer: I think you will see the seasonal – seasonality play out in the gateway portion of communications. You will see some seasonal impact on the SSD for the high end computing, consumer, of course. Industrial, I think, will relatively have less of a seasonal play and that's the best I can describe at this point. As you know, with such a distributed revenue base, we are actually dependent on the resales (44:20) reports we get to actually pinpoint which markets we sell into.
J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Great. And just any color on the lighting market? I think you've had some success there with LED lighting. Just curious, does that – how that's doing into Q4 and how you think about that for 2016?
Meera Rao - Chief Financial Officer: Lighting has – is one of these markets where we haven't seen seasonality play in before – in the fourth quarter and it's a market where we continue to do well because we play in the high-end of the market with a very good dimming solutions, and so we continue to see that play out.
J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Last question was just around auto. I know you guys are extremely diversified, which is great, but just to give us some increased confidence around how we could think about potential opportunity there. Would you say at this point you're on annually tens of millions of vehicles, out of the 90 million or 100 million maybe autos are you on 10 million, 20 million and you've got a little bit on each, are you more concentrated on the vehicles you get in with multiple solutions?
Meera Rao - Chief Financial Officer: So what we are seeing is mostly revenue that we got from design wins that we got about four years ago and since then every year we have increased the pace of our design wins here. We started with infotainment and then we have gone on to safety and...
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Lighting.
Meera Rao - Chief Financial Officer: ...lighting and a whole bunch of other products. So like Michael said, we are not under the hood, thankfully, at this point, but we see on an annual basis there are more and more design wins. So when we look at revenues for automotive, we are increasingly confident that we will see higher revenues each year looking at next year's...
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Actually, yeah, we have – in Analyst Days that we have a slide, and we have a couple of slides and now I think it will be – is online, right?
Meera Rao - Chief Financial Officer: Yes.
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: And you can look at our product and our design cycles. Four years ago, we started knocking on doors and with existing product and, again, two years ago, we're in the door and we engage with all these auto customers and we design specifically for automotive. These products will be – since two years ago will be four years later, which is 2016/2017 and 2016/2017, we're getting to productions, so these are very predictable and very sustainable revenues.
J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, great. All right. Thank you very much.
Michael R. Hsing - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. At this time I'd like to turn it back to Ms. Rao for any closing remarks.
Meera Rao - Chief Financial Officer: I'd like to thank you all for joining us on this call and look forward to talking to you again at our next earnings call in February. Thank you and have a nice day. Bye-bye.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes your program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

===== 2015 Q2  (2015-07-27 17:00:00) =====
Executives: Meera Rao - CFO Michael Hsing - CEO
Analysts: Tore Svanberg - Stifel Steve Smigie - Raymond James Anil Doradla - William Blair Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer David Wong - Wells Fargo
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Monolithic Power Systems Inc. Q2 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a remainder today’s conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Meera Rao, Chief Financial Officer of Monolithic Power Systems. Please go ahead.
Meera Rao: Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to the second quarter 2015 Monolithic Power Systems conference call. Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS, is with me on today’s call. Over the course of today’s conference call, we will make future projections and statements that involve risk and uncertainty, which can cause results to differ materially from management’s current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties, and other factors that can cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q2 earnings release as well as in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on March 2, 2015, and our Form 10-Q filed on May 6, 2015, which are all accessible through our Web site, www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today’s call. Today we will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, operating income, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Included in our earnings release which we’ve filed with the SEC is a table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures and GAAP financial measures. Investor should refer to the Q1 and Q2 releases for 2014 and 2015 as well as the reconciling tables posted on our Web site. I’d also like to remind you that today’s conference call is being webcast live over the Internet and will be available on our Web site for one year along with earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. We’re pleased to report that MPS again delivered record breaking quarterly revenue of $81.4 million representing a 19% increase from the second quarter of 2014. This is the 8th consecutive quarter MPS has achieved double-digit year-over-year revenue growth. In addition MPS’s non-GAAP gross margin expanded 50 basis points year-over-year to 55%. Our non-GAAP operating income of $19.8 million grew 27.6% from our year ago quarter and our non-GAAP earnings of $0.46 per share grew 24.3% over the second quarter of 2014.  The strong organic revenue growth is attributable to efforts initiated four years ago. We have since introduced many ground breaking products in new market and consequently we have consistently delivered revenue growth well above industry average. Four years later MPS is expanding into a new $1 billion market besides power management.  We’re excited to announce that MPS is introducing the revolutionary family of solutions in advance motion control. We are setting a new milestone for the next phase of MPS’s growth. We will discuss this new development in detail at our next Analyst Day on September 15th. Turning to the financial, our revenue for the second quarter was $81.4 million which was above the mid-point of our guidance. Compared with the first quarter of 2015 our revenue increased $7.9 million or 10.7% primarily due to growth in consumer, industrial and computing markets.  Looking at our revenue by end market, fueled by higher demand in the security, smart meter and automotive markets. Industrial revenue which represents 19.9% of our revenue ramped up $2.9 million from the previous quarter. Consumer revenue grew approximately $4.1 million due to increasing demand from our newer high value market as well as from the markets they are traditionally served. Revenue increased $1.2 million in computing largely due to strength in the cloud computing and high end PC markets. Communications revenue was relatively flat due to soft demand.  Moving on to gross margin. Our second quarter non-GAAP gross margin increased to 55% from 54.8% in the prior quarter. On our GAAP basis our Q2 gross margin was up 54.2% from 54% in the prior quarter with the only difference between the GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin being stock comp expense and charges by acquisition related amortization. Let’s review operating expense. Our non-GAAP operating expenses for the second quarter of 2015 increased approximately $300,000 to $25 million. In the second quarter, GAAP operating expenses were $34 million compared to $33.8 million in the first quarter. The difference between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for these quarters is stock compensation expense as well as expense or income on an unfunded deferred compensation plan. Stock comp was $9.2 million in Q2 compared to $9 million in the prior quarter. Investment income related to the deferred comp plan of approximately $100,000 in decreasing Q2 GAAP operating expenses. In the prior quarter investment expenses of $200,000 increased GAAP operating expense.  Switching to the bottom line. On a non-GAAP basis our Q2 net income was $18.8 million or $0.46 per fully diluted share. This result is computed with an estimated tax rate of 7.5%. Q2 2015 GAAP net income was $7.9 million or $0.19 per fully diluted share. During Q2 MPS resolved the tax issues arising from the IRS audit of the 2005 to 2007 tax years. We recorded a net one time charge of $1.6 million for tax and $1.1 million in interest related to prior year.  Now, let’s look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $236.4 million at the end of the second quarter of 2015, slightly below the $239.2 million at the end of the prior quarter. This reduction in cash was attributable primarily to the $7.7 million we spent to purchase 148,000 shares under our stock buyback program; payments of an $8 million quarterly dividend and $1.1 million of capital equipment purchases. In Q2, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $8.7 million. Another $5.4 million was contributed from cash proceeds resulting from the exercise of employee's stock options. Accounts receivable ended the second quarter at $26.8 million up from the $25.3 million at the end of the prior quarter. Days of sales outstanding were 30 days in Q2, one day less than the 31 days reported in Q1 2015. Our internal inventories at the end of the second quarter were $65 million compared with the $53.4 million at the end of the prior quarter. Days of inventory increased from 144 days at the end of Q1, to 159 days at the end of Q2. Days of inventory in the distributed channel decreased from the prior quarter. I would now like to turn to outlook for the third quarter of 2015. We’re expect yet another quarter of a record revenue. We are forecasting Q3 revenue in the range of $89 million to $93 million. At the midpoint of the guidance we are projecting approximately 11.8% growth from the prior quarter. We also expect the following. Non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 54.6% to 55.6%. GAAP gross margin in the range of 53.9% to 54.9%. Total stock-based compensation expense of $9.1 million to $9.7 million, including approximately $300,000 that would be charged to cost of goods. Litigation expenses of $100,000 to $400,000. Non-GAAP, R&D and SG&A expense in the range of $25.8 million to $26.8 million. This estimate excludes stock compensation and litigation expenses. Other income of $200,000 to $300,000 before foreign exchange gains or losses. Fully diluted shares in the range of 40.8 million and 41.8 million shares before share buyback. Conclusion, MPS continues to deliver. As a reminder we’re hosting our September 15th Analyst Day at our San Jose headquarters. We look forward to sharing our vision of the future at that time. I'll now open the microphone for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Your line is now open. 
Tore Svanberg : Few questions. First of all, just given what’s happening out there in the overall environment could you just talk about your relative visibility going into the September quarter, obviously there is a lot of share gains going on here, but just sort of how are your customers feeling right now typically at this time of the year?
Meera Rao: If you're asking the softness that some of our peers have talked about, we’re seeing some softness in a market, but what we’re also seeing is some of our growth drivers and we’re also seeing new opportunities. And all this together with our usual conservatism colors how we look at the quarter. 
Michael Hsing: As you said -- the growth is really from share gain. And to be more precise, all the gain is from the new segment that we entered in, and which wasn't there a few years ago. So the opportunity is for us is great. So that’s why we see the growth and then we see the growth for the next few quarters. 
Tore Svanberg : And your inventory days picked up a little bit again, I'm just wondering what’s behind that, is it basically getting ready for this quarter demand or is it the beginning of the transition to new foundries? Just trying to understand what’s going on there please. Thanks.
Meera Rao: It’s a combination, some of it was in support of the higher shipment this quarter, and also in support of customers demand and strategic inventory build. And some of it is also we need to hold additional inventory until we get another foundry up and running. So it's a combination of those. 
Michael Hsing: Let me answer little more or give a little more color. I’m never concerned about MPS's days of inventories because first thing, in a history of MPS we never have any large amount of write off. Because MPS is a product that lasts of six years to eight years. So in history we never -- let's say we’ll never have a material amount -- the large amount -- have a material to stay there. So we never have it. And we have a very small amount of write offs because -- due to engineering issues that weighed [ph] to a technical issue.  The reason you see the inventory is, overall in the history our inventory fluctuation is because, firstly, we have a lot of engineering lot and they’re ready to take off and other customers are waiting and other reasons are of course and the manner [ph] and the demand. Than the third reason is depend on our pricing. We can use the pricing to book more materials, if it’s a favorite we’ll book more, if it’s less favorite we book less. So these are the reason that’s driving the MPS inventory.  So I give the reason, Tore I gave long, long answer is because I keep hearing our investors ask that MPS has an inventory, so might as well just give a -- once and for all, I give you all the color, what’s the reason behind MPS inventory.
Tore Svanberg : That’s very helpful Michael. Just one last question and I know this is going to be highlight here in about six weeks. But could you just give us a little bit of sneak peak on your advanced motion control new business unit just maybe little bit of more information please?
Michael Hsing: We’re moving to a new era. MPS always relates to some kind of power, this one still relates to a power, but more in the motion controls, and then we introduced in a family, it's really software driven and to have our customers can much easier to implement an motions like robot, they can really easily -- ease of use or ease their design activity. And this is not only for robot, anything motion related, including automotive, and it will be much easier for them to design. So we’re going to talk about it in Analyst Day.
Operator: And our next question comes from Steve Smigie of Raymond James. Your line is now open.
Steve Smigie : Just a few quick one, so if I could just to clarify, I think what I am hearing you say is, one of the reasons for the inventory is up, is that, in bad environments like this you guys can usually get pretty great pricing on wafer and so you take advantage of that to lock in some lower cost, is that one of the reasons?
Michael Hsing: No, the reason we’re not disclosing why, -- there is a reason that either our demand high or second, we have a lot of a new product launching and the third, we may booked -- have a high inventories because of the favorable pricing. We’re not disclose any of the reason.
Meera Rao: Michael was just saying, historically the reasons why we have held higher inventory and he included all the reasons. So favorable wafer pricing is not necessarily the reason why we are doing it now, so that’s the take on it.
Steve Smigie : And then on the advanced motion control, you mentioned automotive, would that be for stuff like power breaking, power steering and then could you also it for stuff like -- seeing some of that used in like air conditioning and the other wide goods where you might have a pump or fans, something like that?
Michael Hsing: Exactly, even in a car anything move, in the car seat, wipers, mirror and everything moves, or the breaks, and all can use MPS product. It’s much easier to use, we really provide a new platform and other ones, as ACs anything related to [indiscernible], electrical bicycles and anything that move, pumps and anything with really a precise measurement, in that case MPS will replace many mechanical parts and also replace the parts called encoders and is an optical device, we will replace all of them.
Steve Smigie : Your auto industrial category was pretty healthy there, can you talk a little bit about what some your bigger buckets are in auto right now?
Meera Rao: We have four buckets in industrial that are big for us, automotive being the strongest and the other three are smart meters, security and power sources.
Steve Smigie : But you're not like very strong in say, like LED lighting in auto or some other areas that we should be thinking about, that you guys are dominating right now?
Meera Rao: So LED lighting, we include a small portion which goes to industrial and commercial in our Industrial segment. The rest of it that goes for incandescent bulk replacement. We include that in the Consumer segment.
Michael Hsing: I think that Steve is asking for as in all of business.
Meera Rao: Within the auto business.
Michael Hsing: I think within the auto business is LED that which were very strong, lot of shipments, lot of designing activities or lot current shipment is in LED and the other one is body automotive, that has nothing under the hood, it’s the body. Lot of DC to DC, these are the product we do in two category, now we shift to auto business.
Steve Smigie : You guys done extremely well here on the quarter and the guide relative to other folks, but as we look out to December that’s typically seasonally soft quarter for you, is that -- and not to guide exact amount, but is it fair to think that you would experience the pro-seasonal softness into December?
Michael Hsing: We’re not usually talking of others, the next two quarters of our guidance, but I can tell you in -- there is a large significant portion of the business, we’re still very much affected by the macroeconomic condition. But overall the new business segment will grow very strong.
Meera Rao: We do know that we’ll have some seasonal weakness in Q4 in consumer and consumer like market and we have our growth drivers. The elements we cannot predict particularly this far ahead is what the macro conditions are going to be in Q4. And as Michael said, we’re not immune.
Michael Hsing: I am excited if we can have year-over-year -- and the four quarters of growth, it never happened, I expected -- I wished it happened, but it’s didn’t happen, so I can wish this year.
Operator: And our next question comes from Anil Doradla of William Blair. Your line is now open.
Anil Doradla : I had one big picture question and then something more specific, Michael obviously you’ve been very excited about this motion control, right, since the acquisition of that small company. But I mean the end markets and applications that you're talking about, when you add them up, I mean we’re talking about billions of dollar. So is it fair to say that -- I mean the addressable market is what $4 billion to $5 billion here for you guys, or are we talking about a very small specific? And when would revenue start coming in from these product lines?
Michael Hsing: I’ll answer your last question first. The revenue comes in now. It’s happening. It’s already shipping. But that’s based on the product, the existing, when we acquired from FEMA [ph] based on those products, we already generate revenue. And it’s not a small revenue, its [indiscernible] meaningful to our revenue either. And to answer the other part about what the -- how bigger the large -- the market segments, it is certainly the over well -- well over several billions and not what over 1 billion or 2 billion. Whether it’s 4 billion - 5 billion, we don’t know yet. And that because the end market is growing very rapidly and I think from the Internet of Things and people now that connect to a phone, now the next explosion of a domain is when you do something, do something and you need automatic controls, those are really [indiscernible]. I see a lot of activity out there, there is a lot of small companies and are doing these kind of things. This product is a perfect for them, there is a product of family, it provides a platform for that kind of implementation.
Anil Doradla : Now Michael I mean clearly you’re very bullish and I think from day one you were very bullish with this very promising product line. So, why shouldn’t I think of this segment being the next $500 million revenue, I mean this should happen very quickly given that no one is there obviously there is going to be some switching cost, but if there you’re talking about these application in the end market and it’s going to be the way you’re talking about, this could itself power the company to double the revenues at where they are today, right?
Michael Hsing: Absolutely, the limiting factor is our sales marketing. Now, and it’s all possible. I think the 500 million, I see a much bigger growth on that. 
Anil Doradla : And finally, Michael you talked about little bit about pricing power. Can you help us understand what position Monolithic Power is in today, given that the modules are finally kicking in with some of these end markets such as, you talked about automotive industrial? How is that affecting the overall pricing environment from your point of view? Is it significantly better than historical levels or, it’s getting offset by consumer? And how should we be looking at your pricing power?
Michael Hsing: Well, our pricing power is, the more as a solution provider, the more we can charge more. And that’s in the last four-five years, our level of integrations and also on top of it and have software and that really gains us our pricing power. And even in the consumer market segments and we’re doing really well. Our customers appreciated those -- the easily used product.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Ross Seymore: Michael you mentioned before that market share gains were really the driver to allow Monolithic Power to offset what’s going on in macro. Can you talk a little bit, either you or Meera about where you think those market share gains by end markets are the most apparent for this year and maybe into next year? And then I guess as a follow on for Meera on that, for the side of the business that you are seeing the weakness on, what are you doing to encapsulate some conservatism into your model and into your guidance, given what we’ve heard from everyone else?
Michael Hsing: Let me answer the first. Of course I am talking about motion controls and I’m all excited about motion control, that’s in the future and Meera can talk about what has been growing in for the last few quarters or so.
Meera Rao: The areas where we see growth this year are some of the same markets we’ve been talking about. We are seeing growth in our industrial markets. We expect to continue to see that. Consumer again it’s our newer market to a large extent, the high value market opportunity that we talk about where we are seeing strength. And computing, and when it comes to computing, it’s both storage as well as cloud computing where we are seeing the strength. So on top of all this and as you roll on into next year and everything, we are in the early inning of modules for example. We expect to get a few millions dollars this year. But as we go onto next year and the year after, we expect to see a lot more revenue there. So that answers the question of where we are seeing growth. And in terms of where we are seeing some of the weakness, we’re seeing pockets of weakness in areas like our gateway communications business. We’re seeing some softness in more traditional consumer market and so we have factored that into our guidance and as you know we have a track record of hitting our guidance. So we sit and put a lot of thought and effort into making sure that we are comfortable with the numbers that we guide the street. 
Ross Seymore: Great, that’s a perfect. I guess as my one follow up, on the OpEx side of the equation you’ve talked about that begin elevated for some period of time as you bring up your fourth foundry. Can you just give us a rough idea of how much of your current spend is targeted towards that and is that something that’s a permanent step-up and then you grow into it, as that foundry ramps or is it something that’s temporary and then will fall off after a period of time?
Meera Rao: Well, currently we’ve started some of the work on bringing the foundry from the standpoint of mass [ph], et cetera, but this quarter we just had a small portion of it in Q2 and we’re going to see more of a stepped up cost in Q3, Q4 going into the first half of next year. And the rough estimate is between these four quarters we’ll expand something -- maybe just a little under $3 million on this mass. And then the rest of the increase this quarter is obviously for some of the sales and marketing that we need, to the people we need to hire in support of growth in newer market.
Michael Hsing: Let me talk about OpEx, I don’t imply MPS will grow tremendously in OpEx. Look at the history, we always grow less than the revenue growth in the history of MPS. And some years ago it goes up a little bit higher than other. If you look in the last four years, and how we expect the next four years will be at similar levels in the plus/minus. But overall I said earlier, MPS growth is limited by our sales marketing. The reason I said I can get into a little more. Four years ago we tried to enter this new market segment so we’re knocking on the door for about two years. Then the four years later we see the door open, we’re in it and there we see lot more opportunity, in that we can grow. But we still want to grow very manageably within the same pattern as in the last four years. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.
Rick Schafer : You guys continue to do great, just in general. I think compared to some others in your peer group. I guess I’m just trying to quantify great, I mean for instance if talk about automotive, I think automotive revenues doubling -- potentially doubling annually for you guys over the next few years which would give us line of sight to that automotive business being something like a $100 million business in the next three or four years potentially. Are there other opportunities out there I’m guessing that e-motion could be another one of those categories. But are there opportunities like automotive that you can lay out for us so we can kind of get a sense of some of these bigger pieces of the pie and how they’re going to ramp over the next, let’s just say three or four years. 
Michael Hsing: I think as the e-motion is across the boat, I mean that and also some of the new emerging market segments, so it’s big enough there. For all our business that you said 100 million, I don’t know 100 million, but in the last few years we grew 100%, we double it every year, is because of we’re small. And growing next couple of years -- in the two years out, I don’t know if we can still double it that will be lot more difficult. But e-motion is -- so far, sky is limited. 
Rick Schafer : Since you mentioned it, how far out is it -- if you want to call it the tipping point? But how far out is that business from sort of hitting that tipping point, the e-motion piece, is that -- and maybe able to find out it’s maybe like a 10% revenue kind of driver, 10% of business kind of business.
Michael Hsing: I think on the consumer side, like a drone, we think generally revenue very quickly. I see a lot of emerging market like a robot, and artificial intelligence, a robot driven by artificial intelligence both are emerging. And I think I truly believe they will more and more, these are all coming. For 10% of MPS revenues -- MPS also growing and I think as we’re going to -- in the next three or four years, I think that we’re going to be -- we’d be more than 10% of MPS revenue.
Rick Schafer : Got it. And if I could just speak one last one, just on the v-core. We’ve talked about the v-core ramp in the second half for you guys and I guess maybe how much this v-core content really go up with Skylake in your eyes. And how big can this business be for you guys here in the second half and that's it. Thanks.
Meera Rao: For the Skylake that's mainly into the notebook business, while Skylake is more interesting than the cycles that have come before. We still tend to view this more opportunistically because the strategic focus continues to on servers. We do believe that this is going to be a stronger cycles and will only play in the high end of the PC business.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from David Wong of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
David Wong: Thanks very much. Can you give us some idea of where the growth in consumer is coming from? This one of your biggest divisions which has been growing at 20% plus year-over-year. So, have you gone into some new segments, do you have new products in particular applications? What is the biggest driver in this segment?
Meera Rao: So, these are our four new markets that we have entered in the last few years that we call our high value market segments and that's where we are seeing most of our growth in consumers coming from these. And just to remind you these are home appliances, these are battery management, LED lighting as well as gaming. So these are the four markets that we are seeing most of our growth in consumer.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Lina Zhang for BayRock [ph]. Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst : Thank you for taking my question and congratulations as well, you guys just keep surprising street. So I have one puzzle in my mind and that given strong growth in the top line as well as in the street grow most and also Michael you mentioned that you are now at favorable pricing some foundries. So, it seems like gross margin expansion is kind of not as --.
Michael Hsing: No. let me break you first. We have not increase of inventory it’s not because we have a favorable pricing I didn’t say that.
Unidentified Analyst : Yeah, I know.
Meera Rao: I has historically been one of the reasons in some of the prior growth, not this one. So just to make that clear.
Michael Hsing: Alright.
Unidentified Analyst : I understand. Thanks for the clarification. But if you look at your top line growth, very strong, especially is this kind of tough market environment, right. And you look at industry growth it's almost more than 30% growth year-over-year in the at last six quarters. So, my puzzle is, it seems gross margin expansion is kind of behind than this kind of two strong growths and -- or you can help me to give me the factors which is in your gross margin, was factors to decide your gross margin?
Meera Rao: It's very simple. As we have said before, as we see more and more revenue come from higher margin opportunities. We also take more of the lower margin revenue and these are in markets like, some of our traditional consumer market or it could be in the gateway business in communications or some time even in notebook. And these are opportunities where as we get more of the higher margin revenue, we do take that. So the idea is if you look at our long term model our gross margin is well within that at the 55% level and so we actually optimize our top line and bottom line more. At the same time showing a steady expansion in gross margin. And we have always talked about the gross margin expansion as a steady growth, it's not a raise.
Unidentified Analyst : Okay, thanks. And also in terms of your new product line motion control and Mike did mention that down the road it will be above 10% of total revenue. So, should we expect you will give us a breakdown, when it reaches a certain amount of revenue?
Meera Rao: When it reaches a material amount of revenue, we would most probably consider breaking it out, but we are not at that point yet.
Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Thank you. And the best of luck that. Thanks.
Michael Hsing: Thank you.
Meera Rao: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And I'm showing no further question at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Meera Rao for closing remarks.
Meera Rao : Thank you, Candus. I would like to welcome you all to come and attend our Analyst Day that's going to be on September 15th, at our headquarters in San Jose, it will be at 9:00 AM California time or noon East Coast time and we’d love to have you all come and attend. Where we can share with you how MPS is going to grow in the years to come. Thank you. Bye-bye.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Have a great day, everyone.

===== 2015 Q1  (2015-04-22 17:00:00) =====
Executives: Meera Rao – Chief Financial Officer Michael Hsing – Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Analysts: Rick Schafer – Oppenheimer Matt Diamond – Deutsche Bank Steve Smigie – Raymond James Tore Svanberg – Stifel Anil Doradla – William Blair Liwen Zhang – Blaylock Amit Chanda – Wells Fargo
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Monolithic Power Systems Q1 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a remainder today’s conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Meera Rao, CFO of Monolithic Power Systems. Ma’am, please go ahead.
Meera Rao: Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to the first quarter 2015 Monolithic Power Systems conference call. Michael Hsing, CEO and founder of MPS, is with me on today’s call. In the course of today’s conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management’s current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q1 earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on March 2, 2015, which is accessible through our website, www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today’s call. We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, operating income, other income, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the Q1 2014, Q4 2014 and Q1 2015 releases, as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our website. I’d also like to remind you that today’s conference call is being webcast live over the internet and will be available for replay on our website for one year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. MPS is pleased to announce record first quarter revenue of $73.5 million representing a 22% increase from the first quarter of 2014. This year-over-year increase which was well above the industry average was fuelled by diversified growth in revenue from all four segment. MPS’ non-GAAP gross margin also expanded 100 basis points year-over-year to 54.8%. Excluding the one time payment of $9.5 million from O2 Micro in Q1 last year our non-GAAP operating income of $15.6 million grew 117% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.37 increased $0.20 over the first quarter of 2014. Looking at year-over-year revenue growth by market segment, industrial was up a record 36%, communications revenue grew 27.4%, consumer revenue was higher by 20.8%, and computing also increased by 7.5% over 2014. Let me speak to the results of each end market. In the industrial market sales rose to $13.3 million, fuelled by product sales for applications in automotive, smart meters and power sources. Communications revenue grew to $17.3 million, largely attributable to growth in networking and telecom opportunities. Gateway revenue also increased year-over-year on market share gains. Revenue from consumer market increased to $31.5 million driven primarily by high value consumer markets like home appliances, gaming, battery management and LED lighting. Computing revenue also increased to $11.4 million. Turning to the financials, our first quarter revenue of $73.5 million was above the midpoint of our guidance. Compared with Q4 2014, revenue decreased by $2.2 million or 2.9% on seasonally lower income – I’m sorry, on seasonally lower revenue in the consumer client based gateway and computing segment. Non-GAAP gross margin was 54.8% slightly lower than the prior quarter. Our non-GAAP operating income was $15.6 million compared to the $18.3 million reported in the prior quarter. Q1 non-GAAP net income was $14.9 million or $0.37 per fully diluted share compared with $0.43 per share in the previous quarter. Let’s review our operating expenses. Our non-GAAP first quarter 2015 operating expenses were $24.7 million. $1.4 million higher than the $23.3 million we spent in the fourth quarter mainly due to higher new products spending and increased compensation cost due to pay raises and higher payroll taxes. Our GAAP operating expenses were $33.8 million in the first quarter compared with $31.8 million in the fourth quarter. The difference between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for these quarters is stock-compensation expense as well expense on an unfunded deferred compensation plan. Stock-comp expense included in operating expenses was $9 million in the first quarter compared with $8.3 million in the prior quarter. Investment expense related to the deferred comp plan increased GAAP operating expenses a $166,000 in the first quarter of 2015 compared to $176,000 of expense in the fourth quarter. Turning to other income, first quarter non-GAAP other income of $516,000 was $229,000 higher than the prior quarter primarily due to foreign exchange…
Operator: [Operator Instructions]
Meera Rao: Now, let’s look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $239.2 million at the end of the first quarter of 2015, slightly below the $244.1 million at the end of the prior quarter. This reduction in cash was attributable primarily to the $10.4 million we spent to purchase 203,000 shares under our stock buyback program; payments of the $5.9 million quarterly dividend and $4.7 million of capital equipment purchases. In Q1, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $13.6 million. Cash proceeds from employee stock option exercises and employee stock plan purchases contributed another $2.4 million. Accounts receivable ended the first quarter at $25.3 million down from the $25.6 million at the end of the prior quarter. Days of sales outstanding were 31 days in both the first quarter 2015 and the fourth quarter 2014 and down from the 33 days in the year-ago quarter. Our internal inventories at the end of the first quarter were $53.4 million higher than the $40.9 million at the end of the prior quarter. Days of inventory increased to 144 days at the end of Q1, from the 107 days at the end of Q4. Inventory in our distribution channel increased from the prior quarter when inventory was lower than usual. Turning to the resolution of matters with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. On April 21, 2015 the IRS signed a formal closing agreement with MPS that resolves the IRS audit of the company’s taxes for the years 2005 through 2007. The resolution includes the following elements. During the second quarter of 2015, MPS will make a payment of $1.2 million for taxes related primarily to the revaluation of a license for certain intellectual property rights of the company, through one of its foreign subsidiaries. The buy-in payment is final and no additional payments will be required with respect to the intellectual property license, for the years under examination or for a previous or subsequent tax year. MPS expects to make a related $1.1 million interest payment in the next few months as well as approximately $200,000 tax payment for the years 2008 to 2013. Under GAAP, the income tax impact is recorded in the period of resolution. Therefore, the results for the second quarter will include a one-time net charge of $2.3 million reflecting the taxes and interest to be paid, partially offset – which is partially offset by the reversal of previously accrued tax liabilities and valuation allowances. Of the $2.3 million book charge, approximately $1.6 million relates to taxes and balance $700,000 to interest. There were no penalties assessed on MPS. The agreement permits MPS to repatriate approximately $17.4 million of cash from its foreign subsidiary without any U.S. federal tax consequences other than those summarized above. I would now like to turn to outlook for the second quarter of 2015. We’re forecasting Q2 revenue in the range of $79 million to $83 million. We also expect the following. Non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 54.5% to 55.5%. GAAP gross margin in the range of 53.7% to 54.7%. Total stock-based compensation expense of $8.6 million to $9.6 million, including approximately $300,000 that would be charged to cost of goods. Litigation expenses of $200,000 to $400,000. Non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense to be in the range of $24.3 million to $25.3 million. This estimate excludes stock compensation and litigation expenses. Other income to be in the range of $200,000 to $300,000 before foreign exchange gains or losses. Fully diluted shares to be in the range of 40.7 million and 41.1 million shares before share buyback. In conclusion, MPS continues to execute against its plans and deliver high growth quality revenue. I’ll now open the microphone for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.
Meera Rao: Just one quick second.
Rick Schafer: Sure.
Meera Rao: Rick, was the phone line off for a minute during the call.
Rick Schafer: Yes, it was about a minute, yes. It was just before you gave the cash number, Meera.
Meera Rao: The phone…
Michael Hsing: We can reread it. We read it again.
Meera Rao: So yeah just before your question. I’ll just go ahead and I think we were talking about switching to the bottom line. So let me just repeat that portion, on a non-GAAP basis our Q1 net income was $14.9 million or $0.37 per fully diluted share this result is computed with an estimated tax rate of 7.5%. Q1 2015 GAAP net income was $6 million or $0.15 per fully diluted share. Now let’s look at the balance sheet and then we went on to cash, cash equivalent and investments were $239.2 million at the end of the first quarter of 2015 slightly below the $244.1 million at the end of the prior quarter.
Rick Schafer: And you were live for that Meera.
Meera Rao: Okay, great.
Michael Hsing: All right okay.
Rick Schafer: So congrats, on a nice quarter you guys. I just had a couple of questions. The first is maybe can you give us a little more color what’s behind the spike in inventory as we look at 1Q, I mean is it supporting a particular product or customer launch or you guys seeing any – or you guys seeing any push outs or any order cancels or anything like that?
Meera Rao: Sure, if you remember most of last year, we were carrying inventory at around 130 to 140 days and the inventory last quarter ended up being much lower. So for over a quarter we’ve been ramping up our wafers in the foundry and this is in support of higher revenue as in Q2 and Q3, these are all strategic builds that we’re doing to support some of our customers and builds we see coming ahead.
Rick Schafer: So maybe a related question, I don’t know for you or for Michael, Meera. But can you give us a sense of what percent of your revenues last year came from sort a new greenfield products and what your expectations are for this year and maybe looking forward in terms of your mix?
Meera Rao: So if you look at last year our revenue from new products has been coming up to close to 50% of all our revenues coming from new products and for this year also we expect mix to be the same or perhaps even a little richer compared - tied to new products.
Michael Hsing: In general, we released the product and then we see revenues coming above 24 months to 30 months later. So if you specify what a green product is, these are we call it a green product. And for this year, last year, as Meera said, it is about 50% and these are products about four, five years ago.
Rick Schafer: Got it.
Michael Hsing: We’re especially we’re green to these more industrials, telecoms, and automotive and the revenue coming is typically about three years. So, this year, we just will be more fruitful than the last couple of years, we see have a lot more activity all of us three to four years ago.
Rick Schafer: Okay. And is there Michael, this is part of that answer. Is there a target mix for you guys? We look forward the next 12 months, 24 months. I mean in terms of do you want your four buckets to sort of the evenly sized in your model like 25, 25, 25, 25 or I guess do you see comps in industrial kind of become a bigger piece over time.
Meera Rao: Our target markets are communications, computing and industrials and we’ve focused on growing those markets as fast as we can, we also recognize there is an inherent timing in each of those markets to convert design win to revenue. So as long as we see growth in all of them as much growth as we can get then we are happy with it. So we don’t have a strict number saying we want to have 25%, 25%, we don’t have anything that. We just want to see the maximum growth we can in those market segment.
Rick Schafer: Great, thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Matt Diamond: Hi, good afternoon, guys. This is actually Matt Diamond on Ross’s behalf. I want to segue to the gross margin line a little bit. The guidance of about 55% is maybe a little given the new products rollouts, it’s maybe a little bit less than one might have expected. I’m curious if that signals a change in mix for this year, just given that consumer was a little bit better than expected, industrial little bit worse, could you reconcile those two dynamics for us?
Michael Hsing: Yes, Matt, this is Michael. That signal is it’s a really a noise and it’s not really a signal. So that and clearly where that the gross margins in a range, so we focused on the top line growth and a bottom line growth.
Matt Diamond: Okay, I’m sorry. On the - I’m sorry – [duly] [ph] noted, on the buyback, [indiscernible] that there is an extension for the buyback program, could you remind us how much has been used to-date and how much of the authority remains?
Meera Rao: Sure, we have - the buyback was originally the $100 million was authorized through June of this year, through the end of last quarter we had bought about $72.2 million. So we have $27.8 million to go. And this extension allows us to buy according to algorithm that we have put into place.
Matt Diamond: Got it. And the $17.4 million of cash that could be repatriated that’s certainly a nice boost. Could you give us an idea of how much of your cash is generated domestically and offshore?
Meera Rao: We have not in the past shared how much is generated domestically and internationally, but I can share with you that right now over half our cash is onshore.
Matt Diamond: Got it. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie of Raymond James. Your line is now open.
Steve Smigie: Great, thanks a lot. Now I’ll have my congratulations on some nice numbers here. And then you guys just give guidance for the one quarter out, but I think typically you have some good seasonal strength of September and I was just curious, could you comment on and if you’re seeing any reason at this point why wouldn’t have some decent seasonal strength in the September?
Michael Hsing: Yes from, we see the business is a normal and although we give a way we are very cautious for the overall market – overall MPS is feel a much similar players and that we a lot of opportunity.
A – Meera Rao: Yes, you know we always guide conservatively as you know, we are like to hit that numbers. So we see business in normal macro there we see a normal booking patent. So well, we can’t give any guidance for Q3, I don’t see any problems in the horizon.
Steve Smigie: Okay, great thank you. And I guess, you said that you saw some continued gateway strength, can you talk a little bit more about, just give any color more on the telecom on the boards you have got pretty substantial dollar content, that was attracting, so as you might have hoped, or is that still in process, there?
Meera Rao: Yes, in the – on the telecom side we actually saw revenue growth from Q4 to Q1. So I mean, and the rest of the gateway business is all about opportunistic for us, it’s based on the revenue and the mix we decided we wanted to take more. But the telecom side we’re certainly in a growth phase in Q1.
Steve Smigie: Fairchild had their earnings call recently and they talked about taking up some dollar content on a server market as they saw Infineon international rectifier merging, which they said created some opportunity for them on the short-term. Is that something you guys could capitalize on your term I know you’d had some nice product introductions in that area or we still have to wait little bit for that stuff?
Meera Rao: In terms of the server revenue, we’ve been seeing a ramp in revenues every quarter and we expect that to continue until hit all the design, hit their stride. And we always by most of the design wins are done particularly for the Grantley cycle we are always open to picking up any new business as we see it.
Steve Smigie: Okay great, last question was just in computing I think you had talk about within your storage products you are going to introduce some new solutions for SST and I think it was like may be around PCI Express I was just wondering if that’s still on track at this point?
Meera Rao: Yes. We introduced the PMIC for the PCI Express last year. And we have design wins and we expecting to have the revenue start in the second half of this year.
Steve Smigie: Great, okay. Thanks very much. Congratulations.
Meera Rao: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Your line is now open.
Tore Svanberg: Yes, thank you and congratulations on the results. A two questions as first of all your consumer business was up 20% year-over-year and I know you had obviously your next generation BCD products. But if you look at that 20% how much of that growth is coming from new generation BCD products versus new applications penetration?
Michael Hsing: I think that – I don’t have the numbers to quantify exactly which is – and which in that, but overall in the growth some modules business and some other newer products and these are release the products these products released about a couple of years ago and as you know the consumer is always he can gain a revenue very quickly. But this time were a lot more pickier and these are revenues that we make sure, these are just the sustainable revenues and sustainable with the margin.
Tore Svanberg: Can I…
Meera Rao: More recently inventory also been looking at our revenues, consumer revenues as a high value market. And what we saw is a lot of strength in the high value market. We also saw pretty good performance in the rest of the more traditional consumer products as well. We saw growth in both.
Tore Svanberg: Very good. And as we look at the outlook for the June quarter, June quarter is seasonally a strong period for you. Do you expect to see growth in pretty much all the segments or are there some puts and takes as far as end market doing better or perhaps where is?
Meera Rao: As first qualify my answer by saying that we don’t have as granular view by all the different end markets as we do when we reach the end of the quarter. But I can tell you that right now we expected to see growth in most of the market.
Michael Hsing: Yes, we don’t see, this time we don’t see any – in all the market segment MPS percentage is very small, there is a lot of opportunity for us to grow although, we can deviate from a market – and impact from a macro markets but we are very cautious and we are very optimistic, okay.
Meera Rao: Optimistic.
Tore Svanberg: Very good. And on the computing side I recognize server revenue continues to ramp, but I know, there is also some potential opportunities to gain some share in notebook core management in the second half of this year. Is that still the case and could you elaborate on that little bit please.
Michael Hsing: In this particular market, we’re very optimistic. And we released the product we have a huge attractions and I think this product we do really well. And then in terms of a numbers that we is – we have a lot of design – we can lot of design win, we have a lot more design win activities you know then before. And it also including that we’re 12.5 and we’re 13.
Tore Svanberg: That’s very encouraging. Last question, if you look at your module business, I know you’ve introduced some new sales strategies there. Is there anything you would like to update us on as far as your sales infrastructure for your module business?
Michael Hsing: Yes, let me answer this way first. Consumer modules always comes in faster. Their product cycles about a year or two or so. And industrial, automotive always comes later. And this year we see lot more activity than in a same period of a last year in industrial and automotive market segment.
Tore Svanberg: Very good and congratulations again. Thank you very much.
Michael Hsing: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Anil Doradla of William Blair. Your line is now open.
Anil Doradla: Hi guys, congrats from my side too. Michael, and Meera can you help us understand what the end market dynamics and behaviors on the communication side I know you guys entered into some of the new vertical, so you are a share gainer. Can you share your thoughts on what you are seeing in China and some of the regarding some of the build outs [indiscernible] has reported, now they are not in your same bucket but things are weak on the outlook. So can share with us what you are seeing on the telecom side?
Michael Hsing: In the telecom side we’re still very new and then we do to the only in fact I can tell you there is we have a lot of design win activities we’re somewhat in slower than automotive on a very much encouraged by all the design activities from a last year and this year.
Anil Doradla: So for – being a new entrance in this market, you are not seeing any kind of soft dynamics out there that’s what I’m hearing, I mean you are just a share gainer there.
Michael Hsing: In the infrastructure side yes, we’re too small to say anything, all I see is opportunity.
Anil Doradla: Okay, great. And can you remind us how much exposure do you have on the PC side and the notebook side?
Michael Hsing: We’re very – we have some revenues and we pick the customers, pick the project really our customers will appreciate our technology.
Anil Doradla: It’s today, I mean when you see very small, would you see less than 5% or 5% to 10% can you give us some sense?
Meera Rao: Yes, currently I exposure to the notebook side, is definitely less than 5%. In last year cycle et cetera, we just played in the market very opportunistically. And more excited about opportunity this year, as Michael said earlier.
Anil Doradla: Very good. And Meera you’ve talked about your BCD three, four contribution, can you give us an update and finally on BCD side, can you share with us some other end market dynamics and your lead versus the competition, thanks a lot.
Michael Hsing: You know BCD4 we’re still lead by our competitor by a wide margins. The BCD5 I can tell you this. Stay tuned now in our product is about being in productions.
Meera Rao: And as with regards to BCD three and four, I would say it’s approaching 70% of revenue at this point.
Anil Doradla: Great, thanks a lot guys and congrats once again.
Michael Hsing: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Liwen Zhang of Blaylock. Your line is now open.
Liwen Zhang: Thanks and congratulations, as well. The first question is regarding your industrial segment. March quarter usually is pretty strong for industrial and the automotive. But I see you had kind of a flattish growth, sequentially. Can you tell me what happened there, and how should I look at it during this quarter?
Meera Rao: Industrial I would say….
Liwen Zhang: Yes.
Meera Rao: In industrial we saw strength in power sources in automotive and not meters, so this is a market where I mean we saw strength in those in security which has been on a tear for several quarters was a little softer I think in one quarter, but I think it’s more a question, customers having bought ahead. And so…
Liwen Zhang: Okay, got it.
Meera Rao: Industrial overall, they also do very well for us in 2015.
Liwen Zhang: Okay. Thank you. Another question is, if you can give us some updates on your Chengdu testing facility in terms of capacity, utilization rates, as well as, so far, MPS does all the testing internally, or what's the ratio for the internal versus external?
Meera Rao: So we’ve been continuing to utilize the test facility in Chengdu, very expensively and we also have some tasting done outside too, so that we can – there is no limit on our test capacity. And we have also taken – we are also in the process of expanding our fab foundry capacity by signing on an additional foundry. And the…
Liwen Zhang: Okay.
Meera Rao: Go on, as you’ll see some of the expenses in bringing up that capacity come on for us starting late in Q2 and more into Q3, Q4.
Micheal Hsing: In terms of the…
Liwen Zhang: Okay, thanks. That’s …
Micheal Hsing: Okay, in terms of a percentage we have a 600 products and growing, the utilization and particularly from a percentage of a inside and outside is difficult for us to do manage, okay, we will spend more money to manage – so spend more money to calculate the percentage than as is.
Liwen Zhang: I see. Thanks. My last one, maybe one analyst already asked. But I still want to understand better about your gross margin. You have more internal testing as a percentage of revenue, as well as your module product ramping up? Which, I believe, even though in the consumer application that you mentioned before, that product line's gross margin will be above corporate averages. Plus, your industrial segment will grow much stronger this year. How shall I think about your gross margin down the road?
Michael Hsing: All the products, all the products – you know pipeline are just released they are much higher than the average corporate margin, however I said that. We – the gross margins is in our models we in the at this period of time we should concentrate on the top line growth and the bottom line growth.
Liwen Zhang: Okay, got it. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Amit Chanda of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Amit Chanda: Hi Michael, hi Meera. Congrats on the quarter. I'm just curious, what percentage of your consumer end market revenue is comprised of modules, at the moment?
Meera Rao: The modules revenue we seeing increased revenue every quarter but right now it’s still a smaller percentage of our revenue.
Amit Chanda: Okay. So, do you expect to release the full suite of module products sometime in 2016? Is that your expectation?
Meera Rao: Terms of revenue will be seeing revenue come from more modules as we go in. We announcing the revenue from the first few modules that we released over a year ago. So I think we already have released something like 12 modules. And then we have a few more that will be releasing. So as more and more of these modules get released we also see more design wins coming from them which is up for a good revenue growth in the quarters ahead.
Amit Chanda: Okay. Great. As a follow-up, I was just curious for your v-core shipments, what the customer mix is? Is it mostly made up of Asian ODMs, or US-based server OEMs, and how do expect that mix to shake out for the rest of the year?
Michael Hsing: Most in the U.S. and some ODMs
Amit Chanda: Okay. Do expect – okay. And you expect that similar pattern to remain for the rest of the year?
Michael Hsing: Rest of the year is a quick, yes.
Amit Chanda: Okay.
Michael Hsing: For the – we’re 12.5 and we’re 13 obviously hasn’t really started yet in so the next patent could changes little bit.
Amit Chanda: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And I’m showing no further questions at this time. I’d like to turn the conference back over to Meera Rao for any further remarks.
Meera Rao: I would like to thank you all for joining us for this conference call, and look forward to talking to you again in July at our second quarter conference call. Thank you. And have a nice day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. This does conclude today’s program and you may all disconnect. Have a great day, everyone.

===== 2014 Q4  (2015-02-04 17:00:00) =====
Executives: Meera Rao - Chief Financial Officer Michael Hsing - Founder, Chief Executive Officer
Analysts: Steve Smigie - Raymond James Tore Svanberg - Stiefel Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer Anil Doradla - William Blair David Wong - Wells Fargo Ruben Roy - Piper Jaffray
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Monolithic Power Systems Inc. Q4 and full-year 2014 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen only mode. [Operator instructions.] As a reminder the conference call is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to Meera Rao, CFO of Monolithic Power Systems. Ma’am, you may begin.
Meera Rao: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome to the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2014 Monolithic Power Systems conference call. Michael Hsing, CEO and founder of MPS, is with me on today’s call. In the course of today’s conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management’s current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q4 earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on March 10, 2014 and our Form 10-Q filed on October 31, 2014, which are accessible through our Web site, www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today’s call. We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, operating income, net income, and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the Q1 through Q4 releases for both 2013 and 2014, as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our website. I’d also like to remind you that today’s conference call is being webcast live over the internet and will be available for replay on our website for one year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today.  MPS is pleased to announce record and allowing you of $282.5 million. Full-year revenue growth of 18.7% clearly outperform the analog industry which SIA estimates accrued 10.2% over the prior year. Four 2014 MPS is non-GAAP gross margin also expanded 60 basis points to 54.6%. Further our non-GAAP operating income excluding the $9.5 million O2 payment micropayment grew 3.6% to $16.6 million achieving record non-GAAP EPS of $1.03, a stellar growth rate of 34.9% over 2013. Over our first decade as a public company we have grown consistently and organically at a compound annual growth rate of 19.5%. Over that same period our share holder returns measured in stock price appreciation grew at a CAGR of 17.5% per year.  Diving into year-over-year revenue growth by market; industrial was up a record 43.3%, consumer revenue grew 22.8% and communications also increased 15.3% over 2013. Let me speak the results of each end market. In industrial and automotive markets, sales rose to $49 million, fuelled by product sales for applications, smart meters, automotive, security and power adaptors. We’ve also seen significant design win activities in industrial and automotive. These design win activities have continued to translate into revenue growth in 2015 and 2016.  Revenue from consumer market increased to $122.8 million driven primarily by high value consumer markets like gaming, LED lighting, battery management and home appliances. Communications revenue grew to $64.6 million, fueled largely by growth in networking and telecom opportunities. Computing revenue was down $1.8 million to $46.1 million mainly due to the ramp down in a huge HD client program that bottomed out in the first quarter of 2014 offsetting the growth in SSD.  Switching to Q4; MPS had a record fourth quarter of its revenue of $75.7 million representing year-over-year growth of 19.1%. Our fourth quarter revenue was above the mid-point of our guidance. Non-GAAP gross margin was 54.9%, the same as the third quarter and 70 basis points higher than the 54.2% reported in the fourth quarter from a year ago. Our non-GAAP operating income was $18.3 million compared to the $19.6 million reported in the prior quarter and $13.7 million reported in fourth quarter of 2014. Q4 non-GAAP net income was $17.2 million, or $0.43 per fully diluted share compared with $0.46 per share in the previous quarter and $0.32 per share in the fourth quarter of 2013.  Let’s review our operating expenses. Our non-GAAP fourth quarter 2014 operating expenses were $23.3 million essentially flat with a $23.4 million we spent in the third quarter. Our GAAP operating expenses were $31.8 million in the fourth quarter compared with $32 million in the third quarter. The difference between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for these quarters is stock compensation expense, income or loss on an unfunded deferred compensation plan and acquisition-related transaction costs basically in the third quarter.  Sub comp expense attributable to operating expense was close to $8.3 million in the fourth quarter compared with $8.6 million in the prior quarter. In addition we incurred approximately $107,000 of deal related expenses in relation to the Sensima acquisition in the third quarter of 2014. Investment income related to an unfunded deferred compensation plan reduced GAAP operating expenses by $110,000 in the third quarter but added $175,000 of expense to the fourth quarter. On a non-GAAP basis our Q4 net income was $17.2 million or $0.43 per fully diluted share. This result is computed with an estimated tax rate of 7.5%. Q4 2014 GAAP net income was $8.9 million or $0.22 per diluted share. Now let’s look at the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents and investment with $244.1 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2014, above $238.5 million at the end of the prior quarter. In Q4 MPS generated operating cash flow of $20.6 million. Cash proceeds from employee stock option exercises has contributed $1.5 million. These cash incentive for partially offset by $8.2 million of expenditures on purchase of 194,000 shares under our stock buyback program. In Q4 we also funded the $5.8 million quarterly dividend declared in Q3 and be purchased $2.4 million of capital equipment. Accounts receivable ended the fourth quarter at $25.6 million, higher than the $24.3 million at the end of the prior quarter due to the higher sales in the third month of Q4 compared to the prior quarter. Days of sales outstanding were up to 31 days in the fourth quarter from the 28 days in the prior quarter, down from the 24 days in the late year ago quarter Our internal inventories at the end of the fourth quarter were $40.9 million, essentially flat with the $41.6 million at the end of the prior quarter. Days of inventory increased to 107 days at the end of Q4 from the 105 days at the end of Q3. Days of inventory in the distributed channel where once again lower than the prior quarter and the lowest level we have seen in the last two years. I would now like to turn to the outlook for the first quarter of 2015. We have forecasted our Q1 revenue in the range of $70 million to $74 million. We also expect following. Non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 54.4% to 55.4%. GAAP gross margin in the range of 53.5% to 54.5%. Total stock-based compensation expense of $8.5 million to $9.5 million including approximately $300,000 [inaudible]. Liquidation expenses of $100,000 to $200,000. Non-GAAP, R&D, and SG&A expense to be in the range of $23.3 million to $24.3 million. This estimate includes stock compensation expense and litigation expenses. Fully diluted shares to be in the range of 40.4 million to 40.8 million shares before share buyback. In conclusion MPS had outstanding results in its first decade as a public company. A product diversification strategy, backed by MPS proprietary leading edge technology has proven successful. Looking ahead into the next decade we’ll continue to execute strategy for sustainable and consistent growth and thereby enhance value to our shareholders. I will now open the microphone for questions.
Operator: [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg of Stiefel, your line is now opened.
Tore Svanberg: Congratulations on the results and I guess on the decade; so my first question is on your communications business, it was up 10% sequentially with sort of bucks the trend seasonally and maybe even in relation with some of your peers, so can you talk a little bit about what’s going on with that business and would you expect them to continue?
Meera Rao: The quarter-over-quarter increase that you find in Q4 was in our traditional gateway business. If you remember back in Q3 had been a little choppy and lower than expected. So you are correct. It is a seasonally higher -- looking into Q1 I do expect this seasonal weakness in traditional gateway business. Our networking and telecommunication business has been steady through the fourth quarter and we expect the same in the first quarter.
Tore Svanberg: Very good and my next question and I don’t want to necessarily pick on anything negative but the one area that so decline last year was your storage and computing business, obviously there were some specific reasons why but as we look into 2015 should we expect that business to show growth more in line with what your SSD key business is doing?
Meera Rao: Yes because we have less exposure, the client SED business and our SSD business will continue to grow over the year.
Tore Svanberg: Very good and then again looking at ’15 and looking at your four segments, could you may be rank what segment you expect to grow relatively faster and relatively lower?
Meera Rao: We expect all four segments to grow and I have never been a fan for ranking them. We expect particularly in a newer products in each of these markets we expect to see very good growth next year.
Michael Hsing: And also the computing business and lot of our designing win will comes in as a revenue in the second half of the year.
Tore Svanberg: Okay very good and just one last question, can you talk a little bit about your relative visibility here in this quarter, I mean I know this quarter is seasonally a down quarter with Chinese New Year and so on but just relatively speaking, how is your visibility looking for the quarter in terms of the backlog or bookings or anything like that. Thanks.
Meera Rao: It’s a quarter where we came in with very good bookings, a backlog rather and we have continued to see good bookings. We feel comfortable about the guidance that given and very confident right now.
Tore Svanberg: Very good. Thank you and congratulations again.
Operator: Thank you and our next question comes from the line Steve Smigie of Raymond James. Your line is now open.
Steve Smigie: Thanks a lot guys. Another solid year, I think from that 19% it grow pretty close 20 there, can you comment Michael on what you see as the opportunity for this year, have got any products you are talking about the growth, because you do another 20% growth here or better?
Michael Hsing: I can’t particular with what the percentage is although it really depend on the micro economic but I can tell you that whatever we – in the past three or four years, we did obviously with the [indiscernible] all the result which is coming from what we did in the three to four years ago, in our next year result, as we – what we have planned to see in the about one to three years ago and every things are the indications of we are on the right track and from a cloud computing mainly the servers communicating sites and also industrial and automotive and all of these segments, we are doing really well.
Steve Smigie: Okay great and specific to the server market, we saw obviously convenient and -- rectifier merge and then obviously maximum another competitor in the space, it seems like it’s opening up a lot for you guys because [indiscernible] can you talk about the opportunity in the server market in the 2015 may be even in 2016 as you may be there some designs opportunities to ramp in 2016.
Michael Hsing: Obviously, this is another MPS as a player and we have a much better chance now but server market is a very conservative and a [indiscernible] successful now and also the [indiscernible] and we start shipping now.
Meera Rao: Just to add to that very quickly, for this year’s revenue all the design wins have already been done back in 2014 and so we seem that play through, I think as next year comes out the things get more interesting because that's where the consolidation in the marketplace plus it will be, our second round in this market all those things would play to our benefit.
Steve Smigie: Okay. Last question I [indiscernible] just as we look at gross margin going forward, it seems like you are getting decent traction in your products and this carries higher gross margin historically, what is the gross margin expansion opportunity there as the mix improves. Could it be over 100 basis points or better for the year?
Meera Rao: As we have been saying in the past, we expect to grow to our gross margin steadily and consistently. As you know as we get more of the higher margin revenue, we have opportunity to take some of the lower margin revenue so that we can accelerate top line and bottom line growth and we expect particularly the same so I can say all the time our revenue grows I would expect to see a slow and steady increase in gross margin.
Steve Smigie: Okay thanks a lot and congratulations on the numbers.
Operator: Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Q – Matt Diamond: Good afternoon guys. This is actually Matt Diamond on for Ross. I want to ask a question that has been alluded to earlier but I am going to ask a little bit a in a different way, could you walk us through the drivers of your long term growth, there is a target out there of 20% to 25%, I am just curious what driver you see to get there over the next year or so, the next two to three years even, any of the biggest positives and negatives that you can see at this point.
Meera Rao: As you know one of the key strategy is to grow through a diversification, so we expect the growth to come in from multiple market. For example if you take communication from the growth is coming from a newer networking and telecom market, we could also opportunistically say more in the traditional gateway business. When you look at computing growth opportunity comes both from the SSV storage as well as cloud computing and as we look at consumer particularly on newer higher value market opportunities markets like battery management, LED lighting, home appliances, gaming all these will be growth areas. Not to forget industrial where we have had multiple markets that are growing in industrial as well as automotive and in addition to all this we have module which is the contributing revenue this year. So all these together will be contributing growth for us this year and more so next year and we feel very confident about that we are going to have strong growth but since we don’t focus more than a quarter, I don’t feel comfortable to saying our growth could be X or Y% but you are right a long term growth model is to grow top line at 20% to 25%.
Michael Hsing: All of the Meera mentioned, they are all, they are going really well in 2014 and Meera missed another big component of it, the sector DC and that contributes a tremendous revenue and we will continue to focus and it may contribute to grow.
Q – Matt Diamond: Got it and then in same [indiscernible], could you talk about your OpEx trajectory for 2015, I know it has been mentioned that you have enough capacity for these new products but I am wondering if anything has changed from 3Q to 4Q, OpEx as far as the trajectory for 2015.
Meera Rao: Our Q4 OpEx was at same level as Q3, although little higher than guidance and probably reason is that we had the higher—new product development cost up that we saw in Q4. So going forward into 2015 other than the pay raises which we talk about in the last calls, we do expect as revenue grows we will continue to increase our investment because that helps us grow even faster in outer years. So we will do some investment in both R&D side as well as in sales and marketing but it will be in line with revenue growth meaning that the revenue growth is going to be higher.
Matt Diamond: Okay great thanks very much.
Meera Rao: You are welcome.
Operator: Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Anil Doradla of William Blair. Your line is now open.
Anil Doradla: Hey guys congrats from my side, can you comment about the inventory level in the channel, what you are seeing out there , and I have a follow-up 
Meera Rao: Sure, inventory in the channel, when they came into the fourth quarter, it was already lower than the level we had been operating in for the last two years, and given the concerns that we had heard across the industry or perhaps some softness in Q4 we continued to manage the inventory in the channel fairly lean into the fourth, and as a result we came in even lower than the prior quarter. And our expectations as we -- as the business improves over the next few quarters we will take inventory in the channel back up to the levels that we typically operate at.
Anil Doradla: Okay great, and Michael, recently you are quite the Swiss company Sensima, the specialist motor company; what’s the latest on that front and are there any revenues yet [inaudible] from that acquisition?
Michael Hsing: Yes, being with the group and visiting our customers a couple of times, the results are great and some of the opportunity we got with some revenue, and other ones will take a little longer time. In a couple of years our shareholders will think that MPS [inaudible]
Meera Rao: And I think the current revenue, the revenue that we have -- we have a very little revenue currently, but the design wins are shaping up nicely and that way we expect a lot more revenue in future years.
Michael Hsing: Since technology and it will revolutionize the motion control. Many other competitors, didn’t realize.
Anil Doradla: And I don’t know that, but you know you talk about the pipeline design wins and 2 to 3 years or so, shaping on to revenues this year, last year, but there’s a delay. If you want to look at the pipeline and if there was a discount factor to the actual revenues, can you share with us some color about that? Typically the pipeline, is that like the standard -- less than 70%, or whatever happened in the pipeline, it has more or less translated into revenue. Then how that evolved over the time, I mean if it is some qualitative [inaudible] very much in progress?
Meera Rao: We haven’t looked at it with a discount to our design win. Typically once we have the design wins we do see revenue come in, a lot of, how much revenue comes in depends upon how our end customers succeed in the marketplace and also depends upon the macro. But we have been, I would say overall very happy with the conversion of the design wins to revenue. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Ruben Roy of Piper Jaffray, your line is now opened.
Ruben Roy: Meera, I’m wondering if you could give us a little bit of commentary on the service side of the sourcing computing business near-term, kind of what that as expected in Q4, and maybe an update on the Grantley cycle would be great.
Meera Rao: On the Grantley cycle, this is one where most of the design win had been completed in 2013 and 2014. We started seeing our first revenue in Q3 and we ramped in Q4 and we expect to see this ramping up -- continue to ramp this year. Most of the design wins on the Grantley service side are in the point of load. We do have a few recor design wins at some of the emerging silver makers in Asia and – 
Michael Hsing: In the U.S.
Meera Rao: And then the second tier in the U.S. and so this is the first cycle for us, maybe prove our as product, we do happened to have a product, but we have to prove ourselves as a supplier and that our products are reliable. And we are very excited about all the design activity that is taking place for the next cycle that we sealed a better position as a result of having played in the Grantley cycle.
Ruben Roy: That’s really awful. Thanks Meera, and to that end on the last bit of commentary, for the next cycle, I guess which includes inventory for the next cycle, I guess which includes[inaudible] from Intel, would you say that you have some of the content driver coming as well as market share or is that just market share, there is no additional content coming?
Meera Rao: I agree on those.
Ruben Roy: Okay and then just finally I have a follow-up question on the storage side; you had Q1 of last year, the heat from the one OEM, solid-state drive where a big growth driver, I think you are running solid-state drive that maybe a third to a little bit better as a portion of the overall storage business. Do you have any idea as you look at into 2015 based on design wins where solid-state drives end up and then what that might do for growth in the storage area?
Meera Rao: SSD drive revenue in storage is more than half of that, I think it’s close to 50%, and so most of our design wins are either on the enterprise side are on the high-end client-side and so our design wins are playing out. We also have a second SSD teammate that we have introduced. This one is targeting PCIE and SaaS and we expect to see revenue on that in the second half of this year as well. And so all these things together will be driving our growth.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer, your line is now opened.
Shawn Simmons: This is Shawn Simmons calling for Rick. Congrats for the good results and guide. My first question is centered around your automotive and industrial business, you guys so a nice uptick here last year, I guess. How do you view that business for 2015? Do you expect to see sort of the same incremental growth and can you potentially quantify automotive as a percentage of sales?
Michael Hsing: Let me answer that. The industry automotive as you know had a long designing cycle. These are revenues that happened three or four years ago, and we will start to focus on it. And for next year our sphere continues to grow, and in terms of quantifying the numbers, we don’t disclose that. I will let Meera to mention about that. The train is we will focused on this three or four years ago and we continue to focus on and the numbers will grow.
Meera Rao: We have already said in the past, for the last two or three years, is that industrial is always the slowest to grow and we expect steady growth and we recognize that they are actually done a lot better than that and I expect 2015 results are going to be better than the slow and steady nature of growth that we typically associate with industrial. But in terms of an actual growth of percentage we don’t get that kind of guidance. I would say at this point automotive is one of the four big drivers in this and I expect as this year goes through it will be one of the fastest growing drivers within the industrial and automotive segment.
Shawn Simmons: Okay great and the second follow-up on that. As you have two distribution agreements from last year, and is therefore any chance to accelerate it, that growth in there, how are those relationships progressing?
Meera Rao: Those relationships are largely for industrial and automotive revenue, and so the design wins that they are generating would be revenue out later in time just because of the time it takes to convert the design wins in industrial and automotive. So they have been very helpful but that’s going to be future years’ growth.
Shawn Simmons: And in my last question is just on the power modules; I know you guys are expecting to see some revenues this year, how significant you think that can be? And where do you expect some of those initial design wins to start ramping?
Meera Rao: We have our design wins currently for the first four or five modules that we introduced. We already have design wins that is in practically every market that we play in. But as we have said before, just looking at the time to convert from design wins to revenue, consumers always adopt it, but the revenue we expect to see this year would mostly be consumer. We will be very happy if some of the others converted also this year. So we expected revenue from modules, or am willing to say is --
Michael Hsing: [inaudible] because the number is small. In 2003 we introduced our five or six modules. In 2014 we introduced three times amount, like a 15, 16 and for those products generate revenue in by 18-36 months. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Lina Tsang [ph] of [inaudible]. Your line is now opened. 
Unidentified Analyst: My question has been answered. Congratulations as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie from Raymond James. Your line is now open. 
Steve Smigie: Meera, I just wanted a follow-up on the modules, as you said you talked about it is doing fairly well in consumer. I’m just curious what are the margins like on these consumers; in the one hand I feel like the modules are very differentiated products, so we expect something better but at the end of the day, it’s still the consumer market. So I was hoping to get some color on that. 
Meera Rao: Yes, we expect the margins on all the modules to be good, even in the consumer market it will be above consumer margins. 
Michael Hsing: Above corporate average.
Steve Smigie: Okay. And you guys have done a good job, again trying to diversify away from just being a consumer company, with that said it’s in some extent good to hear the consumers, how actually you’re going to grow your ways as the modules take off, is that fair to think because of the success in the modules that you can still have healthy growth in consumer?
Meera Rao: We expect to have a healthy growth in consumer and not just because of the modules, but also because some of these newer high value opportunities that we’ve found like battery management, LED lighting – 
Michael Hsing: These are wearable goods and that’s sports cameras, these are all very high -- customers will appreciate our technology and they will pay for those type of products. I think that internet of things, is emerging and it has a lot more demand for those type of products. 
Meera Rao: Internet is a thing that presents a lot of opportunities for our modules. 
Steve Smigie: Under the comment about gross margins as you said you’ll have the newer products growing and getting a higher gross margin that you’re also going to take some lower margin stuff -- you know given that opportunity. Is that lower margin stuff that you would take, is that consumer or is it kind of spread out across the end markets there?
Meera Rao: I would say it’s in our traditional consumer may be even in our traditional Gateway business those are the kinds of markets that we play in opportunistically. But the net idea is that at the end of the day when our revenue grows we still expect to show an expansion net-net in our gross margin. 
Steve Smigie: Right. On that Gateway stuff, obviously you have some exciting new stuff ramping in coms but I think a decent chunk of coms is still the Gateway business? How are you trying to manage that Gateway revenue to use – do you keep trying to grow that as well or is it more this kind of a cash-cow business. 
Meera Rao: For us, you know as we see opportunities we keep playing -- how much we pick up is all driven by how our revenues and margins are playing out. It is an opportunistic play for us. 
Steve Smigie: And you talked about in industrial [inaudible] it’s just you have the new autos, one of the major drivers -- can you just give it up to any other three major drivers in there.
Meera Rao: Sure, we have smart meters. We have security and surveillance and then we also have power adapters. 
Steve Smigie: Any three here, one of those you expect to do better in 2015 versus the others?
Meera Rao: Automotive. 
Operator: And I am showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to Meera Rao for any closing remarks.
Meera Rao: Thank you for joining us for this conference call, and we look forward to talking to you again in April for our next conference call. Thank you. Have a nice day. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today’s conference. This does conclude today’s program and you may all disconnect. Have a great day everyone.

===== 2014 Q3  (2014-10-27 17:00:00) =====
Executives: Meera Rao - Chief Financial Officer Michael Hsing - Founder, Chief Executive Officer 
Analysts: Steve Smigie - Raymond James Tore Svanberg - Stiefel Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer Anil Doradla - William Blair David Wong - Wells Fargo
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Monolithic Power Systems third quarter earnings conference call. [Operator instructions.] I would now like to hand the conference over to Meera Rao, chief financial officer. Please go ahead.
Meera Rao: Thanks, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome to the third quarter 2014 Monolithic Power Systems conference call. Michael Hsing, CEO and founder of MPS, is with me on today’s call. In the course of today’s conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management’s current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today.  Risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q3 earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on March 10, 2014 and our Form 10-Q filed July 29, 2014, which is accessible through our website, www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today’s call. We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, operating income, net income, and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the Q1 through Q3 releases for both 2013 and 2014, as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our website. I’d also like to remind you that today’s conference call is being webcast live over the internet and will be available for replay on our website for one year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. As expected, MPS delivered again. In the third quarter of 2014, we achieved yet another record, with revenue of $28.3 million, 20% growth over the second quarter of 2013. This growth, which was well above the industry average, was organically fueled by sales into high value consumer, storage, and industrial markets. At the same time, the quality of revenue improved, resulting in a 60 basis point expansion in non-GAAP gross margin, from 54.3% in the third quarter of 2013 to 54.9% in the third quarter of 2014. More importantly, non-GAAP operating margin grew from 21.3% to 25% in the same period. As a result, we achieved record non-GAAP EPS of $0.46 per share.  Now let’s talk about a few business highlights. In cloud computing, our [QS Mod] digital solutions have been very well received. This product family, introduced earlier this year, has won many design wins with major customers. We have already started shipping core power for Grantley service.  In automotive, MPS’s high voltage and high performance solutions are being designed into a broad range of applications, including the USB hub power inverters, infotainment, climate control, interior lighting, ignition lock, and keyless entry. In the internet of things, MPS has grown in various home automation projects. Our tiny AC/DC products have won multiple sockets where only a few watts of power are required, for ZigBee, wifi, sensors, and similar applications. Our MPM modules are attractive to customers with space constrained applications and we have won several sockets in this market.  In sensors, our recent addition of Sensima Technologies is progressing very well. Multiple European motor driver customers are designing in these revolutionary motion control systems. We are very excited about the future of this technology.  Trying to the financials, our third quarter revenue of $78.3 million was above the midpoint of our guidance. Compared with the second quarter, revenue increased by $9.9 million, or 14.5%, primarily on growth in the consumer, storage, and industrial markets. Looking at our revenue by end market, consumer revenue grew approximately $7 million to $35.5 million, fueled primarily by high value consumer markets like gaming, battery management, and home appliances. Computing revenue also grew by $2 million, driven by higher storage revenues. Industrial revenue increased by $1.7 million to $13.8 million, with growth in automotive, general industrial, security, and smart meters. Revenue in the communications end market was down $800,000 due to lower Gateway revenues.  Moving on to gross margin, our third quarter non-GAAP gross margin expanded from 54.5% in the prior quarter to 54.9% due to improved product mix. On a GAAP basis, our Q2 and Q3 gross margin was 54.2%. In prior quarters, stock comp expense was the only difference between MPS’s GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin. Starting with the third quarter of 2014, amortization of acquisition-related IP intangibles will also be a reconciling item between GAAP and non-GAAP reporting. So the 40 basis point improvement in third quarter gross margin over second quarter was offset by the addition of 40 basis points of intangible amortization for GAAP purposes. Let’s review our non-GAAP operating expenses. Excluding stock compensation, acquisition-related transaction costs for Sensima, and income on an unfunded deferred comp plan, our non-GAAP third quarter 2014 operating expenses were $23.4 million, an increase of $1.6 million from the $21.8 million we spent in the second quarter, largely due to the addition of Sensima’s R&D spending as well as higher new product development costs. Moving on to our GAAP operating expenses, our GAAP operating expenses were $32 million in the third quarter, compared with $30.5 million in the second quarter. The difference between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for these quarters is stock compensation expense, transaction costs related to the Sensima acquisition, and income on an unfunded deferred compensation plan. Stock comp expense attributable to operating expenses was $8.6 million in the third quarter, compared with $8.2 million in the prior quarter, due to a higher charge for pay for performance stock plan and performance shares granted to Sensima employees post-acquisition.  We are required under the accounting rules to assess the probability of hitting the performance metrics under this plan on a quarterly basis and record catch up adjustments on future revenue projections. As we noted before, this has increased the quarter over quarter volatility of stock comp charges compared to the typical straight line approach associated with time based [grants].  In addition, we incurred approximately $107,000 of deal-related expenses in relation to the Sensima acquisition. Investment income related to an unfunded deferred compensation plan reduced GAAP operating expenses by $110,000. Switching to the bottom line, on a non-GAAP basis, our Q3 net income was $18.3 million, or $0.46 per fully diluted share. This result is computed with an estimated tax rate of 7.5%. Q3 2014 GAAP net income was $11.2 million, or $0.28 per fully diluted share. Now let’s look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents, and investments were $238.5 million at the end of the third quarter of 2014, below the $250.7 million at the end of the prior quarter. This reduction in cash was attributable primarily to the $11.6 million paid in July for the Sensima acquisition. We also spent $9.2 million under a stock buyback program to purchase 212,000 shares. We funded our first quarterly dividend of $5.8 million and purchased $2 million of capital equipment. In Q3, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $14 million. Cash proceeds from employee stock option exercises and employee stock plan purchases contributed $2.4 million.  Accounts receivable ended the third quarter at $24.3 million, compared to the $21.4 million at the end of the prior quarter and the $22 million at the end of the third quarter of 2013. Days of sales outstanding were down to 28 days in the second and third quarter of 2014 on 31 days in Q3 2013. Our internal inventories at the end of the third quarter were $41.6 million, essentially flat with the $41.2 million at the end of the prior quarter. Days of inventory decreased to 106 days at the end of Q3 from the 120 days at the end of Q2. Days of inventory in the distributed channel decreased from the prior quarter. I would now like to turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter of 2014. We entered the fourth quarter with strong bookings as well as the lowest days of inventory in the distribution channel that we have seen in the last two years. We continue to see strength in many markets. However, we have taken into consideration signals of weakening macro conditions from other analog companies and reflected that in our guidance for the fourth quarter. We are forecasting Q4 revenue in the range of $72 million to $76 million. We also expect the following: non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 53.6% to 54.6%; total stock based compensation expense of $8.5 million to $9.5 million, including approximately $300,000 that will be charged to cost of goods; litigation expenses of $200,000 to $400,000; non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense to be in the range of $22 million to $23 million (this estimate excludes stock compensation and litigation expenses); fully diluted shares to be in the range of 40 million to 40.5 million shares before share buyback.  In conclusion, MPS continues to execute according to the plan established three years ago. We are seeing positive early results and are optimistic about our future growth. I’ll now open the microphone for questions. 
Operator: [Operator instructions.] Our first question comes from the line of Steve Smigie from Raymond James. 
Steve Smigie - Raymond James: I was hoping you could talk a little bit about your segments here. In particular, you had a lot of strength in consumer. I think you mentioned gaming. Is that seasonal? And then as we look into next quarter, any color on how the segments might perform? 
Meera Rao: Some of the strength in consumer, like in gaming, is seasonal. There’s a definite seasonal pattern to it. But one of the things that we are excited is we have gotten into a bunch of new markets that we call high value markets, where they pay a premium for performance products. And those are markets like gaming, where we have battery management, we have lighting, and we have appliances. In all these markets, we have seen growth in the third quarter.  Q4, typically there is a seasonal decline from Q3 to Q4, and we do expect to see some seasonal softness in consumer and consumer-like markets. 
Steve Smigie - Raymond James : And one item you mentioned there, battery management, you guys talk about that a lot. Sorry if you’ve addressed this in previous calls, but can you go into a little bit more detail about what exactly you’re addressing with battery management.
Michael Hsing: Our battery solutions in battery management, these are mostly for [polar volts] and then electrical vehicles. So everything from either handheld, some industrial use, to tablets. We have very good solutions. Just two years ago, we released the product, and now we have meaningful revenue.
Steve Smigie - Raymond James : And on the gross margin, another nice improvement. I think it’s essentially flat sequentially, but down seasonal quarter. You’ve got a little bit of back end capacity, so is that what’s causing the flatness sequentially, just sort of maybe utilization? And if that’s the case, what utilization rate are we at on the test?
Meera Rao : It’s not exactly utilization. We just look at the mix, and essentially expect gross margin to be in the same range in Q4 as well. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg from Stiefel. 
Tore Svanberg - Stiefel: I was hoping you could talk a little bit about what you said about the distribution channel. You said it was at a two-year low. Would you care to quantify that?
Meera Rao : We’ve been managing our inventory in the channel very well over the last two years, and we’ve been able to hold it at the same level for over eight quarters, I would say. And in Q3, we had addressed some of the concerns that it could be double booking, etc., by shipping early and managing the [unintelligible] concern. And we were able to complete the quarter with lower days of inventory in the channel than we have seen in two years.
Tore Svanberg - Stiefel : And my second question is in relation to your computing business. It was up 19% sequentially. Is that a reflection of some of the design wins in Grantley? Or is this more seasonality and then the Grantley designs are yet to come?
Meera Rao :
. :
Michael Hsing : The Grantley just started, and there’s a lot more revenue behind it.
Tore Svanberg - Stiefel : Yeah, that’s what I was trying to get to. And then lastly, your communications business was up a lot in Q2. That’s probably why it took a breather in Q3. But can you talk a little bit about the dynamics there? Are we getting to a point now where some of your bigger design wins in networking could potentially start to become more meaningful production?
Meera Rao : What we saw in Q2 was some of the networking and telecom design wins that we’d been talking about in the past started ramping in Q2. And what we saw in Q3 was, while we still have good revenues coming from the networking and telecom, we saw a certain amount of softness, I would say, in more traditional Gateway business. These are things like the modems, the routers, the line cards that we sell mostly on the client side. And that’s where we saw a little bit of softness. But the networking and telecom we still saw good revenues this quarter.
Tore Svanberg - Stiefel : Given your conservatism, and also the way you’re managing your distribution channels, is it fair to say that your backlog percentage into your guidance is actually very high?
Meera Rao : I’d say that we’re very happy with it. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank : Just following on Tore’s question, on the Gateway business, that was a little bit weak, the traditional comms. Is that something that is just choppy, or is it something that you expect to be a persistent headwind?
Meera Rao : I think it was just choppy.
Michael Hsing : These are the businesses we have. These are the set-top boxes and wireless [unintelligible]. Those type of business, which we’re not really concentrated. What’s exciting about that is that it’s infrastructure. We made a significant headwind and we do expect revenues and world growth. But you know, these designing cycles take two to three years.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank : And I guess on a last follow up on the revenue side of things, when you talked about the conservatism that you put into your guidance from what everybody else is seeing, what are you guys seeing as far as the bookings on your side?
Michael Hsing : Our bookings, I will have Meera talk about booking. I would say our future is great. We’re executing, in the last two or three years, all the products that we released [unintelligible] to revenue.
Meera Rao : In terms of bookings, Ross, we’ve seen good bookings as we go through the quarter. We’re not seeing any signs of softness. But we are cognizant of the fact that if there is a slowdown, it’s going to impact us, and we just want to give a guidance that we’re comfortable that we’re going to be able to meet. As you know, we have a history of meeting our guidance, and so we just factored that in.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank : You guys have done a great job controlling opex. Can you just talk about how you think opex versus revenues could grow as we think a little bit longer term, into 2015, 2016, etc.? What sort of band should we put about the relationship in growth rates between the top line and opex? 
Meera Rao : I would say we will continue to hold expenses, but we will have pay raises that will go in the first of each year, which could be in the range of $500,000 to $600,000 impact. And then as we see growth coming in, we will do some investment in the future. We did a bit of that this year. So a lot of it is going to be tied with our growth as we go forward.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank : Those pay raises, that was on a quarterly basis, I assume?
Meera Rao : Yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rick Schafer from Oppenheimer. 
Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer: I guess my first question is talking about mix. You guys have doubled your industrial and comms business as a percentage of revenue over the past three years or so. I guess what’s the right mix longer term? And maybe part of that answer, if you could talk about your design win backlog, if you look at how it breaks out, what percent would be sort of comms and industrial, auto, that kind of stuff, versus your more legacy PC consumer stuff?
Meera Rao : Right now, we have growth drivers in every one of these segments. And even industrial, which typically is a segment where we’d have expected to see growth coming in slower, we are seeing very strong growth. And as you know, we don’t typically give guidance as to growth by segment, but I think when you see next year, assuming regular macro, you would see us growing in every one of these segments.
Michael Hsing : Let’s put it that way. It’s difficult to give you what the percentage of each market segment. What we really focus on, [unintelligible], our customer value, the performance from our products. And they pay a premium, and also, if the market is sustainable, we will growth that market segment.
Meera Rao : And the key is also we are focused on diversified revenue growth, so we are happy to see growth across multiple segments versus just one.
Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer : And I know you talked about premium customers on the consumer side. As those guys become a bigger piece of the mix, should we think of the consumer segments enjoying higher gross margin over time, a better mix over time, within just consumer?
Michael Hsing : Absolutely. We’re not going to a commodity.
Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer : And just a question on the power modules business. When does that begin to ramp in a meaningful way? Is it 2015? Or is this really something more out in 2016? And as part of that question, I’m assuming your consumer business would adopt and ramp the power mods first? Is that right? And then same kind of gross margin question. Is that a gross margin positive versus overall corporate average gross margin?
Michael Hsing :
. :
 :
Meera Rao : Right now, it’s just early revenues. So we have got fairly big design momentum here. So you’re going to see those revenues start ramping next year, and we’ll see very significant revenues in 2016.
Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer : In terms of putting a number on it, is this a 10% business unit sometime in the next two years?
Michael Hsing : If I think about 2016 MPS growth, in 2016 would be difficult, but it will be there in the next few years.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Anil Doradla from William Blair. 
Anil Doradla - William Blair: I’m trying to figure out how to ask this question. I know it’s kind of tough, but when I look at Monolithic Power, obviously it’s a product cycle story versus the rest of the industry. So let us say the macro does weaken further over the next couple of quarters. Now, given that you’ve got some very strong product cycles, even in macro-sensitive environments, could you share which are the end markets, or which of the four segments would you start seeing the effect of it on the overall revenue composition?
Meera Rao: As you guessed, that’s a hard one to answer, because in all these segments we have both a combination of new markets that we’re just getting in, newer customers where we are ramping up, as well as markets where we are taking market share from our peers. It would be very hard for us to call, because I don’t know how the macroeconomic conditions would impact different end markets. But I can say, just looking at the last few years history, that even if the macro gets weaker, we still expect to do better than our peers.
Anil Doradla - William Blair : And last quarter, I know BCB 3 and 4 were about 60% of revenues. How much was it this quarter?
Meera Rao : I think still in the 60s. A little bit above. I think it’s getting close to two thirds of revenue.
Anil Doradla - William Blair : And then finally, could you give us a little bit more color on the breakdown between TVs and some of the gaming devices?
Meera Rao : I would say right now if you look at things like set top boxes and TVs, they would be a smaller portion of consumer, and just these newer high value markets that we talked about, that would easily be a third or more of our consumer revenue. And then you have set top boxes, TVs, and a lot of different stuff that we call general purpose, that would make up the rest of the two thirds.
Anil Doradla - William Blair : And finally, if I can squeeze in, Michael, given the mixed signals that we’re getting in China, especially China 4G, you’ve got some exposure to some of the OEMs there. How does that play out for Monolithic Power, the volatility on the 4G buildouts in China?
Michael Hsing : The telecom business essentially, for MPS, is at the beginning. As long as our customer is expanding then opportunity for MPS is enormous, regardless whether one region is shrinking or expanding. 
Anil Doradla - William Blair : So effectively you’re not too worried about the volatility in the Chinese 4G, that’s what I’m hearing?
Michael Hsing : No.
Meera Rao : That’s the beauty of a diversified model.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Wong of Wells Fargo.
David Wong - Wells Fargo : You commented about inventory levels in the channel being so particularly low. So is there a need, actually, for inventories to be rebuilt in the near future, or do you anticipate they’ll continue going down from the current levels?
Meera Rao : No, we don’t anticipate that they’ll go down. They’ll be at the same levels or maybe at more traditional levels that we’ve had. So we kind of look at this inventory level that we had in Q3 as a sign of how well we have managed to execute in managing channel inventory. And it also gives us confidence as we look at our Q4 forecast.
David Wong - Wells Fargo : And the other thing is, on the matter of pricing, with all your new product cycles, are you seeing pricing going up at all in any segments?
Michael Hsing : The new products that we’ve released all have a premium price. And for the competitive landscape, I won’t put my fingers on the elephant and describe what kind of elephant it is. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie from Raymond James.  
Steve Smigie - Raymond James : I was hoping you could talk a little bit about gross margin across your end markets. And I guess within consumer, if you could differentiate the low end stuff versus the high end?
Meera Rao : Sure, as you know, industrials is our best gross margin. And within the different segments, you take communications, our networking and telecom has a better gross margin profile compared to the traditional Gateways. If you look at consumer, the newer markets that we call our high-value markets, they clearly have a better than average gross margin profile compared to the rest of our traditional consumer. And then when you look at computing, SSD is better than HDD, and the cloud computing margins are very good.
Michael Hsing : All the new products and product families, they all have a higher margin profile. And in this conference call, we never mentioned AC/DC, and that product line had a phenomenal growth this year and next year.
Steve Smigie - Raymond James :
 : 
Meera Rao : No, I wouldn’t say it’s quite half of industrial, but it is growing. We anticipate that at some point in the future, when it’s large enough on its own, that we will break it out of industrial. But I think at least for the near term, we will continue to include it with industrial.
Steve Smigie - Raymond James : If you could talk a little bit about LED lighting and the growth prospects of that over the next 12 to 24 months. It seems like we’re kind of at an inflection point for that. I know you’ve kind of got portions where you’re better than others, but I was just curious if you could talk about that overall opportunity there.
Meera Rao : We’re seeing a lot of growth in LED lighting, particularly the incandescent bulb replacement. We believe we have a product that has a superior dimming solution, in particular, so we’re seeing a lot of sales from that, and strong growth every quarter. Our longer term view in this market is we’re interested in industrial and commercial LED lighting more than consumer. But right now, when it’s still got an attractive gross margin profile, we’re happy to play in consumer as well.
Michael Hsing : That’s well said, and industrial and commercial is our focus, but we’re opportunistic and will take whatever the revenue is with the higher gross margin.
Operator: Thank you. And that concludes our question and answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back to Meera Rao for any closing comments.
Meera Rao : Thank you for joining us for this conference call, and we look forward to talking to you in February.

===== 2014 Q2  (2014-07-24 17:00:00) =====

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Monolithic Power Systems Incorprated Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we’ll conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today’s conference Meera Rao, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead. 
Meera Rao:  Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to the Second Quarter 2014 Monolithic Power Systems Conference Call. Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS is with me on today’s call. In the course of today’s conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management’s current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q2 earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on March 5, 2014 and our Form 10-Q filed May 1, 2014, which is accessible through our Web site www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today’s call. We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, operating income, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the Q1 and Q2 2013 releases, the Q1 and Q2 2014 releases, as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our Web site. I’d also like to remind you that today’s conference call is being webcast live over the Internet and will be available for replay on our Web site for one year along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. MPS again delivered record breaking quarterly revenues. And more importantly MPS achieved greater than 50% year-over-year growth in both non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP EPS. Revenue grew 18.6% compared with the same quarter of 2013 to $68.4 million. This increase which is well above the industry average was fueled by organic growth in revenue from our industrial and newer consumer markets. Non-GAAP gross margin expanded by 70 basis points to 54.5% in Q4 2014 from 53.8% in Q2 2013. We continue to grow the business while holding expenses relatively flat by leveraging the infrastructure investment made over the last few years. This has resulted in a significant 54% year-over-year growth in both non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP EPS. The strong organic revenue growth is attributable to our efforts initiated four years ago when we set our goals to diversify our products. To further enhance our growth strategy, we have acquired Sensima Technology SA, a Swiss company. Sensima is a developer of magnetic sensor technologies for angle measurements as well as three-dimensional magnetic field sensing. Sensima’s patented magnetic angle sensors are used in rotary encoders, electronically commutated motors and a broad range of products. Combining Sensima’s real time precision magnetic angle sensing with MPS’s technologies could offer revolutionized solutions for key industries such as automotive, industrial and cloud computing. We believe Sensima’s unique technology will enhance our diversification strategy and create new opportunities with key customers.  Turning to the deal terms; MPS has acquired all of the outstanding shares of Sensima. The purchase price includes an initial cash payment of $11.7 million, and a subsequent cash earnout payment of up to $8.9 million, which will be based upon Sensima achieving certain performance goals in 2015. Sensima is a free revenue company. We expect this acquisition to be accretive in the second half of 2015. The initial cash payment was paid with offshore cash and any future earnout will also be paid with offshore cash. Now a quick a review of other recent business activities, in the past MPS’s demand creation and sales efforts was driven mainly by our internal sales force. Now we are accelerating these designing activities through the addition of two key distribution partners. We have added Future and Avnet Memec for coverage in North America and Europe. These partnerships will multiply the number of sales and field application engineers focused on selling and promoting MPS products. At the same time, we have been seeing significant design win momentum, new product ramps and market share gains in battery management, cloud computing, and industrial applications. Turning to the financials, our second quarter revenue of $68.4 million was well above the midpoint of our guidance, compared with the first quarter of 2014 revenue increased by $8.4 million or 13.9% primarily due to growth in the communications, industrials, and consumer market. Looking at our revenue by end market, communications revenue grew approximately $3.4 million over the prior quarter to $17 million, fueled by the ramp of networking and telecom design wins as well as our gateway business. Revenue from consumer market increased $2.4 million to $28.5 million on higher TV and gaming demand. Industrial revenue also grew approximately $2.3 million to $12.1 million over the prior quarter, fueled by smart meter and other industrial applications. We are pleased to report that industrial revenues now 17.7% of revenue. Computing revenue increased slightly from $10.6 million to $10.8 million. Moving onto gross margin, our second quarter non-GAAP gross margin was 54.5% compared to 53.8% in the prior quarter. Higher manufacturing overhead absorption contributed 20 basis points of growth. The remaining 50 basis point improvement was attributable to the impact of a special non-executive employee bonus expense in the first quarter of 2014. That was not repeated in Q2. On a GAAP basis our Q2 gross margin was 54.2% compared to 53.4% in the prior quarter. The only difference between the GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin is stock comp expense and the special non-executive employee bonus. Let’s review our non-GAAP operating expenses. Excluding stock compensation and transaction costs related to the Sensima acquisition. Our non-GAAP operating expenses for the second quarter of 2014 were $21.8 million, an increase of $6.2 million from the $15.6 million we spent in the prior quarter. This increase was largely due to $9.5 million legal payment in our favor from O2 Micro recorded during the first quarter of 2014, as a benefit to litigation expenses. This pickup was partially offset by one-time charges in the first quarter of $500,000 for payments to the law firms that successfully represented as against O2 and special non-executive employee bonuses of $2.8 million. Moving onto our GAAP operating expenses; our GAAP operating expenses were $30.5 in the second quarter compared with $23 million in the first quarter. The only difference between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for these quarters is stock compensation expense and transaction costs related to the Sensima acquisition. Stock comp expense attributable to operating expenses increased to $8.2 million in the second quarter compared with $7.4 million in the prior quarter as a result of a higher charge for pay for performance stock plan implemented from 2012 to 2014. Accordingly, we are required under the accounting rules to assess the probability of hitting the performance metrics under the plans on a quarterly basis and record catch up adjustments reflecting our two-year revenue projections. As we noted before, this has increased the quarter-over-quarter volatility of stock comp charges compared to the typical straight line approach associated with time based grants. In addition, we incurred approximately $500,000 of legal and the accounting expenses in relation to the Sensima acquisition. Switching to the bottom line, on a non-GAAP basis our Q2 net income was $14.6 million or $0.37 per fully diluted share. This result is computed with an estimated tax rate of 7.5%. Q2 2014 GAAP net income was $6.4 million or $0.16 per fully diluted share. Now let’s look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $250.7 million at the end of the second quarter of 2014, above the $238.5 million at the end of the prior quarter, as well as a $201.3 million at the end of the second quarter of 2013. In Q2 MPS generated operating cash flow of about $22.9 million. Cash proceeds from employee stock option exercises, contributed another $3.5 million. MPS enhanced the $100 million stock buyback program effective August 2013. Under this program we bought back approximately 322,000 shares for a total of $12.4 million in the second quarter of 2014. We also spent $1.7 million on capital equipment. As a reminder, MPS initiated a dividend program in the second quarter of 2014. The $0.15 per share dividend declared and accrued in Q2 was paid on July 15th to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 30, 2014. Accounts receivable ended the second quarter at $21.4 million down from the $22.1 million at the end of the prior quarter and up from the $20.3 million at the end of the second quarter 2013. Days of sales outstanding were down to 28 days in Q1, from 33 days in Q1, 2014 and 32 days in Q2, 2013. Our internal inventories at the end of the second quarter were $41.2 million, compared with the $39.8 million at the end of the prior quarter. Days of inventory decreased from 130 days at the end of Q1 to 120 days at the end of Q2. Inventory in distributor channel decreased in both dollars and days from the prior quarter.  I would not like to turn to our outlook for the third quarter of 2014. We expect yet another quarter with record revenues. We are forecasting Q3 revenues in the range of $76 million to $80 million. At the midpoint of the guidance we’re projecting approximately 14% growth from the prior quarter. We also expect the following: non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 54.4% to 55.4%, GAAP gross margin in the range of 54.1% to 55.1%. Total stock based compensation expense of $7.7 million to $8.3 million including approximately $200,000 that would be charged to cost of goods. Litigation expenses of $200,000 to $400,000. Non-GAAP, R&D and SG&A expense to be in the range of $22.5 million to $23.5 million. This estimate excludes stock compensation and litigation expenses. Fully diluted shares to be in the range of 39.5 million to 40.1 million shares before share buyback. This Q3 outlook validates our overall business model discussed in prior calls as a mid-point of guidance will produce 25% non-GAAP operating margin. In conclusion, as we continue to execute on our growth strategy formulated four years ago, we are delighted to see these early results. I will now open the microphone for questions.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Your line is open.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel:  So my first question is on communications and industrial. It had a very strong quarter in Q2. And just wondering if that’s what’s going to continue to drive growth in Q3?
Michael Hsing:  I think it is difficult to comment on quarter-by-quarter, but the overall trend is increase because in the past two or three years we have focused on that segment and we generate a lot of design wins. And these design wins turns into revenues and we see a very steady increase in the next few quarters, and in near future. So the next quarter will probably follow the similar trend, but it is not exactly a number but overall direction is same.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel: And on gross margin, you’ve had very nice steady increase now for a while. And as we look forward, I am just wondering if we should expect that similar improvement? And I assume that it’s primarily mix driven or is there anything else going on there?
Meera Rao:  We’ve been saying for a while that our gross margin improvement is going to improve slowly and steadily and that’s exactly what’s spanning out. So we have in the latest quarter Q2, we also had because of the big increase in revenue; we also had a pickup from a better absorption of our test manufacturing capacity that we have, the overhead costs. Our mix also continues to improve as the new products come out.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel: Just one last question if I may. Could you update us a little bit on your Monolithic Power Module business? I know that’s revenue primarily is slated for later. But just hoping you could give us an update on reception so far, when you expect more meaningful revenue and so on? Thank you.
Michael Hsing: We introduced, as you know we have we have a matrix of product, in the last quarter we introduced few more. And as the release of these products are kind of difficult, we had to go through a full qualification; every one of them had made a deal about 2,000 hours, so we gradually complete that metrics. In terms of our market, reception is extremely well. Our customers and some customers adopted our module very quickly, and some industrial automotive for traditional markets and they follow the similar trend as they do with other business, which takes about 24 months to 36 months to generate any revenues. But we see a lot of designing activities and there are no surprises.
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie with Raymond James. And your line is open.
Vincent Celentano - Raymond James:  This is Vincent Celentano speaking for Steve. I was wondering within your memory and storage business. I was wondering PMIC is looking really strong lately. Do you see this trend continuing and do you believe share growth is part of that?
Meera Rao:  SSD PMIC continues to do well. We expect to see growth in next quarter as some design wins ramp up next quarter, I mean in Q3.
Vincent Celentano - Raymond James: And then within the LED driver market. I was wondering what’s your shares of that and what you see as the growth drivers?
Meera Rao: In the LED lighting market, this is a market that long-term our interest is industrial and the commercial applications. We are playing in the consumer market right now because it’s a good market and it’s very profitable for us. We’re only playing in key segments of this market and not across the board like some of our peers.
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Rick Schafer with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer: I had a quick question first I think on the Sensima acquisition. I know you talked about being accretive. I think you said on the second half of 2015. When do you guys expect to see first revs from that business? And in the meantime can you quantify the dilution or is it a noticeable impact?
Michael Hsing:  I can answer the first part of the question. It’s a small revenue. The key is that we acquire technology, it’s a proven technology and customer accepted it. And so whether you generate $1,000 and $100,000 of revenue, that’s not really important. We see this technology is true revolutionized the motion control. You have mono drivers, you have robots, you have industrials machineries and automotives. And this is really something nobody else has seen it before. And we are glad to find this company and we can beat all. The founders like MPS, and they turn down all the other offers and they join us.
Meera Rao:  And the second part of your question Rick. We expect this deal to be accretive by the second half of 2015. 
Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer:  And then my next question is on mix. Obviously it continues to improve as comps and auto and industrial continue to ramp as a percent. What’s the right split for your guys long-term between your sort of four main buckets? And I am just curious what gross margins are going to look like once we’ve sort of hit that optimum mix?
Meera Rao: For us the three target markets are computing, communications and industrial, and we’d like to grow those markets as much as we can. We don’t have any internal number that we’ve shared. And our idea is that as we go out in time, when it comes to gross margin there are no headwinds and basically we expect to show a slow and steady increase in gross margin.
Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer: And then just I am kind of curious on TV. Can you update us on what your TV exposure is now and maybe elaborate a little bit on the content increase story there?
Meera Rao : Sure. It’s roughly about 10% of our business from TV. And I think we talked about this a couple of quarters ago saying that we’ve got more design wins now in TV and this particularly as you see some of the smarter TVs and some of the power requirements are going up. We’re seeing higher revenues here.
Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer: But can you quantify? I mean is your average content increasing, I don’t know 5% or 10% year-over-year or any kind of number you could put that there?
Michael Hsing: We just focused on that, on the market segment really opportunistic, and some of the newer TVs are smart TV with processor-based TV that requires higher power. And we have product and we have a very cost competitive product and we just take -- in the past we took this bucket. And we have continued to do well in those high current sockets. And because our competitor couldn’t even match what we do. So in terms of a real percentage of what the growth is I put a very little focus on it. And maybe Meera can tell you what is our growth pattern it.
Meera Rao: I think overall what we’ve got is we’ve got more design wins, so you’ve seen the increase in revenue. I would attribute it more to design win increase rather than a dollar content increase.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Anil Doradla with William Blair. Your line is open.
Anil Doradla - William Blair: Michael and Meera I have a kind of big picture question. Obviously consumer business continues to do well. You’ve had some benefits from some of the gaming products. But when I look at Monolithic Power one of the key transition stories was to step away slowly from the consumer business and diversify to more longer product cycles infrastructure oriented. Last couple of quarters consumers have been good, last quarter has been good. So how should I be looking at it? Are going to continue working with consumer? But your hurdle rates are going to be based on some higher gross margins? Or I mean can you lay out what the big picture strategy is going forward? And I have a follow up.
Meera Rao: Sure, our overall strategy is to go into more and more markets where they’ll pay as a premium for our products. And if you notice some of the newer consumer markets where we have been seeing higher revenues come in the last few quarters. There have been markets that require higher performance, calling for a thinner competitive landscape. And these are markets like gaming, battery management. These are the markets where we’re particularly seeing our revenues increased. So while those happen to be in the consumer marketplace, it still plays into our overall strategy of focusing on performance and where we get a premium for our performance. And as you will see out in time, you’re going to see revenue from computing, from communications, from industrial continue to go up. I don’t know if you noticed, but our industrial revenue is about 17% of our revenue. And just about two or three years ago, it was about 6% to 8% of our revenue. So I think we’re focusing on differentiated products that make a difference to us both from a top line gross margin and bottom line.
Anil Doradla - William Blair: And on Sensima Technology, I mean why did you acquire this? Because I am trying to understand the connection between the Sensima Technology and a power management company. What were the synergies and can you give a little bit more color on that?
Michael Hsing: Yes, I’ll give you a longer version answer. Let’s start it, that’s motion control, all the motion controls are consistent with motors in them. And traditionally all the motors -- for the last century all the motors in building a similar technology in the last 10 years to 15 years and require higher performance motors that are using a microcontroller. So in order to deliver the power accurate and reduced noise and vibration of the motor, these are considered high performance and much costly. In Sensima Technology we can deliver higher performance motors. By using the Sensima Technology the motors performance will increase greatly and considered even better than any motor drivers in the market now with the microprocessors. So this is a very low cost solution. We can revolutionize the entire motor drivers. So you offered using this solution in lower performance motor can be even better performance than existing high performance motors. So that’s the reason, one of the reason we acquired them.
Anil Doradla - William Blair: And finally BCD3, can you give us a sense what was the contribution and how did that grow during the quarter? 
Meera Rao: BCD3 and 4, the revenues continued to be about 50%.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Lena Zhang with Baylock. Your line is open.
Lena Zhang - Baylock:  So the Company has done real good job on the diversification in the end market, and I believe will continue. How has that impacted your sales in different ranges and how well that impacts as well?
Meera Rao: Essentially, we have done a lot of sales using our existing sales force. And if you noticed in the last few months we’ve announced at least two distributors who will increase the number of boots on the ground, and we believe will lead to future growth and revenue as well. And as you pointed out, we have a broad breadth of products and this just takes the revenue to the next level.
Lena Zhang - Baylock: But in another words, so how should I expect which region will grow faster than others?
Meera Rao:  That’s hard to tell, but irrespective way the demand is created almost all the manufacturing ends up in Asia. And if you notice the numbers we report on the sell through region, and so you are going to see Asia revenues grow anyway. But that does not necessarily mean that the demand was created in that region. So it’s kind of hard to answer the question.
Michael Hsing: To answer your question in the industrial market, automotive market takes 2 years to 3 years. So you add more people, the result will be better two years to three years later. It doesn’t change the pattern but change the numbers.
Lena Zhang - Baylock: And in terms of the acquisition of Sensima and is your Q3 guidance -- does your Q3 guidance include OpEx from that, because of the acquisition?
Meera Rao: Yes, we included about, I think just a little under $500,000 in Q3 for the operating expenses of Sensima.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Our next question comes from the line of Mike Lucarelli with Evercore. Your line is open.
Mike Lucarelli - Evercore:  If I look at guidance for 3Q, how does that breakdown by end market. Maybe like I was thinking about which one should go faster or slower than the midpoint of your guidance?
Meera Rao: As I’ve said before when we look at the granularity of the forecast data, it’s not at the same granularity as we get when with actual data. So I can’t comment segment-by-segment, but I can talk about a few drivers that I see that are going to be doing very well for us, SSD for once, we’re going to see growth over there. I expect to see that gaming is going to do well; we’re going to expect to see growth in battery management or in LED lighting. In TV we will continue to see progress over there. I think industrial particularly automotive most probably is going to be a growth for us if you are comparing Q2 to Q3.
Mike Lucarelli - Evercore: What about the design wins you had in server and PC? How is that shaping up?
Meera Rao: In servers we’ll be shipping this quarter and next quarter for revenue. In terms of -- in computing on the notebook side. I think the market is shifting from [shock bay] over to [crescent bay] and we are positioned to do as well if not better in the [crescent bay] than [shock bay].
Michael Hsing: The consumers market we expect to do well in the next two to three quarters or even beyond. So you will see some significant changes in the next couple of quarters.
Mike Lucarelli - Evercore: And then I guess back into the storage PC bucket. That was only one that was down year-on-year. What are the moving pieces within there, is that ACGs falling off a little bit?
Meera Rao: No, it was actually one of the SSD design wins ramp down. But the successor design win ramps up fairly strongly for us next quarter. So it ended up being flat this quarter. I mean computing was flat but SSD within was a little down. But we are going to see that portion go up again in Q3.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Amit Chawla with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Amit Chawla - Wells Fargo: I just had a quick follow up question. I guess what percent of your industrial revenue at the moment stems from automotive solutions? And I guess what percentage of your industrial mix do you expect automotive to be exiting calendar year ‘14?
Meera Rao: I would say industrial is an area where as I have said before there are multiple markets that make up that portion. Automotive is one of the market that is growing for us. I don’t think we have disclosed in the past what portion of industrial is from automotive.
Michael Hsing: But automotive will be a very significant number, so from this year and going out of this year in to next year. So we may develop that divide it up sometime.
Meera Rao: In the future.
Michael Hsing: Yes.
Amit Chawla - Wells Fargo: And the one final question. I guess as you rollout your broad module product portfolio this year. My understanding is these modules require a higher level of integration. So I guess my question is will this higher level of integration require you to step up spending on capital equipment that’s unique to these modules?
Meera Rao: No, in fact we’ve already released many of these modules. We have few others that are being sampled to customer and the rest of them are in various stages of QA. So we don’t need any equipment from an R&D standpoint.
Operator: I am not showing any further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Meera Rao for closing remarks.
Meera Rao: I want to thank you all for joining us for this call and wish you a very happy day. Thank you. Bye-bye.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today’s conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a good day.

===== 2014 Q1  (2014-04-24 00:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Monolithic Power Systems Incorporated First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Meera Rao, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead. 
Meera Rao: Thanks, Kate. Good afternoon, and welcome to the First Quarter 2014 Monolithic Power Systems Conference Call. Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS, is with me on today's call. 
 In the course of today’s conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risks and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management’s current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor statements contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q1 earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on March 10, 2014, which is accessible through our website, www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today’s call.
 We will be discussing gross margins, operating expense, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the Q1 2013, Q4 2013 and Q1 2014 releases, as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our website. I’d also like to remind you that today’s conference call is being webcast live over the internet and will be available for replay on our website for 1 year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. 
 MPS is pleased to announce record first quarter revenue of $60.1 million, representing a 16.7% increase from the first quarter of 2013. This year-over-year increase, which was well above the industry average, was fueled by diversified growth in revenues from a newer, high-value consumer and industrial markets. Over the last several quarters, MPS has released many groundbreaking products in several new markets. MPS continues to build on the innovative foundation of these products by expanding its portfolio.
 I would like to discuss some of these product family expansions with you. In our AC/DC portfolio, we introduced the industry's first Monolithic 900 volt flyback regulator designed specifically for industrial power grid applications supporting wireless communication. This product saves our customers from having to include a high-voltage blockage device, and, due to its high integration, allows for improved ease-of-use, high reliability and the lowest overall solution cost.
 MPS is also expanding its LED lighting portfolio with a third-generation LED driver that includes power faction -- power factor correction with dimming capability that has been even further enhanced from our previous industry-leading generation. We have multiple design wins for this third-generation LED driver and expect revenue to ramp in the second half of the year.
 Since we introduced our first products in the battery management family a few quarters ago, we have achieved significant success in the market. We have continued to expand this product family with the release of an even higher current charger, which integrates both booster kits and smart power distribution. As a result, our new charger delivers the best efficiency performance in the market, which equates to faster time to charge for users. MPS continues to leverage its technical advantage to gain market share.
 Finally, MPS continues to build its portfolio of system-on-a-chip MPM modules by introducing a new mid voltage family of products. The mid voltage family works from 4.5 to 24 volts and can handle output currents up to 20 amps. Based on our industry-leading Monolithic BCD process technologies and a patented packaging technology, our MPM modules have achieved the smallest footprint on the market today. We continue to see widespread acceptance of the MPM module in the industrial storage and high-performance consumer markets.
 Turning to the financials. Our first quarter revenue of $60.1 million was at the midpoint of our guidance. Compared with Q4 2013, revenue decreased by $3.5 million or 5% -- 5.5% primarily on seasonally lower consumer expense -- or consumer revenue, sorry. Looking at our revenue by end market. Industrial revenue grew approximately $900,000 to $9.8 million over the prior quarter, primarily fueled by automotive and smart meter applications. Revenue in the communications market also grew in the first quarter by $745,000 to $13.6 million. Computing revenue declined by $2 million to $10.6 million, reflecting an expected ramp down of an older HDD design win, as well as the seasonal decline in notebooks, partially offset by SSD revenue growth. Revenue from consumer markets declined $3.1 million in the first quarter to $26.1 million, largely due to seasonal declines in newer consumer markets like gaming, as well as in traditional consumer markets like TVs. 
 Let's review our non-GAAP operating expenses. Excluding stock compensation, our non-GAAP operating expenses for the first quarter of 2014 were $15.6 million, a decrease of $5.2 million from the $20.8 million we spent in the fourth quarter, and also down $6 million from the midpoint of our guidance. This decrease was largely due to a $9.5 million legal settlement in our favor from O2Micro. The settlement was recorded during the first quarter of 2014 as a benefit to litigation expenses. This pickup was partially offset by onetime charges of $100,000 for payments to the law firm that successfully represented us against O2Micro and special nonexecutive employee bonuses of $2.8 million.
 Moving on to our GAAP operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $23 million in the first quarter compared with $26.3 million in the fourth quarter. Since the only difference between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expense for these quarters is stock compensation expense, let's look at stock comp. Stock comp expense attributable to operating expenses was $7.4 million in the first quarter compared with $5.5 million in the prior quarter as a result of a higher charge for pay-for-performance stock plans implemented from 2012 through 2014. Accordingly, we are required under the accounting rules to assess the probability of hitting the performance metrics under the plan on a quarterly basis. As we noted before, this has increased a quarter-over-quarter volatility of stock comp charges compared to the typical straight-line approach associated with time-based grants. 
 Moving on to gross margin. Our first quarter GAAP gross margin was 53.4% for the first quarter compared to 54% in the prior quarter. This decrease is primarily attributable to the impact of a special nonexecutive employee bonus of approximately $300,000 in the first quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, our Q1 gross margin was 53.8% compared to 54.2% in the prior quarter. The only difference between the GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin is stock comp expense.
 Switching to the bottom line. On a non-GAAP basis, our Q1 net income was $15.6 million or $0.39 per fully diluted share. This result is computed with an estimated tax rate of 7.5%. Q1 2014 GAAP net income was $9 million or $0.23 per fully diluted share. 
 Now let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $238.5 million at the end of the first quarter of 2014, above the $236.2 million at the end of the prior quarter, as well as the $186.8 million at the end of the first quarter of 2013. In Q1, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $10.9 million. Cash proceeds from employee stock option exercises and employee stock plan purchases contributed another $6.6 million. MPS announced a $100 million buyback program effective August 2013. Under this program, we bought back approximately 324,000 shares for a total of $11.4 million in the first quarter of 2014. We also spent $3.9 million on capital equipment. Accounts receivable ended the first quarter at $22.1 million, down from the $23.7 million at the end of the prior quarter and $22.7 million at the end of the first quarter 2013. Days of sales outstanding were down to 33 days in Q1 from 34 days in Q4 2013, and 40 days in Q1 2013. Our internal inventories at the end of the year were $39.8 million, relatively flat with a $39.7 million at the end of the prior quarter. Days of inventory increased from 124 days at the end of Q4 to 130 days at the end of Q1. Inventory in the distributor channel increased by approximately $800,000 over the prior quarter.
 I would now like to turn to our outlook for the second quarter of 2014. We expect second quarter revenue to be in the range of $65 million to $69 million. At the midpoint of the guidance, we are projecting approximately a 16% year-over-year increase and about 11.5% growth from the prior quarter. We also expect the following: GAAP gross margin in the range of 53.7% to 54.7%; non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 54% to 55%; total stock-based compensation expense of $7.5 million to $8.1 million, including approximately $200,000 that would be charged to cost of goods; litigation expenses of $200,000 to $400,000; non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense to be in the range of $20.5 million to $22.5 million, this estimate excludes stock compensation and litigation expenses; fully diluted shares to be in the range of 39.5 million to 39.9 million shares before share buyback. 
 In conclusion, MPS had an outstanding quarter, hitting record first quarter revenues while continuing to deliver solutions that exceed industry standards. We are delivering on our promise to broaden our product portfolio and grow revenues above the industry average with sustainable long-term growth.
 I'll now open the microphone for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg with Stifel. 
Tore Svanberg: My first question is on your outlook for the second quarter. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about your visibility either by backlog or current bookings? 
Meera Rao: Sure. We've had very good bookings so far, and I think we're kind of seeing an environment that is better than what we saw a quarter ago. And that's what's drives the guidance that we have now given for the second quarter. 
Tore Svanberg: Very good. And you mentioned your HDD business was down in Q1. Are we at a point now where SSD revenue is higher than HDD revenue? 
Meera Rao: Yes. It's -- more than half of our revenue is now coming in from SSD, and SSD continues to be a segment that's growing for us. 
Michael R. Hsing: Doesn't mean that HDD continue to go down. As the newer model ramping up, we expect the revenue start to pick up again. 
Meera Rao: Yes. So one design win that has started decreasing in the second quarter of last year has now bottomed out. 
Tore Svanberg: Okay, very good. And on your consumer revenue, I know last year you actually grew it in dollar terms, but I know it became smaller percentage. But if we look at how things are progressing so far this year, could consumer still grow in dollar terms or expecting it to be more flatted out? 
Meera Rao: We expect consumer revenues to also grow this year in dollars. 
Tore Svanberg: Okay, very good. Last question for me. Your gross margin guidance for Q2, does that assume just a natural improvement in mix or is there anything else behind that? 
Meera Rao: It contemplates a slow and steady improvement in our gross margins as we've always talked about in the past, and I think that's what you're seeing in the second quarter as our revenue mix gets richer. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie with Raymond James. 
Vincent Celentano: This is Vince Celentano speaking for Steve Smigie. My first question was, with the recent price cuts in LED bulbs, I was wondering if you knew going forward when it would translate into a pickup in sales? 
Michael R. Hsing: The second -- as Meera said in the script, the second half of the year, our third generation of our LED will gain sales revenue. 
Vincent Celentano: Okay, great. And with the Broadwell delay, I was wondering if you see that impacting your 2015 outlook? 
Michael R. Hsing: Will you say that again? The first part, I can't hear. 
Vincent Celentano: I'm sorry, I said with the Broadwell delay. I was wondering if you see that impacting your 2015 numbers? 
Michael R. Hsing: Broadwalk? 
Meera Rao: Broadwell. 
Michael R. Hsing: Oh, Broadwell. 
Meera Rao: On the Intel. 
Michael R. Hsing: Oh, that. Oh, you switched topics, okay. Yes, these models, it was 2015 starting to see -- not in 2015 revenues. So we're not going to go beyond that. I don't -- I'm not very familiar with these names. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. 
Matt Diamond: This is actually Matt Diamond on for Ross. I'm curious if you could give us a breakdown on your second quarter guide of the end market which comms consumer, computing, industrial, what all of those should be expected to do directionally? 
Meera Rao: Sure. I'd like to kind of put it in context, as I have in the past, that we don't have as much visibility to break it down by the different end markets when we are looking at bookings and a forecast as we do when we have the end quarter POS or resales data. But directionally, I can tell you that I expect to see growth in consumer in the second quarter. I also think that we will see growth in computing, since I expect both storage and notebook revenue to increase in that quarter. And I expect the -- all the other markets also to do fairly well. 
Matt Diamond: Okay. And in somewhat of a different vein on your OpEx, it looks like if I back out the litigation benefit, it appears as though it came in a couple of million above the midpoint of guidance fee -- I'm sorry, coming in at above the top end of non-GAAP guidance. I'm curious if there's anything beyond stock comp that would explain that or what the dynamics there is at large? 
Michael R. Hsing: Well let me -- before Meera answers, here's a correction. Meera in the script has said the settlement. This is not a settlement. This is a verdict from the court. Okay, Meera, please answer the question. 
Meera Rao: Yes. So the $3.1 million that you're referring to is actually special bonuses that were given to employees in the first quarter. And I think that's the difference that you're picking up, and that's what I talked about in the commentary a little earlier. And I think out of that $3.1 million, $2.8 million of that was in OpEx and about $300,000 went into cost of goods and impacted gross margin. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rick Schafer with Oppenheimer Funds. 
Richard Schafer: First question, I guess, is, could you give us an idea, I guess, as mix improves and manufacturing costs are dropping, maybe walk us through your thought process on your longer-term gross margin targets. I mean, I guess, what I'm asking is what's actually going to keep gross margins below 60% longer term? 
Michael R. Hsing: Well, 60%, that's a big jump, Rick. Big jump. As we said in the long term, we're transitioning from -- we are broadening our market coverage and the gross margin world growth. And when -- how we're going to get 60%? I would say the possibility is there. And as we do the more annuity products and then we will get there. So -- but the questions is really -- really, the question is when will it get there? And as you know, this year, consumer business we're going to do really well, and they make very good bucket. Increase our -- keep increase our EPS and, I mean, these are money you can't walk away. And so we will see. I think in the next 5, 6 years, I think as a possibility it's very good. 
Meera Rao: Rick, I mean, our focus has always been on maximizing the operating income on a non-GAAP basis, right? So we also try at the same time to improve our top line while steadily expanding our gross margin. And as Michael said, there's absolutely no headwinds when it comes to gross margin, and you're going to see it improve. And as we get more revenue coming from some of our newer products, we also transition to a richer mix. And all that's going to help with our gross margin expansion as we go forward. 
Richard Schafer: And so maybe a second part of that question would be if you could give us some color on the percentage of your sales now that are BCD3 versus how much you're still on BCD2, and then maybe remind us sort of what that cost, relative cost savings was as you move from BCD2 to 3? 
Meera Rao: Sure. Our revenue from BCD3 and BCD4 is above 60% of our revenues in the first quarter. And the cost savings that we got, that came out of it, came both from having 20% to 50% die size reduction and the cost savings that came from it for the different products, as well as some of the packaging advances that we had made. Of course, some of that cost advantage gets narrower as we go forward as our competitors continue to drop prices. But it clearly allows us to still match a competitors' prices in the consumer market with a group of family of products and yet get a corporate gross margin that's in our model of 53% to 58%. 
Richard Schafer: And Meera, this is my very last question. But -- so would you say that on your consumer and PC businesses that the gross margins are actually improving there as well? Because of these cost reduction efforts, you're seeing a margin -- gross margin actually improve there? 
Meera Rao: I mean, we get picked up periodically as new products roll onto it. But some of the benefits have also come from some of the newer consumer markets we get into. And these newer markets have better gross margin profiles than traditional. 
Michael R. Hsing: Yes, the one we -- Meera just mentioned it, the very management -- and certainly it's much higher than a corporate average gross margins. And other consumer products we just recently introduced for the smart TVs. And those products are generally has a much higher gross margin compared on the existing one. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Anil Doradla with William Blair. 
Anil Doradla: Meera, you talked about a charger. I just wanted to clarify. Would some of the applications of these chargers be in the automotive industry for electric vehicle charging? Would that be an application? 
Michael R. Hsing: No. Our charging is, a lot of them is for consumers products and other one is the hand tools. 
Anil Doradla: Okay. So it's a little step away. And also, you talked about LED being a driver in second half of 2014. Can you give us a little bit more color on what you meant by that? 
Michael R. Hsing: Well we just introduced the third generation of our LED drivers in early this year or second half of last year, and it's well, well received. In the conference call, we should have bring that up to our shareholders and that will have some additional revenues in the second half of this year. 
Anil Doradla: Can you quantify it or that's difficult at this stage? 
Michael R. Hsing: It's -- as you know, the LED market is very fragmented, and a lot of customer competing with the same sockets. And some's going to win, some are going to lose, okay, but ended up it's okay in [indiscernible]. These sockets are either more into the consumer side. And so it's difficult for us to forecast from the design wins to revenues. 
Anil Doradla: Okay. And finally, I mean, in your last Analyst Day, you did talk about going from $2 billion TAM to $6 billion TAM as you entered into new markets? Is there an update on the Tam now, I mean, is it more than $6 billion that you're trying to address or can you give us an update on that front? 
Meera Rao: Since then, one of the newer markets that we entered into, that we have discussed publicly is the gaming market. And I don't think we have announced any newer markets since then. 
Michael R. Hsing: Yes I think -- but we don't look at the TAM or calculate the TAM every quarter. From the last year's Analyst Day, we announced that here is the TAM we're going to cover, so this is the opportunity and then since then, of course, we introduced a lot more product than we will have more TAM, but we don't have any particular numbers. 
Operator: Our next question is a follow-up question from the line of Tore Svanberg with Stifel. 
Tore Svanberg: As a follow-up on your Monolithic Power Module, I was hoping you could give us an update on recent trends and also on optimizing the structure for that product line? 
Meera Rao: Tore, could you please say that again? You're breaking up. 
Tore Svanberg: Yes. Sorry, I was hoping you could update us on design wins for Monolithic Power Module and also on the cost structure initiatives there? 
Michael R. Hsing: Yes. We have, of course, we have seen a lot more design wins from the last quarter to -- well from the 2 quarters ago to the last quarter's. And then Meera talked about in the script that we have a more industrial design wins, more in SSD, more in the consumer side, actually. And some wearable device, some these action cams, those kind of a thing. Cameras, they require very small devices, and they want to use a high-performance product. And so we have a lot of these design activities. And so the revenue -- we're translating the revenues and some are sooner than the other one, okay, and consumer being the fastest and the industrial is relatively slowest. Also, the automotive and we have several activity -- several design wins. These will be probably take us 3 years to generate any revenues. From the cost side, the cost is really not -- and at this time, it's not really our concern because we're selling values. And the gross margin is a much, much higher than the corporate average. And so it's a less concern. But we believe our -- the way we implement the module is the lowest cost in the market. We don't use the PCB. We don't use any multiple chips in there and everything is the same. We utilized integrated circuit packaging technology which we developed. And available in -- we implement it in the assembly and it can be mass-produced. So the reliability and the cost that we clearly will have an advantage now. 
Meera Rao: And, Tore, one of the things that is truly exciting about this module is the variety of markets into which it's being adopted into. We have design wins all the way from SSDs to appliances, to smart meters and to automotives, other industrial applications, servers, networking. So we have seen these products being kind of being adopted very widely. And the revenue, as Michael said, some of it consumer will be earlier to ramp and the others will take a little longer. But you're going to see us talk more about this and having this be a more significant part of our revenues, particularly in 2015 and 2016. 
Tore Svanberg: Very good. Last question, you're a relatively new entrant into the high-voltage markets. I was hoping you could just update us a little bit there and will you actually start to break out BCDHV-based revenue? 
Michael R. Hsing: The last portion was a break... 
Meera Rao: The BCDH. 
Michael R. Hsing: Oh, the BCDH, okay. Well I'm glad that you mentioned it. This is the fastest growth segment in our revenue stream. The high-voltage device, and we started about 4, 5 years ago, and the revenue grows and it grows phenomenally, and as in AC to DC side, and also as well the LED lighting. 
Meera Rao: And just add to that, our AC/DC products essentially sell across to more than one of our end markets. While a lot of it goes into industrial, we also have one of our AC/DC parts, the synchronous rectifier that's going in for gaming as we announced a few quarters ago. So we won't be able to break it out that way, but we will give some color as we go on through the rest of this year and next year. 
Michael R. Hsing: Well most of it -- a lot of them is -- these are power -- these are micro transmitters, [indiscernible] and the WiFis and network for connectivities. 
Operator: I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks. 
Meera Rao: I'd like to thank you all for joining us on this call today, and look forward to talking to you all again at the next earnings release. Thanks, and have a nice day. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a good day.

Executives: Meera Rao - Chief Financial Officer Michael Hsing - Founder and CEO
Analysts:  Patrick Wang - Evercore Tore Svanberg - Stifel Matt Diamond - Deutsche Bank Vernon Essi - Needham & Company Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer Amit Chanda - Wells Fargo  
Operator:  Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Monolithic Power Systems Incorporated Fourth Quarter Full Year 2013 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we’ll conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I’d like to introduce your host for today’s conference Meera Rao, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.
Meera Rao: Thank you, Kate. Good afternoon and welcome to the Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2013 Monolithic Power Systems Conference Call. Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS is with me on today’s call. In the course of today’s conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risks and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management’s current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor statements contained in the earnings release published today. Risk, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statement contained in the Q4 earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on March 5, 2013 and Form 10-Q filed on October 20, 2013, which are accessible through our website, www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today’s call. We will be discussing operating expense, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4 2012 and 2013 releases, as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our website. I’d also like to remind you that today’s conference call is being webcast live over the internet and will be available for replay on our website for one year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. We would like to start this call by reviewing our business highlights for 2013 followed by fourth quarter operating results and finally our expectations for the first quarter of 2014. We will then open up the call to your questions. Let’s start with the business highlights for the year. MPS is pleased to announce record annual revenue of $238.1 million. Full year revenue growth of 11.4% clearly outperformed the analog industry, which SIA estimates grew 2% over the prior year. This is our 10th year as a public company and during that period our revenue has grown organically at the compound annual growth rate of 19.6%. For 2013 all key financial metrics revenue, gross margins, non-GAAP EPS and in particular, non-GAAP operating income grew sharply over 2012. MPS’s gross margin expanded 80 basis points in 2013 to 53.7%. Our non-GAAP operating income for the full year rose $8.7 million to $44.6 million in 2013. Non-GAAP EPS grew to a $1.06 per share in 2013 from $0.93 per fully diluted share in 2012. In 2013 we again grew revenue in each of our targeted market segment industrial, computing and communications. Industrial was up 32%, storage and computing grew 16% and communications increased 10% compared with 2012. In addition consumer revenue was also up 4.3%, clearly we continued to execute according to our plan. Let me speak to the results of each end market. In industrial and automotive markets, sales grew to $34.2 million, fueled by product sales for applications in security, power adaptors and Smart Metters. We have also seen significant design win activities in automotive applications in USB, [rear] camera, lighting and the chassis. All these design win activities will continue translate into revenue growth in the second half of 2014 and in 2015. In cloud computing, where we focused on storage and servers, revenue grew to $47.9 million due to strong growth in storage. In three years we have been able to grow storage revenues to $32.5 million. We see tremendous new opportunities for growth in this market with the proprietary storage solutions. Revenue in the communications and telecom market grew 10% to $56.1 million, primarily reflecting market share gains. Revenue from consumer market is up $4.1 million in 2013 to $99.9 million. This growth was largely fueled by higher sales into newer markets such as LED lighting and gaming controls more than offsetting declines in our traditional consumer markets in particular TVs. Now let’s talk about some of the major achievements in 2013. After two years of development, we showcase our new DC to DC conversion technology which we called quantum state modulations QS Mod. QS Mod allows the users to quantify the power outsource and the time duration between firing each phase without using the traditional feedback move. Our solution has multiple benefit. First it greatly improved the overall system efficiency. Second it is much simpler requiring minimal design effort, also the output transient is significantly faster than our competitor. And finally all of this can be achieved through a simple software interface. This demonstrates clear advantages over traditional methods of pulse with modulations or PWM. The first product based on QS Mod technology is MP 2953, a six phase controller targeting ultra high current applications such as server, CPU core, DDR power and network systems. Coupled with our Intelli-Phase family of DriverMOS ICs, the MP 2953 delivers the best in class performance and efficiency and transient response. The built in current sense technique, with extremely high accuracy allows the CPUs to optimize power, deliver the best efficiency and eliminate the need to over design DC to DC converter. In fact, we have received overwhelmingly positive feedback from several major customers on our solution efficiency and simplicity with the programmable GUI or graphic user interface unlike the trial and error approach in labs today. We believe this technology will set a new standard for size, the power conversion efficiency in cloud computing and networking. Another exciting development is our innovative Monolithic Power Module or MPM. The MPM products integrate the entire system into one package which as expected has been well received by customers. Now customers can just drop in a module and move on to other challenges. In addition, these miniaturized modules based on BCD3 and BCD4 technologies have increased power densities which drive smaller size, increased efficiency, and lower solution cost. We already have multiple design wins for our power modules in industrial, storage and high end consumer markets. As we continue to expand the family of plug and play modules to address a variety of applications throughout the year, we expect to see steady revenue growth beginning in the second half of 2014. In the technology area, the BCD4 process technology is introduction and promises to be the growth driver for the future. Our point of load DC/CD products and many of our MPM products are all designed on the BCD4 process technology. We continue to push forward on a process technology with the next generation of development, BCD5. This would be an essential effort for our future servers, cloud computing, and module strategies. Finally, a few years ago we identified powering of connectivity for the internet of things to be one of the future growth engines for MPS. While tens of billions of devices gets connected to the internet, a new power solution is needed. The efficiency of standby power must be extremely high as these tens of billions of devices are connected to the grid at all time. In addition, a small form factor is essential due to small space constraint applications. For instance, a traditional power supply will not fit in a light switch, or in electric socket or junction box. In April 2012 earnings call, we presented the easy power family specifically targeting the internet of things applications. These products provide an extremely strong solution to deliver a few 100 megawatts to a few watt of DCDC power from offline AC source. Two years later, we have seen steady increase of demand from many applications such as investors control systems, building automation, thermostats, floor entry and air conditioning flow control. We believe the internet of things to grow rapidly in the next few years. And as an early mover, we’re well positioned for growth in this market. Switching to Q4, MPS had a record fourth quarter with revenue of $63.6 million, representing year-over-year revenue growth of 31.8%. Gross margin was 54% in the fourth quarter, the same as the third quarter and 100 basis points higher than the 53% reported in the fourth quarter from a year ago. Our non-GAAP operating income was $13.7 million compared to the $13.9 million reported in the prior quarter and significantly higher than the $8.3 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2012. Q4 GAAP net income was $12.6 million or $0.32 per fully diluted share compared with $0.33 per share in the previous quarter and $0.21 per share in the prior quarter. Let’s review our non-GAAP operating expenses. Excluding stock compensation, our non-GAAP operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2013 were $20.8 million, a reduction of $800,000 from the $21.6 million we spent in the third quarter. Moving on to our GAAP operating expenses, our GAAP operating expenses were $26.3 million in the fourth quarter, compared with $26.6 million in the third quarter. Since the only difference between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for this quarter is stock compensation expense, let’s look at the stock comp expense. Stock compensation expense was $5.6 million in the fourth quarter, compared with $5.2 million in the prior quarter. Switching to the bottom line, Q4 2013 GAAP net income was $7.5 million or $0.19 per fully diluted share. On a non-GAAP basis, our Q4 net income was $12.6 million or $0.32 per fully diluted share. This result is computed with an estimated tax rate of 7.5%. Now, let’s look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $236.2 million at the end of 2013, up from the $214.2 million reported at the end of the prior peak quarter. MPS generated operating cash flow of about $30.6 million in Q4. We also received a $9.5 million award from O2 Micro during the fourth quarter and cash proceeds from employee stock option exercises contributed another $5.2 million. MPS announced a $100 million stock buyback program effective August 2013. Under this program we bought back approximately 396,000 shares for a total of $13 million in the fourth quarter; we also spent $800,000 on capital equipment. Compared with the end of 2012, cash, cash equivalent and investments were up $63.8 million from the $172.4 million. During the year, MPS generated $63.2 million in operating cash flow and $40 million from stock option exercises and ESPP purchases by employees. We received a $9.5 million award from O2 Micro. We also spent $18.4 million on capital equipment during the year. Accounts receivable ended the year at $23.7 million compared with $22 million at the end of the prior quarter and $19.4 million at the end of 2012. Days of sales outstanding were up to 34 days in Q4 from 31 days in Q3 2013 and down from 37 days in Q4 2012. Our internal inventories at the end of the year were $39.7 million, lower than the $43 million at the end of the prior quarter. Days of inventory also decreased from 130 days at the end of Q3 to 124 days at the end of Q4. Days of inventory in our distributor channel stayed at the same level as the last five quarters. I would now like to turn to our outlook for the first quarter of 2014. We expect first quarter 2014 revenue to be in the range of $58 million to $62 million and 15.5% year-over-year increase at the midpoint of the guidance compared with 4.4% year-over-year first quarter growth projected for the analog industry by SIA. We also expect the following: Gross margin to be in the range of 53.5% to 54.5%; stock-based compensation expense to be in the range of $6.3 million to $7 million, the increase over the prior quarter is primarily due to the stock price based performing stock units granted in December 2013; litigation expense to be in the range of $200,000 to $400,000; non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense to be in the range of $20 million to $22.5 million. This estimate excludes the stock compensation and litigation expense estimates mentioned above. Fully diluted shares to be in the range of 39.5 million to 39.9 million shares before share buyback. In conclusion, MPS had an outstanding fourth quarter with 31.8% year-over-year revenue growth, much faster than the overall analog market. This was also MPS's best Q4 and best year yet in our history. We continue to deliver on our growth strategy articulated in the past as evidenced by revenue diversification and growth far exceeding the analog industry. We are confident in our future growth. I’ll now open the microphone for questions.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Patrick Wang with Evercore. Your line is open.
Patrick Wang - Evercore: Great. Thanks so much. Congrats on the record year. I want to talk about your guidance first. Your guidance is impressive. I guess in light of the overall industry, we are still seeing pretty good outperformance there historically also slowest in the fourth and first quarters. As we look ahead for the rest of the year, and I know you are not giving guidance there, but there seems to be a huge pipeline of product cycles and design wins. Can you give us a sense of maybe your visibility your confidence that you are going to be able to continue outgrowing the market at kind of 20% level that you have done in the past?
Meera Rao:  Clearly we are very confident that this is going to be a growth year for us and we will outperform the analog industry [handling] again. And the reason we feel confident is the pipeline of design wins that we have and the number of growth drivers that we have. So if you look at the areas of growth, we have cloud computing, networking and telecom, SSD, sharp blade, set-top boxes, TVs, gaming consoles, LED lighting, automotive, security and various other industrial applications. When we look at all this and the momentum that we have going forward, we feel confident that we will have growth this year.
Michael Hsing:  To summarize what Meera said, we don’t find any surprises. And as we go into Q1 of 2014 everything is still intact and everything is actually -- and many projects are better than we expected.
Patrick Wang - Evercore: Okay, got you. I wanted to talk a little bit about your [comps] end market; it was down about 14% sequentially last quarter. Can you talk about what happened there and perhaps what we should think about in the March quarter?
Meera Rao:  Sorry, which end market was that?
Patrick Wang - Evercore: Communications.
Meera Rao:  Our communications; communications was down in Q4 largely it’s a demand for our older gateway products that were lower in Q4. And I think that’s one of the areas where we saw some seasonal weakness back in Q4.
Patrick Wang - Evercore: Okay. But as we kind of move into the first quarter and over the course of the year, I mean are you expecting more older product to get kind of [wind] down? And then on that same note, can you talk about some of the new products that you’ve got ramping and when we should expect a material impact at the kind of growth there?
Meera Rao:  Going through the year, we expect all the gateway products’ revenue to continue to be up for the year, plus we have the newer networking and telecom revenues, which will continue to ramp this year.
Michael Hsing: One of our products that we designed in early to middle of last year that will start ramping in Q1 this year and also Q2.
Patrick Wang - Evercore: Okay. So you are confident you have got products that can hand off the growth, they can hand off the revenues too and we’re not going to be looking at the big horn revenues?
Michael Hsing:  No, that's not what we see at this time.
Patrick Wang - Evercore: Okay, terrific. And then just lastly the -- you mentioned the module business; I think I heard you say, you are expecting first revenues to ramp in the second half of the year. Can you give us an update on that, some of the key milestones to look forward to and perhaps as we exit the year what type of revenues we should be thinking about?
Michael Hsing: I think that it’s really a long-term growth for MPS. We did (inaudible) for the coming applications and that design activity happened in the past and are projected to be in the second half of this year and then (inaudible) on track, but to be a meaningful revenues we’re looking for what really happened here then, in the next year I think through the end of the second half of the next year.
Meera Rao: So it’s just not incremental story this year as well.
Patrick Wang - Evercore: Yeah, got you. Okay. And just one last -- further one last quick one and then I’ll get out. What are some of the kind of the bigger, the top three or four product cycles that are going to drive the growth this year? So maybe you can just kind of talk about that in the linked quarter?
Michael Hsing: Well, we haven’t (inaudible) really talk about industrial automotive, that’s one of that. I think also the LEDs and our cloud computing and particularly server size and then you have many products in the customer solutions are bigger platforms. We are expecting this year that we’re having some meaningful revenues. And in the last year (inaudible) get on the top customers and we generated few many model revenues and this year we experienced (inaudible). So I mentioned that automotive industrial (inaudible) and servers and we have other ones, but (inaudible) we will talk about it (inaudible) market shares and we really believe that it will continue to (inaudible) positions. And doing that (inaudible) as Meera mentioned about the internet, two years ago we designed -- many years ago actually sort of four years ago we designed a few products (inaudible) these are connectivity in the tough environment, these are micro solutions, 80 to 60 solutions for connectivity. In the first year we used that product and we can see the whole lot of activities. And last year, we do see a lot of activities from (inaudible) internet connected a dollar in the simple steps not other thing. So the revenues (inaudible) and it’s still too early to talk about, but we believe that it will come and there is so much activities and the revenue will, it’s just a matter of time.
Patrick Wang - Evercore: Okay, terrific. Thanks so much. Congrats guys.
Michael Hsing: Yeah.
Operator: All right. Our next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Your line is open.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel: Yes. Thank you and congratulations on the results. First question, your consumer business was up year-over-year, I think you had hinted that that would be the case. But my understanding is that the mix there has changed. I think historically you sort of classified that as third set-top box, third TV and third discretion consumer. But how does your consumer business look like now?
Meera Rao: Right now, I would say that the mix has shifted more into the general purpose consumer. I would say that general purpose consumer would be roughly about half of business. And based on the new market that we're entering like gaming consoles, as well as LED lighters and battery charging, those are the areas that are driving it. So I would say that the more traditional market like TV and set-top boxes would more probably be a quarter and a quarter each roughly. So, that's even mix overall.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel: Very good. And as Michael is going through sort of the top drivers this year, I mean they all seem like higher gross margins type markets. Should we expect the gross margin expansion as we move throughout the year?
Meera Rao: I think you would -- our goal is to grow gross margin steadily through the year.
Michael Hsing: Yes. And then we don't have it. We don't as executing our strategies and which we see it from the result from last years I don’t see a huge downside of a lot of headwinds I must say that and pressures from our gross margin. Although we do have all in traditional the analogs of traditional consumer products and which will fastly replaced by the new consumer products as Meera just mentioned and those have a higher gross margins. So I will say that we feel comfortable and we can improve the margins if not a lot at least a bit.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel: Very good. And any chance you can update us on the mix between BCD3 and the (inaudible) we have a percentage for BCD4?
Meera Rao: It’s I would say fairly early for BCD4, but if you look at BCD3 and BCD4 together, about two thirds of our revenue in Q4 was from those two technologies.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel: Okay very good. Last question and on your new DC to DC converter technology should that already start to ramp this year?
Michael Hsing:  This year, yes we have design wins. And this (inaudible) and after that this is new state of art technology that really I am excited about this. Again this contents same modulating will really replace the traditional PWM pulse with modulation. We believe this match is the better way to do it and it’s like a breakthrough we took after many years and to define this product. And I think (inaudible) can be applied for a general market and particularly for, I mean the high current for this year and this year we generated revenues on using (inaudible) and also for next year, the module, a lot of module based on this programmable power technologies.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel:  Very good. Thank you very much.
Michael Hsing: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from line of Steve Smigie with Raymond James. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks this is Vincent (inaudible) speaking on behalf of Steve. I was hoping if you could talk about the long term growth rate you see for the AC to DC business?
Michael Hsing:  Yeah. I talk about quite a good other things. AC to DC there, I didn’t mentioned there. (Inaudible) several things, such as, Meera why don’t you [take that]?
Meera Rao:  AC/DC is an area where we are seeing a lot of revenue growth coming from that. We are seeing some of the revenues growth coming in easy power family of products which is to power the (inaudible) things. We are also seeing revenues from this and multiple other market and this is going to be one of our areas of the things that are going to (inaudible) this year?
Michael Hsing: A lot of products from, a lot of demand is from (inaudible) leads some kind of small powers and also very efficient and efficient power converting from AC line and also small compacter. And so our product is outstanding in the segment. And also these some of the small appliances which connect to have quite some connectivity and we see some demand for that, but all those still at the beginning. A large portion of our AC to DC is really come from energy saving device and we call it ideal dialed and multiple lot of a high power product, computing servers and all that kind of high efficiency product which all products can just dropping replace a traditional dials and we see the ramp on that.
Unidentified Analyst: Great, thank you. And as a follow-up I was wondering if you’re considering any acquisitions?
Meera Rao: We’ve talked about this before. We would be interested in if there was a good technology (inaudible) out there and we would certainly be interested in those opportunities. So it has to be something that’s of interest to us that has maybe associated sales opportunities. So this is something that we have been looking at for a while.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Matt Diamond - Deutsche Bank: Hey good afternoon guys. Solid results. Here this is actually Matt Simon on Ross’s behalf. I wanted to ask you about your OpEx plans for the course of the year. It looks as though your SG&A is a little bit higher than your long-term model at about 16%. I am curious if you could enlighten us to what plans if any you have to cut that down to the long term model this year?
Meera Rao: Our plan, if you have noticed, back in Q4, we have held our OpEx down, and that our plan is as we don’t need to do any investments right now to hit the 2014 roadmap. As we see our revenue increase, we will increase some of our investment in particularly in the [depth] in marketing area, targeting 2015 and 2016 revenue growth. You are going to see us come into target as you see our revenue, our top line growth.
Matt Diamond - Deutsche Bank: Okay, great. And could you comment on the linearity of bookings this quarter, what you’ve seen heading into January and February?
Meera Rao: I would say this is fairly typical for what we see in most periods. As you know, we have mostly six to eight weeks lead time, so we have not seen most of the orders coming in, into the second half of the prior quarter going into this quarter. So in terms of linearity, it’s the same as it usually is.
Matt Diamond - Deutsche Bank: Okay, understood.
Michael Hsing: We feel a very normal, consumer is a little bit longer and little bit weaker, it’s in everything else doing better than we actually expected.
Matt Diamond - Deutsche Bank: Okay, great. Thanks very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Vernon Essi with Needham & Company. Your line is open.
Vernon Essi - Needham & Company: Thank you. And just to follow on the last question there on the OpEx, I guess, I didn’t understand really the answer to that. In terms of achieving the long term model, obviously you are not going to probably hit that in 2014, but it’s fair to say that your OpEx will be growing at least in dollar terms in sort of the similar pattern it has in the last couple of years. Is that a fair statement?
Meera Rao: I would say that yes. For our revenue, for our OpEx, particularly SG&A if you hit the model, that is based on revenue growth. And I'm not sure if that we’d be able to hit that this year. But you're clearly going to find that any OpEx increase this year is also going to be driven by substantially higher revenue growth.
Michael Hsing: Vernon, you see our -- you commented for long enough (inaudible). We have to increase some of the -- we have to invest some of the items like R&Ds and further growth. In the past so you see it, if the growth slowdown, we can cut a few million dollars within a quarter. And we've demonstrated many times in the past. So, OpEx, the out of control OpEx, it should not be your concern.
Vernon Essi - Needham & Company: Okay. And I just want a clarification on last point; I appreciate the answers here. Just to switch gears to lighting, and I won't bring up audio amplifiers, since I’ve followed you long enough, Michael. But going back to that revenue segment, it's been sort of flattish over the last couple of years. Can you go over the mix that's transitioned from sort of the backlighting and notebook area into general lighting over the last two years, just to get a feel for what has happened behind the scenes?
Meera Rao: Sure. As you know that a good portion of our revenue in the lighting controlled portion of it used to be all backlighting and we have been seeing this a transition more into LED lighting. And I think if you look at the most recent year, I'd say a bigger portion of our revenue is coming from LED lighting.
Michael Hsing:  So it is transitioning from the backlighting to LED lighting now.
Vernon Essi - Needham & Company: Sure, but I guess what I am trying to under is how much -- I am assuming the bulk of this year is gen -- or excuse me, 2013 was general and then like give us an idea of how much was general versus backlighting in 2012, just to understand how much general versus lighting while the other one is declining.
Michael Hsing:  Yeah, I think that Meera said that. As Meera implies more than half of it right is the LED lighting and to be more specific is these lightings not really consumer lightings and we are really targeting industrial and the commercial lightings. And so our solution, you won’t get it from these hardware stores for residential use, more in the industrial use.
Vernon Essi - Needham & Company: I know and I appreciate that. Okay, thanks. And then my last question, just to go back to the quantum module, the QS Mod, I guess that’s what you are calling this product. And you talked about the PWM topology and how that works. And I just want to be clear on this, is this going to be basically sort of an envelope tracking solution that you could target into the core area or is this more of a point of load application in sort of an enterprise example, I mean just need to be more specific on that if you could please?
Michael Hsing:  Our first product is clearly is for the core in the high current telecoms and with power solutions. And then we will -- our next generation of module will adapt that kind of approach. And with the programmable we can service our customer through internet.
Vernon Essi - Needham & Company: Okay. So just again, the backup...
Michael Hsing:  Yeah. That would be in general application DC to DC.
Vernon Essi - Needham & Company:  Okay. All right. That's helpful. Thanks a lot Michael, and thank you Meera.
Michael Hsing:  Thank you. Yeah.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rick Schafer with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer: Hey, thanks and I’ll add my congratulations guys. Couple of follow-up questions I guess here. First is, surprised to see consumer in compute up actually in the fourth quarter and comps and industrial down but despite sort of that unfavorable mix, your gross margins are still solid in 4Q. I guess where I’m going with that is, given the better mix that we would assume for the first quarter and increased percent of BCD3 and BCD4, so lower cost production in 1Q. I guess I’m surprised gross margins are just trending flat in the first quarter sequentially. Is that just a function of lower volumes, or is there anything else going on in there?
Meera Rao: I would say it’s a function of lower volumes of that. So, we expect margins to be similar to where we were in Q4 despite the lower revenues.
Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer: Okay. So it is just volume kind of as an offset for that sounds like?
Meera Rao: Yeah.
Michael Hsing:  It’s utilizations and volumes and volumes and also mix of products and that. But overall, it was a drop of some -- a few million bucks and then the margin was even much bigger change. And so where margin still stay pretty flat and that's due to just as you said it the newer product to a BCD for -- now they’re really ramping up and so replaced older products. That’s the reason we can sustain the margins.
Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer: Yeah, got it, got it. And then talking about TV, you mentioned it briefly but you kind of gave us a frame reference on how big TV is? I guess would you consider that a stable business now? I mean has it basically been de-risking the model or do you consider it still sort of a drag as we look into 2014? And part of that question, do you see any other businesses that are acting as sort of a growth offset or a drag on the top-line this year?
Meera Rao: If you look at TV, the TV business in 2013 was down from 2012, but we actually expect based on design wins that we would probably be able to grow this some. So when I look all across at all our different products, I don’t see anything in particular that would suggest that it will be a drag. Though I have to say that in consumer business, we look at each account by account to see which account we want to be able to support going forward. But I cannot think of an entire category or anything that we’re defocusing.
Michael Hsing: I am asking that you mentioned -- I think you mentioned TV; in the last few years we sort of want to minimize the concentration, but for this year and over the last year, I started looking at, there is a new application that is so called smart TV requires a higher current DC to DC. And very few players, very few suppliers, they can deliver cost effective solutions. And so MPS again, and think this year, at least I’m not optimistic in that segment.
Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer: Great. And then my question is you know I think you mentioned in the last call or let’s talk anyway. Talking about the move to BCD5 next year and how that’s probably a move or that when you’ll move to potentially 12-inch wafer. And I am curious, should we be modeling any sort of step up in cost or anything as we look out, modeling our 2015 numbers, should we think it of any kind of cost step up ahead of that 12-inch move?
Michael Hsing: I think that you -- to improve a margin is really, really is the product directions. And we move away from the lower price market segments. So I think that’s really the plus behind. Of course and continue to lower the cost and introduce a better technology that will help, but the main purpose is driving the performance. So for your model wise, okay, you look at our product lines and look at the product market segments, in all of them it should be higher than what the consumer product is.
Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer: Got it. Great, thanks Michael. Thank you, guys.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Our next question comes from the line of Amit Chanda with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Amit Chanda - Wells Fargo: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Michael, can you talk about the competitive environment associated with Shark Bay notebooks. Are you seeing any other competitors in the marketplace right now for a point of load solutions in Shark Bay? And if so, can you talk about how your products are differentiated relative to the competition?
Michael Hsing: Yeah, for the notebook side, we're not really a big player. We have some products for servers and for others. So we introduced the product to the notebook is very opportunistic. However, we do get some revenues out of this and we have pretty good margins, not [grey] margins. In this year I see that our product remains very competitive in that area. And I think we'll even gain some market shares in the notebook side.
Amit Chanda - Wells Fargo: Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. And then Meera can you maybe comment on your CapEx expectations for 2014?
Meera Rao: We've done a lot of investment already in our testers et cetera. So we think that our CapEx in 2014 is going to be down to below $10 million.
Amit Chanda - Wells Fargo: Okay, great. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
Meera Rao: Welcome.
Operator: Our next question is a follow-up from the line of Patrick Wang from Evercore. Your line is open.
Patrick Wang - Evercore: Great, thanks. Just a quick follow-up, this is probably a silly question, but when we take a look at the March quarter and how you guys guided. The street was a little bit higher than the midpoint of your guidance here. So, I'm just kind of curious from your perspective, do you think it's just Wall Street getting a little bit too excited or were there any particular areas that are a little bit weaker was it maybe perhaps Chinese New Year. Can you just talk about that a bit it could be a very simple answer in a sense that maybe we are all too excited, but just curious what you think?
Meera Rao:  Sure. I think it was just a consumer business the seasonality that we had following a very strong Q4 where consumer was about 45% of our revenues and it also included areas like gaming which have seasonality going into Q1. And we saw, particularly in December, we saw -- we had higher shipments in December than is typical for us. So I think everything combined together, I feel very comfortable with the guidance that we have and constitute here the Street’s expectation.
Michael Hsing:  Well, and I can say that okay all the analysts who cover this they’ll be very, very knowledgeable. And you guys are not silly. When I look at it, I look at the Q1 I would say that in consumers in particularly in the second half of 2003 going up substantially and in the Q1 is a little bit softer. And so, we can’t really -- in that kind of a business we really can’t predict very accurate. So that’s sort of my answer.
Patrick Wang - Evercore: Okay. So it seems like consumer is a bit stronger in the fourth quarter, so the sequential comp is a little bit steeper, but it seems like the consumer cycle probably does improve over the course of the year and this is probably the low point just from that standpoint?
Meera Rao: Absolutely, because Q2 and Q3 in particular tend to be very strong consumer quarters for us, plus you have all the other growth drivers in all the other areas that also ramp at the same time.
Michael Hsing: And traditionally in Q1 consumer is -- that's seasonality is the lowest to anyway. And I think that this year would be better than past years and then would have strong consumer content in the past years. But this year I would say that we have a high current product for TV and I think the consumer will continue to grow.
Patrick Wang - Evercore:  Got it. And there was nothing other than ordinary in terms of Chinese New Year, I mean I know it happens every year, so it shouldn’t be, but I’m just curious if there is any variation there?
Michael Hsing: I think that may be this year or a little bit slightly earlier than the last years, because I can’t say, I can’t -- this is really a pinpoint. And we do see some of it that implies early shutdowns and that will affect the Q1 revenue particularly in a consumer site. But I don’t see extraordinary will happen.
Meera Rao: And as I said, there are stronger shipments in December than is typical could be partly associated with it, but we did not want to necessarily jump to that conclusion.
Amit Chanda - Wells Fargo:  Understood, thanks very much.
Operator: And I’m not showing any further questions at this time. I’d like to turn the call back over to Meera Rao for closing remarks.
Meera Rao: Thank you all for joining us for this earnings call. We look forward to talking to you again in April. Thank you. And have a nice day.
Michael Hsing: Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. This does conclude the program. And you may all disconnect. Everyone have a good day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Monolithic Power Systems Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we’ll conduct a question and answer session and instructions will be follow at that time. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the floor over to Meera Rao. Ma’am, the floor is yours.
Meera Rao: Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to the Third Quarter 2013 Monolithic Power Systems Conference Call. Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS is with me on today’s call. In the course of today’s conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management’s current views and expectations. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q3 earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on March 5, 2013 and our Form 10-Q filed August 6, 2013, which is accessible through our website, www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today’s call. We will be discussing operating expense, operating margin, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the first, second and third quarter releases of 2012 and 2013, as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our website. I’d also like to remind you that today’s conference call is being webcast live over the internet and will be available for replay on our website for one year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. Let’s start with the highlights. MPS delivers again with another outstanding quarter. All key financial metrics revenue, gross margin, non-GAAP operating income and, in particular, non-GAAP EPS grew sharply for the second consecutive quarter. Revenue of $65.3 million grew 13% from Q2 with growth in the consumer, industrial and storage computing market segments. Gross margin expanded by 40 basis points. We continue to grow the business while holding expenses flat. As a result, non-GAAP operating income rose 37% over Q2 and non-GAAP EPS grew by 38%. More importantly, non-GAAP operating margin grew from 13.5% in Q1 2013 to 21.3% by the third quarter. These achievements are attributed to our efforts initiated three years ago when we set our goal to diversify our products and establish a consistent model for growth. We targeted multiple market segments including cloud computing, communication infrastructure, industrial and automotive. Since then we have executed against our plan. First, we created a technology roadmap to leapfrog the competition and to expand our lead. Next, we organized the company into product lines, focused on strategic target markets and hired the marketing and sales talent to drive revenue growth in these markets. Further, we enhanced our systems and processes by implementing demand and supply chain management and CRM systems. Finally, we expanded our manufacturing capacity by adding another foundry partner. As a result, we have expanded our SAM by $4 billion with growth in cloud computing, communication infrastructure, industrial and automotive. More importantly, major OEMs in these market segments are accepting MPS as a strategic supplier. We have seen the early results and are now positioned for future growth. In our last call, we updated you on our progress with point of loads for servers, modules and SSDP mix. We continue to do well in these segments. Now let me give an update on other opportunities we discussed a few quarters ago. Among our new products our switching battery charger products are performing better than expected as a result of the smaller size and superior performance. We continue to expand this product family with higher current switching chargers for fast charge applications. In the automotive product market, MPS has had early success with many European models covering chassis, lighting and ignition system. We have now expanded into several U.S., Korean and Japanese models using our high performance products such as the 60 volt small footprint synchronous regulators. Within the key industrial and white goods market, MPS has earned name recognition with many high end U.S. and European brands. White goods are increasingly offering intelligent interfaces with connectivity. MPS delivers the entire power solution to address AC/DC and DC/DC, white LED lighting and back lighting for LCD panels and wireless connection. These projects will start to ramp in the first half of 2014 and continue with long life cycles. Turning to the financial summary, our third quarter revenue of $65.3 million was at the midpoint of our guidance. Compared with Q2, revenue was up by $7.6 million or 13.2%. Our third quarter gross margin expanded 40 basis points to 54% from the 53.6% reported in the previous quarter primarily on richer product mix. Our non-GAAP operating income increased from the $10.1 million reported in the prior quarter to $13.9 million in the third quarter as a result of higher revenue, gross margin expansion and relatively flat R&D and SG&A expenses. Q3 non-GAAP net income was $12.8 million or $0.33 per fully diluted share compared with $0.24 per share in the previous quarter. Looking at our revenue by end market, consumer revenue grew $4.2 million to $28.1 million over the prior quarter driven by increased product sales in new market such as gaming and battery chargers. Industrial revenue increased by $2 million over the prior quarter to $10 million fueled by strong demand for our solutions in the security, power adaptor and power tool space. Storage and computing revenue also grew $1.3 million to $12.2 million. Revenue in the communications and telecom market increased slightly to $15 million. Let’s review our non-GAAP operating expenses. Excluding stock and net deferred comp expenses our non-GAAP operating expenses for the third quarter of 2013 were $21.6 million, an increase of $600,000 from the $21 million we spent in the second quarter. This increase was largely due to a $400,000 litigation benefit in the previous quarter which was not repeated in Q3. Moving on to our GAAP operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $26.6 million in the third quarter compared with $26 million in the second quarter. Most of the difference between non-GAAP operating expense and GAAP operating expenses for these quarters is stock comp expense. Stock compensation expenses was $5.1 million in the third quarter compared with $5 million in the prior quarter. Switching to the bottom line, on a non-GAAP basis, our Q3 net income was $12.8 million or $0.33 per fully diluted share. This compares to Q2 net income of $9.3 million or $0.24 per fully diluted share. These results are computed with an estimated tax rate of 7.5%. Now let’s look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $214.2 million at the end of the third quarter of 2013, up from the $201.3 million at the end of the prior quarter and up from the $197.3 million at the end of the third quarter of 2012. In Q3, cash proceeds from employee stock option exercises and employee stock plan purchases contributed $17.4 million. Operating cash flows generated another $6.8 million. In our last conference call, MPS announced $100 million stock buyback effective August 2013. Under this program, we brought back approximately 268,000 shares for a total of $8 million in the third quarter. We also spent $3.4 million on capital equipment during the quarter. Accounts receivable ended the third quarter at $22 million compared with $20.3 million at the end of the prior quarter and $21.6 million at the end of the third quarter 2012. Days of sales outstanding were down to 31 days in Q3 from 32 days in Q2 and 35 days in Q3 2012. Our internal inventory by the end of Q3 were $43 million up from the $40.3 million at the end of the prior quarter. However, days of inventory decreased from 137 days at the end of Q2 to 130 days at the end of Q3. Days of inventory in our distributed channel stayed at the same level as the last four quarters. I would now like to turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2013. Despite the softness in the economy, MPS expects to achieve a record fourth quarter. Our revenue guidance is $61 million to $65 million. We are seeing continued success from revenues generated from our newer products offsetting typical seasonal declines in consumer. We also expect the following. Gross margin to be in the range of 53.5% to 54.5%, stock-based compensation expense to be in the range of $5 million to $5.8 million, non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense excluding stock compensation to be in the range of $20 to $21 million, fully diluted shares to be in the range of 39.7 to 39.9 million shares for buyback. In conclusion, MPS had an outstanding third quarter with sequential organic revenue growth of 13.2% well above industry average. We continue to closely monitor the macro economic condition and to control expenses. We are well-positioned with new product revenue ramping in multiple market segments for 2014 and beyond. I’ll now open the microphone for questions.
Operator: Thank you, ma’am. (Operator Instructions) And our first question in queue will come from the line of Patrick Wang with Evercore. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Patrick Wang - Evercore: Hey, thanks so much. Congrats on the quarter end guide. And I think the 16% year-on-year organic growth you just posted is pretty impressive. On that note for my first question, analog figures have been fairly disappointing so far. I think the world seems to be slowing and you are typically down quite a bit seasonally in the fourth quarter. Can you talk about why you are not seeing such a huge decline this quarter?
Meera Rao: As we said last quarter, we have several new product that are growing and we expect that revenue growth to offset some of seasonality, and that’s what you are seeing playing out in our Q4 guide.
Michael Hsing: Yes, Patrick. We -- Meera has spend a quite a bit amount of time in her script to talk about but in the last three years we built a really good fundamental of the company and we focused on the multiple growth market such as the cloud computing and also less growth in industrial and automotive side. But all of these market segments are new to MPS; it’s just for us the opportunity is enormous. We are executing our plan and we deliver the product and introduce to the market in the last 12 to 18 months and then we start to see the result. So this is one of the reasons we don’t see Q4 is down by – traditionally from a 5% to 10% and now we are almost as good as Q3.
Patrick Wang - Evercore: Yes, great. Is there anything in particular you can highlight for us here that’s that you are seeing traction in the fourth quarter that you were working on in the past?
Michael Hsing: Yes, I think it's a pretty much evenly spread and Meera can give you some details. Meera?
Meera Rao: So most of the places where we are seeing the softness in Q4 has been in consumer and consumer like markets out there. What’s happening for us is we are also seeing some areas where because we have design wins ramping we are seeing them being on par with the prior quarter and other markets where we are seeing some growth and you combine all this together, you’re seeing the guide that we just shared with you and the Street.
Patrick Wang - Evercore: Okay. So, I guess fair to say your booking has been pretty good into fourth quarter.
Meera Rao: We are happy with the bookings.
Patrick Wang - Evercore: Yes, okay, great. And then just for a follow-up here. When we look into the first half of next year and I know you can’t talk about timing or you can’t give us too much detail, but can you walk us through some of the key growth drivers that you think are going to show up then that are going to help you continue to outperform the analog market? Thanks.
Michael Hsing: Well again in the industrial portions and -- well the white goods were classified in the industrial side. And Meera talk about it in the script and then we’ll have a two year in a next year especially start to ramp in the first half of 2004. Other ones in (inaudible) delayed, the Intel delayed the introductions and that we have a lot of design win activities and we thought to late first half or second half of the next year. And we have so many other project and we’re making about the lighting and also the battery chargers and these are all moving up -- by percentage evenly. So, this is really what we want. We want to grow evenly and consistently.
Meera Rao: I would just add to that list. We also expect to see growth in SSD, we expect to see growth in various industrial markets including automotive. We expect to do well in networking and telecom would also be an area where we will see growth. So, the key for us is that we have multiple areas where we see growth against the backdrop of whatever the macro economic conditions are.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Our next phone question will come from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Please go ahead your line is open.
Evan Yewen Wang - Stifel: Hi, this is Evan Yewen Wang for Tore Svanberg. Thank you for taking my question. I just like to dwell into telecom or your communications end market a little bit. This quarter it didn’t – it grew slightly but I was wondering if you can talk about the opportunity that you see there and maybe the timing where the growth might resume?
Michael Hsing:  In a telecom market, we see some -- the set-top box has been changed to a newer models. And so, the revenues stays about the same, I recon are little bit lower but the other newer business that start to rent but it’s not big enough to offset that areas the way before.
Evan Yewen Wang - Stifel:  I see. I'd like to – I was also wondering about your new product the Power Modules, I think you didn’t touch on that quite as much this time around. I was wondering if you can give us some sense of how well that’s doing in ramping and whether it’s reaching new applications market.
Michael Hsing:  Yes. We continue to introduce the modules and we want to complete it the product family which is a really a catalogue product. And, so then -- and then particularly in the telecoms with them the modules being shipped and also we have a multiple design wins and we expect the revenues come in in the next year.
Evan Yewen Wang - Stifel: Great. And I just I want to maybe change gear and ask you quickly about given that your growth, your accelerated growth and are you seeing that your current channels are adequate for that growth to handle that growth? And also if you can touch on whether you made any key new hires this past quarter?
Michael Hsing: We were expanding our channels in the new age of selling is the e-commerce and which will update our website wherein internally will establish our group for e-commerce and also get to particularly its aimed for our module business. And through e-commerce I can -- we can reach to a thousands of a millions of a smaller customers. And other ones, I mean, other business segments, our other channels sales channels will all reach to -- will be significant players now. And the large distributors and they start to looking at us, so start to negotiating with MPS. So, these are our still in development. We’ll expect to complete some agreement or contract in the next few months.
Operator:  Thank you, sir. Our next phone question will come from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Matt Diamond - Deutsche Bank:  Hey, good afternoon guys. I’m sorry, this is actually Matt Diamond on Ross’s behalf here. I want to talk about the gross margin dynamic. I know it was highlighted last quarter that you have some better gross margin consumer products and I would imagine that contributed to the results here but what factor if any did industrial play into that? I’m trying to figure out if the gross margin came largely as a results of the better mix within consumer or the better mix of industrial versus consumer?
Meera Rao: As industrial revenue grows, clearly that’s one of our better gross margin segments and that helps. But overall I think the story for us in Q3 is that our product mix has gotten better even in the various segments. Clearly, industrial is one of them.
Matt Diamond - Deutsche Bank: Okay. And I want to ask Patrick's question, one of Patrick's questions just a little bit differently. Could you point out the linearity of bookings within the quarter? Is there anytime that really stood out when they hit an inflection point or weaken somewhat? If you could get just sets more line on that would be greatly appreciated.
Meera Rao: Sure. In terms of timeline, I usually look at both bookings as well as resales in the channel. And resales in the channel all the way through the end of September look good. In terms of bookings, looking back the last two weeks in September was -- they were pretty good, maybe were a tad bit lighter in some areas like particularly the consumer and the consumer related market. And that’s something that we are seeing continue through right now in October.
Operator:  Thank you, sir. Our next questioner in the queue comes from the line of Vernon Essi with Needham and Company. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Vernon Essi - Needham and Company:  Thank you very much. Wondering if you could give us a little guidance on, Meera, on the OpEx. I mean, rarely does it tick down I think sequentially in the fourth quarter. And I just was wondering how we should look about which segments going to or which portion is going to be down more pronounced either in R&D and SG&A in the fourth quarter?
Meera Rao: Our plan -- as we have done in the past is always to control our cost. And I’d expect that these you would see these cost reductions in both in R&D as well as SG&A.
Vernon Essi - Needham and Company: So evenly spread between the two. And wanted to go back to a comment you made earlier on the industrial side, had a nice sequential growth there. And it sounds like you’re putting white goods into that mix. And I just was wondering if that was historically how it’s been handled, I assume that is and how do you --
Meera Rao: Yes.
Vernon Essi - Needham and Company: Okay, how do you define white goods necessarily? Is it more -- because I mean some -- most companies are lumping that in the consumer side but is it -- should the company you’re shipping it to is at the voltage or the power density of the product itself? I mean how is that definition taking place? And then by the way, the other question is that -- was that were the growth was sequentially or was it in a lot different areas.
Meera Rao: There has been a lot of -- it was in different areas. Security has been one of our big areas, power adaptors, some of the power tools, those are all the areas where we saw our growth.
Vernon Essi - Needham and Company: Okay. And I assume that power tools that that’s a battery related products?
Michael Hsing: No, it’s not.
Vernon Essi - Needham and Company: It’s not. Okay.
Michael Hsing: Vern, we always have classified that same way. And white goods I mean we can -- what the components that we’re selling to is IC, is a high voltage IC. And your refrigerators and your wash machine, dish washers and some of them even the coffee makers and I can -- they need AC to DC power supply and also DC to DC panel and some of the small white goods have a LCD panels or with a LED panels and a LCD display which they need a power tool and also the backlight, both of that. These are the areas that we shift product to. And we have other industrial area of growth and these are more the plant controlled in power stations or as well within the large production plant. And they need a 60 volts power supply lines and offer their communications. That’s where our point grows, really shine in that machine, in that area.
Vernon Essi - Needham and Company: Okay. Thanks for helping out on that. And then I just -- one follow up question here. Just going back to inventory and I think there was some prior question along those lines. But Meera, you had the inventory levels running in sort of that’s 110 to 130 day range for the last year or so. Is this going to be kind of the new norm for you and is there -- it looks like you’ve got a newer distribution sort of partner set up that's stocking a lot of components. Is that what’s happening here or can you just guide sort of that list you’ve had over the last I guess five or six quarters?
Meera Rao: No, we’ve had for two reasons. One, as we have thought this newer products has got these products designed in in some of the very large companies and they look to us to be able to support any upside that they may have and, so they are holding strategic inventories in those instances. Because, as you know, these are the first one or two products we are designed in but we see an opportunity to sell a lot more products to these customers and we want them to be very happy with us both on the product front and as a reliable supplier. So, second thing is we have trained the channels over the last few quarters to be fairly lean and let us hold the rest of the inventory because we have more flexibility and able to do that. And I want to repeat again what I said on the script that we have over the last five quarters we have held inventory in the channel at the same levels. And the reason we could do that is because we are holding the inventory.
Vernon Essi - Needham and Company: No, I realize you’re holding the inventory, I was just wondering if you had new stocking partners but you answered the question I mean you’ve got it obviously with larger end customers.
Meera Rao: Yes, yes.
Operator:  Thank you very much, sir. (Operator Instructions) And it looks like our next questioner in queue will come from the line of Amit Chanda with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Amit Chanda -Wells Fargo: Hi. Hi, Meera. Could you comment maybe on your design win activity in Shark Bay?
Meera Rao: We have multiple design wins in Shark Bay. And we do have some of our revenue that you’re seeing in storage and computing segment is from Shark Bay. So, for us as you know this is just incremental revenue that we get. And for us it’s a new market, the incremental revenue but this is a way for us to monetize technology that we actually developed for the server market.
Amit Chanda -Wells Fargo: And that’s ramping in line with your expectation?
Michael Hsing: Yes.
Amit Chanda -Wells Fargo: Okay. Okay, great. And then, Meera, can you comment maybe on uses of cash and after you finish your share repurchase program whether you plan to entertain paying out a dividend?
Meera Rao: Sure. I mean, we’ve discussed this before. We planned to have a balanced capital allocation program. We’ve already done the first phase of it or we've initiated the first phase of it which is $100 million buyback program. We’ve also having a lot of discussions with the board about initiating a dividend program. And the third a part of it is, is to acquire small technology companies out there and we are actively in the market looking at companies.
Operator:  Thank you, sir. Our next question will come from the line of Anil Doradla with William Blair. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Anil Doradla - William Blair: Hey, guys congrats on the quarter. Meera, couple of questions. Can you talk a little bit about the slope of the gaming revenue? Was that weighted more towards Q3 or Q4? And I had a follow up.
Meera Rao: Our gaming revenue started in Q3. So, Q3, Q4 are going to need a big gaming quarters.
Anil Doradla - William Blair: So, does that mean it’s going to moderate in Q1 or if in this maintenance momentum beyond that?
Michael Hsing: I think that we don’t -- we really don’t know what that of the gaming market pattern or what the seasonality there. And we design it in the -- the good news here is we being in a several loss not many designs gaming consoles, we are mostly in all of them now. And we have a several products and they all start to ramp in the third and fourth quarter of this year. And Q1 I think that we’ll see more product that’s shipping in the market segments. We believe that Q1 still will be a growth quarter.
Anil Doradla - William Blair: Okay, great. And on the TV side today Silicon (inaudible) also talked about weakness in TV for Q4. Now, is this softness limited to TVs or is it beyond TVs? At least from your perspective, did you witness the greater softness from TVs? And can you give us some color on that?
Meera Rao: The way -- when I look at it I see softness across the board and consumer; TV is one of the markets that I see it. But I also have to say that -- I've said this before as well that I don’t have as granular vision when I’m looking at it at this stage in the game as I have when I get to the end of the quarter. Well so, I can just look at it in broad brush stroke. So when I look at it I can see that consumers is largely softer than we’d have expected it to be. And TV is one of the markets that I do see that.
Anil Doradla - William Blair: So your guidance is based on the current environment continuing on, you’re not assuming any improvement on that front?
Meera Rao: I have no basis to assume an improvement. I mean, we’d be happy to have an improvement.
Anil Doradla - William Blair: Great. And finally on the battery management, can you give us a sense how big is that today, is it from a large customer or is it more broad based?
Michael Hsing: Very broad based. And if it’s probably a -- if we have as a number, its probably 10 plus customers.
Meera Rao: Yes, we have multiple customers in the segment.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Our next phone question will come from Rick Schafer with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer: Yes, thanks guys. Congratulations on the nice quarter and I apologize that some of these questions have been asked I got dropped off the call here a couple of minutes ago. Just I guess the first question I had, if -- I know you discussed Michael, the Grantley ramp beginning sort of mid year next year I believe. Can you just may be put some numbers around that how big that revenue opportunity could be for you guys? And I guess the second part of that question would be talking about the sort of what you share you think on Grantley it will be and did that primarily -- did those wins primarily come from one customer that was your competitor, excuse me, that was recently acquired?
Michael Hsing: All right, let me -- let me break you down into even more detail. In server business, we have intelligent fuse and also we have a point of a low -- those products we're working, these are very large -- these are dominant server players and in the past two quarters. And so next year we’ll see lot more revenue from a point of low and also our smart fuse and these are product line that will ramp.
Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer: Okay.
Michael Hsing: The Grantley is a really on the memory side -- on the storage side and also the CPU side, those are more in Intel’s and that called VR12.5. That product okay that product family in for a chipset will accepted now accepted by a few companies and some Japanese companies and Taiwan there as well the U.S., and but we are not in the front -- in the top tier server makers because usually it takes a few just a few generation to get in but we will see a significant revenue growth in the market. And in the one beyond Grantley was that we are -- we after -- we also the king of I forgot what was the name but I think we will be ready for primetime.
Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer: Great. Okay, so I guess my second question is in automotive I know you highlighted that as a growth factor for you guys next year, can you talk about what’s your content is per car today? Does that make sense do you have metric ready? Can you talk about what that trend is like sort of what the potential for you guys is per car or how fast that content is growing or just kind of give some color around the auto opportunity?
Michael Hsing: Yes, auto business is a very, very slow one way stall designing to -- designing to revenue it takes about three years and well we expect a pretty meaningful revenue ramp up and in from Europe in 2014; we talk about it in many quarters ago. And as you know these are -- these design wins okay these are products -- these are socket is not easily to change, they don’t cancel, they don’t drop introduce the models and like a consumer product. So it is three years earlier designed it in, they're pretty much set and it won’t generate some revenue. And so what’s the dollar content is we are in headlight, dull light, in consoles of the dashboards and ignition switches and entertainment units and we’ll have a more products -- we have more products will be introduced that like a model drivers and these all suitable for auto industry, okay auto -- for car. So what current serve the -- a product we can sell it to a car marker I don't have exactly a number but somewhat between probably $10 to $15 now.
Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer: Okay. Great. Thanks Michael. And then just a last question was just on could you give some color on what percent of REVs BCD 3 and 4 are now respectively? And maybe -- I know this is looking way out but maybe when do we start talking about BCD 5? I know a lot of the others starting to model 2015 numbers. I mean, is it 2016, 2017 before we really start talking about BCD 5 contributing to the top line?
Meera Rao: Yes. So I think a couple of quarters ago we got this question and we had said that we expect to exit 2013 with about 60% or 70% of our revenue coming from BCD 3. And this quarter exiting Q3 we are already at 60 plus percent. So, as that -- and that’s for BCD 3. And then you know we will expect to be subsequently be shipping BCD 4 products which we’re not talking about currently for competitive reason.
Michael Hsing: Well, we -- I can -- I can talk about it.
Meera Rao: Okay.
Michael Hsing: I'm going to talk about and okay, and BCD 3 is a -- BCD 4, okay really is for higher performance product that made us the product with 6 millimeter by 6 millimeter the ADM current. These are definitely the only application in the server market. And then these are the one of a kind the best efficiency in the industry. And we are talking about BCD 5s and they will really move to a 12-inch and we are in the 12-inch now and we are even pushing it to 60 nanometers and those are the fab would be the leading supply in the analog world.
Rick Schafer – Oppenheimer: But it sounds like Michael it sounds like that’s a few years away before we start talking about 5 correct?
Michael Hsing: No, well, we’re talking about probably end of next year.
Rick Schafer – Oppenheimer: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Our next question will come from the line of Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Tore Svanberg – Stifel: Yes, thank you. First question actually the sort of a follow up to the last question so BCD 4, I know at your Analyst Day you talked about working on some cost enhancement, so wondering if you get update us on those how far you’re getting along on optimizing the actual process and its cost?
Michael Hsing: And I think it’s continuing the same trend for BCD 2, BCD 3 where every generation we think about improve the cost of about 30%, 40% [indiscernible] this much. And, BCD 5 announced and of course we don’t expect that these are 60 nanometers and a 12-inch fab still very expensive but I will see -- I will foresee in the two to three years and the cost will be same as now and per silicon per unit -- per unit area what will be same cost as of now. So the product we really aiming for is for BCD 4 now. It’s – these are lot of high current product and high speed, high speed also apply for modules we delivered all the teeny tiny modules it’s because we know our product switch faster than everybody else and we can use a smaller inductors in a capacitor and that’s why our modules are in a very lower cost and a very small and so these are -- silicon cost is relatively not relevant.
Tore Svanberg – Stifel: That’s very helpful. Also you talked about the fast charging product just to clarify, is this basically tied to the rapid charge market, the chips that were going through the smartphone adaptors?
Michael Hsing: It is aiming for the fast charger like rapid chargers market but we are not in adaptor area we are in the phone.
Tore Svanberg – Stifel: Okay.
Michael Hsing: Because all the smartphone want fast chargers and they had to increase the current now we have a product to the chargers -- battery chargers that up to 3 to 4 amp current and those chargers cannot be integrated into one of this – this power management into the [indiscernible]. So it will be a standalone chargers that we – we would have a lot of demand for this product.
Tore Svanberg – Stifel: Very good, thanks for clarifying that. I also had a question on your SSD power management business, is SSD now basically hasn’t surpassed HDD in your revenue mix?
Meera Rao: No I would say that HDD is still the bigger portion of the revenue, but SSD is growing fast and we have the two additional things that we introduced that we talked about last year which is going to be adding to our revenue mix next year. So next year is a year that I expect SSD to may be take over HDD. We also got to remember HDD programs tend to be fairly large so is one single program could actually change that equation again.
Tore Svanberg – Stifel: Okay, very good. Just one last question, I don't think you really comment on backlog or bookings I think you talked a little bit about early in the call, but can you give us anything specifically sort of where you stand right now as far as coverage is concerned and how you feel about your guidance?
Meera Rao: Sure, as you know when we give our guidance we look at both the backlog, our churns business where it’s coming from and how comfortable we are about it. And so right now, I can say that we’re very comfortable with our guidance we have got good bookings comfortable about the churns to come.
Michael Hsing: In the history of MPS, I think only 2008 in a middle of the quarter we changed our previous guidance we guided low. And we updated the guidance and that was external or extraordinary macro conditions – macroeconomic condition change. And so other than I don't remember we ever missed the quarters.
Tore Svanberg – Stifel: Very good, that’s all from me, congratulations on a solid execution here.
Meera Rao: Thank you.
Michael Hsing: Thank you Tore.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Presenters, I'm showing no additional phone line questions in the queue. I’d like to turn the program back over to Ms. Rao for any additional or closing remarks.
Meera Rao: Thank you.
Michael Hsing: Thank you.
Meera Rao: Thank you for joining us on this call and we look forward to talking with you on the next call. Have a nice day.
Operator: Thank you presenters and thank you ladies and gentlemen. Again this does conclude today’s conference. Thank you for your participation. And have a wonderful day. Attendees, you may now all disconnect.

===== 2013 Q2  (2013-08-06 17:00:00) =====
Executives: Michael Hsing – President and CEO Meera Rao – CFO
Analysts: Patrick Wang – Evercore Partners Tore Svanberg – Stifel Financial Vernon Essi – Needham and Company Ross Seymore – Deutsche Bank Steven Smigie – Raymond James Lena Zhang – Baylock RV 
Operator: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Monolithic Power Systems’ Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) Today’s conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Meera Rao, CFO of Monolithic Power Systems. Please proceed.
Meera Rao: Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to the second quarter 2013 Monolithic Power Systems conference call. Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS is with me on today’s call. In the course of today’s conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management’s current views and expectations. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q2 earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on March 5, 2013 and our Form 10-Q filed today, which is accessible through our website, www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today’s call. We will be discussing operating expense, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the first and second quarter releases of 2012 and 2013, as well as the reconciling tables that are posted on our website. I’d also like to remind you that today’s conference call is being webcast live over the internet and will be available for replay on our website for one year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. Let’s start with the highlights. MPS had a great second quarter. Our revenue, gross margin, non-GAAP operating income and EPS grew sharply quarter over quarter. Revenue of $57.7 million grew 12% from Q1 with the higher sales in the consumer, communication and industrial market segments. Gross margin expanded by 40 basis points. We leveraged the increase in sales and gross margin by holding non-GAAP operating expenses relatively flat for the prior quarter. As a result, non-GAAP operating income rose 45% over Q1 and non-GAAP earnings per share grew by 41$. On the business front, our Monolithic power modules, the MPM product family is being very well received by customers. As everyone knows power system design has always been a laborious and time consuming process. It requires selecting and designing multiple components surrounding the IC to make the full system work efficiently. MPS has developed a power module that integrates the entire system into one package, as expected has been well received by our customers. Now customers can just drop in our module and move on to other challenges. We already have multiple design wins for power modules industrial and high end consumer markets. As we continue to expand the family of plug and play modules, to address a variety of applications throughout the year, we expect to see steady revenue growth beginning in 2014. Another market we have been focused on is the fast growing cloud computing segment. As we have mentioned in past earnings calls, we have had multiple design wins with emerging server manufacturers in Asia. At the same time there has been extensive design activity with US server OEMs. As you know, US OEMs are typically more conservative in adopting new technologies and are cautious in accepting new vendors. Despite this conservatism, the high efficiency and compact form factor of our product enabled us to penetrate the US server market. We are pleased to report that the US server maker has awarded MPS multiple [guaranteed] platforms using our BCD3 family of point of load products. This success has led to additional design wins at this OEM with our current limit switches and we are continuing to pursue other opportunities as that. Storage continues to be an exciting and growing market for MPS. Our continued introduction of p-mix for this application has increased penetration and led to design wins at several customers. Following the introduction of our initial front-end p-mix, MPS is now sampling two additional p-mix which will allow the customers to shrink overall form factor. We believe these exciting products will ramp in the second half of next year and allow us to keep our leadership position in this market. Finally, as the CoolPower family has gained strength in the consumer market, we are pleased to see that revenue in the consumer segment has started to grow again. Turning to the financial summary, our second quarter revenue of $57.7 million was at the midpoint of our guidance. Compared with Q1 revenue was up by $6.2 million or 12%. Our second quarter gross margin was 53.6% compared with the 53.2% reported in the previous quarter. Our non-GAAP operating income increased from the $7 million reported in the prior quarter to $10.1 million in the second quarter as a result of higher revenues and relatively flat operating expenses. Q2 non-GAAP net income was $9.3 million or $0.24 per fully diluted share compared with $0.17 per share in the previous quarter. Looking at our revenue by end market, consumer revenue grew $5.1 million to $23.9 million over the prior quarter on increased product sales and general purpose consumer and set-top box markets. Revenue in the communications and telecom markets also grew $1.6 million in the second quarter to $14.9 million primarily reflecting market share gains. Industrial revenue increased $800,000 to $8 million over the prior quarter. Storage and computing revenue declined $1.2 million to $10.9 million as customers transitioned from older models to newer models. Let’s review our non-GAAP operating expenses. Excluding stock compensation, our non-GAAP operating expenses for the second quarter of 2013 were $21 million, an increase of $400,000 from the $20.6 million we spent in the first quarter. Moving on to our GAAP operating expenses, our GAAP operating expenses were $26 million in the second quarter compared with $25.1 million in the first quarter. The only difference between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for these quarters is stock compensation expense. Stock comp expense was $5 million in the second quarter compared with $4.5 million in the prior quarter. Switching to the bottom line, on a non-GAAP basis, our Q2 net income was $9.3 million or $0.24 per fully diluted share. This compares to Q1 net income of $6.4 million or $0.17 per fully diluted share. These results are computed with an estimated tax rate of 7.5%. Now let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $201.3 million at the end of the second quarter of 2013, up from the $186.8 million at the end of the prior quarter and also up from the $196.4 million at the end of the second quarter of 2012. In Q2, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $16.1 million. Cash proceeds from employee stock option exercises and employee stock plan purchases contributed another $6.3 million. We spent $7.9 million on capital equipment and software. Accounts receivable ended the second quarter at $20.3 million compared with $22.7 million at the end of the prior quarter and $21.4 million at the end of the second quarter 2012. Days of sales outstanding were down to 32 days in Q2 and 40 days in Q1 and 33 days in Q2 2012. Our internal inventories at the end of the Q2 were $40.3 million, up from the $34.9 million at the end of the prior quarter. Days of inventory also increased from 132 days at the end of Q1 to 137 days at the end of Q2. Days of inventory in our distributor channels stayed the same level as the prior quarter. I would now like to turn to outlook for the third quarter of 2013. With design wins ramping and strong bookings for our newer products, we are seeing positive momentum in our business. Our revenue guidance is in the range of $63 million to $67 million. We expect gross margin to be in the range of 53.5% of 54.5%. We expect stock based compensation expense to be in the range of $4.3 million to $4.8 million. We also expect non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses, excluding stock compensation, to be in the range of $21 million to $22 million. We expect litigation expenses in the range of $300,000 to $400,000. We expect fully diluted shares to be in the range of 48.8 million to 39.2 million shares before share buyback. MPS has brought a two of the first phase of our capital allocation program, a $100 million stock buyback program over a two-year period beginning in the third quarter of 2013. In conclusion, MPS had an outstanding second quarter with sequential organic revenue growth of 12% well above industry average. With the industry leading products continue to gain acceptance in cloud computing, industrial and automotive markets, we are now in the new era of growth and diversification. I'll now open the microphone for questions.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Patrick Wang of Evercore.
Patrick Wang – Evercore Partners: Just a couple of questions, first, last quarter you saw some upside in gross margins, even though consumers off the tone, it seems like your structural change taking place, can you talk about what happened in Q2 to get you a little bit better gross margin in your Q3 guide? And then also what the mid-term implications are -- potentially you just recently raised your margin targets at analyst day?
Meera Rao: Our gross margin improvement was a result of the product mix and as you noticed, our consumer revenues increased and we have some consumer products that also have pretty good margins. So the net result of that is we saw an improvement in Q2 and as we’ve talked about the last few quarter, we expect our gross margins to continue to expand but we expect it to be steady increase. And you can also see that in our guide for Q3.
Patrick Wang – Evercore Partners: And I guess just the mid-term implications, I guess how should we think about that just over the next couple of quarters?
Michael Hsing: Patrick, this is Michael. As our revenue grew and also we expected our gross margin to keep it steadily increase as Meera said it, the reason for that is we focus on more value product rather than competing on the price. And as in the past year also with all these -- introduced all these products, which all have a higher margin volume and as we grow revenue as I said it and the margin will grow.
Patrick Wang – Evercore Partners: Hey Michael, then your inventory is up 15% sequentially. I am just curious if this was some or all of this was in reaction to the type of backlog you are seeing in the back half of the year or was it something else?
Michael Hsing: Yes, as you noticed that the inventory grew. There are two points, two even for that. One is that we introduced a lot of new products and we prepared some of the inventories for those products ramping in the second half of this year. And also from a number point of view, from a revenue you see our revenue grew from 57.7 to mid-60, that’s also a bigger jump. So we have to have some or more inventory to cover the growth.
Patrick Wang – Evercore Partners: And then I have got one last question and then I will jump back in the queue, Michael. I just want to ask, we have been hearing about some M&A chatter recently and I know you can’t comment on it. But as you talked about it in the prepared comments that the company is much different now than before – you are in the new era of growth, I mean for instance we are seeing you guys deliver much higher growth rates than your peers today. So given these changes, I am just curious how you actually think about fair value for the company or just how you think about it today?
Michael Hsing: As we said that we have internally in the company transitioning from a smaller company to maybe a mid-sized of a company and did a lot of changes from the organization point of view. And we – some two years ago we thought to divide into the product lines and our organization is very much different from two years ago and we are still learning. And also you look at the –from a value point of view and the product – we focus on a different product profile, we changed and these are more focused on the value side. That’s – I would emphasize on the MPS technology, and how we compete in the market, and for the long term in a sustainable higher margin growth segment. Now to answer to your question, what’s the value of the company, the board recognized that – we are in a growth period and we are still at the very beginning. And on the one side, yes we announced a $100 million buyback and couple of reasons for that, from a small company we return to our shareholder values – if shareholders one time we buy back 70 million shares and the other one is, will give us $30 million, $35 million for – as a divided. These are sporadic and now we look at the long term view and for the comprehensive program to first to minimize the share gain, second, how we do study the dividend and the board hasn’t made a decision yet but I think it’s a very (inaudible) how we acquire the technology company to continue to expand. So these are really the value for our shareholders, we are on the transition, from a smaller company to a larger company. And also these all are going to reflect to MPS’ long term value. And we shall buy our shares, now and have to return our shareholder value.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel.
Tore Svanberg – Stifel Financial: First question, you talked about backlog and bookings doing quite well. But can you just give us some sense of how your visibility is looking now, with two months left in the quarter?
Meera Rao: We had – we saw very good bookings as we went through last quarter and we are seeing that trend continue right now. And when we look at retails and channel that’s also very good retails last quarter, we are still seeing good retail through July. So right now we are feeling pretty comfortable.
Tore Svanberg – Stifel Financial: And your consumer business bounced back quite significantly and you have mentioned some discretionary consumer growth there. But could you talk specifically to that segment, where they need other programs or move product launches that you benefitted from?
Meera Rao: Some of the areas where we have grown in consumers is what I call general purpose consumer with consists of a lot of small different product lines and these are lot of the design wins that we had with our CoolPower family products that have started to ramp and as a consumer, they are also introducing the new models and this is something that we had alluded to also back in Q1 and all that revenue is coming in now in Q2 and you’re also going to see a growth in Q3 in consumer as these models ramp.
Michael Hsing: Thanks Tore for recognizing that, and I had some – I received some concerns from our shareholders, the way we are getting rid of the consumer business and at the same time we are starting – the focusing on another other bid notice. And so my response was okay, consumer were now walking away and the CoolPower family were introduced the last year and we still start to ramp, at the same we haven’t crossed the growth yet, again I only can tell you – our shareholder was our intention. Now finally we delivered. We started – you will start to see a light trend. The percentage of the total consumer business will reduce but the revenue will go up.
Tore Svanberg – Stifel Financial: And better relations on those grant wins, could you give us a sense of when will we see revenue contribution from those?
Meera Rao: Second half of next year. That’s the grant – cycle, so we expect to see revenue in the second half of next year.
Tore Svanberg – Stifel Financial: Very good. Last question, I know you still have some important design wins for communications in the pipeline. Can you just update us on those and especially on the timing please?
Meera Rao: We have very extensive engagement on the design activity front. We also have a few design wins that are going to be ramping up and you will see the revenue in – some revenue this quarter, more in 2014.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vernon Essi with Needham and Company.
Vernon Essi – Needham and Company: I was wondering Michael, if you could give us the profile or maybe a little more color on the customer, you said that was the domestic customer and any information I guess with regarding sort of what sort of penetration rate you might have within that customers product line portfolio?
Michael Hsing: Okay. I will answer your second part of the question first. The percentage of a design win that’s still at the very beginning but the key is are we penetrate it and we will see meaningful ramp starting next year. So in the next year and then it goes definitely will move the needles and on the revenue needle. The first question is what customers, okay, our entity all of them, all the servers including in the US and in Asia – Asia means, Japan, China, Taiwan.
Vernon Essi – Needham and Company: And I assume obviously the straddled both enterprise and cloud based –
Michael Hsing: Yes.
Vernon Essi – Needham and Company: And then jut to go back to the computing segment, it was a little I guess you sort of had a sluggish performance and in your prepared comments, you said that we’d transition from an old product to a new product, is this on the storage side or is this on the computing side?
Meera Rao: On the storage side, as our customers transition from the older models to the new models. That’s what impacted our Q2 storage revenues.
Vernon Essi – Needham and Company: And do you have any visibility to how might shape up in the third quarter, does it still look to be sluggish or is it snapping back?
Michael Hsing: I think in a transitional period – FFDs in North America the traditionally these internet companies, it changes adopting rate of kind of lower. And that reflects that, we see in the second half, maybe beginning of latter second half of the year and into next year, and the revenue will accelerate and the same time, they are changing a models and FFDs as well as HDD in the game. Well, that’s the situation that we have now.
Vernon Essi – Needham and Company: On the consumer side, you had indicated at your analyst event that you had a high profile gaming console win, if I remember correctly there was a pretty decent amount of dollar content on that product. Just out of curiosity what sort of sizing of that would contribute to the back half lift you have going in consumer, you have a broad range of CoolPower opportunities but is there a way you could sort of strip out what the console opportunity mean relative to the rest of the consumer business?
Meera Rao: We are going to see – the gaming console design win is ramping up in Q3 and Q4, I don’t want to be anything more suspect than think we expect to be $7 million of revenue.
Vernon Essi – Needham and Company: Well, I guess let me try this another way and maybe you can go – is there – if you were to strip out the console, we you still be seeing growth in consumer through quarter on quarter for the rest of the year?
Meera Rao: We would definitely see an increase in Q3.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore – Deutsche Bank: Just a question on the mix side of things, specifically on gross margin. As impressive that your gross margin hit your guidance range even though it appeared that the mix actually was a big headwind with consumer growing and the computing/storage side falling off. Was that in pact a dynamic that you overcame in the second quarter and if so, how does that – what drop it up I guess I would be the question.
Michael Hsing: Remember last year – I will begin the last year, CoolPower intrinsic, we have a low cost structure. CoolPower, and again we also – the second factors include the gross margin is about we focus on only the value side. And we are not going now just to competing on a price to gain the market share. So we are picking the choose this time. That’s the reason, even though we grew the consumer business and are relatively reading large portion and would you maintain the goal of the gross margin?
Ross Seymore – Deutsche Bank: My first of two follow-ups, looking into the third quarter you have given very solid revenue growth guidance. Any outliers as far as the four segments which one you’d take to grow faster or slower and what those are drivers please?
Michael Hsing: No really, we don’t have outlier out there and the most systematic growth across the broad and I am glad to see us American and finally the consumer across the – going down every quarter. Now it’s going up. Primarily all segments the revenue is going to go out. And so we are going to keeping in that way but again the percentage of a consumer business, while the growth rate will be slower than the other segments.
Ross Seymore – Deutsche Bank: I guess it’s my last question and I know you’re not guiding specifically for the fourth quarter but historically you have been a hyper seasonal would be the best way to say it and I think your historical average for the fourth quarter as we down relatively 7% sequentially in revenues, how should we think about the revenue trajectory given all the new products launches that you have heading into the fourth quarter this year?
Meera Rao: One of the things that I have noticed for the last few quarters is that the seasonality is trumped by a cyclicality of the market every single time. So that kind of mix are hard one to answer. Particularly for our this year is that we have a lot of design wins that are ramping. So we don’t know what is market demand, cyclicality is going to be at that time and it’s just going to offset any or historically ramp that we have right now. So that’s something we are not going to have much visibility on at this time. So when you look at a design wins and demand out there, we still feel pretty good.
Michael Hsing: Yeah, to add a little bit more on it. I think in the last couple of years, our focus didn’t change and so our seasonality should be impacted at $0.02. And looking at all the design win activities or revenue lift, we feel very positive in the fourth quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Smigie of Raymond James.
Steven Smigie – Raymond James: Looks like on the guidance to revenues, pretty darn close to your previous record high. Congrats also on the $100 million buyback, in the first lease on that buyback, I think you talked about starting that buyback relatively soon takes place over the couple of years. And that you would do it sort of as you see fit but is it – the case that you might sort of do more of it on the front end versus end just cause it seems like a strong growth phase here, it soon -- start is probably going to be cheaper now the in the future. Would we expect to see more share buyback early on as – $100 million?
Michael Hsing: Yeah of course, we cannot calculate buying the formula, buying patent. And yes, we will start to buy a – as some of the rules and the laws allowed.
Steven Smigie – Raymond James: Just with regard to process technology, BC3s has been out there for a little while. Have you see anybody come out with anything that’s catching up a little bit on that?
Michael Hsing: Yeah, the BCD4 product valve and of course, there is no revenues, it’s really 2015 revenues and with this, you will have a much bigger – that’s the order it’s not the BCD3.
Steven Smigie – Raymond James: A question is more just – obviously you guys came out this BCD3 and very significant of BCD4 as a way to sort of I think get ahead of some folks that had – like that, and I am just wondering if you have seen any more competition on the BCD3 level and I realized – was the case that you are beyond that but –
Michael Hsing: No, we haven’t seen anything yet – not that we know of.
Steven Smigie – Raymond James: Somewhat similar on the MPMs, sounds like you have some great innovations – you have the first generation three to pull all that together, have other folks have seen what you have done and started making noise about being able to come out with something like that, or do you think you’ve got those kind of teaser lead on that stuff?
Michael Hsing: I haven’t seen the landscape, landscape is changing – there is always some noise – this is what customers always, always wanted that and I think that we are the first to make deliver that kind of a product and there are some product on the market of too way expensive and focused on a very small number of our customers and like MPS, we just – we commercialized the BCD process and at this time we are going to accomplish our life with module business.
Steven Smigie – Raymond James: Just wondering up on Ross’ question about the Q4 seasonality, doesn’t have to be just specific to Q4 but if we were to see some seasonal drop, I assume you could just add some more color what might happen to gross margin, you guys are obviously fabulous and it seems like a lot of the new innovations you have come out with CoolPower for example on lower costs, so even like a modest seasonal decline, could you still expand gross margin through that?
Meera Rao: It kind of depends upon the revenue levels and the mix of products. So I could see a scenario where revenue could be down seasonally and gross margins could still expand. But again it depends upon the revenue level and the mix.
Michael Hsing: But I don’t see a lot of downside. The market – the macro-economic significant change and we see the consumer business growth and rest of the business as you see growing in the last three or four quarters and our gross margin will keep going higher.
Steven Smigie – Raymond James: And then last question is just on operating expenses, looks like guidance here is pretty good, OpEx control, obviously revenue is helping, there is a big jump, how should we think about that going forward? Obviously have your target model out there but my thought is that you’ve got a bunch of really successful products, that sounds like ramping here that are in areas like computing, networking that are sort of outside your typical end markets. If those would ramp pretty quickly, would you have to add support for that, I think I’d typically be more significant support than what you guys have done in the past?
Meera Rao: We are expecting to evolve our OpEx relatively flattish going forward as well. We believe we have the support that we need, we might have to do an occasional hire. But I think we are going to find that revenue growth is going to far outstrip and increase in OpEx.
Michael Hsing: Yeah, I will give you a little more color on that. So our large shareholder is going to initially expand and initially grow as well as – it shouldn’t goes our back, so we take a moderate approach. And we see the sales and marketing side is our weakness and we should keep expanding and overall numbers, should we have a very modest increase.
Operator: Our next question comes from Amit Chanda with Wells Fargo.
Unidentified Analyst: This is [Amit Chanda] dialing in for David Wang. Meera, can you talk about inventory levels at your customers, for the different end markets you serve, what you are seeing there?
Meera Rao: What we can see the C levels, and our inventory in the channel come -- number of days has been at the same level for the last four quarters and we have been able to hold the inventory level and we carry more the inventory, so we can move our customers and demand. And the inventory that’s in the channel right now we are also seeing a mixed debt changing from the older products to the newer products. So it’s all in line with our sales strategy.
Unidentified Analyst: And can you provide us with a quick update on what percentage of your revenue at the moment stems from new products versus your older products?
Meera Rao: Our new product revenue is about 37% to 38% of our revenue right now.
Unidentified Analyst: And then finally, can you may be talk about any traction you are getting with the power modules, targeting the FSD market?
Meera Rao: We basically use a couple of Phoenix this quarter. This is in addition to the front-end Phoenix that we had released I think about a year ago. So one is higher voltage p-mix and the other one is companion that work for the front end processes.
Michael Hsing: And the PMP for FSD revenue will not ramp until next year.
Meera Rao: Yes, the new Phoenix that we have introduced are – MPM modules.
Operator: Our next question comes from Lena Zhang with Baylock.
Lena Zhang – Baylock RV: Only one from me is regarding your internal inventories. So in the last two quarters increases in internal inventory outpaced your revenue growth. Is that fair to assume the long term revenue product revenue coming in Q4?
Meera Rao: We continue to see our new products being designed in and the revenues from these ramping, so we are holding those inventories in support of that demand and as we also have started selling in some of our new products into larger customers, they also require us to hold more inventory of these new products. In some situations we are only supplier or we are one of two and they want assurances that we will have products ready. So everything we are doing is in support of our new business.
Operator: I am not showing any other questions in the queue at this time. I would like to turn it back over to Ms. Rao for closing comments.
Meera Rao: We very much appreciate your joining us for this call and look forward to talking to you next quarter at the next earnings release. Thank you and have a nice day.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference. Thank you for your participation. Have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.

===== 2013 Q1  (2013-04-29 17:00:00) =====
Executives: Michael R. Hsing - President and Chief Executive Officer Meera Rao - Chief Financial Officer
Analysts:  Patrick Wang - Evercore Partners Tore Svanberg - Stifel Financial Vernon Essi - Needham and Company Steven Smigie - Raymond James Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank Lena Zhang - Baylock RV Gus Richard - Piper Jaffray 
Operator:  Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Monolithic Power Systems Incorporated First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) Today’s conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Meera Rao. 
Meera Rao: Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to the first quarter 2013 Monolithic Power Systems conference call. Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS is with me on today’s call. In the course of today’s conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management’s current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q1 earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on March 5, 2013, which is accessible through our website, www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today’s call. We will be discussing operating expense, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the Q1 2012, Q4 2012, and Q1 2013 releases, as well as the reconciling tables that are posted on our website. I’d also like to remind you that today’s conference call is being webcast live over the internet and will be available for replay on our website for one year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. MPS had a record first quarter with revenues of $51.5 million. The represents a 6.8% increase from the previous quarter instead of the typical seasonal drop of 5% to 10%. We grew revenue in each of our target markets segments, industrial, computing and communications. Gross margin also expanded by 20 basis points in the first quarter. We're encouraged that business conditions have stabilized and begun to improve since the beginning of 2013. We saw a meaningful number of recent design wins, new product ramps, and market share gains, all of which will support our top line growth in the second half of this year. At the same time, we will continue to further diversify our product portfolio to be less consumer-centric. With the ever-increasing demand for mobility, capacity and connectivity of all electronic devices and applications, small size, energy efficiency and flexibility are critical to the success of our customers in different markets. MPS continues to lead our competition in those areas and reinvent our technology ahead of the curve. With that, let me share with you some examples of our success. Our innovative synchronous rectifier product family has been very well received. One of the top video game console makers reduced their system power loss by 30% without going through a system redesign and by simply replacing a passive component with an MPS synchronous rectifier. As we see this product family being designed into industrial, solar power, and DC power market, we expect this product family will generate meaningful revenue in the coming years. Our EasyPower AC to DC product family has been widely adopted by many of the top appliance manufacturers and has expanded into other markets, such as building and industrial automation. Demand for this product family is being driven by its power efficiency, ease of use, low pollution cost, and being the smaller size in the industry. As we have previously reported, we have developed and introduced the Monolithic Power Module, the MPM product family. Our early success with MPM was being designed in by a large networking company. We are even more excited by the module product we have developed and are developing which will set a new standard for power application. These miniaturized modules based on BCD3 technologies have increased power density which drives smaller size, increased efficiency, and lower pollution cost. These advantages mean MPS can replace existing discrete solutions. We're excited that some customers are moving towards volume production during the second half of this year. For Intelli-Phase products, the efficiency, performance, and small size of a product offering has deemed acceptance at networking companies. We offer both high-current power modules as well as standalone Intelli-Phase products and controllers. A major telecom company designed MPS' point of load Intelli-Phase product and controllers into their switchboard and will start production in the second half of 2013. This is a significant win for us as each six-board chassis has multiple boards and each board uses nine MPS controllers and 22 MPS Intelli-Phase driver MOSFET product, netting us several hundred dollars of MPS content per chassis. We are optimistic about this design win proliferating into additional network chassis at the networking company. Finally, in the mobile segment, we introduced our line of battery management products last year and expect to have a few million dollars of revenue this year. Market acceptance has been ahead of expectations and MPS is on its way to becoming the major player in this segment. We are starting to collaborate with key battery suppliers and OEMs to develop new battery management systems, designed to improve battery life and power delivery efficiency. We're excited by the enormous potential for MPS in this segment. Turning to the financial summary, our first quarter revenue of $51.5 million was above the midpoint of our guidance. Compared with Q4, revenue was up by $3.3 million or 6.8%. Q1 revenues increased approximately $1 million, up 2% from the first quarter of 2012. Our first quarter gross margin was 53.2% compared with the 53% reported in the previous quarter and 52.3% posted in the same quarter from a year ago. Our non-GAAP operating income of $7 million was lower than the $8.3 million reported in the prior quarter. This reduction was largely due to a $2.5 million legal judgment in our favor during the fourth quarter. The Q1 non-GAAP operating income was higher than the $6.5 million from the same quarter of the prior year. Q1 non-GAAP net income was $6.4 million or $0.17 per fully diluted share compared with $0.21 per share in the previous quarter and $0.17 per share in the first quarter of the prior year. Looking at the revenue by end markets, we saw our strongest growth percentagewise in the industrial market where sales increased $1.2 million to $7.2 million over the prior quarter. This performance was fuelled by increased product sales for applications in general industrial, commercial LED lighting, as well as automotive. Computing revenue grew $1.9 million to $12.2 million, fuelled by strong growth in storage. Revenue in the communications and telecom market also grew $1.1 million in the first quarter to $13.3 million, primarily reflecting market share gain. While revenue from consumer markets declined $1 million in the first quarter to $18.8 million, this decline was lower than our typical first-quarter seasonal decline in consumer. Let's review our non-GAAP operating expenses. Excluding stock comp, our non-GAAP operating expenses for the first quarter of 2013 were $20.6 million, an increase of $3.2 million from the $17.4 million we spent in the fourth quarter. This increase was largely due to a $2.5 million legal judgment in our favor during the fourth quarter of 2012, which we recorded as a benefit from litigation expenses. Moving on to our GAAP operating expenses, our GAAP operating expenses were $25.1 million in the first quarter compared with $24.6 million in the fourth quarter. The only difference between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for these quarters is stock compensation expense. Stock comp expense was $4.5 million in the first quarter compared with $7.1 million in the prior quarter. As you know, MPS declared and paid a one-time special $1 per share dividend in December 2012. An equitable adjustment of vested stock options outstanding resulted in a $2.8 million of stock comp charge in the fourth quarter. Switching to the bottom line, on a non-GAAP basis, our Q1 net income was $6.4 million or $0.17 per fully diluted share. This result is computed with an estimated tax rate of 7.5%. Q1 2013 GAAP net income was $2.5 million or $0.07 per fully diluted share. Now let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $186.8 million at the end of the first quarter of 2013, up from the $172.4 million at the end of the prior quarter and down from the $194.6 million at the end of the first quarter of 2012. In Q1, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $9.8 million. Cash proceeds from employee stock option exercises and employee stock plan purchases contributed another $11 million. We spent $6.4 million on capital equipment and software. Accounts receivable ended the first quarter at $22.7 million compared with $19.4 million at the end of the prior quarter and $19.9 million at the end of the first quarter 2012. Days of sales outstanding were up slightly to 40 days in Q1 from 37 days in Q4 2012 and 36 days in Q1 2012. Our internal inventories at the end of the quarter were $34.9 million, up from the $32.1 million at the end of the prior quarter. Days of inventory also increased from 129 days at the end of Q4 to 132 days at the end of Q1. Inventory in our distributor channels stayed at the same level as the prior quarter in both dollars and days. I would now like to turn to outlook for the second quarter of 2013. With the economy improving and design wins ramping, we are seeing positive momentum in our business. Our revenue guidance is in the range of $55 million to $69 million. We expect gross margin to be in the range of 53% of 54%. We expect further expansion in gross margin as high-value products as well as CoolPower family of products ramp in the second half of 2013. We expect stock-based compensation expense to be in the range of $4.5 million to $5 million. We expect non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses, excluding stock compensation, to be in the range of $20.5 million to $22.5 million. In conclusion, MPS had an outstanding first quarter of the year, hitting record first-quarter revenues while continuing to deliver solutions that meet or exceed industry standards. We are delivering on our promise to broaden our product portfolio and grow revenues above the industry average with sustainable long-term growth. I'll now open the microphone for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Patrick Wang from Evercore Partners.
Patrick Wang - Evercore Partners:  Congrats on a great quarter. First question I've got is, it sounds like you guys are pretty – you've got a lot of good stuff in the pipeline for the second half of the year, I'm just kind of curious, as you look ahead, which areas do you think you'll get the most growth in terms of just end markets, because it sounds like a lot of stuff in a lot of different areas?
Michael R. Hsing: Yes, Patrick, we in the last couple of years or so, we focused on the different market segments, such as networking, servers, and the industrial, and the AC to DC line including also the LED lighting, last year we also added another product market segment, battery chargers and the battery management. In all of them, we try to do the best we can and based on how the new technology which provides much more small, efficient energy efficiency of a product, we're designing as many as we can, and we treat all the markets equally, and so far we – at this time, we see all the markets are ramping up, and that's what's very exciting.
Patrick Wang - Evercore Partners: Got you, that's great. So the second question here is, when we take a look at gross margin for Q2, the gross margin guide at the midpoint, it was a tad little lighter than I would have expected and I take a look at your product mix and computing has come up a bit, it sounds like you've got a consumer ramp coming, can you give us some puts and takes on what's going on in margins from Q1 to Q2?
Meera Rao: Sure. What we expect as a new product starts ramping is that you expect to see a gross margin expansion, particularly as our high-value products kick in, as more and more CoolPower comes in. So we're expecting to see the gross margins expand. What you're also seeing in here is there's always a certain amount of play in the gross margin, there's so many factors in there that economies decide, but we do expect to see a gross margin expansion.
Michael R. Hsing: Yes, basically your target module is fairly higher, but as I've said in last year also, in the second half of this year, we will grow all the products in high-end market, which is the networking, telecom, and industrial, automotives, and other new segments like battery management. So they will start from the second half of this year. And also, as you'll remember, in the 2011 and 2010, that we gradually started phasing out the BCD2 Dc to DC product, and from the last year, on the (indiscernible) designing and the revenue happening in the first half of the year is a lot more than in the second half of this year. So, the gross margin will keep improving.
Patrick Wang - Evercore Partners: Perfect. There isn't any concern about pricing pressure or anything because you guys seem to be in a pretty good competitive position?
Michael R. Hsing: The new market segment that we entered directly of course, it is all the gross margins were very good and without competing with the price. We really like to offer customers the value of the product. In CoolMOS product family, which is more adjusting, more high-volume consumer oriented product, we don't have – the price looks competitive and MPS, we can depend our other position not sacrificing a lot of the margin.
Patrick Wang - Evercore Partners: Okay, and you still expect that, the CoolMOS part to be over 60% of sales by kind of exiting this year?
Meera Rao: Actually, it's BCD3, we expect revenues from BCD3 products to be about 60% to 70% of our revenues as we exit this year. The CoolPower family of products is just a portion of it. It's a module that we are talking about, it's the parts that are going into servers, notebooks, all those parts are also BCD3 but they're not CoolPower. CoolPower family of products are the ones that go into high-volume consumer and consumer like market.
Patrick Wang - Evercore Partners: Got you. Last question, I just hope you could provide a little clarification. There's been some concern that you guys have a lot of notebook exposure. When you take a look at your financials, the way you report computing, I think this quarter you guys had 24% of sales, my understanding is that most of that is higher-margin higher value- added type of products but could you just kind of set the record straight?
Meera Rao: Sure. In Q1, the bulk of the revenue in computing is from storage, and as you pointed out, that's got a very good gross margin profile. Now we're seeing increasing revenue coming in from SSD where we expect to see revenue come in from notebook, shockwave-based notebooks in the second half of this year and that would be all incremental revenue to us that we haven't had in the past, and you've got to remember, it's the same technology that we develop to go out to the server market and the telecom market and this allows us a way to monetize that technology earlier and it also helps us that the same OEMs and ODMs are designing our products for notebooks are the same guys who have been designing these products for servers, and so this helps us to build up, to prove to them the viability of our product. So for us, the notebook market opportunity in Q3 is all upside and it is very positive for us.
Patrick Wang - Evercore Partners: Perfect. Thanks so much and congrats again.
Operator: The next question comes from Tore Svanberg from Stifel.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel Financial: Thank you and congratulations on the nice diversification. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about your visibility into Q2, either by order linearity, backlog, or even qualitatively talk a little bit of how you feel about the visibility for Q2?
Meera Rao: We saw very good order activity last quarter, except for a little bit of a slowdown in February around the Chinese New Year. We have seen that continue strong into April and I can certainly say setting where we are right now this looks so much better than the second half of last year.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel Financial: Very good. And you mentioned a new design win with a telecom customer. I assume that's above and beyond what you already have with a large networking customer. Can you elaborate a little bit more on the revenue potential from telecom?
Michael R. Hsing: This is just to give, we were just giving examples, and we have many design wins in the telecom side, and what size of the market – this is very new to us, we see this kind of design win in several places and so we try to establish what the market size is, we know that it's very big. So the first thing I tried to do, I went to our server room, look at how many traffic. We have six, seven of them -- like MPS size of the company, we have six, seven, (indiscernible) and what we are generating is either several hundred dollars per chassis and there is a lot more out there. So, you can see us in all these larger buildings, they always have a server extension. So we have with that incremental revenue as sort of roughly estimated a (indiscernible) volume.
Meera Rao: Sorry, just to add to that, what (indiscernible) for us is we're offering our customers a choice of either going for this high current module or these standalone solutions and we're finding that winning with both of them, and what you're seeing right now, we just chose to – we had talked about win as a networking company before, and in this case, we are talking more about how the standalone solutions are playing out, and this is just one win and one chassis and we see this proliferating into more different kinds of boxes at just this one telecom company. So I guess you'll be using it more to kind of highlight our successes, and I think as we go on, you're going to see a communications network in revenue going to be a more sizable portion of our business.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel Financial: Very good, and then a question on inventory, a good $2 million or $3 million this quarter, I mean is this pretty much, are you giving up for the stronger ramp in the second half, especially with BCD3 products of higher percentage?
Meera Rao: Yes, we are. We also started to ramp some of our newer products because we have seen a strong demand for those projected out in the second half and so we are kind of making sure that we have enough products available to service this market. For some of the traditional products, we usually go a certain amount by history, but from what we hear from our customers, we are expecting a sharper ramp and we just want to be prepared for those demand ramps.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel Financial: Very good. Just last question for Q2 growth, should we assume the growth to come from all of your end markets, even consumer, I'm thinking obviously it may come down as a percentage of revenue but it will be up in dollars terms?
Meera Rao: Yes, I expect this to come from consumer as well this quarter because seasonally Q2 and Q3 are the strongest quarters for consumer and we see an increase over there as well. The other market segments are going to do well, just as we've seen the new product design wins kick in or as the market share gains kick in.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel Financial: Very good, nice quarter, thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Vernon Essi from Needham and Company.
Vernon Essi - Needham and Company: Thank you for taking my question and I echo the congrats on the diversification efforts, these are great results. Wondering if we can just dive into a couple of point questions I guess on the product side, and Michael, you've talked a lot about this AC to DC EasyPower primary side solution, where are you seeing the success for that product right now, what is the end market that seems to be hitting, getting into a lot of hits, or is it sort of very diversified?
Michael R. Hsing: Yes, this market segment, we really provide the values of much higher efficiency, and in the sub 5 watts, there is no good solution in the market segment and it takes a lot of demand for that, especially some of the wireless, the micro-wireless, I call them the micro-wireless network, and like (indiscernible) and (indiscernible), these are buildings of the nations. So we have a product line that's called EasyPower and we design it into a many of these products segments. So, we see a lot of design win with a lot of revenue. And also, we also talked about the synchronous rectifier and that's geared towards the higher power, that's over 100 watt power. So I'm just using MPS solution where it saves 3%. 3%, that means 30% reduction in the energy losses. That's a huge amount. And we don't charge on (indiscernible) the customers that were replaced by a single discrete component and they will improve the efficiency by 30% and by the reduction of the losses by 30%. So, game consoles and also other computing systems, we see a lot of (indiscernible) activities and all going to pending to a revenue in the second half of the year.
Vernon Essi - Needham and Company: So, let me kind of just to sort of restate some of the points there I thought was interesting, so when you look at this market, you're seeing the most activity on both ends of the spectrum, under 5 watt, over 100 watt, it sounds like you're not terribly competitive or you're not strong offering sort of in the middle you do but it just seems like you're getting more attention on both ends of that.. Can you help us understand which area you think is going to add more dollars content or generate more revenue rather maybe over the next two years or so and where do you see the most growth?
Michael R. Hsing: Well MPS, as you said, it is not competitive in the middle end of the market, that's not true. MPS, we just focus on where we can deliver the best value for the smallest dollar amount or the biggest bid bet, and that's what we are really focused on now. So to answer your question, where is the growth with the dollar content, for our sub 5 watts, our dollar content in the modules are very, very high, and also over 100 watts, the semiconductor cost of the power supply which is very little, but in the MPS synchronous switcher, just improve the content, improve the efficiency by that much, so we will have about somewhere from $0.25 to $0.75 in each power supply for over 100 watts.
Vernon Essi - Needham and Company: Okay, and I assume that dollar content would be lower in the sub 5 watt category?
Michael R. Hsing: The dollar content, sorry I didn't answer your question, the dollar content is somewhere from $0.25 to $0.50, $0.60.
Vernon Essi - Needham and Company: And I'm sorry to go back to the original question but in the sub 5 watt, I'm just kind of curious because I think a lot of people think there's a lot of growth going on in these sort of sensor networks and what have you, where do you see the demand on that, is this a situation where you're just sort of supplying into a distribution partner and sort of not understanding perhaps where that's getting pulled or are there specific customers that have approached you, and if so, what specific kind of end markets do you see that at?
Michael R. Hsing: I think there's pulling from here, I can't recall more than (indiscernible). I think there are more than seven customers into different market segments, from power meters, from lighting LED, and also using the power product (indiscernible) the EasyPower product, and also white goods and other industrial segments, uninterrupted power supplies, and the building automation, and we see all of them.
Vernon Essi - Needham and Company: Okay, and let me put one quick follow-on question you've brought up a couple of times, you've talked about a console win. Is this a product that's ramping right now or is this sort of a second-half 2013 production ramp?
Michael R. Hsing: It is the second half of 2013.
Operator: The next question comes from Steven Smigie from Raymond James.
Steven Smigie - Raymond James: Great, thanks a lot, I'd like to add my congratulations as well. You saw a nice performance there in the storage business. Can you talk a little bit about how you see the profile of that going forward as that continue to ramp even into next year? I mean I'm sure it will be some more tied to certain platforms but can you talk a little bit about that, and then specifically I know you've got a wide variety of customers there, if you can update us of where you're seeing the demand from?
Meera Rao: About a third of our storage revenue right now is coming from SSD and we continue to see our SSD solutions being accepted by most players, and as I've explained before, we have three kinds of customers, we have the flash memory folks,, we have the integrators as well as the HDD players who are all in SSD and we continue to see us getting more sockets on them as we get on to more platforms with them. We're also increasing our product offerings in SSD. We also have new products that they are rolling out for HDD. So this is a market where we expect to continue to see revenue growth both this year and next year.
Michael R. Hsing: I should add on, I see a very optimistic market opportunity, particularly in the SSD side, and I really believe this is the beginning. The opportunity is huge and one of the Chinese Internet companies that released some report last year that they converted all or most of their HDD to SSD and the efficiency went up by huge amount, I forgot the numbers, and it was a very successful story. I think that most of the Internet companies will convert to SSD. So that opportunity is huge for MPS.
Steven Smigie - Raymond James: Okay, great. And then I just wanted to follow-up on the mini modules. It seems like you've got extreme opportunity there. It seems like it goes across a whole bunch of markets. So can you talk a little bit about how you sort of figured out which markets do you focus on and where you think you have the most opportunity there?
Michael R. Hsing: Obviously we're designing in the large networking companies, and now with the same technology, we are very excited about it and that applies to for our pharma consumer all the way to industrial. So we really have a product line for MPM.
Operator: The next question comes from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank: Congrats on another solid results, and guys, just a couple of follow-up questions on what's been asked already. Can you give us a little bit of a hierarchy ranking to gross margin by the end market segments that you have to help us figure out how to fold-in when the revenue growth from these product cycles occurs?
Meera Rao: Sure. Industrial has the best gross margins (indiscernible) as we would expect. Currently computing has the second best because the storage revenue has very high gross margin. I guess communications is the third. Going forward, as the new product revenues come in, I can't say whether computing or communications, which one will be second and which one will be third, and consumer of course will always be the lowest gross margin.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank: And does the computing side on the Shark Bay platform pull the computing down or up, how should we think about that dynamic?
Meera Rao: That will be at corporate margin.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank: Great. And then, the OpEx side of things, you guys have done a good job of controlling the OpEx while you're investing through this diversification period. How should we think about how OpEx will trend, especially with these product cycles taking off in the back half of the year?
Meera Rao: We will start investing in R&D as well as sales and marketing in the second half of the year. This is critical for us as we hit some of our historical ramp, our revenue the way we want to, into 2014 and 2015. So we will be investing in that growth in the second half.
Michael R. Hsing: Yes, I should say that in the prior earnings call, I emphasized that we don't invest in the sales and marketing, and now, in the middle of the year and after we've done all the transitions of how things ended up from their last year, we see a huge opportunity and all the doors are open, so we need to invest in, reinvest in R&D just a bit more.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank: Great, and the last question for me is just a bit of a housekeeping one. You had a patent litigation benefit in the first quarter. Does that repeat itself in the second quarter and then is that the end of it or is it already done?
Meera Rao: Yes. The last $400,000 that kicks-in in Q2 and then we're done with that particular one. We still have the O2 litigation open but we don't know the timing of when that money would come in.
Michael R. Hsing: But we have a potential it's still as a larger amount of money.
Operator: The next question comes from Lena Zhang from Baylock RV.
Lena Zhang - Baylock RV: You have commented a lot about end markets. If you could give us some Q1 performance and Q2 demand by region, that would be very helpful. Thank you.
Meera Rao: In Q1, we grew revenue in the three target markets that were critical for us, the ones that we have targeted for growth, communications, computing, and industrial. So we're very happy with the progress that we saw over there. And we even expect to see growth continue, we also expect to see consumer revenues kick-in in the second quarter.
Lena Zhang - Baylock RV: I'm sorry, probably I didn't speak clearly. Actually I would like to know about by region, by geography.
Meera Rao: From geography, Asia ends up being the factory for the world and we see most of our products irrespective of where they are designed in being manufactured over there. So I would say that the majority of our products will be manufactured in either China or Taiwan, and if you take up all of Asia together, I think it will be somewhere between 85% and 90% of our revenue.
Operator: The next question comes from Gus Richard from Piper Jaffray.
Gus Richard - Piper Jaffray: In your telecom opportunity with the large manufacturers, can you talk a little bit about what sort of end markets you're getting to, is it wireline communications, is it wireless base stations, can you give a little bit more color as to where you're starting off at that customer?
Meera Rao: You're asking about the one where we're designing in our Intelli-Phase as well as controllers?
Gus Richard - Piper Jaffray: Correct, and the modules, yes.
Meera Rao: Okay. The module is going into a wireless router and that's something we expect to begin production next quarter and we have got our first purchase order for that. And for the parts that are just Intelli-Phase and the controllers, that's going into switchboard chassis and that's something we also expect to start shipping into the second half of this year.
Gus Richard - Piper Jaffray: And when you say wireless router, is that an EDGE router or is that a Wi-Fi router?
Michael R. Hsing: No, it's not wireless, it's not a Wi-Fi router. It's more in the input structure.
Gus Richard - Piper Jaffray: Right, okay, I just wanted to make absolutely sure I was clear. Those were my questions, thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Vernon Essi from Needham and Company.
Vernon Essi - Needham and Company: Thanks for taking the follow-up here. I guess two topics I wanted to explore. First on your lighting, if we look at sort of your year-on-year numbers, they were down, and I won't overstate that, that's obviously I realize a small portion of your revenue, but you're probably winding down completely the CFL inverter contribution. What is this going to look like for 2013? Do you expect to have year-over-year growth or do you think it's going to be a closed call, and are you seeing enough demand out there in LED to kind of make a lift here?
Michael R. Hsing: This year LED lighting will grow, will grow substantially.
Meera Rao: So what you're seeing in the numbers there is backlighting going down and that's tied into the monitor business that we have in the notebook market, but you are seeing LED lighting go up and we expect, as Michael said, that LED lighting will continue to grow for us this year and next year.
Vernon Essi - Needham and Company: Just to help us frame that, I mean the percentage of backlighting as a proportion of that number for, let's say you closed out 2012 at, and I can't put that quickly enough, $25 million, how much of that was backlighting driven?
Meera Rao: In 2012?
Vernon Essi - Needham and Company: Yes.
Meera Rao: In 2012, it was about maybe $5 million.
Vernon Essi - Needham and Company: $5 million, okay, alright. And then, this is clearly another just a question I think everyone looks to me like I'm some nuisance, but Michael, what's happening to some of these legacy products that clearly you're deemphasizing, what's happening to the marketplace with the competitors, are you seeing really aggressive price activity or what seems to be the main tone if you will out there? Obviously I realize you're not focusing on getting standard (indiscernible) parts or what have you that are flowing by the weight side, but how has that environment been?
Michael R. Hsing: It's stabilized and I don't see the price going down. So, with MPS and BCD3 products, the CoolPower based on the BCD3 are very competitive in the market, and it's our choice to go from that segment or not, and now we have a bigger fish to catch now.
Vernon Essi - Needham and Company: Okay, but so if you were to look at the legacy part, it's in a state of somewhat atrophy just because you're not out there actively designing them or is this becoming more price (indiscernible)?
Michael R. Hsing: We do it, we do it actively depending on our existing position and a lot of BCD, the product line that we call, these are mini monsters and those type of things if you remember, and these are based on BCD2 product, and they do have those products that feel the price pressure and now we actively replace it with the CoolPower.
Operator: The next question comes from Steven Smigie from Raymond James.
Steven Smigie - Raymond James:  Thanks for the opportunity to ask some follow-ups. Just with regard to the BCD policy, BCD2, whatever you want to call it, will you use that still going forward for say some higher voltage applications, and keep BCD3, BCD4 more for just lower voltage with higher current applications or would you take the other BCD3, BCD4 also to higher voltage?
Michael R. Hsing: We do have the plan in the high-voltage, mostly in the industrial applications, automotive, and these are much price-sensitive, and also they require a very long qualification. And BCD2 products, they're doing well in those market segments. Not that many companies operate more than 36 volts DC to DC product. So we don't have to change that very quickly, although starting from this year, and even in the industrial and automotive product, we are designing the BCD3 now.
Steven Smigie - Raymond James: Okay, great, it was helpful. And then just on BCD4, how's the timing of that at this point?
Michael R. Hsing: I think the first product will be where we release first product in the next couple of months.
Steven Smigie - Raymond James: Okay, so if you just look at industrial, you had some decent percentage growth, obviously it's off kind of a small base. Is there room for that to double this year?
Michael R. Hsing: The industrial market?
Meera Rao: For the industrial?
Steven Smigie - Raymond James: Yes, because you have a lot of new, it seems like you have a lot of new products there, in AC/DC for example, and I know sometimes some of that stuff is slower to get traction to get some of the new products there, just wondering if there's potential for the industrial market to maybe double in the next…
Michael R. Hsing: I can't answer you directly, I mean whether the number will double or not, but industrial, the nature of that business is a lot of the small size of customers and we added together and whether their projects are going to kick in or not will be a bigger uncertainty but the bottom line is that this year they're going to be much better than the last year and we see that in 2014 too.
Meera Rao: So you saw that in Q1 we grew our industrial revenue and we expect it to grow again in Q2. You've seen a lot of design wins come in and start ramping up. So I expect that by the end of this year, we'll have very good growth, whether it's going to be double, that's the part I don't know. But cumulatively, it's going to be very good.
Steven Smigie - Raymond James: Great, fair enough. And last question is on LED lighting, not so much the backlight stuff but specific to the LED say for bulb replacement. It seems like your guys can go across a whole bunch of different markets. Do you think the primary market would be sort of a bulb replacement driver type solution in sort of like a household application or do you see it more opportunity in say something like LED lighting for cars, sort of like in the headlamps and the tail lights, et cetera, so what would you see as the biggest drivers across the end market?
Michael R. Hsing: We are more focused on the commercial lighting and that's including commercial, that being the buildings and the factories, and even airports and the nuclear stations, those are industrial applications. And also we have a line of a product for automotives and headlamps and tail lights and those kind of replacements, and not much left to focus on in the consumer lighting.
Operator: At this time, I am showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to the presenters for closing remarks.
Meera Rao: I'd like to remind all our listeners that we have our Analyst Day on June 6 at our headquarters in San Jose and we'd like to encourage you all to register at investorrelations@monolithicpower.com. Other than that, I'd like to thank you all for joining us on this call and look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Thanks. Bye-bye.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference for today. Again, thank you for your participation. You may all disconnect. Have a good day.

===== 2012 Q4  (2013-02-06 17:00:00) =====
Executives: Meera Rao - Chief Financial Officer Michael Hsing - Chief Executive Officer and Founder, MPS

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by. And welcome to the Monolithic Power Systems Incorporated Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2012 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we’ll conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be followed at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today’s conference may be recorded. It’s now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Meera Rao, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.
Meera Rao: Thank you. Good afternoon. And welcome to the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2012 Monolithic Power Systems conference call. Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS is with me on today’s call. In the course of today’s conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management’s current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q4 earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on March 12, 2012, and Form 10-Q filed on November 5, 2012, which are accessible through our website www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today’s call. We will be discussing operating expense, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4 2011, and 2012 releases, as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our website. I’d also like to remind you that today’s conference call is being webcast live over the internet and will be available for replay on our website for one year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. We would like to start this call by reviewing our business highlights for 2012, followed by fourth quarter operating results and finally, our expectations for the first quarter of 2013. We will then open up the call to your questions. Let’s start with the business highlights for the year. We are pleased to announce MPS revenue grew 8.8% to $213.8 million in 2012. Clearly, outperforming the analog industry which SIA estimates shrank 7.2%. Gross margin also expanded 120 basis points to 52.9% in 2012. Our non-GAAP operating income for the full year rose $9.4 million to $35.9 million in 2012. Non-GAAP net income grew from $0.71 per fully diluted share in 2011 to $0.93 per share in 2012. In 2012, we grew revenue in each of our targeted market segments, industrial, computing and communication. Industrial is up 93.2%, computing grew 36.4% and communications increased 13.5% compared with 2011. Clearly, we are executing according to our plan. We saw a strongest growth in industrial markets where sales increased $12.3 million to $25.6 million over the prior year. This performance was fueled by increased product sales for applications and smart meters and general industrials, as well as commercial LED lighting. We have seen significant design win activities in building automation, securities, appliances, environmental controls and automotive. All these design win activities will continue to translate into revenue growth in 2013 and 2014. In 2012, computing revenue grew $11.1 million to $41.5 million fueled by strong growth in storage. In two years we have been able to grow storage revenues to more than $25 million and we see tremendous new opportunities for growth in this market. More importantly, our industry-leading point of load products have gained wide acceptance in servers and Ultrabooks and are expected to generate significant revenue in 2013. Revenue in the communications and telecom market also grew $6.1 million in 2012 to $50.9 million, primarily reflecting market share gains. In 2011, we introduced our first power module and in 2012, we introduced additional ease-of-use power module products targeting high efficiency and self constrained applications in networking and other markets. These products have generated great interest from networking, as well as top tier customers in other market segments. Revenue from consumer markets declined $12.2 million in 2012 to $95.8 million due to large part to anemic market conditions in the second half of the year. The TV market in particular was impacted by weaker demand. Looking forward, additional CoolPower products are starting production. Most significantly, we introduced a family of high current switching battery charges targeted at power application such as mobile phones and tablets. Our BCD3 technology has allowed us to make very small competitive and high-performance switching battery chargers. Initial feedback is very encouraging and we are currently projecting production ramps in the second half of 2013. 2012 has been a great year for our technology development. We launched our next generation BCD4 process technology which represents as much as 50% dye size reduction from our BCD3 technology release just a year ago. Our BCD3 technology leads throughout competition and we believe that BCD4 will extend our lead even further. BCD4 will enable us to deliver the highest power density products in the semiconductor industry, greatly reducing system size and complexity. The first products target networking, servers and storage. Switching to Q4. Our fourth quarter revenue of $48.2 million was at the mid point of our guidance. Compared with Q3, revenue was down by $8.3 million or 14.7%. Q4 revenue increased approximately $750,000 or 1.6% from the fourth quarter of 2011. Our fourth quarter gross margin was 53%, compared with the 53.1% reported in the previous quarter and the 52.5% posted in the same quarter from a year ago. Our non-GAAP operating income of $8.3 million was lower than the $10.5 million reported in the prior quarter, but higher than the $5.5 million from the same quarter of the prior year. Q4 non-GAAP net income was $7.7 million or $0.21 per fully diluted share, compared with $0.27 per share in the previous quarter and $0.15 per share in the prior year. Let’s review our non-GAAP operating expenses. Excluding stock compensation, our non-GAAP operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2012 was $17.4 million, a reduction of $2.2 million from the $19.6 million we spent in the third quarter. This reduction was largely due to a $2.5 million legal judgment in our favor during the fourth quarter which we recorded as a benefit for litigation expenses. Moving on to our GAAP operating expenses -- GAAP operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $24.6 million in the fourth quarter, compared with $23.7 million in the third quarter. Since the only difference between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for these quarters is stock compensation expense, let’s take a look at the stock comp expense. Stock comp expense was $7.1 million in the fourth quarter, compared with $4.1 million in the prior quarter. As you know, MPS declared and paid a one-time special $1 per share dividend in December 2012 and equitable adjustment of vested stock options outstanding resulted in a $2.8 million stock comp charge in the fourth quarter. Switching to the bottom line. On a non-GAAP basis, our Q4 net income was $7.7 million or $0.21 per fully diluted share. This result is computed with an estimated tax rate of 7.5%. Q4 2012 GAAP net income was $248,000 or $0.01 per fully diluted share. On the topic of taxes, our GAAP tax rate in the last few years has been below 10%. However, our 2012 GAAP tax rate was 11.9%. Stock comp charges related to the special dividend that we mentioned earlier increased the 2012 tax rate by about 4% -- 4 percentage points. Now let’s look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $122.4 million at the end of 2012, down from the $197.3 million at the end of the prior quarter. This reduction in cash is attributable to the $35.7 million in special dividend that we paid in December 2012. We also spent $2.1 million on capital equipment. MPS generated operating cash flow of about $12 million in Q4 and cash proceeds from employee stock option exercises contributed another $1.2 million. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were down $15.5 million from the $187.9 million at the end of 2011, mainly due to the one-time special dividend of $35.7 million paid in December, 2012. We also spent about $21.2 million on capital equipment and headquarter building improvement. During the year, MPS generated $26.5 million in operating cash flow and $16.2 million from stock option exercises and ESPP purchases by employees. Accounts receivable ended the year at $19.4 million, compared with $21.6 million at the end of the prior quarter and $15.1 million at the end of 2011. Days of sales outstanding were up slightly 37 days in Q4 from 35 days in Q3 2012 and up from 29 days in Q4 2011. Our internal inventories by the end of the year were $32.1 million, slightly lower than the $32.6 million at the end of the prior quarter. Days of inventory on the other hand increased from 112 days at the end of Q3 to the 129 days at the end of Q4 in line with lower Q4 revenues. While days of inventory into distributor channels remain the same as the prior quarter, inventory in the channel declined in dollar value. We also observe that most of the decrease in the distributor inventory was in older product, while new product inventory increased.  I would now like to turn to outlook for the first quarter of 2013. Entering the first quarter, the CoolPower projects pushed out of Q4 have begun their production ramp. With the economy improving and design wins ramping, we’re seeing positive momentum in our business. Our revenue guidance is in the range of $49 million to $53 million. We expect gross margin to be in the range of 52.8% to 53.8%. We expect stock-based compensation expense to be in the range of $4.2 million to $4.7 million. In 2012, and 2013, we implemented pay-for-performance equity compensation program for our key employees. As a result, we are required under accounting rules to assess the probability of hitting the performance metrics on a quarterly basis. This will add volatility to stock comp compared to the physical straight line approach associated with time-based grants. We expect non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense to be in the range of $20 million to $21.5 million. This estimate excludes the stock-compensation estimate mentioned above. In conclusion, we are executing through our vision of growing MPS to $500 million company and evolving from a consumer-centric company to a diversified company targeting cloud computing, Internet appliances, industrial and automotive markets. We are at the beginning of a new era of growth and diversification. I’ll now open the microphone for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Patrick Wang with Evercore. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Patrick Wang - Evercore Partners: Very good guidance. Meera, my first question is this one, when we take a look at 2012, you guys grew the business -- overall business about 9% year-over-year and that’s been a pretty tough market. I’m just curious when you kind of look out over the next year or so. How do you see guys performing versus peers. So, I guess I’m curious how much out performance do you guys expect versus the overall analog group when you kind of look at it all in?
Meera Rao: So, we expect to, definitely expect to outperform the market and the extent we outperform the market, all depends upon the market conditions that we have in 2013. But we have a very strong mix of design wins that we have. We are diversifying into several new markets that we have not diversified into before. And I think this will give us very good momentum.
Michael Hsing: Patrick, if you look at our long-term model as I said it before, 2013 we will try to hit our target model. And that’s also given the macroeconomic conditions and if the market is really against us, I think the percentage difference will show that.
Patrick Wang - Evercore: Got you. Okay. That makes a lot of sense. And, you know, I apologize for drilling in the background. When I take a look at your end market, you guys have significant growth in industrial and computing, within computing, some high quality storage business. Can you talk about some of the product cycles we should look forward to, kind of, on the horizon. It sounds like you guys have got a lot of good stuff in the pipeline. If you could just kind of walk us through couple of the Q1 that would be helpful? Thanks.
Michael Hsing: Yeah. There are so many of them, not just mentioning the field. Storage continues to be strong in 2012 -- 2013 and ‘14 and also point-of-load for communications for servers and for Ultrabooks as Meera mentioned it in the script. We’ll generate a meaningful revenue in 2013.
Meera Rao: We’d also -- we’d like to grow in industrial. We are in various different sub-segment in the industrial market like LED lighting, general industrial meters. So we expect to grow in those as well. And battery chargers is a new area that we expect to have additional incremental revenue this year that we haven’t discussed in the past.
Michael Hsing:  Also, Patrick Wang talked about computing.
Meera Rao: Yeah computing, sorry.
Patrick Wang - Evercore Partners: Got you. Now I realized it. Last question, you had a push out last quarter from Q4 to Q1, a couple of million. Meera, you talked about that on the call. I’m kind of curious how much of that came through in the fourth quarter, how much more do you expect to get in the first quarter. Thanks.
Meera Rao: Some of the CoolPower production ramps that were pushed out of Q4 as we had said in the last call, we are seeing some of it come in this quarter. And we expect some of it to start next quarter. So, there is no change from what we had discussed in the last earnings call.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg with Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Evan Wang - Stifel Nicolaus: Yeah. Hi. This is Evan Wang calling in for Tore Svanberg. Thank you for taking my questions. You have mentioned in your prepared remarks that you are seeing good business momentum. I was wondering if you could add some color to that comment. Where are you seeing the indications and what are some of your customers saying and maybe what are your bookings trend in your distri channel is looking like?
Michael Hsing: We said, I think, in the last quarter. There are a few customers -- there are a couple of customers that push out orders to Q1. And we also say that, okay, we see a positive momentum for MPS in the business. So all our customers stayed push out to Q1 and the orders came in. And other business segments, we are new to the market and we see a huge amount of growth opportunity. And we see all the tailwinds, we feel the tailwinds now.
Meera Rao: Okay. Just to add to that, we have been hearing from our customers increased confidence in the fourth quarter and in the last few weeks we have seen a pickup in orders. We have seen higher resale, all of which support the feeling that the momentum is building.
Evan Wang - Stifel Nicolaus: Thank you. And for my follow-up question, you had mentioned earlier in your response to one of the questions that you would try to hit your target model in 2013. Would you also including your revenue growth in that hitting the target model. I understand that you have a long-term revenue target of $500 million. So given that 2012 from a macroeconomics perspective hasn’t been all that helpful. Do you see some catching up in 2013?
Michael Hsing: Of course, MPS is a business borne by the macroeconomic conditions. What I’m talking about, you can’t really absolutely talk about the numbers. What you said -- and yeah, of course, the revenue is included in the target model. And I think what I really mean is the percentage is different from the industrial growth to MPS growth.
Evan Wang - Stifel Nicolaus: Great. Thank you. 
Meera Rao: Yeah. We are not speaking to our growth rate number. I just want to make that clear. We just expect to be able to continue to outperform industry. If the market stays the same we will still outperform. If the market improves, we expect that could be sharper.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Steve Smigie - Raymond James: Great. Thanks a lot and good to hear that things are looking up a little bit nice guide for the March quarter. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about EasyPower. It seems like you had a fairly compelling solution there and can you talk a little bit about some color you might have had and because you’ve gone up against competition. And they looked at the size and the ability of your solution and told you why you -- like how would that bake off and go. And then specifically, can you still update us on what the market opportunity could be in 2013 and then what kind of growth did you see in 2014?
Michael Hsing: I think that EasyPower really at the beginning of the ramp. And we see a lot of application, building automation and also some of the infrastructures for environmental monitoring and those are widely accepted by our customers. And where we will see the revenues continue to grow and/or will start to grow in 2013 and continue to grow in 2014 as we call internal things became more and more popular.
Steve Smigie - Raymond James: Okay. Great. And then on your server power solutions, for Grantley have you seen anything that would suggest maybe how do all ramp starts more quickly for you or Grantley ramps starts more quickly for you than you might have thought. And it seems like there is some urgency or desire to push that forward to accept pull revenue forward for you a little bit or have you kind of already accounted for that in what you’ve told us?
Michael Hsing: I think that we have a lot of our design winning in the Haswell and in the Grantley Solutions. And we will see the revenue. We will see the strong revenue in 2013.
Meera Rao: On the Haswell Ultrabook front, we expect that to be bigger in the second half of the year because that’s when Haswell really ramped. But we’re already seeing some pre-production ramps now.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank: Hi. Thanks for letting me ask a question and congrats on the solid guide. Especially just looking at the first quarter guide, first and foremost, is there any large delta from an end market perspective and what you expect these segments to grow versus the 6% average at the midpoint of your guidance?
Meera Rao: In terms of with -- we will be able to kind of get very granular on this towards the end of the quarter. So, what I can see from the early signs right now I would say that I’d expect growth in all three of the market segments that they’re targeting -- communications, commuting and industrial.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank: Got it. And then a bit of housekeeping more than anything else, what should we think of as far as how OpEx growth versus revenue tax rate for the year and CapEx for the year?
Meera Rao: Sure. Let’s start with CapEx. We expect CapEx to be around the $20 million level. In terms of the tax rate, I would say, we still expect to be below $10 million. So, I’d say -- we usually say $5 million to $10 million. And the reason we kind of give that range is there are bunch of discrete items that we won’t know until as the year plays out, but right now we expect to be 5% to 10%. In terms of OpEx, a lot of it depends upon the market. If market conditions continue -- if our revenue continues to be at the level we are projecting now, we will keep our expenses down as much as we can. So, I would expect that we would have some increase in new product costs, while some additional cost for key hires in marketing and sales. So once, say, business were to go back to normal and we see normal cyclicality out there than we would see -- we’ve been holding down a lot of discretionary spending and we would see that increase. We would also start investing in the future and start hiring more sales and marketing people in particular.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Our next questioner in queue comes from the line of Cheng Cheng with Pacific Crest. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Cheng Cheng - Pacific Chrest: Thank you. So, maybe a first question on the charger product, you talked about kind of seeing revenues in the second half. I was wondering if you can give a little more color around maybe the quantity or the quality of customer wins you have there or how big the opportunity you think it is.
Michael Hsing: We see -- the consumer or the MPS was a consumer centered company. We -- in the last couple of years we would try to diversify from the consumer market segments. And although the revenues where we start to -- we see the growth in 2013 a bit more opportunistic and that’s not the segment where we’re really focused on.
Cheng Cheng - Pacific Chrest: Okay. And maybe if I’m just looking, you guys have a variety of different ramps and designs, just looking at the segments outside of consumer. I guess, which end market do feel most excited about in 2013, is that computing or…?
Michael Hsing: Meera talked about it earlier. The industrial growth was almost 100% in 2012, and we see the similar momentums. I don’t imply the similar percentage and over growing tremendously in the market segment. And also the computing, telecom, and these are all in the storage, these are all our opportunities.
Meera Rao: The three target markets that we have, we expect to be able to grow in all of them. Industrial, as you know, is typically slower just by the nature of that market, but we have design wins in various -- from various different customers that will ramp. Computing, clearly, we’ve got the Ultrabooks. We’ve got the storage that’s going to be driving it. Communications is also an area where we expect revenues -- incremental revenues from Telco. But that’s again a slightly slower market to ramp, but as we go out this year you will definitely see design ramps. I mean revenue ramps from all three segments.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gus Richard with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Gus Richard - Piper Jaffray: Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. On a little bit different tack here. Just curious what you are seeing in terms of wafer availability in terms of wafer pricing these days? Has it gotten better or worse or are the foundries tightening up at all sort of? How is that supply side of the equation working these days?
Meera Rao: In terms of availability, we don’t see any tightening out there. And if you remember as compared to 2010, we have a couple of different facts in our favor. One is that we have a smaller die size, which means we can get more wafers out of the two foundries that we have then. We also have a third foundry. So between that, we have higher wafer capacity and also remember that we are going into this upturn where the higher level of inventory that we had in prior upturns. And I think the combination of that we are not as concerned about the supply side of the equation right now.
Gus Richard - Piper Jaffray: And then just -- I may have missed it, but did you give the mix of BCD2 versus BCD3 at this point?
Meera Rao: I think we exited Q4 with about 40% of revenue was from BCD3, and we expect that to grow as we exit 2013 to maybe 60%, 70% level.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Lena Zhang with Baylock RV. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Lena Zhang - Baylock RV: Yeah. Thank you for taking my questions. I’m just kind of confused about your gross margin. In Q4, your revenue is down around the 15%ish and of course margin held pretty well, but look at your midpoint of Q1 revenue guidance and up sequentially but it’s much better than the seasonality. But gross margin guidance just seems a little bit weak, so would you please help me understand that?
Michael Hsing: Okay. Lena, this is not a precise point of index. Any small percentage of a change, we have a lot of factors in there. We can have a product mix and new product wins and so any small percent of a change like it’s a real business, not a real financial model.
Meera Rao: And then, I just want to add to Michael’s comment. We have this -- we are diversifying market and we are introducing new products that have better gross margin profiles. So what we are targeting is to see continued gross margin expansion and if you look at our guide for Q1, that’s what we are seeing. We have some revenue growth, but we also have an attendant gross margin expansion that we’re forecasting right now.
Lena Zhang - Baylock RV: Okay. Thanks. That’s all I have.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick Wang with Evercore Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Patrick Wang - Evercore Partners: Yeah. Thanks. I just want to follow-up one thing. Can you remind us what your long-term targets are? I think on revenues in terms of OpEx, I think as we kind of look ahead with all these product cycles and growth drivers, I just want to refresh on that? Thanks.
Meera Rao: Okay. The long-term business model that we’ve been talking about is the one that we announced back in July of 2010, when we were focusing on more high-volume market strategy, and while some of those elements might not be quite as applicable. The key point that we have is our operating margin. We want to be a company that has a high operating margin, and we are targeting about 25% to 30% earnings. But that’s our long-term model and we recognized that we have two levers that we can pull the revenue and gross margin. We want to continue to be a high growth stock, I mean high revenue growth company as well as having a very attractive gross margin.
Patrick Wang - Evercore Partners: Okay. Great. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Steve Smigie - Raymond James: Great. Thanks a lot. And I just wanted to follow-up on the earlier question on BCD3. So with regard to the penetration you are talking about, is that just on the parts where you want BCD3? I know you’re rolling out BCD4 similar for separate products, so just hoping you could talk a little bit about? Is that penetration that you’re talking about, it’s just on the parts you want and just give an update on where you’re on the BCD4? Thanks.
Michael Hsing: The BCD3 product at this time is really the industrial leader for power density, and all the parts that we released from our second half of -- from the beginning of the first half of last year’s, all the parts released were all based on BCD3. And now these are products that are hitting the market for across the board from telecom and computing and also the EasyPower product line. And so in the 2013, we’ll continue to grow. And as Meera said the percentage of production shift from the BCD2 to BCD3 where you see that exhibit to this year is probably more than 60%, 70%. And we released the BCD4 product, which is further up to about 50% of a shrink from a BCD3. And those products, initially we’re targeting for telecoms and some of the industrial servers use.
Meera Rao: Yeah. So, we would be rolling out those products on BCD4 this year, and I’m expecting revenue from them more in 2014.
Steve Smigie - Raymond James: Okay. Great. And then just on the margin, can you talk a little bit about what the gross margin might be in some of the newer products versus, say, some of the consumer stuff that you are focusing less on in and let’s just say in an environment where if the products been in production for little while and so you don’t have any ramping issues. What sort of differential would you expect in that mix?
Michael Hsing: For the gross margin side, all the market segments we targeted tend to have a higher margin. And so as we grow in the margin real growth, but at the same time we still have a large percentage of product revenue in the consumer segment. We still have to defend that. And so the, let’s say overall, going forward we do see a margin creep up but at this time we don’t give it -- it’s not the right time to give a long-term gross margin model now.
Steve Smigie - Raymond James: Okay. If I could just speak one more on storage, it’s obviously been pretty successful for you guys. What’s the product cycle for that product, does that run just through ‘13 and then you have to introduce something new in ‘14, or how does that play out?
Meera Rao: The pre-mix that we introduced for SSD, is just one of a series of family of products that we have. So we expect to be able to continue to play and expand our revenues in this market as we come out with new products. So we expect that cycle to extend beyond 2013.
Michael Hsing: And to answer your question more clearly, yeah, it is model dependent and we do have to an executing. The design cycle is about a year or so.
Steve Smigie - Raymond James: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot. I appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you, sir. And presenters, I’m showing no additional questions in the phone queue. I would like to turn the program back over to Meera Rao for any additional or closing remarks.
Meera Rao: We would like to thank you all for joining us on this call and look forward to talking to you again in April. Thanks and have a nice day.
Operator: Thank you, presenters. Again, ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today’s conference. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day. Attendees you may log off at this time.

===== 2012 Q3  (2012-11-01 00:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Monolithic Power Systems’ Third Quarter 2012 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today’s conference may be recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to today’s host, Meera Rao, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead. 
Meera Rao: Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to the third quarter 2012 Monolithic Power Systems conference call. Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS is with me on today’s call. In the course of today’s conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty. These statements will cover a number of areas concerning our business outlook, including our business and financial outlook for the fourth quarter of 2012, our expectation for fourth quarter litigation, stock-based compensation and GAAP and non-GAAP operating expense.
 Projected fourth quarter revenues and gross margins, our target operating ranges for gross margins and inventory, our expectation for revenue growth and gross margins beyond 2012, our expectations of revenue ramp from new product, our expectations of percentage of total revenue from various markets, our expected average tax rate for 2012, a belief regarding the outcome of a pending IRS project, our belief that MPS is well-positioned for future growth, the expected seasonality of our business, our expectation for future cost reductions and in-product introductions, potential customer acceptance of our products and opportunities these present and the prospects of diversification and expanding our market share.
 Forward-looking statements are not historical facts or guarantees of future performance or event and are based on current expectations, estimates, beliefs, assumptions, goals and objectives and involve significant known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by these statements.
 Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause the actual results to differ are identified in our SEC filings, including but not limited to, our Form 10-K filed on March 12, 2012 and 10-Q filed on July 30, 2012 which are accessible through our website, www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today’s call. We will be discussing operating expense, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis.
 These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release which we filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the Q1, Q2, and Q3 2011 and 2012 releases, as well as to their reconciling tables that are posted on our website.
 I’d also like to remind you that today’s conference call is being webcast live over the Internet and will be available for replay on our website for one year along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. 
 We would like to start this call by reviewing our third quarter financial summary, followed by our operating results and expectations for the fourth quarter of 2012. Michael Hsing will conclude with a discussion of our business conditions. We will then open up the call to your questions. Let’s start with our financial summary.
 The third quarter 2012 net revenue of $56.5 million was at the lower end of our guidance of $56 million to $60 million. Compared with Q2, revenue was down by $2.1 million  or 3.6%. Q3 revenue increased $3.5 million or 6.7% from the third quarter 2011. This is the third consecutive quarter of year over year growth in revenue. Despite the low revenue compared with the prior quarter, gross margin of 53.1% was similar to the 53.2% from the previous quarter.
 Gross margin was higher than the 52.5% in the same quarter from a year ago mostly due to an increase in new higher margin product revenue. Our non-GAAP operating income of $10.5 million was similar to the $10.6 million reported in the prior quarter and higher than the $8.4 million from the same quarter of the prior year. Non-GAAP net income was $9.9 million or $0.27 per fully diluted share compared with $0.28 per share in the previous quarter and $0.23 per share in the prior year.
 Moving to Q3 revenue by end market, computing sales increased to $10.8 million. Storage revenue showed strong growth despite softness in the PC and graphics card market. The macroeconomic slowdown was also noticeable in the consumer related space where the third quarter is typically stronger. Revenue from consumer market decreased from $26.2 million in the prior quarter to $26 million. Communication revenues of $12.8 million also declined from $14.1 million in the second quarter of 2012. These declines in PC, consumer and communications revenue from the prior quarter can be attributed to 2 reasons.
 First, lower industry-wide demand and two, some customers responding to the economic slowdown, by delaying rollout of new products that would have paid [ph] in our BCD3-based [indiscernible] products and replaced our BCD2-based products. While Industrial revenue of $6.9 million was lower by $1 million from the prior quarter, this was the second consecutive quarter where revenues from Industrial revenue were greater than 10% of total revenue. Year to date, revenue for 2012 grew $16.5 million or 11.1% from the same period a year ago.
 Next, moving on to the gross margin line, third quarter gross margin of 53.1% was similar to the 53.2% in the prior quarter, despite lower revenues mostly due to an increase in new higher margin product revenue. Gross margin was higher than the 52.5% in the same quarter from a year ago mostly due to an increase in new product revenue and higher overhead cost absorption.
 Let’s review our non-GAAP operating expenses. Excluding stock compensation, our non-GAAP operating expenses for the third quarter of 2012 were $19.6 million, a reduction of $1.1 million from the $20.7 million we spent in the prior quarter. Third quarter non-GAAP R&D and SG&A spending decreased $1.1 million from the prior quarter largely due to expense control. Both Q2 and Q3 included the benefit of $300,000 each quarter under an overall settlement and license agreement totaling $2 million.
 Non-GAAP operating expenses for Q3 2012 of $19.6 million was essentially flat with what we spent in the third quarter of 2011. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 18.6% in the third quarter of 2012 compared with 18.1% in the prior quarter and 15.9% in the third quarter of 2011. Moving on to our reported expenses and operating margin, our operating GAAP -- our GAAP operating expenses were $23.7 million in the third quarter compared to $24.4 million in the prior quarter and $22.8 million in the same quarter a year ago.
 Since the only difference between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for these quarters is stock compensation expense, let’s look at the stock compensation expense. The stock-comp expense was $4.1 million in the third quarter compared to $3.7 million in the prior quarter and $3.3 million in Q3 2011.
 Our GAAP operating profit was 11.2% in the third quarter of 2012, compared to a GAAP operating profit of 11.6% in the prior quarter and 9.5% in the third quarter of 2011. Switching to the bottom line, on a GAAP basis, our Q3 2012 net income was $5.9 million, or $0.16 per fully diluted share. On a non-GAAP basis, our Q3 2012 net income was $9.9 million, or $0.27 per fully diluted share. This result is computed with an estimated tax rate of 7.5%.
 We recorded a one-time settlement of $159,000 as other income in the second quarter. Fully diluted shares increased slightly from 36 million shares in the prior quarter to 36.4 million shares in the third quarter of 2012.
 Now, let’s look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $197.3 million at the end of the third quarter 2012, up from $196.4 million at the end of the prior quarter and $176.6 million we had on the book at the end of the third quarter 2011. In Q3, cash proceeds from employee stock option exercises and ESPP purchases were $5.7 million.
 MPS had offered in cash also for about $2.2 million mainly due to a reduction in current liability. We spent $2.6 million in the quarter, mainly on capital equipment and also on our headquarter building improvement.
 Accounts receivable ended the third quarter at $21.6 million compared with $21.4 million at the end of the prior quarter and $16.4 million at the end of the third quarter of 2011.
 The increase in accounts receivable from Q2 2012 was largely due to differences in timing of revenues between the 2 quarters.
 Days of sales outstanding were up to 35 days in Q3 2012 from 33 days in Q2, 2012 and up from 28 days in the Q3 2011. Our inventories at the end of the third quarter were $32.6 million or about 112 days of inventory on historical basis, which is just above our inventory model of 100 to 110 days. This compared with $29.5 million or 98 days of inventory at the end of the prior quarter.
 Inventory in our distribution channels was above the middle of the target range of 30 to 45 days.
 I would now like to turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2012. Our revenue guidance is in the range of $46 million to $50 million for the fourth quarter of 2012. We expect gross margin to be in the range of 52.5% to 53.5%. We expect stock-based compensation expense in the range of $4 million to 	$4.5 million. In 2012, we implemented pay-for-performance performance equity compensation program for our key employees.
 As a result, we are required under the accounting rules to adjust the probability of hitting the performance metrics on a quarterly basis. This will add volatility to stock-comp compared to the straight line approach associated with time-based grants. We expect non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense to be in the range of $19.5 million to $21 million. This estimate excludes the stock compensation estimate mentioned above. We expect to record a $2.5 million legal judgment as a benefit to fourth quarter litigation expense.
 I’ll now turn the call over to Michael Hsing, our CEO, for a discussion of the business condition. 
Michael Hsing: Thank you, Meera. Good afternoon to everyone. Now that you have heard the detailed financial results, I would like to talk about business highlight and the strategic directions. Despite the current economic challenges, we executed and delivered 11% year to date growth well above the market performance with 1.5% gross margin expansion. We have grown revenue in each of our targeted market segments, industrial cloud computing and communication in each quarter this year.
 Industrial is up 100% to $19.6 million, Computing including storage and the server up 43% to $31.2 million and communication up 14% to $38.7 million. These are significant events which set the foundation for our future growth. Like our peers we are experiencing significant weakness in market like the PCs and consumer- related products which account for significant proportion of our revenue. In particular, a majority of our customers delay their production ramp with our cool power product causing a slowdown in the second half of 2012.
 As you recall from the February 2012 earnings call, the cool power product based on BCD suite technology cost as much as 60% less than BCD 2 products. They are extremely price competitive in high volume markets. These products will recapture and expand or consumer-related market share. The cool power products were widely accepted and designed in by our customer only this year. The delay on the production ramp based on our recent survey is mostly due to current economic condition.
 And we were informed however by many of our customers that they plan to lend [ph] a cool power product in the first half of 2013. Notwithstanding the near term macroeconomic headwinds, we remain focused on our target markets. The computing and storage -- in the computing and storage space our Q3 design activity was stronger than ever. For example, after Intel pulled MPS solutions the [indiscernible] cloud server platform we spent a surge of design activity in both Tier 1 and up and coming server maintenance for large internet companies.
 As I mentioned at the past earnings call every percent of improvement in power convergence efficiency equals 3% to 4% in power savings for servers and data centers. This result in key reduction and a significant energy cost savings. Our BCD suite technology provides the highest power density solution combined with the lowest switching loss in the market. Our new Intelli phase products based on this technology can deliver highest efficiency in a most compact solution for server and the data centers.
 In Mobile, we won many designs in the shop based platforms as Tier 1 mobile makers with our point of a low products based on BCD suite technology. Additionally we won many new [indiscernible] designs with our low standby point of local products which we released prior quarters. These are the only product exceeding the Intel spec AOAC which stands for Always On, Always Connected. We expect these design wins will generate revenue starting in 2013.
 In our Storage segment, revenue continues to grow, our key mix released in Q2 for SSB application are expected to ramp in Q4. In automobile and industrial segment we continue to penetrate automobile market of products in the design win now kind of diverse application such as all lighting for passive and interiors. Ignition switches, power door, power window and infotainment system.
 During the third quarter we released the industrial thrust into fully integrated, high voltage, high current, high efficiency synchronized single chip solution which surpasses the performance of all existing display solutions. Because of these cutting edge products, we are growing substantially in this stable market. All AC/DC products including industrial lighting have generated meaningful revenue as of today. We expect a significant growth from this family in 2013.
 A couple of quarter ago we released Easy Power product family targeting control units and interface panels for small appliances which need a small amount of power from an AC power line ranging from a few tenths of a watt to a few watts. Example of these appliances are rice cooker, espresso machine, refrigerators, oven, low power iron, network systems for home automation such as Vware system, lighting controllers, temperature sensors, motion sensors, fire alarm systems et cetera. All of our competitor in solution today are too large, too complicated and too expensive.
 MPS with single chip solution solves all these problems. We have strong design activity to help our Easy Power product family in doing this. We expect revenue to raise in 2013. In high volume consumer related market, through the third quarter of this year, we have shipped over 20 million units of our cool power products to set top boxes, PD and other consumer related products. Because cool power products are extremely cost competitive and a better performance, we believe this product family will continue to recapture and gain an additional share in the market segment.
 As our customers run their new modules into production all business will grow in these segments. In the process of technology development front we are very excited to announce that we have launched our next generation BCD 4 office technology which represents as much as 50% downsize reduction from our BCD suite technology released just a year ago. Our BCD suite technology leads lots of competition and now BCD 4 will extend the lead even further.
 The first application targets are in networking servers storage where high efficiency converging and small size are valued the most by our customers. In conclusion, despite the current condition, MPS is evolving from a consumer centered company to a diversified company targeting cloud computing, internet appliances, industrial and automotive. The total revenue growth and changes in our revenue mix indicate clearly that we are executing our plan.
 The current slowdown in our revenue growth in the second half of 2012 was [indiscernible]. With the breadth of our newly released products and our strong pipeline MPS will accelerate its growth in 2013 and the coming years. Now, I will open the microphone for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Patrick Wang with Evercore Partners. 
Patrick Wang: Hey, I’m just kind of curious about one thing. Take a look at the way that you guided the fourth quarter, just use the midpoint there about 9% year to year growth. Which is well ahead of I think all [indiscernible]. Michael at the very end you said that you think that you’ve got a great pipeline here. It sounds like you have a lot of design activity and that you expect growth to accelerate into 2013. Do you think that based on what you’ve got today and obviously you're not giving guidance for out quarters, but do you feel like you going to be able to deliver 9% to 12% growth next year, year over year? 
Michael Hsing: I only can speak of today. Even with today’s economic condition I will expect that next year we’ll continue to grow and especially on the newly released product from last 4 months. The total revenue will grow as in today. 
Patrick Wang: Okay, got you. And then on the fourth quarter guidance it was especially lower than what most of you had thought, sounds like you got some push outs from fourth quarter into the first half of next year on cool power, can you help us quantify perhaps how much of that business has been pushed out? It didn’t sound like seen any design loses but it’s just customers holding on to bills but can you help us understand the size of that? 
Michael Hsing: Yes, obviously was down by -- some of the -- in the seasonality and which we don’t talk about anymore, we don’t know exactly what is the seasonality anymore, but into some of that is still related. And other one’s I could -- as you know because of shortage in the past years and like 2010 and still affected our current growth which either products are all BCD 2 products and I think last year and end of last year we start to designing BCD suite products, cool power product and some of them to change the existing BCD 2 and also expand in the market share.
 So the combination with gain and losses and -- or gain and the main slow down on all the products and that you can’t exactly quantify although we try to and -- so you can -- using the past seasonality Q4 is about 5% to 10% down and now this year about 14% to 15% and so extra percent or $4 million or $5 million due to the push out, so that’s best I can to my knowledge I can say. 
Patrick Wang: Okay, so based on Q3 it $4 million or $5 million that is being pushed out mostly into Q1 and maybe some into Q2 of next year, right. 
Michael Hsing: Yes, that’s correct. 
Patrick Wang: Okay, got you. And then just last one and I jump back in queue. You’ve got a lot of new design activity, lots of cool power cycle here, how much of your revenue -- just to help us understand in terms of fourth quarter are from your new designs and how much do you think you expect to see in the first half of next year? 
Meera Rao: Right now about 30% of our revenue is coming in from all the new products that we have had designed in, so as we draw to next year as more of our new design or new product design grant, we expect to see a higher share as we go into next year. 
Patrick Wang: Okay and then just last one. I know the seasonality is changing but particularly what are you seeing in the first quarter? 
Meera Rao: For seasonality? 
Patrick Wang: Seasonality, yes. 
Michael Hsing: We don’t know. This year’s seasonality, this year -- okay, Q1 we had a -- we had a growth from the last year and this year and few of our -- more than a few of our customers said that all these projects are pushed out to Q1 and that implies we’ll have a good first quarter, so this -- at least our customer [indiscernible] and the real situation we still can see that very clearly now. 
Patrick Wang: Okay, than from a customer standpoint it feels like you are at the bottom here in the fourth quarter. 
Michael Hsing: That’s how we see it now, yes. 
Operator: Our next question in queue comes from the line of Aaron Matthew with Megamaid Company. 
Unknown Analyst: Thank you very much, I was wondering -- I guess both Michael and Meera if you could elaborate a little bit more on the gross margin and given your guide it seems like you are getting a little bit of positive variance, probably due to some newer product that is you’re -- I guess what I’m trying to understand is you are getting 30% of that from newer products. Is it possible we could be seeing a lot more gross margin life into next year if that continues to grow? And then it sounds like -- in response to the last question you are just sort of working out maybe a sub-par growth year for you, are you possibly going to be getting more gross margin content next year versus revenue growth and are you trading that off in your business module right now? 
Michael Hsing: Well it is okay, let me say first and then I will pass it to Meera. From Q3 to Q4 is a significant revenue of a less than -- revenue less than in Q3 so that gross margin stays about similar, so it’s clearly on, it’s a new product in the revenue stream now and -- but we stayed our allowance and gross margins and we don’t see any headwinds to move the margin upwards and we don’t do long term forecast. 
Meera Rao: Just to add to that. As we’ve gone on into Q3 and Q4 we see both revenue coming in from newer products which have higher margins, we also see that in fact as our customers move from BCD 2 product to the BCD 3 product which has beneficial impact on our gross margin and we expect both of these structures to continue to play out into next year and just to reaffirm what Michael said, our gross margin module has been 50% to 55% and while we don’t expect any headwinds at this point we are not planning to revise that guidance. 
Unknown Analyst: And just so I understand, you -- how should I say this, pruning product lines right now or possibly doing that or are you sort in a situation where you are happy to have revenue even if it’s at sub-par margin at this point. 
Michael Hsing: We don’t know what the -- the reason we don’t revise the long term gross margin module is that there are a couple of components -- okay, couple of reasons. First, we don’t know what the economic conditions are and if it sometimes in the last -- particularly this year, from the beginning of this year, it looking everything good but now it’s not so good and the key is -- the key point is we want below the revenue and so when the down times we were using pricing to grow the revenue slightly and to stabilize the revenue growth and when the new products we ramp then we will not concentrate on the consumer related product market segment.
 So the growth is that it was very important for MPS. 
Unknown Analyst: Okay and just a quick question, maybe you said it in your prepared comments but what’s the proportion of LED revenue you had in the quarter approximately? 
Meera Rao: Are you talking about D2 to D2 lighting versus LED lighting or are you talking about the LED lighting segment? 
Unknown Analyst: Just both, I mean obviously you have to break out a part of it, but what what proportion is LED? 
Meera Rao: LED lighting revenue right now is in a low single millions and this is one that’s growing and we are expecting it to grow next year based on design wins. 
Michael Hsing: Some of the product also pushed especially for the Europe and in Asia markets. 
Unknown Analyst: Okay, so the majority of you lighting controls revenue is the way to look at that. 
Michael Hsing: Yes. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie with Raymond James. 
J. Steven Smigie: Can you talk a little bit about how big your SSD business is at this point? 
Meera Rao: SSD business has been growing very well. It’s about 1/3 of our overall storage revenue and storage is a bigger part of our computing revenue. 
Michael Hsing: What's the percentage? I think 10% -- slightly less than 10% of total revenue for storage. 
J. Steven Smigie: Okay, with regard to your computing product that you are focused on currently, can you get products and address it also to ARM based solutions. I realize for you intel -- revenue [indiscernible] because it started from nothing, but could you also use that for ARM [indiscernible] since your out there and do that. 
Michael Hsing: Your question is user currently for ARM based? 
J. Steven Smigie: Your computing solution that you have targeted at grant [indiscernible]. Could you also use it in power architecture, I know that’s Intel specification but can you use basically that similar setup and try to go after ARM processes where it starts to show up in the books. 
Michael Hsing: Absolutely in BCD 3 and the BCD 4 technology install that kind of application and a web developer single chip solutions for ARM based single chip solutions for determining power to ARM based processor. 
J. Steven Smigie: Okay, good. And then with regard to DC to DC Easy Power business, can you talk a little bit about what kind of growth you could sort of downward levels think you can maybe achieve in that 2013? 
Michael Hsing: Downward levels, I think there will be a high single digit, a mid to high single digit a million  dollars in the Easy power. 
J. Steven Smigie: With regards to the SG&A expense I obviously all of this adjustment you had this year, how should we be thinking about OpEx SG&A as we go to 2013, is that -- should we model that back down or it sort of pop up and you have to account for that or how should we be thinking about OpEx. 
Meera Rao: Clearly in Q3 and in Q4, we are holding down our OpEx expenses by taking down some of the variable cost and this is in line with revenues being lower, so to the extent that this low demand scenario continues into a portion of 2013, we’ll continue to exercise the same kind of expense control but once we see normal market we will continue to invest in our future. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. 
Unknown Analyst: Hi guys, this is Beas Mitchell sitting in for Ross, I just had a few housekeeping questions, my line dropped off so I may have missed some of this stuff. Can you just give us the CapEx guidance, the general inventory in dollars, cash from operations and the CapEx sum of these? 
Meera Rao: Sure, our inventory level was about $32.6 million which was about 112 days of inventory this in internal. Inventory in the channel was in our range of 30 to 45 days, but about the middle of the range. What was the other one that you wanted? 
Unknown Analyst: And just in the channel inventory and dollars if you had any color on that? 
Meera Rao: We had kind of projected this last quarter that our inventory levels were going to be higher. And as the result of key functions, we had -- our inventory levels were running well below our target model, our target model is a 100 to 110 days. So back in Q1 and Q2 when we were closer to 80 days, we had started ramping up our inventory, some of which is also in connection with the new products ramps that we foresee. 
Unknown Analyst: Got it. And then what was your tax rate guidance for the next quarter? 
Meera Rao: Our tax rate guidance continues to be between 5% and 10%. 
Unknown Analyst: Okay. And then just the cash from operations in this quarter as well as the CapEx number, I believe, it was $2.9 million, but I just want to make sure? 
Meera Rao: And just one second. Our CapEx for the quarter was about $2.6 million. Operating cash wise, we had a cash outflow of about $2.2 million and that’s because we paid down some current liabilities that we had on the book. 
Unknown Analyst: Got it. And then lastly, just on the revenue guidance, if you could provide some color on what kind of -- is it coming -- the decline is coming more from DC or lighting controls? That will be helpful. 
Meera Rao: From both. As Michael said, we’ve seen some of the demand slowdown for 2 reasons, one is the general economic condition and the second is as customers have responded to the general economic condition by pushing out some of the production ramps of the peer products based on our BCD3 products. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel Nicolaus. 
Unknown Analyst: Hi, this is Kevin Winning for Tore Svanberg. Thank you for taking the questions. I would like to start with your inventory level. You’ve actually been operating at below your target model of a 100 to 110 days for a quite a number of quarters. So, as you say about the fourth quarter revenue, that is transitory, do you expect your inventory to go back to below your target model, where would you be seeing that going forward? 
Meera Rao: I think for the near-term, it’s going to stay at this level, because even though a little higher as you ramp up for the new product revenue ramp. 
Michael Hsing: The demand of new -- new product increases, I want inventory typically well increase some and so the difficulty -- is the existing products and we are changing -- we are switching from older product to newer product which has better cost efficiency. And so, the demand is on a best stand, we will stock up more inventory. So, as Meera said, the inventory will go in the same level of slightly high. 
Unknown Analyst: I see. And when you talked earlier about your SSD product and you are ramping in the fourth quarter of 2012 and maybe into first quarter of 2013, can you just given an idea of how much grant -- how much of -- how much of it you might start seeing in the fourth quarter versus the first quarter? 
Michael Hsing: We don’t forecast in more than a quarter, say, and then we don’t forecast a particular product, but I can tell and I can tell you, and SSD is a growing market and we have a lot of demand actually. And now, 1/3 of our storage revenue which again -- with the sort of storage, 9%, 11%, 12%. 
Meera Rao: It’s positive at, I’ll say, 15%. 
Michael Hsing: Storage at 15%. 
Meera Rao: Yes, so about 5% of our revenues is from SSD. 
Michael Hsing: Okay. 
Meera Rao: And the other piece number, the SSD have been talking about the last year quarters, we are going to start shipping that product out this quarter, and we expect revenues from the PEMEC to start ramping out in Q1 and the quarters beyond. 
Unknown Analyst: Maybe another -- last question is, do you see orders be ramping near the end of the quarter or rather the weakness shifting throughout the quarter? 
Meera Rao: I think the growth is, we release the product -- we have our first product in early 2011 or late 2010, I don’t remember really, but now we are at about 10% -- 10% is -- it’s about a $10 million business and so it is not explosive growth. So we have a majority of design activities out there. 
Unknown Analyst: Okay, great. Well, let me change gears quickly here and ask you a little of the high level question. Year-to-date, can you talk about how many new products you’ve released and maybe what percentage of these products are now ramping or about to ramp in revenue? 
Michael Hsing: We don’t have any -- as in the past earnings calls, we have a capability of develop -- selling new products. And this year -- so I don’t have exactly written the numbers, but we are on track. And each of our products have -- our products, in -- from a released revenue and generally, it’s a meaningful revenue it takes about 18 to 24 months. And some product will -- little faster, other ones were somewhat worse and it depends on the market segment. So it does -- do I answer your...? 
Unknown Analyst: Oh yes, oh yes. I’d just like to dig a little deeper here and ask if you’re seeing the revenue -- incremental revenues from these new products more concentrated in a smaller number or do you find it to be very well spread out across all your new products? 
Michael Hsing: Well, obviously is very spread out, and I can -- in the industry long-term, as I mentioned we grow quite a bit -- we grow the 100%. And so that industrial rhythm itself is very -- have a very big, broad applications and then you go down to a smaller with automotives. It takes 36 months to 48 months to generate any revenues. And the other ones referred fall -- falling in between, like storage, notebooks, ultrabooks and I’d say networking system, networking and also the industrial lighting. 
Meera Rao: Also, Adam, one of our goals had been to diversify our revenue, and particularly to grow revenues in focus market. So you can see some of that already in our revenue year-to-date or do we expect this to play out even next year. So we have introduced products in a lot of different markets and via team design wins that are going to translate into revenue. So it’s not going to be in just one area. I mean, just now we planned it, and we expect to see it across a broader range of markets. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Cheng-Cheng with Pacific Crest Securities. 
Cheng Cheng: Quick question on Q4 guidance. I know it’s impacted heavily. Was wondering if, are you seeing anything on customer inventory front? Is there any movement there that’s affecting Q4 guidance or if you are expecting you are done packing in future quarters as well? 
Michael Hsing: I think the demand just slow down. And they may have some inventory in our customer end. And also, the loss of good story for us is that a new project they delayed; they pushed up. So in -- so the combination of the delay -- the demand and also delayed their ramp and it’s affected us. 
Cheng Cheng: Okay. And maybe just thinking in terms of end markets relative to -- in terms of relative strength, should we think about -- you talked about continuing consumer push-out. Is that the end markets we shipping to have been the retails in Q4? 
Meera Rao: I think in Q4 it’s pretty much the weakness or strongness in consumer and other high volume markets like that in PCs. That’s where we are seeing the bulk of the weakness. We also see some weakness in other markets such as overall the demand. But it’s more amplified I guess in the high volume consumer market because of customer delay in rolling out our DC/DC based full power family products. 
Operator: Our final question will come from Lena Zhang with Blaylock RV. 
Liwen Zhang: And first one is on your top line, the Q3 revenue came in at the low end of your guidance. Would you mind to give us a little bit more detail, see which end market came below your expectation? 
Meera Rao: Sure. I think it’d be consumer and consumer-like markets that came in lower, again, what it would have taken us to hit the midpoint of our guidance. 
Liwen Zhang: Okay. And the next one is just a follow up on inventory. And given the weak macro situation and also your new products being squished out by your customers, but I -- if I remember correctly you mentioned that you probably will continue to build up your inventory. Is this because you have an obligation with your foundry partners to take a minimal amount of inventory per quarter? 
Michael Hsing: Let me correct you, okay? We have a total introduction; we have over 400 products and a high percentage in -- 43% related to consumer-related products. And it’s a high percentage of products in the consumer-related segments. And some of the -- in those segments, some of the new products were pushed out. Not all the product push out. All the product in the networking and industrial lighting, automotive industrials and accessories, notebook, ultrabook, all these are in the servers; all these are -- they are not pushing out. And these are progressing really well. Okay, that’s the message I wanted to make it very clear.
 Audit inventories, I said we would stay in the same level or slightly higher because all the new products are ramping, including the DC/DC cool power product family. And as our -- many our customer indicated they were ramping in the first half of 2013. So we better have a these products ready. 
Meera Rao: And just to add to that, we don’t have any minimum wafer-out requirements from -- with our foundry partners, so none of this is because we are forced to meet any minimum purchase requirement. 
Liwen Zhang: Okay, thank you. And then my last one is regarding BCD 3 transitioning to BCD 4. Because you are going now BCD 3 -- transitioning to BCD 3 some of them are slowed down by some of the customers. So when should we expect the starting point of BCD 3 transitioning to BCD 4? 
Michael Hsing: Well, I think -- then let me clarify it, okay? We are transitioning from BCD 2 to BCD 3, and as Meera said, about a 1/3 of our products is based on BCD 3. And BCD 4, during the split in the process development front and that technology which is released. And the new product we will release starting the first half of next year. So if you answer your questions correctly it should be -- the transition will be in the 2014 or 2015 from BCD 3 to BCD 4. 
Meera Rao: Just to clarify, we use BCD 3 both to kind of come out with new products which took advantage of high density power features to go after a newer market in servers, in network, as well as storage. We also use BCD 3 in the high volume market to cannibalize our own BCD 2 products. This is to give us a cost advantage to continue to play in the market. But when we go to BCD 4, our plan initially is to use BCD 4 just to take advantage of even higher power density to go after high value market opportunity. For the plan with BCD 4, at least initially is not to use it in the consumer space. So there is no question of transitioning from BCD 3 to BCD 4. We’ll be using BCD 3 or BCD 4, depending upon the characteristics we need to go after the markets we are targeting. 
Operator: And again, that does conclude our time for questions. I would like to turn the program back over to management for any additional or closing remark. 
Meera Rao: We appreciate your joining us on this call and look forward to talking to you again in February next year. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you, ma’am. Again, ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today’s conference. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day. You may now all disconnect.

===== 2012 Q2  (2012-07-30 00:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Monolithic Power Systems’ second quarter 2012 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call may be recorded.
 I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Meera Rao, CFO. Ma'am you may begin. 
Meera Rao: Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to the second quarter 2012 Monolithic Power Systems’ conference call. Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS is with me on today’s call.
 In the course of today’s conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty. These statements will cover a number of areas concerning our business outlook, including our business and financial outlook for the third quarter of 2012, our expectations for third quarter litigation, stock-based compensation and GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses, projected third quarter revenues and gross margins, our target operating ranges for gross margins and inventory, our expectation for revenue growth and gross margin beyond Q3 2012, our expected average tax rate for 2012, our belief regarding the outcome of a pending IRS audit, our belief that MPS is well positioned for future growth, the expected seasonality of our business, our expectation for future cost reductions and new product introduction, potential customer acceptance of our products and the opportunities these present and the prospects of diversification and expanding our market share.
 Forward-looking statements are not historical facts or guarantees of future performance or events, and are based on current expectations, estimates, beliefs, assumptions, goals and objectives, and involve significant known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by these statements.
 Risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in our SEC filings, including but not limited to our Form 10-K filed on March 12, 2012, and Form 10-Q, filed on May 08, 2012, which is accessible through our website www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today’s call.
 We will be discussing operating expense, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
 A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the Q1 2011, Q2, 2011, Q1, 2012 and Q2, 2012 releases as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our website.
 I would also like to remind you that today’s conference call is being webcast live over the Internet, and will be available for replay on our website for one year along with the earnings release filed with SEC earlier today.
 We would like to start this call by reviewing our second quarter highlights. Following this update, we will discuss the operating results. We will conclude by discussing our expectations for the third fiscal quarter of 2012. We will then open up the call to your questions.
 Let’s start with the financial highlights. The second quarter 2012 net revenue of $58.6 million was above the midpoint of our guidance range. Q2 revenue increased $8.1 million or 16.1% from the prior quarter and MPS revenues increased in all end market. Q2 revenue also increased $7 million or 13.5% from the second quarter of the prior year.
 MPS saw the strongest growth both in dollars and as a percent of revenue in the industrial market. For the first time, revenues from industrial markets crossed 10% of revenues. Industrial revenues were 14% of revenues in the second quarter.
 Second quarter gross margin rose to 53.2% compared to gross margin of 52.3% in the prior quarter and 51.4% in the same quarter a year ago. Bottom line, non-GAAP net income was $10.1 million or $0.28 per fully diluted share.
 Turning to the business highlights, in the computing and storage space, we had multiple design wins with industry leading, integrated power products on the [Sharkey] notebook platform. Not only does this reduce our customer solution costs, it also increases the notebook battery’s life. In addition, MPS has also sampled parts for the Sharkey ultrabook platform that meets Intel’s low power requirement.
 Last quarter, we mentioned Intel’s validation of MPS’ core power Grantley server solution. We now have also been accepted by several Tier 1 server customers for a point-of-node power solution ranging from 4-amp to 20-amps.
 In the storage market, our SS EPA has been widely adopted since its introduction last quarter. In the industrial and automotive market we have expanded our presence in security, smart meters and automotive markets. Our battery charger design win in industrial measurement application further extended our footprint in the industrial space beyond DC to DC.
 In the AC/DC markets our new Easy Power product family has been widely accepted by customers in the so called Internet of Sync space like smart power grid, environmental controls and building automation. This Easy Power product family is based on a proprietary high voltage technology which provides unique simple cost effective solutions for the Internet of Sync and creates a significant barrier to entry for our competitors.
 Moving to the profit and loss statement. Looking at our revenue by end market, all four end markets enjoyed revenue growth compared to the prior quarter. Second quarter industrial and automotive revenue grew by $3.2 million to $7.9 million compared to $4.7 million in the prior quarter. Industrial and automotive sales growth was fueled by lighting, security, industrial meters and automotive applications.
 Consumer sales increased $2.3 million quarter-over-quarter to $26.2 million in the second quarter of 2012, largely due to continued growth in set-top box and general purpose consumer sales. Communications revenue grew $1.8 million to $14.3 million in the second quarter of 2012. Sales to Gateway systems drove the increase in the communication market. Computing sales increased to $10.2 million in Q2, 2012 mainly due to growth from graphics cards and storage applications.
 Let’s move down to the gross margin line. Our second quarter gross margin increased to 53.2% from the 52.3% in the prior quarter, largely due to favorable product mix and overhead absorption. Second quarter gross margin was also up from the 51.4% reported in the same quarter a year ago.
 Let’s review our non-GAAP operating expenses; excluding stock compensation, our non-GAAP operating expenses for the second quarter of 2012 were $20.7 million, up $700,000 from the $20 million we spent in the prior quarter. Second quarter non-GAAP R&D and SG&A spending increased $1.1 million from the prior quarter mainly due to higher R&D spending in support of our new product initiative.
 This increase was partially offset by about $400,000 lower litigation expenses in the second quarter, both quarters of 2012 included the benefit of $300,000 each quarter under a Settlement and License Agreement of $2 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses for Q2 2012 were $1.7 million from the $18.9 million we spent in the second quarter of 2011.
 The increase year-over-year was primarily driven by sales and marketing hired, commissions on higher sales and higher R&D spending in support of new product initiatives. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 18.1% in the second quarter of 2012 compared with 12.9% in the prior quarter and 14.9% in the second quarter of 2011.
 Moving on to our reported expenses and operating margins, our GAAP operating expenses were $24.4 million in the second quarter compared to $23.2 million in the prior quarter and $22.5 million in the same quarter a year ago. Since the only difference between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for these quarters is stock compensation expense.
 Let's look at the stock compensation expense. The stock comp expense was $3.8 million in the second quarter compared to $3.3 million in the prior quarter and $3.7 million in Q2 2011. Our GAAP operating profit was 11.6% in the second quarter of 2012 compared to our GAAP operating profit of 6.3% in the prior quarter and 7.8% in the second quarter of 2011.
 Switching to the bottom line, on a GAAP basis our Q2 2012 net income was $6.6 million or $0.18 for fully diluted shares. On a non-GAAP basis our Q2 2012 net income was $10.1 million or $0.28 for fully diluted shares. This result is computed with an estimated tax rate of 7.5%. We recorded a one-time settlement of $169,000 as other income in the second quarter.
 Fully diluted shares increased slightly from 35.5 million shares in the prior quarter to 36 million shares in the second quarter of 2012. Now let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $196.4 million at the end of the second quarter of 2012, up from the $194.6 million at the end of the prior quarter and $180.5 million we had on the books at the end of the second quarter 2011.
 In Q2 MPS had operating cash flow of about $8.9 million and cash proceeds of $3.4 million from employee option exercises. We spent $10.4 million in the quarter mainly on capital equipment and also on our headquarter building improvement.
 Accounts receivables ended the second quarter at $21.4 million compared with $19.9 million at the end of the prior quarter and $17.6 million at the end of the second quarter of 2011. The increase in accounts receivables from Q1 2012 was largely due to higher revenues in the second quarter.
 Days of sales outstanding were down to 33 days in Q2 2012, from 36 days in Q1 2012, and up from 31 days in Q2 2011. Our internal inventories at the end of the second quarter were $29.5 million or about 98 days of inventory on a historical basis which is just below our inventory model of 100 days to 110 days. This compares with $21.5 million or 81 days of inventory at the end of the prior quarter. Inventory in our distribution channel was about the middle of the target range of 30 days to 45 days.
 Let's turn to a discussion of general business condition. While our design win cycle continues to be robust and we believe that we've maintained our recent market share gains. We saw resales and order momentum start to slowdown particularly in the second half of June. The industry wide slowdown is most noticeable in the consumer space but projected demand is down in what would otherwise be a strong quarter for the consumer market.
 I would now like to turn to outlook for the third quarter of 2012. Our revenue guidance is in the range of $56 million to $60 million for the third quarter of 2012. We expect gross margin to be in the range similar to the second quarter. We expect stock based compensation expense in the range of $4 million to $4.5 million.
 In 2012, we implemented pay-for-performance equity compensation program for our key employees. As a result, we are required under the accounting rules to assess the probability of hitting the performance metrics on a quarterly basis. This will add volatility to stock comps compared to the typical straight line approach associated with time based grants.
 We expect non-GAAP; R&D and the SG&A expense to be in the range of $20 million to $21.5 million. This estimate excludes the stock compensation estimate mentioned above. In conclusion, we are well positioned with new product revenue ramping in multiple market segments. At the same time, we will closely monitor the macro economic conditions and control expenses during the slowdown.
 Our goal is to exit the slowdown stronger and better positioned for success in 2013 and beyond. I will now open the microphone for questions. 
Operator: [Operations Instructions] Our first question comes from Steve Smigie from Raymond James. 
J. Steven Smigie: I know obviously the macro is a little bit soft here, so I understand the flat guidance. Can you help me understand the implications of that for the December since we didn’t see the seasonality in September? Does that mean you are also likely to not see the negative seasonality in December so could that be potentially flattish I know you can typically kind of low quarter but since unusual quarter? 
Meera Rao: Our seasonality in the last two or three years has been not reflective of what we consider a normal seasonality, so Q4 is a hard one to call because I don’t know what the macro conditions are going to be in Q4, but when I say we do expect that on some of the  newer product revenue stream we might see some early revenues in Q4 all-in-all how the different trends are going to play off we don’t know at this point. 
J. Steven Smigie: If you could talk a little bit about your graphics and storage products I think in some of the products we are to see some earlier ramps relative to some of the others how meaningful that could be in September and back half of the year and so the profile how should we think about that into next year? 
Michael Hsing: Echoing back Meera now just said it, and we see that Q3 was a very optimistic and until the third week of June. And suddenly all there are slowdown, some of the stuff even pushed out but as I said in the last conference call, in the future revenues, and that particularly in the second half of 2012, because we have all these designing activity should hit the inner revenue stream. So we have we mentioned as key market we have the HDV market and in some of the industrial and offline EV power product lines, they all are going to show some early revenue in stock from Q4. And so, but that’s the way we see it and that’s what our customers forecast and what the revenue rate will be and so until then we know it. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Tore Svanberg from Stifel, Nicolaus. 
Tore Svanberg: Could you talk a little bit about the BCD3 process? You know, what sort of percentage of products right now in production and can you also comment if BCD4 is still ready for Q4 launch? 
Michael Hsing: BCD, we are still converting from BCD2 to BCD3 technology. I don't know exactly what the percentage, maybe it's 30% to 40% and Meera can give you a better contribute. 
Meera Rao: Sure. As you know, we introduced BCD3 for office last year and such products went into production late last year. So we have started shipping, landing revenue on the BCD3 process. We've seen a significant portion of our design wins all on BCD3. Our new product offerings are also on BCD3. So we are well positioned to see a ramp in revenue from BCD products in 2013? 
Tore Svanberg: And then, could you just talk about your relative visibility, I mean I know you usually don't comment on backlog and bookings and things like that, but just so we understand how the linearity has progressed you know, how do you feel right now about the flattish times for the third quarter? 
Michael Hsing: You mean the second quarter? 
Meera Rao: For Q3? 
Michael Hsing: For Q3. The Q3 as I said earlier, [demand] in the third week of June which is, we realized that it's not as good as we thought. So, going for the future in Q4 and beyond we remain very optimistic. 
Meera Rao: I will just add to that. In terms of a backlog, we had a very good backlog and we are comfortable about the quarter’s guidance. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Patrick Wang from Evercore Partners. 
Patrick Wang: On my first question, I want to follow up on your comments there. You know, it sounds like things softened in the back half of June, can you talk about how things have looked thus far in July and then, Meera, you said that you saw felt fairly comfortable with the guidance here today. I guess help us walk through the thought process behind the guidance here because you know, it seems there if things continue to be soft today, then perhaps should we not really expecting [indiscernible] business? 
Meera Rao: So, let me speak to that a little bit. We saw softness in the second half of June in the consumer area, particularly in set top boxes and TV. We also saw some softness in our gateway product revenues. So we've taken that into consideration when we came up with a guidance. We still see strong growth in our new product stream, things like Storage, Lighting, Automotives. We still see growth over there, but this is a quarter where typically we would have seen a lot of growth coming in from set top boxes, TV and gateway. So those are the three areas where we’re not seeing the strengths that we typically would have seen to take us to a higher quarter. In fact some of the growth in the areas that I talked about, the new revenue streams are actually offsetting the decline that we’ve seen in the consumer and consumer light markets. 
Michael Hsing: Yes, and usually the consumers and the gateway, those are products that have a very fast turn business. And we don’t see the very long-term booking. 
Meera Rao: In terms of expectation, from our perspective, the markets got soft in the second half of June and this market has an ability to go soft or pick up within a space of week. So we’re being conservative as we typically are and are guiding it to flat essentially. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. 
Ross Seymore: Meera, can you just walk us through or Michael, what percentage of your sales do you now deem to be in product versus the legacy product? 
Meera Rao: I think at the moment, the bulk of our revenues are sales from the BCD2 or BCD front. We've just started shipping on our BCD3, but based on our design wins that we’ve seen out there, we expect a larger portion of the 2013 revenues to be from BCD3. 
Michael Hsing: It was strictly say based on the BCD2 and I think the BCD2, we rough estimated that it would be some way of 70% and if the continuous effort to change the - to upgrade BCD2 process to a final version of a BCD3, and the full BCD3 as we said it, we used a die size by far a certain percentage, by 50% and those who bought products by hitting on the market and I think last year, third quarter of last year and those products my guess will be like a single digit of a percentage. But in between other ones like a backlight product we released last year summer time and it’s sort of in between. So overall the rough number is probably 30% to 40% and 20% to 30%, then well going forward, all the product will be based on this BCD3 and which is all using the mesh connect in network and also the technology with a 40% shrink. 
Ross Seymore: Okay. And I guess there is my one follow up switching just a little bit related to earlier question. If we just assume that the fourth quarter is, I don’t know kind of down 5%, been kind of a historically normal range, Meera, can you just talk us through what some of the puts and takes would be on both gross margin and OpEx, again not so much guiding in revenues. I know you are not going to do that, but assuming down 5, what would those two lines of your income statement be? 
Meera Rao: Were you asking me hypothetically if our revenues were to go down 5%? 
Ross Seymore: Yes, it’s 5% sequentially, what’s the percentage of new product, mix, those sorts of things, how does that help or hurt gross margin in that and I don’t if there is any seasonality here out as well? 
Meera Rao: I would expect gross margin, with a 5% decline, I would expect our gross margin to be flat to maybe be slightly down. It also depends on how much of that early revenue we get in, if it is in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, it may not have as much of an impact. If it runs in the million of dollars, then I think it could have a bigger impact on gross margins. 
Michael Hsing: Yes, as for the utilization of course, if that's a negative, that is a negative side and it's not the medium line and if you drop to 5%, you will see a volume of that percentage as we talked about in our prior quarters and so what Meera just brought that up, the new product mix and I feel very strongly optimistic in the second half of this year and the new product will rank and bodes well with our high gross margin. So if you for pure modeling purpose, we will be slightly flat or flatly there. 
Operator: Our next question our next question comes from Jaeson Schmidt from Craig Hallum. 
Jaeson Schmidt: Just Meera, wanted to get your thoughts on what you guys think that you see the inventory situation is and just overall inventory in the channel and then secondly how should we look at litigation going both for Q3 and Q4 and then into 2013? 
Meera Rao: Inventory in the channels, we are off a little bit. We were in the low end of a range and again the increase in inventory has largely been in our gateways and set top boxes and TV; while we have really tried to the extent possible to keep it at this level and so that's without any further deterioration in the environment that's what I would kind of expect. In terms of litigation expenses, as you know we are going to be getting another $300,000 this quarter and our litigation expenses right now are really low, so we’re expecting it to be somewhere less than $100,000. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Cheng Cheng from Pacific Crest Securities. 
Cheng Cheng: A quick question on inventory; I know its low on your target level but I did see a little bit of jump in Q2, so I was wondering what’s your thoughts on the current level of inventory and what you are planning for in Q3? 
Meera Rao: Sure. Our inventory I think we mentioned in the last call that we are planning to increase our inventory because it would substantially grow what our model is. With the slowdown we have ended up a little higher than we have expected going into the quarter. And my expectation is given the wafers in line that we’ll most probably end-up this quarter at the high end of our inventory range or a little higher than that. But lots of inventory that we’ll be holding will be in die. 
Michael Hsing: I see this as not necessary to get negative thing and in the past we have sudden slow down and you always will expect to see a sudden snap back. So given long-term even a slightly higher than our model inventory, if it’s slightly higher, then I can -- those products will have more effect in the long-term because our products lifecycle is about at least five years. 
Cheng Cheng: I wanted to follow-up and maybe just on your computing segment, I was just wondering if you would breakout about how much of that is for storage application? 
Meera Rao: Storage right now is slightly above 50% and it is LCD and SSC and the SSC portion is growing, is a faster growing opportunity. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We have a follow-up question from Steve Smigie from Raymond James. 
J. Steven Smigie: Just regard to the Sharkey wins; can you talk a little bit about how many OEMs did you guys might have opportunities with there? 
Michael Hsing: The Romley and Sharkey, yeah we currently have a design win, not in the typical server makers, but we are in the networking company and we won the server either Romley and Sharkey design; or Romley design, okay. 
J. Steven Smigie: And going back to the questions on storage, do you have better margins on say SSD versus HDD and as that stuff ramps within your computing mix, would that storage business be better to overall computing so we could see margins going up as storage rises in your mix? 
Michael Hsing: All of the new products for servers and even for some of the ultrabooks, they are all higher in the corporate margins and much higher than the corporate margin and you mentioned that the SSD and HDD and I think these are molding up about the same where they are much higher than a corporate model, corporate average number. 
Meera Rao: And going forward, as a revenue for our SSD that would be even better margins. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Patrick Wang from Evercore Partners. 
Patrick Wang: Yes, I just want, I hope you could rank order for us in the back half of the year, what do you think some of your more compelling material catalysts are? I mean you guys have talked about some of the notebook server designs, talked about storage auto, industrial, could you maybe just kind of highlight a couple that we should be looking forward to in the next couple of quarters? 
Michael Hsing: I think one of those definite ones will be on graphics where we continue to see incremental revenues coming in. They’re from, all from the make and some of the other products that we've been releasing. We will continue, that’s going to be a continuing story on the networking side for the modules that we had talked about. We expect those revenues to ramp in 2013. We might even see some of the earlier revenue towards the end of the year and then the other ones, going into, if you go into 2013 is going to be our revenues from [indiscernible]. Everybody, easy to remember only seven things; so I can add a few more like the lighting and Meera didn’t mention that and we expect to see a lot more revenues and easy power the product line in as Meera mentioned that in her manuscript and the internet of things and it really I think it hit the market and as I said two or three quarters ago, this product will set the industrial standards and that’s the product and that’s the product we will see a lot of activities in the market and we expect volume will ramp up very soon. 
Patrick Wang: And then also wanted to touch on inventories. Your internal inventories again, so it sounds like it’s a $2 million heavy based  on kind of have slower trends that we have seen recently here, but do you think that, can you just kind of help us characterize how quickly those inventories went up? Was it a more of a recent kind of phenomena, was it just kind of the timing of the change there? 
Meera Rao: We were planning to increase our inventory that we had because our goal was to keep inventory as lean as we could in the channel and so our goal was to hold more inventory internally. So some of the increase was expected with the slowdown in turns we could have a little bit more inventory but we are going to hold most of the inventory in guide banks so that allows us to respond to either to a snap back or either so we can package it wherever the demand is. 
Michael Hsing: Let me add some more color on that. I said that many long time ago, as I always said, MPS’ inventory is not by a one to one relationship with the revenue and especially during a time, when you're ramping up the new product and we have to strategically build up an inventory for those product. The more new products you have, the larger inventory and so it's not quite a one-to-one relationship, pure is already a relationship with the future revenue. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Tore Svanberg from Stifel Nicholas. 
Tore Svanberg: Yes, just two quick follow ups. First of all, as the margin is down, it's like you are a little bit more optimistic about new products may be ramping as early as Q4. Is that due to some pull-ins or some programs being launched earlier than expected? 
Meera Rao: Some of it is earlier adoptions then we would expect from new product ramp. We're seeing this in areas like the SMTP mix we talked about. We are seeing some of that in the [EZ Tab], things, the possibility, things that we might see something similar in networking as well. So we're just seeing a lot of interest in here and based on early feedback from customers, we think that we could get some design wins; we could get some early revenue in late Q4. 
Michael Hsing: Yeah, our story hasn’t changed, I think been for the last couple of quarters. We all say that in middle of this year and that most of our products generating is from an existing product and in second half or later this year, it is all the new product that will move the needle slightly and so that story hasn't changed yet. 
Operator: I am showing no further questions at this time. 
Michael Hsing: All right. Thank you, everybody and looking forward talking to you in the next quarters. 
Meera Rao: Thanks. Bye, bye. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes our program. You may all disconnect and have a wonderful day.

===== 2012 Q1  (2012-04-30 00:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Monolithic Power Systems, Incorporated Q1, 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today’s conference call is being recorded.
 And now, I would like to turn the conference over to your host, Meera Rao. 
Meera Rao: Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to the first quarter 2012 Monolithic Power Systems conference call. Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS, is with me on today’s call.
 In the course of today’s conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty. These statements will cover a number of areas concerning our business outlook, including: our business and financial outlook for the second quarter of 2012,
 Our expectations for second quarter litigation, stock-based compensation, and GAAP, and non-GAAP operating expenses projected second quarter revenues and gross margins. Our target operating ranges for gross margins and inventory, our expectations for revenue growth and gross margins beyond Q2, 2012, our expected average tax rate for 2012,
 Our belief regarding the outcome of a pending IRS audit, our belief that MPS is well positioned for future growth. The expected seasonality of our business, our expectations for future product cost reductions, and new product introductions, potential customer acceptance of our products and opportunities these present and the prospects of diversification and expanding our market share.
 Forward-looking statements are not historical facts, or guarantees of future performance or events, and are based on current expectations, estimates, beliefs, assumptions, goals, and objectives, and involve significant known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by these statements.
 Risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in our SEC filings, including, but not limited to our Form 10-K filed on March 12, 2012, which is accessible through our website, www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today’s call.
 We will be discussing operating expense, net income, and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measure the financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
 A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the Q1, 2011, Q4, 2011 and Q1, 2012 releases. As well as to the reconciling tables, that are posted on our website.
 I’d also like to remind you that today’s conference call is being webcast live over the Internet, and will be available for replay on our website for one year along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today.
 We would like to start this call by reviewing our first quarter highlights. Following this update, we will discuss our operating results. We will conclude by discussing our expectations for the second fiscal quarter of 2012. We will then open up the call to your questions.
 Let’s start with the highlights. MPS had a stellar first quarter with revenues of $50.5 million. This is a record first quarter for MPS. It represents a 6.4% increase from the previous quarter instead of a typical seasonal drop of 5% to 10%.
 MPS saw a strong demand fueled by our new design wins and market share gains in the communications, computing and industrial markets. The engineering and marketing initiatives that we have been executing for over a year continue to pay off and are driving further product innovation and design wins.
 MPS has unique technology capabilities, product innovation and market focus has increased our served available market. Some of the more exciting developments are in the networking server and storage space. For the first time, MPS has been approved by Intel as a qualified vendor for their core power.
 The MPS Intelli-Phase offering for the upcoming VR12.5 [indiscernible] platform is one of the few Monolithic Vcore solutions on the approved vendor list. We provide unmatched performance in efficiency, size and cost. Additionally, this has opened the door to work on future reference designs using other Monolithic high-power density product offerings.
 We introduced our first digital Intelli-Phase in our Digi-Phase family of products targeted at server and networking applications. For the SSD and HDD markets, we are sampling a new generation of DC/DC products based on BCD-3 technology. We improved the product features and efficiencies, while reducing the cost and size. Some of these products have built in features requested by leading storage companies.
 In the Industrial and Automotive market, we have increased our industrial application base to include the solar power market. Our automotive product portfolio has expanded with additional ACQ100 product offerings. We have another white goods design win in Europe. This was due to the low power green energy capability of a high voltage DC/DC product.
 In lighting an AC/DC market, we have scored multiple design wins for our flicker free white LED dimming product and have started ramping production.
 MPS is sampling a new generation of low power AC/DC products called Easy-Power family. These products simplify designs and save space for high volume, low-power applications.
 Finally, in high volume consumer markets, our new generation of DC/DC products the Cool-Power family, continue to gain traction and increased market share in the legacy high-volume BCD Plus market.
 Turning to the financial summary, we have record first quarter revenues, strong turns business boosted net sales to $50.5 million, above the high end of our guidance range. Revenue from industrial markets grew sharply in the first quarter by 37% over the prior quarter and 90% over the same quarter a year ago.
 First quarter gross margin was 52.3% compared to gross margin of 52.5% in the prior quarter and up from 50.2% in the same quarter a year ago. Bottom line, non-GAAP net income was $6.1 million or $0.17 per fully diluted share.
 Moving to the profit and loss statement, in the first quarter of 2012, net sales were $50.5 million. Q1 revenues increased $3 million or 6.4% from the prior quarter and were $6 million or 13.5% higher compared to the first quarter of the prior year.
 Looking at our revenue by end market. Revenues from communications, industrial and computing markets grew both in dollars and as a percentage of total revenue. Sales breakdown as a percentage of total revenues by market was as follows: Communications was 25% of revenues, an increase from 23% and 22% in the fourth quarter and first quarter of 2011.
 Computing represented 19% of revenues, an increase from 18% in the prior quarter and 13% in the first quarter of 2011. Industrial revenues totaled 9% of revenues, an increase from 7% and 6% in the fourth quarter and first quarter of 2011. Consumer sales represented 47% of revenues and decreased from 52% in the prior quarter and 60% in Q1 2011.
 Communication market revenues grew to $12.5 million in the first quarter of 2012 from $11.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 and $9.9 million in the same quarter a year ago. Sales to gateway systems drove the increase in the communication market. The largest end markets in the communication space for MPS are gateways, networking, and telecom.
 Computing market revenues were $9.4 million in Q1 2012 increasing from $8.4 million in the prior quarter and $5.6 million in Q1 2011. Strong growth in storage sales contributed to the increase in computing revenue. The largest end markets for MPS in the computing space are storage, notebooks, tablets and printers.
 First quarter industrial and automotive revenues were $4.7 million compared to $3.5 million in the prior quarter and $2.5 million recorded in the first quarter of 2011. Industrial and automotive sales growth was fueled by industrial AMR meters, lighting, security, and automotive applications. The largest end markets in the industrial and automotive space for MPS are meters, automotive, lighting, and security.
 Consumer sales were $23.9 million in the first quarter of 2012 compared to $24.5 million in the fourth quarter and $26.5 million in Q1 2011. The decline was attributed to lower TV sales, however, set top box revenues continue to hold strong and grow. The largest end market for MPS in the consumer space are set top boxes, TVs, monitors, handsets, and other general purpose consumer market.
 Let’s move now to the gross margin line. Our first quarter gross margin was 52.3% compared to gross margin of 52.5% in the prior quarter. The slight gross margin fluctuation is tied to product mix change. First quarter gross margin is up from the 50.2% in the same quarter a year ago, largely due to higher absorption of in-house manufacturing overhead on higher revenues in Q1 2012.
 Let’s review our non-GAAP operating expense. Excluding stock compensation, our non-GAAP operating expenses for the first quarter of 2012 were $20 million, up $500,000 from the $19.5 million we spent in the fourth quarter of 2011. First quarter non-GAAP R&D and SG&A spending increased $1.3 million from the prior quarter, mainly due to higher expenses related to sales and marketing hires, commissions on higher sales and higher audit and tax expenses. This increase was partially offset by about $800,000 lower litigation expenses in the first quarter, which included the benefit from the first payment received of $300,000 under a settlement and license agreement of $2 million.
 Non-GAAP operating expenses for Q1 2012 were up $2.5 million from the $17.5 million we spent in the first quarter of 2011. The increase year-over-year was primarily driven by higher R&D spending in support of new product initiative. Sales and marketing hires, commissions on higher sales, and partially offset by lower litigation expenses. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 12.9% in the first quarter of 2012 compared with 11.6% in the prior quarter and 11% in the first quarter of 2011.
 Moving on to our reported expenses and operating margins. Our GAAP operating expenses were $23.2 million in the first quarter compared to $22.5 million in the prior quarter and $20.4 million in the same quarter a year ago. Since the only difference between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for these quarters is stock compensation expense. Let’s look at the stock compensation expense.
 The stock compensation expense was $3.2 million in the first quarter compared to $3 million in the prior quarter and $2.9 million in Q1 2011. Our GAAP operating profit was 6.3% in the first quarter of 2012 compared to our GAAP operating profit of 5.1% in the prior quarter.
 Switching to the bottom line. On a GAAP basis, our Q1 2012 net income was $3 million or $0.08 per fully diluted share. On a non-GAAP basis, our Q1 2012 net income was $6.1 million or $0.17 per fully diluted share. This result is computed with an estimated tax rate of 7.5%. Fully diluted shares increased by 1.3 million shares from the 34.4 million shares in the prior quarter to 35.7 million shares in the first quarter of 2012. The increase in the fully diluted shares was largely driven by the increase in the average quarterly share price from $12.52 in Q4 2011 to $17.53 in Q1 2012. The increase in fully diluted shares was also due to refresh grants awarded in the quarter.
 Now let’s look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $194.6 million at the end of the first quarter 2012, up from $187.9 million at the end of 2011 and $193.3 million we had on the books at the end of the first quarter 2011.
 In Q1, MPS had operating cash flow of about $8.5 million and cash proceeds of $4.1 million from option exercises by employees and employee stock plan purchases. We spent $5.9 million on headquarter building improvement, capital equipment and software in the first quarter.
 Accounts receivable ended the first quarter at $19.9 million compared with $15.1 million at the end of the prior quarter and $17.6 million at the end of the first quarter of 2011. The increase in accounts receivables from Q4 2011 was largely due to the timing of revenues in the 2 quarters.
 Days of sales outstanding were 36 days both in Q1 2012 and Q1 2011, and 29 days in Q4 2011. Our internal inventories at the end of the first quarter were $21.5 million or about 81 days of inventory on a historical basis, which is lower than our inventory model of 100 days to 110 days. This compares with $20.1 million or 81 days of inventory at the end of 2011. Inventory in our distribution channels stayed at about the same level as of prior quarter both in dollars and days and total days of distributor inventory was in the target range of 30 to 45 days.
 Let’s turn to a discussion of general business conditions. Inventory in the channel continues to be lean. Order momentum that started in December continues, design wins and market share gains continue to contribute to revenue growth.
 I would now like to turn to outlook for the second quarter of 2012. Our revenue guidance is in the range of $56 million to $60 million for the second quarter of 2012. We expect gross margin to be in the range of 52.5% to 54%. We expect stock-based compensation expense in the range of $4 million to $4.5 million.
 In 2012, we implemented pay-for-performance equity compensation program for our key employees. As a result, we are required under the accounting rules to access the probability of hitting the performance metrics on a quarterly basis. This will add volatility to stock comp compared to the typical straight line approach associated with time-based grants.
 We expect non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense to be in the range of $20.5 million to $21.5 million. This estimate excludes the stock compensation estimate mentioned above. We expect litigation expense in the range of $100,000 to $300,000.
 In conclusion, in 2012 we will further expand our technology leadership, expand the product roadmap and gain market share in targeted high-value growth markets. This will set MPS on track for sustainable growth in 2013 and beyond.
 I’ll now open the microphone for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Vernon Essi with Needham & Company. 
Vernon Essi: I was wondering if you could go over your - I guess, for my purposes just your capacity that’s available out there and can you give us a rundown of sort of who you are using to ramp your production and what sort of availability you have, I mean you’re on a nice trajectory here, and I guess also just in line with that, you had given us an update on your BCD, I guess rollouts from BCD-3 or BCD-3 Plus and BCD-4, if you could go over that sort of how that progression is taking place, maybe appreciated. 
Michael Hsing: Okay. We don’t have a capacity now and we disclosed the last earnings call we added another foundry with a much more advanced equipment. And with the BCD-3 product we strengthened, I’ve always said, we strengthened it by a huge amount, more than 30%, 40% of die size. Our - even our existing foundries we couldn’t fill it up, because number of the wafer dramatically reduced. So we don’t have any capacity constraint. And audio represents the technology for BCD-3 product, the third generation is now in a converting phase and BCD-4, the fourth generation we are trying to release at the end of the year. 
Vernon Essi: So you’re still qualifying BCD-3, 4 - I’m sorry, BCD-4 with your customers, you’re in-production ops in BCD-3 and I realize that of course your die size is smaller, but I guess my question is the technology you’d brought in another foundry partner, I remember that, and what I guess I’m asking is how is the capacity with that partner and do you feel that equates to… 
Michael Hsing: That will add another more than $100 million. 
Meera Rao: Yes, so we have more than enough capacity for the foreseeable future. 
Vernon Essi: Okay, I’ll move on, then congrats on the Vcore situation on the grandly[ph], and I just - obviously you had talked about this a long time ago and now that you’re in a reference design scenario, can you give us an understanding on how that revenue would ramp and sort of when you would start to see the first opportunity to recognize revenue on that? 
Michael Hsing: This is very - we disclosed that information on the - on grandly because this is a milestone for MPS. And MPS is always in the analog side, we don’t have a digital, now we have a digital capability and it took MPS more than a year or 2 to do that and that’s a milestone. In terms of our revenue, this is - grandly is really a 2014 volume. So now, we are engaged with our customers and therefore designing process now. 
Vernon Essi: Okay. And then my final question, if you could explain on the consumer side, you have sort of migrated away from that and you still had a very strong quarter in consumer especially on a sequential basis relative to your peers. Can you discuss - you put a lot of things in that bucket there and even some handset revenue, can you discuss sort of what seems to be the strongest driver in that bucket and why it’s not seeing a seasonally slower downtick? 
Meera Rao: We had told you last quarter that we had got -- gained a lot of market share in set-top boxes, so we saw stronger revenues from set-top box in the quarter and we also saw a stronger demand from a whole lot of general purpose consumer products. And I think a lot of it is the new design wins and some of the market share that we have been gaining in this market. 
Vernon Essi: Okay. And so if we go through the rest of 2012, especially as you get into the back half of the year, you obviously would expect consumer to tick up as a percentage of your revenue going into the back half of the year, in other words it would certainly be well north of 50%, perhaps approaching 50% again as you exit the year, is that a fair statement? 
Michael Hsing: We expect to have a percentage, we expect to remain the same level of slightly lower in other market segments picking up, but the revenue dollar, it will be - will have a modest growth in consumer area. 
Operator: Our next question in queue comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. 
Ross Seymore: On the gross margin line, given just a stereotypical assumption on mix and what would be good and bad for your gross margin, I’m a little surprised at where the growth came from that the gross margin actually was down a little bit sequentially, can you just clarify to us how we should think about mix, whether it’s by new products or by end markets? 
Meera Rao: In the second quarter? 
Ross Seymore: In the first quarter. 
Meera Rao: Okay. Our first quarter mix - product mix came in lower, it’s a combination of products and customers and it’s largely because of consumer and a little bit of the low end computing as well. 
Ross Seymore: But going forward… 
Meera Rao: Pardon. 
Ross Seymore: Go-ahead, ma'am. 
Meera Rao: By low end computing, I ‘m talking about laptops, notebooks et cetera. 
Ross Seymore: So if we think going forward, as Michael just answered to the previous question about consumer as a percentage of the mix, if Thompson Industrial become a bigger part of the mix, I assume those are the richest gross margin area much like your peers, is that how the mix related dynamic works in your business model as well? 
Michael Hsing: Yes and that’s the truth. But the industrial revenues and the contribution of the gross margin from industrial is rather small for MPS at this time because the overall industrial revenue is not as big and more in communications and a computing from a - especially from a new generation product for the computing area. 
Ross Seymore: And I guess is a - it’s a follow-up on the gross margin line, as well as - if I remember correctly you had underutilization charges and so you got upwards to the $60 million or $61 million in revenue away from the mix side of things just from a fixed-cost coverage perspective. Can you just walk us through in fact still the bogie on where those underutilization charges disappear and if so how should we judge the magnitude of what they were in the first quarter and how do they go down going forward as you grow? 
Meera Rao: As we explained before, there was a 300 basis gross margin hit that we took back in Q4 2010. And so as we grow that we get some of that back or we get some of the gross margin improvement out of it. But one of the things to keep in mind is we'll always be balancing revenue growth with gross margin growth. 
Michael Hsing: To answer your point it’s due to do same formula. We view the capacity around $70 million so it’s still running at the $50 million range, so it still have a lot of room which we include. 
Ross Seymore: Great. And I guess this is the last question a little bit more housekeeping. What tax rate should we think about for the rest of this year? 
Meera Rao: I would say between 5% and 10%. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Patrick Wang with Evercore Partners. 
Patrick Wang: I know you’ll recently talked about this that your sales guidance was very strong, can you give us a sense of how your booking trends were, perhaps I guess a linearity or shape over the quarter, I know you said that it was strong throughout the quarter, but could you give a little more color there? And then also you entered last quarter with a lot of backlog coverage. If you could also give us a ballpark on how much you’ve got heading into Q2? 
Meera Rao: Last quarter was an exception, it’s typically a down quarter and we were projecting revenues to be flat to up and so as an exception, we shared the bookings number. For this quarter, I’ll just say that we entered the quarter with good bookings and we are comfortable with the quarter guidance. 
Patrick Wang: Okay. So I mean should we think about that as - looking as more of a typical quarter that we see in the past with MPS? 
Michael Hsing: It is a typical quarter, yes. 
Patrick Wang: Typical quarter, okay got it. Great. And then also I want to follow-up Ross’ question on gross margin. When we think about margins over the course of the year, just the way that you guys have guided revenues for the second quarter and it almost feels like we should really sort of approaching something in the 60s and the back half for the year. And if we do that what’s the best way to think about the margin progression over time. And I guess you know it’s just when we take into account the underutilization surcharges and I guess may be for 6 quarters ago you guys got hit on higher wafer costs as well? 
Michael Hsing: Well, as I said earlier than the consumer - the percentage of a consumer product will go low. And that overall dollar will still go up. So overall margin as the revenue grow it should go up slightly. Although, we don’t want to emphasize the margin only. We want to have a balanced growth between the growth margin and also the revenue growth. 
Patrick Wang: Okay. So is it fair to think about as we approach 55% margins, is that - do you want investors to think about that or is it more kind of 53% to 55% is a healthy range and looking to maximize top line growth? 
Michael Hsing: Yes. We - our current models do have 50% and a 55%. So we’re so in the middle now and as the revenue grow in the euro expected, we will go even higher. But we - at this time, we are not changing our model. 
Patrick Wang: Okay. Great. And then also we’ve been pretty excited about an opportunity with MPS ramping at a big comp equipment supplier out there. I’m just curious if you can give us an update on some of the key milestones, the sampling that the power module and if any of that is actually baked into your Q2 guidance? 
Michael Hsing: No, the modules and we are actively engaged with our customers. So we have a conference call with them every week and for the progress of the project and we don’t expect any revenue in the second quarter and/or even third quarters. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Smigie with Raymond James. 
J. Steven Smigie: Just a follow-up a little bit more, you guys had a very strong result here on the first quarter and a very good guidance. How can we think about seasonality this year given that typically Q3 would be very strong from you? So first while you’re moving more towards networking business and other area is industrial that you probably means you will have less of that seasonality going forward, plus you've had 2 above expectation quarters. So how should we think about that seasonality this year and next year we have more of that mix in your business. 
Michael Hsing: That’s a good question and we try to figure out what is seasonality and also relating to next couple of years - financials and the unstable market with our new business. And we really can’t tell in the - that the close to 50% our business still in a consumer side. So I would still expect to have a very - a similar trend, but not as much - now - we don’t have a typical pattern anymore. 
J. Steven Smigie: Okay. So probably wouldn’t be fair to sort of model a big drop down in Q4 and then even bigger drop down Q1 anymore should obviously would that out that fixed? 
Michael Hsing: Well, we never had a Q4. We have our Q3, we have always have a big Q3 and a Q4 slightly down, even or slightly down and I don’t see and really depend on [indiscernible] market and also the computing market and what Q3 will be and we are still contemplating, but at this time too far away to say it. But overall I expected the things that new product designing activity happened in the last year and I expect the revenue continue to grow. 
J. Steven Smigie: Okay. Within the operating expenses, can you give some color on what the mix would be as a percentage wise, dollar wise, SG&A versus R&D and talk a little bit about R&D spend over the rest of the year. Is it certain dollar amount you guys are looking to spend for the year? That's the question. 
Meera Rao: Sure. In terms of the OpEx, R&D we’ve got all the headcount on board. So any increase would be associated with new product releases, math sets and development wafer large things like that. With regard to sales and marketing, we just hired a new sales and marketing executive and we’ll be adding a few more as we find them. So, I would expect salaries to increase a little bit and then we would also have variations, I would say sales commissions could go up and down along with revenues. 
J. Steven Smigie: Okay. So I should think that you probably see much faster ramp in SG&A going forward and then R&D dollars just really have to spend in place the dollars probably will ramp that significantly. 
Meera Rao: Yes. And even SG&A, the ramp is not going to be that significant but there will be an increase. 
J. Steven Smigie: Okay. And last question, with regard to the new products coming out, can you help us think about how we should be looking at ASP and units. Feels like the ASPs got to be going up a lot, does that mean units go down quite a bit as well because again you are moving away from those higher volume markets? 
Michael Hsing: That’s true. We have all the computing product and those are the new generation with computing product called out high ASP and also for storage and the new generation where products like SSD and HDD are higher price, will have - those products have a higher content. 
Operator: The next question comes from Rick Schafer with Oppenheimer. 
Shawn Simmons: This is Shawn Simmons calling in for Rick. Congrats on the good quarter and guide. I have just a couple of questions, quick on your set top box business, can you guys just talk about where you are taking share just geographically? 
Michael Hsing: I think all over the place in Europe, U.S., Asia. 
Shawn Simmons: Okay, great. And then, can you give us an update on your past auto design wins? I know you guys got pretty good traction in Europe and then one design win in Asia last quarter, did you pick up any incremental share there or do you have any further color on that? 
Michael Hsing: Yes, we do have some design wins in the U.S. mall - in the U.S. market although we are not really qualified for big 3 automakers, but we design it in those component makers. 
Shawn Simmons: Okay. And then I guess just one last question for me. I guess, what do you expect to do with internal inventories? Do you guys expect to take them up here quarter-on-quarter as you built for a seasonally kind of stronger second half? 
Meera Rao: Yes, we expect to increase in-house inventory levels. It will be getting closer to our in-house inventory models that’s may be goes slightly short of that. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel, Nicolaus. 
Tore Svanberg: A few questions, first of all, you had converted to BCD-3, what is the percentage now and where would you expect that to be by the end of the year? 
Michael Hsing: BCD-3 and currently we are converting all the product based on the BCD Plus, BCD-2. 
Meera Rao: Plus to BCD-3. 
Michael Hsing: To BCD-3 and BCD-4, the fourth generation we’re planning to release in production at the end of this year. 
Tore Svanberg: Okay. And I guess you have a --the reason I'm asking the percentage question is because that I’m trying to understand the impact on gross margins. So at the end of the year, would you have a pretty high percentage in BCD-3? 
Michael Hsing: That’s correct. 
Tore Svanberg: Okay. Very good. And you talked about the grant in the design win then I understand you’re not going to get much revenues until 2014, but when would be the release you could potentially announce a design win there? 
Michael Hsing: Yep. You’re talking about BCD-3. 
Tore Svanberg: No, no. Now, I’m talking about the Vcore design win for grandly. 
Michael Hsing: These are - yes, we do have - we can’t call a design win because the production day is a little further away. And but certainly many leading manufacturer needing supply from the - in the server market, they’re very interested in MPS solutions. 
Tore Svanberg: Very good. 
Meera Rao: In fact, right after Intel sent out the approved vendor list, we got a lot of request from customers asking for samples and boards. 
Tore Svanberg: Very good. You guided legal to be - legal expenses to be $100,000 to $300,000, is that sort of the new run rate now going forward? 
Meera Rao: For the rest of this year, we kind of expect it to be at that rate. 
Tore Svanberg: Okay, very good. And you had a little bit of a step up in CapEx. Is that it for now and now we’re going to be go back to sort of $2 million, $3 million? 
Meera Rao: Yes. I think we’ll see another quarter with CapEx will be up and then they will be back to the usual levels. 
Tore Svanberg: Okay. And when we talk about communications, I think you mentioned telecom as a narrow that’s big for you guys. I didn’t think that was a pretty material business for you. I mean I should still think that in comp it’s primarily networking right? 
Meera Rao: Networking is the bigger champion. Yes. 
Operator: I’m showing the next question in queue is a follow-up from Vernon Essi with Needham & Company. 
Vernon Essi: Thank you very much. And I apologize if you had already addressed this, but what is the update on your outlook for the LED lighting market and sort of how you guys progressing and I guess give us the landscape of where you’re seeing the most traction right now? 
Michael Hsing: Well, we have a - we had a product that it have with a little problem, where I mean and we corrected that and so we got a design win now, we got a design win, we got a multiples which called a multiple design, design wins after we release this product in early - just at the end of the last year. And so we will have an enough - a meaningful revenues from LED lighting in this year. 
Vernon Essi: Okay. And so should we’ll be looking at I mean you’ve historically broken out this revenue with lighting controls and some of that’s probably, we spoke of that could still be sort of in the computing area, correct? 
Meera Rao: Actually, if we have continued to breakout the revenues by product type as well as DC/DC and wireless, but what you see is lighting control revenues includes both LED lighting, as well as backlighting revenues. 
Vernon Essi: Okay. But I mean is it fair to say when we look at that $6 million number for the first quarter, is that - like what would be the split of that between monitor based revenue versus general lighting? 
Meera Rao: The majority of that would be… 
Michael Hsing: Monitor business is about a round of portfolio of $5 million to $6 million right. 
Meera Rao: Yes. 
Michael Hsing: Yes. So and this year, the Monitor business is still - will be very strong as we’ll release a new product for that market. And we also see the lighting business will grow too. 
Vernon Essi: Great. So let me just back up. You’re expecting the growth you will see in 2012 would be contingent upon your success in the general lighting market, I mean is it a monitor market or the computing market expected to grow at all for you or is it sort of flattish? 
Michael Hsing: Yes. Those are well growth. 
Meera Rao: So we are focusing on growth from the lighting market. 
Operator: Thank you. And I show the next question is follow-up Steve Smigie from Raymond James. 
J. Steven Smigie: So it seems overall that the not specific view, but the TV end market overall seems to be maybe finally getting a little bit better. Do you still have product there that could grow and any chance that some of the big guys over in Korea would be talking to you about, again about any products you have out there? 
Michael Hsing: Well, we did that in the 2010. We did a lot revenues and I mean in a TV mark - 2011 loss a lot of revenue then in a market - in the Korean TV market. And now the overall TV market we - I think it’s 2010, and our revenue is only - is about a 30% and in terms of overall market we’re still a small, it’s not a dominate player like 20%, 30% of our total market share. So without the Korean - major Korean TV makers and so our percentage is a much smaller now and with [indiscernible] and with the crew product we released we’ve released in last year and we expect to gain some shares and although and that’s not our focus. 
J. Steven Smigie: Okay. And I’m sorry if I missed this somewhere, but you appreciate you guys giving the end market breakout very helpful. I think when you gave us Q1 I think you gave comparisons for Q4 and Q1 a year ago. If you have guys could put on the website Q3 and Q2 if it’s not familiar in the press release that I missed it. 
Meera Rao: I can give you the Q4 and the Q1. Again we already gave Q1 2011. I can give you an approximation of the Q4 2011 if that would be helpful. 
J. Steven Smigie: Sure. I think you gave Q4 2011. I could be wrong 
Meera Rao: I’ll just - I gave it in the script, but let me just walk through it one more time. Communication is about 23%, computing about 18%, consumer was 52%, industrial is about 7%. 
J. Steven Smigie: Right I appreciate, I just take there is point for Q2 and Q3 and it’s only if important that you send that information out. 
Meera Rao: Sure, Q2 communications was 24% in Q2, 23% in Q3, computing was about 14% in Q2 and 17% in Q3. Consumer is about 57% in Q2 and 53% in Q3. Industrial is about 6% in Q2, and about 8% in Q3. 
Operator: I’m showing no other questions at this time. I’d like to turn the program back to management for any concluding remarks. 
Meera Rao: Thank you for joining us on this call. Look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Bye-bye. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining today’s conference. This does conclude the program and you may now disconnect.

===== 2011 Q4  (2012-02-09 00:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by for your Monolithic Power Systems, Incorporated, Q4 and Full-year Fiscal 2011 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. And now I will turn the program over to Meera Rao. Please go ahead. 
Meera Rao: Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to the Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2011 Monolithic Power Systems Conference Call. Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS is with me on today's call. In the course of today's conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainties. These statements will cover a number of areas concerning our business outlook, including our business and financial outlook for the first quarter of 2012, our expectations for first quarter litigation, stock-based compensation and GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses, our target operating ranges for gross margins and inventory, our expectations for revenue growth and gross margins beyond Q1 2012, our belief regarding the outcome of our pending IRS audit, our belief that MPS is well positioned for future growth, the expected seasonality of our business, our expectations for future product cost reductions, new product introductions for 2012, potential customer acceptance of our products and the opportunity these present, and the prospects of diversification and expanding our market share.
 Forward-looking statements are not historical facts or guarantees of future performance or events and are based on current expectations, estimates, beliefs, assumptions, goals and objectives, and involve significant known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by these statements.
 Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in our SEC filings, including but not limited to our Form 10-K filed on March 4, 2011, and Form 10-Q filed on October 27, 2011, which is accessible through our website, www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligations to update the information provided on today's call.
 We will be discussing operating expense, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
 A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the Q1 to Q4 2010 releases and Q1 2011 to Q4 2011 releases, as well as the reconciling tables that are posted on our website.
 I'd also like to remind you that today's conference call is being webcast live over the internet and will be available for replay on our website for one year along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. 
 We would like to start this call by reviewing our fourth quarter business highlights. Following this update, I will discuss our operating results. We will conclude by discussing our expectations for the first fiscal quarter of 2012. We will then open up the call to your questions.
 Let's start with the business highlights. 2011 was an exciting year for MPS. We successfully executed our plan by introducing many innovative products, expanding our sales and marketing team and winning designs in many new high value markets. These actions will diversify and sustain our future revenue growth. In the process technology and product arena, MPS had a stellar year. We've set a goal to leapfrog our competition by developing multiple generations of process technologies. We are happy to report that the MPS proprietary BCD3 process has been released which offer higher efficiency and up to 50% reduction in die size compared to our previous BCD Plus process. We are qualifying our proprietary BCD4 process which further reduces die size 20% to 50% from BCD2. We introduced many innovative products and scored key design wins in the following market.
 For industrial and automotive, we had our first wide [ goods ] design-in. Our high voltage DC/DC parts enable the customer to meet new energy requirements. Our high voltage small footprint solution was successfully designed in by a major part manufacturer opening the door to a new market. We continued gaining traction in automotive markets. MPS products are now designed into 6 models at 5 major European car makers and we scored our first design win in Asia. In the networking and service space, we won our first server design-in as a major U.S. company. This has opened the door for future design activity, utilizing our Intelli-Phase family of products.
 Our new BCD3 DC to DC product, which offers very high performance in a small footprint, won MPS the first design-in as one of the largest networking companies in the world. In addition, we are sampling a high current fully-integrated module for the networking and cloud computing market.
 In lighting, we won a key A19 incandescent bulb replacement based on the unparalleled performance of MPS's White LED solution at a large lighting company in Japan. We introduced the first of our new flicker-free White LED dimming family of products.  The ability to dim to very low levels is generating interest at various large customers. 
 Finally, in high volume consumer market, our newly introduced cool power family of AC/DC products have gained traction in high volume markets. The cool power series are replacing the older generation devices designed on BCD Plus. 
 Our new White LED backlighting architecture solutions is now ramping as a major Japanese TV manufacturer. Easy configuration and the lower system cost empower the customer to design the solution in multiple models.
 Now we turn to the financial summary. Strong demand activity in December boosted Q4 revenues above the midpoint of guidance to $47.5 million. Enterprise storage revenues ramped up in the fourth quarter. For the year, our revenues came in at $196.5 million, down $22.3 from 2010, mostly due to the Korean TV business loss from 2010. In the manufacturing area, fourth quarter gross margin was 52.5% consistent with the prior quarter and improved by 2 percentage points over the same quarter a year ago.
 Our internal base of inventories remain well below our target range coming in at 81 days, while inventory at our distributors was lean. Bottom line, non-GAAP net income in the fourth quarter was $5.2 million or $0.15 per fully diluted share. 2011 was also a good year for IT litigation activity. We successfully enforced our rights against a Chinese company that infringed our patent. In the cases against O2 Micro and Linear Technology, the court granted us multi-million dollar attorney fees award against the other parties.
 Moving to the profit and loss statement. Q4 revenues were slightly above the $47.1 million in the same quarter a year ago and declined $5.5 million or 10% from the prior quarter, largely attributable to seasonal softness in consumer and notebook market. 
 Looking at the fourth quarter revenue by product type. DC to DC revenues were $41.3 million, down 7% or $3.2 million from the prior quarter. Lighting control revenues were $5.7 million, down 29% from the third quarter, mainly due to higher than seasonal slowdown in notebooks and tablets. While Q4 revenues declined in most end markets, enterprise storage revenues were up quarter over quarter, and gateways and set top boxes were relatively flat to the prior quarter.
 Let's move down to the gross margin line. Our fourth quarter gross margin of 52.5% was above the high end of our guidance range. Product mix was richer than expected. Fourth quarter gross margin was flat with the prior quarter and grew from 50.5% in the same quarter a year ago, largely due to improved revenue mix.
 Let's review our non GAAP operating expenses. Excluding stock compensation, our non GAAP operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2011 were $19.5 million, same as the prior quarter. Our non-GAAP operating expenses were up $2.7 million from the $16.8 million we spent in the fourth quarter of 2010 largely due to higher spending on new products and market diversification initiative. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 11.6% in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared with 15.9% in the prior quarter and 15% in the fourth quarter of 2010.
 Moving on to our reported expenses and operating margin. Our GAAP operating expenses were $22.5 million in the fourth quarter compared to $22.8 million in the prior quarter and $19.8 million in the same quarter a year ago. The only difference between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for these quarters is stock compensation expense. Stock comp expense of $3 million in the fourth quarter was flat with the same quarter a year ago and down from $3.3 million in the prior quarter.
 GAAP operating profit was 5.1% in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to GAAP operating profit of 9.5% in the prior quarter. Looking to the bottom line, on a GAAP basis, our Q4 2011 net income was $2.5 million or $0.07 for fully diluted share. On an non-GAAP basis, fourth quarter 2011 net income was $5.2 million or $0.15 for fully diluted share.
 On the tax front, we have an update on the IRS notice of proposed adjustment, or NOPA, that we discussed in the first quarter of 2011 conference call. We recently received a revised notice of proposed adjustment, or NOPA, from the IRS regarding our returns for the years ended December 31, 2005, to December 31, 2007.
 In the revised NOPA, the IRS reduced its proposed adjustment substantially. This represents a potential income tax liability of $10.5 million plus interest and penalties if any. We continue to believe that IRS position is incorrect and that our cash returns for those years are correct as filed. We expect to contest these proposed adjustments vigorously.
 Now let's turn to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalent and investment were $187.9 million at the end of 2011, up $11.3 million from the $176.6 million at the end of the prior quarter. In Q4, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $13.3 million and used $2.3 million to purchase capital equipment. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were down from $196.9 million we had on the books at the end of 2010. In 2011, we generated $42.7 million of operating cash flow and $6.5 million from ESPP purchases and option exercises by employees.
 In the first half of 2011, we bought back approximately 2.5 million shares for a total $38.5 million. On August 5, 2011, we purchased as a new corporate headquarters a property located at 79 Great Oaks Boulevard in San Jose for $11 million. We also purchased other capital equipment in 2011 for $8.7 million. Accounts receivable ended the year at $15.1 million, compared with $16.4 million at the end of the prior quarter and $18.3 million at the end of 2010.
 Day sales outstanding were 29 days in Q4, slightly up from 28 days in the prior quarter and down from 35 days in Q4 2010. Our internal inventories at the end of the year were $20.1 million or about 81 days of inventory on a historical basis, which we managed to less than our inventory model of 100 to 110 days given the slowdown we saw entering the quarter. This compares to the $23.6 million or 85 days of inventory at the end of the prior quarter. Inventory in our distribution channels decreased in both dollars and days. Total days of distributor inventory are lean and at a lower end of the target range of 30 to 45 days, largely due to higher than anticipated re-sales in December.
 I would now like to turn to a discussion of general business condition. As we entered the first quarter of 2011, inventory in the channel is lean. So all the momentum that we saw in December continued and storage demands continued to ramp.
 Turning to our outlook for the first quarter of 2012. We are expecting Q1 revenue in the range of $46 million to $50 million. We expect gross margin to be similar to those reported in the third and fourth quarters of 2011. Stock based compensation expenses are expected to be in the range of $2.5 million to $3 million. In 2011, we expanded our sales and marketing team in support for diversification strategy.
 Expected non-GAAP, R&D and SG&A expense are in the range of $19.5 million to $20.5 million. This estimate excludes the stock compensation estimate mentioned above. We expect litigation expense in the $500,000 to $700,000 range.
 Our fully diluted share count is expected to increase as the average quarterly stock price goes up. At current levels, the estimated fully diluted share comps were approximately 35.3 million. 
 In conclusion, as we said a year ago, 2011 was a transition year. We successfully executed our plan. We introduced many innovative products, expanded our sales and marketing team, won designs in many new high value markets and effectively increased our serviceable market. We believe that these successes will lead to a growth here in 2012 and beyond.
 I will now open the microphone for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first questionnaire in the queue is Patrick Wang with Evercore Partners. 
Patrick Wang: Just 2 quick questions for Meera, right up front, on gross margins. You had really, really nice gross margins. As we think about the rest of the year as revenues keep ramping here, I know that you guys had under-loading charges from your facility in Chengdu and you used to pay higher wafer costs. Just curious to know, what is the trajectory we should be thinking about margins kind of over the course of the year? 
Michael R. Hsing: Let me hope the best. I think I will forecast on what we have seen in the region and in quarters that we have seen similar levels. And although we had design wins in the last year, it is difficult for us to project when these revenues will take and have significant effect on the gross margin. 
Patrick Wang: I see. But there is no reason that this is temporary uptick in gross margins. This is structural improvement that we see today? 
Michael R. Hsing: If you look in the past, in the past several quarters, and the margins continue to improve, improving. 
Meera Rao: Yes, we expect it to stay at these levels, Patrick. 
Patrick Wang: Okay. Great. And then just a quick one on OpEx before I ask a more interesting question. OpEx is up a bit here in the first quarter. I know you guys said you did a lot of hiring at the end of the year. How should we think about that, again, as you guys continue growing over the course of the year? 
Meera Rao: We expect it to be just have a little growth from these numbers, but pretty much the impact of the higher annual pay raises are all already baked into these numbers. So there will be a small uptick, but it's going to be small. 
Patrick Wang: Got you. Okay. And then, Michael, I wanted to ask you about process technologies, this is something that I am really happy to hear you guys are kind of going back towards BCD3 coming out, and then of course you guys mentioned BCD4. Can you talk about some of the competitive advantages that you are seeing there, and maybe perhaps the timing of when we will see products based on these processes? 
Michael R. Hsing: BCD3 all the products are out now and so we see a lot of good results, as Meera said it a while ago. And BCD4, we are trying to rollout by the end of Q3. 
Patrick Wang: By the end of third quarter, okay. And with the products that you've seen out there based on BCD3, can you talk about the kind of customer feedback you've seen, the die shrink and the better performance, something that customers are really flocking towards, or are they kind of pushing back, what are you hearing? 
Michael R. Hsing: Well, it's all high current products, and without BCD3 we wouldn't be able to do it. And these are very high current products in a very small package that enable us to open the volume of major networking and industrial accounts. And high volume business with the BCD3 out, that price reduction will reduce a significant amount, and that enable us to compete effectively in the high volume market again. 
Patrick Wang: Got you. And then just last question. Can you talk about how your product pipeline and design pipeline looks today based on your new technologies coming out? 
Michael R. Hsing: As we said it before, we planned the release of our 70 products every year, and these are products we really believe that will further diversify our -- it's a game change, and the seed that we planted in the last couple of years. 
Operator: Our next question in queue is Vernon Essi with Needham & Company. 
Vernon P. Essi: I was wondering, Meera, if I would just dive in, and I apologize, maybe you answered this. But your OpEx looks to be going up about $1 million sequentially on this guide. What exactly is driving that and where we will be seeing that? Between R&D and SG&A, or weighted towards one or the other? 
Meera Rao: You will be seeing the impact of pay raises will be across both R&D and SG&A. But the impact of the hires that we have had is largely going to be in the sales and marketing area. And most of the hires have been done, we will just have a few more as we go through the year. 
Vernon P. Essi: And then also, will this -- just to follow on that point, will this impact your stock-based comp in the out quarters? Will you be granting more options on the sales side, or what -- should we be expecting it to kind of be in this level through the remainder of the year? 
Meera Rao: We will have annual repurchase and grants for new hires as we go through. I think the bigger factor that's going to impact our share count for fully diluted shares is going to be our average stock price for the quarter. As the average stock price goes up, we expect that the fully diluted share count would be higher. This just reflects the impact of underwater options coming into the money. 
Vernon P. Essi: Okay. And just moving over to sort of product front, you -- it's probably more Michael's front here. You have made some comments about the enterprise storage area. Obviously there has been a lot of turmoil in that market of late. How do you see that playing out, I guess, through the remainder of the year. It sounds like you've obviously got an incremental customer on-board. It's ramping. Are you prepared for any other, I guess, disruptions that may happen. I think there is some consolidation also going on, perhaps, with this customer. If you sort of vetted that out, you're confident that your pipeline is pretty strong all the way through 2012? 
Michael R. Hsing: We have been working with a storage company for over a year. And last year the Thailand event didn't affected us and actually our product went according to schedule and always ahead of the schedule. And in 2012, we have a many more design win in the last year which will grow in 2012. 
Vernon P. Essi: Okay. So I guess, just to rephrase that then, you are obviously, at this point, confident that this was probably -- I mean and it sounds to me like this was probably your best horse in all the diversification efforts you've made. This is the one you're probably seeing the most demand through 2012 on a year-over-year basis? 
Meera Rao: This is a first horse, in effect. 
Michael R. Hsing: That said, this is the first horse, and we have other ones. And we have a set top box, LED lighting, industrial market, and especially control and safety. In all of these, and we will see a significant growth in this year and also in the next year. 
Vernon P. Essi: Okay. And this is my last point. You brought up the other horse, I'll stop using that analogy. On the LED front, you had an A19 incandescent win out of Japan. How do you feel about that market broadly, are you engaged with some of the top customers that are penetrating more on the western hemisphere, or are you sort of going to be playing more in the Asia-centric vendors? 
Michael R. Hsing: No. Just the way we probably just to have a significant wins in A19 incandescent bulb replacement, we just reported that was large win. And other ones that we have, of course, in the Northern America and Europe, we engage with all of these traditional light bulb makers. And we have many, many design wins. We haven't really been in the production yet. 
Vernon P. Essi: Okay. So you have got the design wins with some of these vendors, but none of them except this Japanese one is going into sort of a material production ramp? 
Michael R. Hsing: That's right, yes. 
Operator: The next questionnaire in queue is Steve Smigie with Raymond James. 
Jonathan Steven Smigie: Just some quick housekeeping items. What will the tax rate look like, I know you're going to this -- all these things -- how should we just draw a model, how should we be modeling this year? 
Meera Rao: In terms of the tax rate, I would say continue to use something like 5% to 10% tax rate, like you have used in the past. Our U.S. revenues are fairly low, so we have a certain amount of volatility from the discrete items, so, but somewhere like in the 5% to 10% range, I think sounds right. 
Jonathan Steven Smigie: Okay. Great. And then as we look out to the June quarter, typically I just take a mean of the June quarters in the past you guys hit a large number. I know you probably won't give guidance, but just how should we think about the seasonality for June and for September? 
Meera Rao: Typically Q2 is higher than Q1 and Q3 is higher than that, and it comes down in Q4. Beyond that, I don't want to give any color as to how high it could be, because the last few years have taught us that the seasonality patterns, other than directionally, we cannot predict it. 
Michael R. Hsing: And at the same time, the MPS business has sort of as we planned it last year, as a transition to higher value market, and we really don't know what's our seasonality, and we'll have to wait, and will play out. 
Jonathan Steven Smigie: Okay. So I mean, if you have maybe somewhat less consumer and more storage networking type products, should we maybe be a little bit more cautious on that, or am I going to shoot myself in the foot if I model that in an environment where it seems like everybody is sort of turning here and starting to ramp back up? 
Michael R. Hsing: If you look at our design win activity, then although that's not really a strong indicator of future revenue, but there is more reason for us not to believe we have a significant change. 
Jonathan Steven Smigie: Okay. Can you just give the 2011 breakout by end market? I think you guys may typically sort of give a year-end number. 
Meera Rao: Sure. The end markets were, consumer was about 39% to 43%, computing was -- actually let me rephrase that. Let me start again. Communications was about 39% to 43%; computing was about 17% to 21%; consumer was about 31% to 35%; and industrial and others were about 6% to 8%. 
Jonathan Steven Smigie: Okay. And within lighting, how much, at this point, is White LED, sort of general illumination, and CCFL? 
Michael R. Hsing: We don't have a CCFL any -- I mean, a very, very small portion of our revenue. 
Meera Rao: Less than a million. 
Michael R. Hsing: Yes. 
Meera Rao: Everything else is White LED. 
Jonathan Steven Smigie: Okay. Then how much would you say is sort of maybe the higher voltage, streetlight stuff versus sort of a lower voltage, maybe lightbulb replacement type stuff? 
Michael R. Hsing: I would say it's about, it is in the single million of dollars. And we expect that to increase in 2012, as the decline we talked about it kick in. 
Operator: Our next questioner in a queue is Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. 
Ross Seymore: In general, in the first quarter guidance, is there any big delta between the 3 main segments and how they are going to perform in your guidance as a whole? 
Meera Rao: We expect it to be roughly along the same lines that we have talked about. 
Ross Seymore: Okay. And then on the gross margin side of things, it's kind of coming out of a prior question, but perhaps in a different angle. Thinking about the fixed cost coverage and utilization, under-utilization charges, et cetera, is the general math that we talked about before that once you get back upward to the 60 million in revenue range that's kind of what we should equate to roughly 55% in gross margin? And then on top of that, as this year progresses, what general sort of mix impact do you think we should be considering with all the new products, kind of higher value add, industrial networking, et cetera, as that blends in, does that kind of round thing to up, or will the consumer side snap back and make mix potentially even a little bit more of a negative? 
Meera Rao: We expect gross margins overall for this year to stay around 52.5% range. In a quarter, if our revenues were to go up, if it were to go up to around $65 million range, then we would see some improvement in that quarter coming in from better absorption. So we still think, since we are targeting revenue growth, I would say that for the most part of the year, we will be at current levels of 52.5%. 
Michael R. Hsing: Well, let me add from that angle. Our consumer business, the percentage in revenue stream went down significantly, and I don't see this year it will increase and will keep going down. So the product, and also the high volume business, we reduce the cost significantly. So but at the same time, we still have older generations. So looking into the future, we don't see a significant reduction on the gross margin. We see it in the last 3 or 4 quarters, and we keep it steadily increase slightly. But we don't forecast a big improvement. 
Ross Seymore: Okay. I guess, the one part I am little confused on, I guess the fixed cost coverage to Meera's answer. But from your answer, Michael, it sounds like the mix component to the equation should be positive not only from the new products that you have but the cost down version of the older products. Shouldn't that mean that the mix is a positive contributor to gross margin along with the fixed cost coverage side? 
Michael R. Hsing: Yes. And I think the mix is the most, is the biggest contributor for the margin expansion. 
Ross Seymore: Great. And then I guess the last question, a little bit more housekeeping. On the litigation side of things, with the cases that you still have outstanding whatever those maybe, the kind of 600,000 you talked about for the first quarter. Is that kind of a new quarterly run rate, or would you expect that to change much with what you know today as the year progresses? 
Meera Rao: Yes, roughly, I think that's the levels that it's going to be at for the rest of the year. 
Operator: Next question in our queue is Rick Schafer with Oppenheimer. 
Richard Schafer: Lot of questions have been asked and answered, but one I have is, is there any way for you guys to quantify your design win dollars? I know you have a lot of design win activity over the last 12 months. Is there any way kind of -- for us to think about those dollars that are sort of on the com over the next year or 2? 
Michael R. Hsing: We try to do that. And we certainly, we have set a criteria what is called design wins. And some of the highly probable and the ones less probable. And we still try to figure out how to comment. And probably by next year this time, we can give you a better forecast based on the design win. At this time, it's difficult for us to say it. 
Richard Schafer: Okay. Okay. Understood. And then I know a lot of guys have asked the utilization question. I am going to ask you in a slightly different way. I am just curious, what is the drag, maybe Meera knows, if you know off the top of your head, but sort of per every 5 basis points of under-utilization equates to a percentage point or half a percent of gross margin drag. Is there a way for us to kind of think about that as we kind of look at you guys ramp towards that $65 million quarterly... 
Meera Rao: Sure. It is same as what we have said in the past. If you look from $48 million to go up to the $65 million, $70 million, there is 300 basis points that you could get as a pick up from just cost absorption. And so if I think every 2 or 3 -- we may not see it for $1 million or $2 million different, but every $2 million or $3 million of it, we'll see a pickup, a linear pickup, I would say that's the best way of looking at it. 
Richard Schafer: Great. That's super helpful. And then just maybe kind of a housekeeping question. But what are your turns requirement, at this point in the quarter, how does it compare to the same point last quarter, to make the midpoint of your guidance? 
Meera Rao: Usually, we don't give our turns business in numbers. But recognize that this is an unusual quarter. So we came in with very strong bookings into the quarter and -- so all I am going to say is that, at the beginning of the quarter, we needed less than 20% turns business to hit the midpoint of our guidance. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next questionnaire in queue is Tore Svanberg with Stifel Nicolaus. 
Tore Svanberg: Maybe some more specific questions. First of all, when you talk about storage being now a nice revenue contributor, are you talking specifically about for management to SSD, or is it something else? 
Michael R. Hsing: Both, HDD and SSD. 
Tore Svanberg: Very good. And when we think about BCD3, and you mentioned you can now go up to really high currents, what types of current are we talking about? And as you launch BCD4 in Q3, how much higher will you be able to go? 
Michael R. Hsing: We are now at a 40m curve single chip now. I don't remember the size, 3 by 4 package, millimeter package. 
Tore Svanberg: And with BCD4? 
Michael R. Hsing: With the BCD4, we haven't really released any product now. And the chip size will be, as Meera indicated and said earlier, about 20% to 15%, for the high current, and probably will be another 30% reduction from the size. And but we haven't released any product yet. 
Tore Svanberg: Very good. And maybe I -- either I misunderstand it or maybe you guys are just being conservative, but your inventory seems pretty depleted at this point, which probably means that you are going to have to build some inventory this quarter to keep up with demand. I mean, why wouldn't you already get some gross margins upside just from that alone regardless of mix? 
Michael R. Hsing: It is, the inventory is pretty low, but as you know, that the world is very -- in the recent periods, is very high, so we are play it very safe. 
Tore Svanberg: Very good. And Michael, I don't know if there is a way to measure there, or if you have this number, but just thinking about the diversification efforts, is there a way to put a percentage of revenue that's not coming from, let's say, new products introduced over the last 2, 3 years? 
Michael R. Hsing: Well, frankly, at this time, I don't have the numbers. And I am glad to answer you -- Meera, if you have -- okay, Meera, okay. 
Meera Rao: If you look in Q4 about 30%, 32% of our revenues came in from new products that we launched in the last 2 to 3 years. 
Operator: And at this time, I am showing no additional questionnaires in the queue. I would like to turn the program back over to Ms. Rao for any closing remarks. 
Meera Rao: Thank you for joining us on this call, and thank you for your many questions. We look forward to talking to you in the next quarter. Bye-bye. 
Michael R. Hsing: Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Again, ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day. Attendees, you may disconnect at this time.

Operator:  Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the third quarter 2010 Monolithic Power Systems earnings conference call. My name is Jennifer, and I’ll be your operator for today. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call conference over to your host for today, Rick Neely, Chief Financial Officer. Please proceed.
Rick Neely:  Good afternoon, and welcome to the third quarter fiscal year 2010 Monolithic Power Systems conference call. Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS is with me on today’s call. In the course of today’s conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty. These statements will cover a number of areas concerning our business outlook, including our business and financial outlook for the fourth quarter of 2010, projected fourth quarter 2010 revenues and gross margins, our expectations for fourth quarter litigations, stock based compensation, GAAP, and non-GAAP operating expenses, our target operating ranges for gross margins, net margins, and inventory, our expected average non-GAAP tax rate for 2010, our expected production capacity in future quarters, our belief that MPS is well positioned for future growth, the expected seasonality of our business, and our expectations for future cost reductions, and new product introductions, potential customer acceptance, and the opportunity these present, and the prospects of expanding our market share. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts, or guarantees of future performance or events, and are based on current expectations, estimates, beliefs, assumptions, goals, and objectives, and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by these statements. Risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in our SEC filings, including but not limited to our form 10-Q filed on July 28th, 2010, which is accessible through our website www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligations to update the information provided on today’s call. We will be discussing operating expense, net income, and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to this release as well as the reconciling tables that are posted on our website.  I’d also like to remind you that today’s conference call is being webcast live over the internet, and will be available for replay on our website for one year along with the earning release filed with SEC earlier today. I would like to start this call by reviewing our third quarter fiscal year 2010 business highlights. Following this update, I will discuss our operating results. We will conclude by discussing our expectations for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2010. We will then open up the call to your questions. Let’s start with the business highlights. In the third quarter, MPS experienced outstanding results growing revenues 37% from the third quarter of the prior year to achieve its third straight quarterly record figure with net sales up $65.8 million. This was a sequential increase of 18% from the prior quarter when MPS set its previous record quarterly revenue total. This notable revenue performance leads to our most profitable quarter in history with non-GAAP net income of $16.4 million, or 25% of sales. MPS saw very strong demand in the first three quarters of 2010 in all of its major brand markets. The third quarter saw substantial growth in our DC to DC and lighting control markets.  Our MiniMonster product family continues to progress crossing the $10 million quarterly run rate for the first time, which compares well to the $4 million we did in the third quarter of 2009. The new LDL family grew to $4 million in the quarter, a significant increase from a year ago when we sold less than $1 million in this family. The LDL products are being used in applications such as set-top boxes, flat-panel televisions, enterprise disc storage, and gaming machines.  In the lighting control segment, MPS had its best quarter ever for white LED-based devices shipping over $7 million in the third quarter compared with less than $3 million in the year ago quarter.  We continue to expand our footprint in computing applications with the introduction of the industry’s smallest monolithic 12-volt, 25-amp DC to DC step down converter for single staged power conversion applications in end markets, such as Enterprise Server, Storage, and Telethon Base stations. In our ongoing initiative to increase our total available market, we are excited to announce our entry into the AC to DC offline market. We recently announced a family of solutions for the one-watt to 300-watt AC to DC power conversion that will target all applications that plug into an AC outlet from TVs and white goods, to PCs and set-top boxes.  The success of our new products enabled MPS to reach 25% non-GAAP net profit as a percentage of sales for the quarter right at the midpoint of our new target range of 22% to 27% of sales. In the manufacturing area, gross margin was 54.7%, which is sequentially down from the second quarter of 2010, but within our expected guidance range of 54% to 56% of sales. Our internal days of inventory improved slightly to 59 days as production started to catch up to the strong demand we have seen the first nine months of this year. Inventory dollars at our distributors ended the quarter above our target range of 30 to 45 days as we were unable to adjust our inventory levels at our distributors quickly enough in response to an anticipated decline in demand for our products in the future quarter. These near-turn demand fluctuations that caused our fourth quarter outlook to diminish.  Bottom line, non-GAAP net income was $16.4 million, or $0.43 per fully diluted share. This resulted in non-GAAP net income of 25% of revenue. Our non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was – our GAAP net income for the third quarter was $13.2 million, or $0.35 per fully diluted share.  Now, let’s look at the financials in more detail. Starting with the P&L on the revenue line, our third quarter 2010 net revenues of $55.8 million increased 18% sequentially from the second quarter of 2010, and were up 37% from the $48 million recorded in the third quarter of 2009.  Looking at our revenue by product type, third quarter DC to DC product sales were $55.2 million up 21%, or $9.7 million from the second quarter of 2010, and up 50% from the $36.7 million recorded in the same quarter a year ago.  This dollar growth was led by our general purpose DC to DC products, but about ½ of the year-over-year growth was contributed by our MiniMonster and LDL product families that I descried earlier in this conference call.  The largest end markets for MPS in the DC to DC product family continued to be flat-panel TVs, general consumer electronics products, set-top boxes, routers, and wireless LAN cards. Lighting control revenues for the second quarter were $9.4 million, which was up 25% from the $7.5 million we did in the second quarter of 2010, and an increase of 10% from the same quarter a year ago. Our newer white LED driver products are taking charge of this segment, as we did over $7 million in white LED revenue compared with $4 million in the prior quarter, and less than $3 million in the same quarter a year ago. We are finding new design success in flat panel monitors, notebook computers, and general consumer products for our white LED chips.  Our traditional CCFL invertors and CCFL controllers make up the remainder of the revenue in this segment. This decline in traditional CCFLs is likely to continue as it reflects the continuing shift of notebook and other back lighting solutions from CCFL to white LED solutions.  Audio revenues came in at $1.2 million, down from the $2.6 million MPS did in the prior quarter, and down from the $2.7 million recorded in the third quarter of 2009. Let’s move down to the gross margin line. Our third quarter gross margin was 54.7%, down from the 58.2% we did in the prior quarter of 2010, and down from the 60.7% in the third quarter of 2009.  This result was in line with our expectations and guidance for the quarter. We recently adjusted our target financial model to focus on top line and bottom line growth as we expect to participate in several new fast-growing market segments with different margin profiles than in the past, which has an impact of 1% to 2% points.  We are also still shipping the higher priced wafers we bought earlier in the year, which impacted our reported gross margins by about 2% points. Let’s look at our reported expenses and operating margins. On a GAAP basis, our operating expenses were $22.6 million in the third quarter. This includes $21.6 million in R&D and SGA expense, which includes $4.1 million for stock compensation expense, and litigation expense of $964,000. Compared with the second quarter of 2010, GAAP operating expenses were down by $3.1 million. The expense mixed changed as follows. R&D decreased by $494,000. SGA decreased by $1.3 million. Litigation decreased by $1.3 million. As a result, our GAAP operating profit of 20.4% was individually up in the third quarter of 2010 compared to our GAAP operating profit of 12.2% in the second quarter of 2010. Compared to the third quarter of 2009, our GAAP operating expenses were up by $222,000 excluding the litigation provision reversal of $6.4 million. R&D expense was up $1.2 million. SG&A increased by $858,000, and litigation expense was down by $1.8 million compared to the third quarter of 2009. Let’s review our non-GAAP operating expenses. Excluding stock compensation, our non-GAAP operating expenses for the third quarter of 2010 were $18.5 million, down $1.7 million from the $20.2 million we spent in the second quarter of 2010, and down $773,000 from the $19.2 million we spent in the third quarter of 2009, excluding the litigation provision reversal of $6.4 million. The sequential decrease in non-GAAP third quarter spending was primarily driven by lower litigation expense as we have completed the ITC case that covered our older CCFL parts. Our combined R&D and SG expenses were down $482,000 for the second quarter of 2010. Compared to the third quarter of 2009, non-GAAP R&D costs were up by $973,000 as we continued to grow our new product offerings and R&D teams. Non-GAAP SG&A spending was only slightly up $101,000 from Q3 of the prior year as efficiencies in the G&A area have offset increased sales and rep commissions. Finally, litigation expense in the third quarter was $964,000, which was down $1.8 million with compared to the third quarter of 2009. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 27% in the third quarter of 2010 compared with 22% in the prior quarter of 2010, and 21% in the third quarter of 2009, a very good performance.  Switching to the bottom line, on a GAAP basis, our Q3 2010 net income was $13.2 million, or $0.35 per fully diluted share. On a non-GAAP basis, our Q3 2010 net income was $16.4 million, or $0.43 per fully diluted share. This result is computed with a non-GAAP tax rate of 7.5%. Let’s look at some of the major changes to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents, and investments were $204.4 million at the end of the third quarter of 2010, down from the $209.3 million at the end of the second quarter of 2010, but up substantially from the $169.2 million we had on the books in the same quarter one year ago. In Q3, MPS had operating cash flow of about $17 million. We purchased capital equipment and outfitted our new R&D building in Chengdu, China for a total of about $7.2 million in the third quarter, which was offset by cash proceeds of $2.3 million from option exercises and employee stock sales. MPS announced a $50 million stock buyback effective from August 2010 until December of 2011 in our last conference call. Under this program, we’ve bought back approximately 983,000 shares for a total of $17 million in the third quarter.  Accounts receivable ended the third quarter at $32.3 million compared with $30.3 million at the end of the second quarter of 2010, and $19.5 million at the end of the third quarter of 2009. The increase in receivables from the prior quarter was a result of our third quarter in a row of record revenues, and higher shipments than normal for the third month of a quarter. Days sales outstanding decreased to 45 days in Q3, 2010 as a result of the elements I just described. In Q2 of 2010, our DSOs were 50 days, and in Q3 of 2009, they were 37 days. Our internal inventories at the end of the third quarter remain low at $19.5 million, or at about 59 days of inventory on a historical basis as a result of the continuation of our record quarterly shipments in the third quarter. This compares with $14.5 million, or 57 days of inventory at the end of the second quarter of 2010. Inventory in our distribution channels grew in dollars as a result of the Q3 revenue increase. And total days of distributor inventory exceeded the upper end of our target range of 30 to 45 days by about $4 to $5 million. The increased level of distributor inventory was a result of two key factors, both of which are non-recurring. First, we’ve had very extended lead times due to product shortages for several quarters causing distributors to put orders on our books earlier than normal. And to keep those orders in place for fear of not getting supplies their end customers need.  Secondly, when the fourth quarter demand deteriorated in September, we were unable to adjust their inventory levels quickly enough by reducing our shipments. In response, we have modified our inventory review procedures. We expect to be better equipped to track and respond to changes in demand and inventory levels at our distributors. We expect to burn off most of this excess distributor inventory in the fourth quarter. I would like to turn to a discussion of general business conditions. MPS has had a robust nine month period hitting all time quarterly revenue records three quarters in a row. Geographically, in the third quarter of 2010, MPS shipped 52% of revenues to Taiwan and China, and 38% to other regions with Europe and Japan performing particularly well in Q3. By segment, MPS had excellent growth in the communications and computing segments primarily driven by new router and set top box business, and new notebook power, and white LED back lighting wins. Last quarter, we introduced a new white LED driver for the high growth incandescent bulb and CFL to replacement lighting markets. This product interfaces to a universal off-line input from 65 volts AC to 255 volts AC.  We’ve significantly increased the number of power supply rails we support with the introduction of the industry’s highest current density 6-amp to 25-amp, 12-volt to 21-volt DC to DC step down converters. Our 6-amp to 10-amp point of load solutions operated an input voltage as high as 28 volts ideal for notebook PC and industrial applications. And are housed in a tiny 3 by 4 millimeter QFN package.  Similarly, our monolithic 25-amp buck includes a 10-milione high side set, and a 3-milione low side set, and comes in a tiny 6 by 6 millimeter QFN package.  We also expanded our set top box and TV footprints with the introduction of our ASST power supply for the low noise block, commonly referred as CLND.  I would now like to turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2010. Which Q3 2010 was another revenue quarter for MPS, we have seen a drop in bookings activities for the fourth quarter for several reasons.  First, our lead times remained well above average until late in the third quarter as we were constrained by product supply. This situation made it difficult to follow the true end product demand because our distributors were reluctant to cancel their backlog. It now appears that end demand for products such as flat panel TVs, monitors, and other general consumer products will decline in the fourth quarter more than seasonally. And this will impact our fourth quarter revenues by about $6 to $7 million.  Secondly, our lack of product availability earlier this year and the high volume TV and monitor markets forced several major customers in Korea to seek alternative suppliers. This will impact our near-term revenue outlook by another $6 to $7 million per quarter. Finally, as we mentioned above, we will burn off our excess distributor inventory in the fourth quarter, which will have a revenue impact of approximately $4 to $5 million.  In total, we project fourth quarter 2010 revenues in the range of $45 to $50 million. We expect gross margin in the 50% to 52% range primarily due to underutilized capacity in our test areas, which will have an impact of approximately 3% points in comparison to Q3, 2010. Our overall gross margin continues to be impacted by higher than normal wafer prices that were purchased earlier this year, which accounts for approximately another 2% points of gross margin compared to the second quarter of this year. We expect stock based compensation expense in the range of $4.2 to $4.6 million. We expect non-GAAP research and development, and selling, general, and administrative expense to decline to the range of $17.5 to $18.5 million. This estimate excludes the stock compensation estimate mentioned above.  We expect litigation expense approximately flat to the third quarter at $1 million. Finally, we expect our non-GAAP tax rate to remain in the range of 5% to 10% based on our sales and profit patterns global. In conclusion, while we were pleased to report three consecutive record revenue quarters, our revenue outlook in the near term is below our performance in the most recent quarters. We will be working hard to improve our planning, forecasting, and demand management process. We believe that the breath of new products with good technology advantages in new market segments will get MPS back to the expected levels of revenue growth that have always characterized our company. Now, we would like to open the microphone and take your questions.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Steve Smigie from Raymond James. Please proceed.
Steve Smigie – Raymond James :  Great. Thanks, guys. I was hoping we could talk a little bit about on the revenue guidance, you mentioned there I think about six to seven inventory work downs or something of that matter. And then another six to seven that will affect you for the quarters going before.  If we were to not have the inventory work down, you’d still be probably six to seven below the peak going forward assuming things stayed as they were. I’m just trying to understand, you know, the nature of that, the revenue change there going forward. 
Rick Neely: Yeah, Steve, I’ll start out and then Steve Pratt, our Marketing Director is also with us on the call and he may chip in later.  Yes, you’re correct. There’s three elements to the revenue drop. One is we lost some business at several premium TV makers that was a 6 to $7 million reduction in the quarterly revenue outlook. There’s another 6 to $7 million that we would call seasonality or low-demand combination. And then the 4 to $5 million of just your inventory that we ended up at the end of Q3, more inventory in our distribution channel than we normally have. That 4 to $5 million that we burned off in Q4, so that’s 4 to 5 million distributor inventory, 6 to 7 million seasonality and demand and 6 to 7 million of the loss of business in the Korean TV market. 
Steve Smigie – Raymond James : Okay. So as I think about seasonality for Q1, you’re normally down quite a bit, but it sounds like you’re burning through a lot of that stuff already in Q4. How should we think about Q1 seasonality given how much stuff has come down here I guess in this quarter? 
Rick Neely:  Well, I think that’s going to depend on demand. We usually don’t like to go out and give any outlook for Q1. We’re probably going to stick with that process. So I would just assume normal seasonality for Q1 at this point. 
Michael Hsing:  Yes. That’s what we’ve planned to have, and the market is not very stable, although in the last few weeks we see the demand has stabilized and now we’re planning for a normal seasonality – a seasonal change in the Q1 quarters. 
Steve Smigie – Raymond James : Great. If I could just sneak one more in. I think there was about 200 basis points you mentioned of gross margin that you used because you’re using the high-cost wafer that you had to use. When have you burned through those wafers that you get that bump back up that you’re using floor-cost wafers again? 
Michael Hsing:  At this time, clearly we’re still buying higher wafer – higher-priced wafers. And as a fab capacity normally the price will reduce. It hasn’t happened now.
Steve Smigie – Raymond James : Okay, great. Thanks. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. 
Ross Seymore – Deutsche Bank:  Yeah, this is Bob in for Ross. I had a question about your utilization charge. Is that kind of a one-quarter phenomena and you can bring back utilization as a back-end facilities, or do you expect kind of that to persist a little bit longer? 
Rick Neely:  That’s a good question, Bob. Yes, the outlet that we talked about, there’s about a 3 percentage point hit to our gross margin in the Q4 guidance because of that. And as you know, we had a huge demand this year. We put in the capacity in terms of testers, people, building – increased the size of the building, moved people out into an RD building and so forth to be able to handle $70 million plus.  So in the near term, when the revenue drops significantly from say 65.7 to the 45 to $50 million range, we can’t adjust that capacity. So as capacity – as revenues improve next year, we should be able to absorb that. We can’t predict when that’s going to be, but when we get closer to $60 million in revenue we should be able to absorb most of that manufacturing capacity. That really relieved our test area. 
Ross Seymore – Deutsche Bank: Fair enough. And then, so it looks like you’re kind of – given the current demand outlook and also the fact that you had a pretty straight CapEx number this quarter, what are you kind of thinking about CapEx for next quarter and then maybe – I don’t know, if you want to talk more on a sustainable level as a percentage of revenue or what you think that number should be? 
Rick Neely: We expect to do 20 to 25 million in CapEx this year, and that’s relative to finishing off the building in Chengdu and so forth. Our typical CapEx is around 10 to $12 million a year. So we’re about double this year because of the new building and additional testers. 
Ross Seymore – Deutsche Bank: Thanks, guys. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Gus Richard from Piper Jaffray. Please proceed. 
Gus Richard – Piper Jaffray: Yeah, thanks for taking my question. I terms of the Korean customers, you know, where you lost share, is that permanent? Is that just because you haven’t been able to deliver on time? Can you sort of talk about the loss and then sort of the plans going forward? 
Steve Pratt:  Yeah. Hey, Gus, this is Steve. So you know, I have to go back a little bit in time to answer this question in full.  In 2008 we saw the transition from CCFL business to white LED. So we went into 2009 really attacking all the sockets, all the opportunities we could, especially in the TV and monitor business, and we did a great job. That was reflected in our growth in 2010 revenue. You compound that success in our market penetration with the TV market exploding in 2010, which was unforecasted caught us by surprise. We spent two quarters not being able to deliver to the customers real demand and that pain felt at the customer level in some cases, they eventually had to seek other alternatives. In certain specific applications, specifically TVs and monitors, and impacted us most in the Korean market.  Is it permanent? No. In some cases it’s shorter term and other cases it’s building back up that relationship and catching the next design cycle. 
Gus Richard – Piper Jaffray: Got it. And then could you speak a little bit – there’s been, I believe, some turnover in the sales force. Can you talk a little bit about that and sort of the plans going forward? 
Michael Hsing:  Okay. Well, this is Michael. As we said it before, you know, in your conference, we completely change – upgraded our sales force and we have all new management in place now. 
Gus Richard – Piper Jaffray: Okay. So pretty much – you’re through this process at this point? Is that correct? 
Michael Hsing:  Yes. And so we finished the changing now. 
Gus Richard – Piper Jaffray: Okay. All right. Thanks so much. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Vernon Essi from Needham and Company. Please proceed. 
Vernon Essi – Needham & Company: Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask going into 2011 on the OpEx front, what should we be thinking about with your R&D levels? I mean, they’ve grown nicely in 2010 [inaudible] products going out. Should we be seeing sort of the similar growth rate in our R&D, or how should that play out? 
Rich Neely :  Yeah. I think that the commitment of the company, the technology and product in the company, that’s the one area we’ll probably continue to hire people and expand new product expenses. The only comment – I’ll turn it over to Michael for more comments, but the only other comment is, as you know with our – I believe we have our OpEx put together, Vern, we have a variable compensation component and if profits decline, some of our profit sharing decline and our expenses decline. We’re seeing that already in the Q4 guidance.  So there’s no recent declines in OpEx based on those kind of variable expenses that we’ve talked about, but in terms of actually cutting back on new products, I don’t think so. 
Michael Hsing:  In the R&D side, all expenses, we have to stay reasonable – to a reasonable level, and you were expected the same of – in the same level of the 2010. 
Vernon Essi – Needham & Company: Okay. So expect, are you just saying, expect it to be sort of flattish in terms of dollars? 
Michael Hsing: And slightly higher, slightly higher in the 2011. 
Vernon Essi – Needham & Company: Okay. And then, Rick, just sort of my follow-up question that to revisit – I guess your analysis of the distribution channel in sort of fixing what you perceive to be the problem, how far back has this been going on? I guess one concern people may have is does this happen all the way back from the earlier this year onward, and will we be at sort of a depressed revenue level as a result going into 2011? Or do you feel this is really sort of a one-quarter phenomena? 
Rick Neely:  No, I think it’s a one-quarter phenomena of an overshoot. I think you’ve heard a few other companies talk about excess distributed inventory as well in their calls. And all the – remember, in the first two quarters of the year we had no inventory. The distributors had about 30 days and they weren’t even at the – in Q2 they were at the lower end of the range and some of them were underneath the range.  So up until probably September, they never had enough parts. A lot of our parts ran allocations until recently and the lead time has only recently come down. So the distributors were left with the dilemma of – I’ve had 16–week lead times, where if you didn’t put a four-month border in, and remember, MPS normally hs 6 and 8-week lead times, and we generally turn half our business every quarter.  So our distributor normally doesn’t have to put any new business in front of you for maybe 8 to 10 weeks out. Now we’re telling them to put an order out in 16 weeks head. So he’s got to do that, or he can’t get the parts. So the tradeoff is, do I keep the order, do I push it out, do I disappoint my customers? So they kept holding onto their backlogs until September-October when clearly there’s a lower demand. You can see the TV business is getting down, the monitor business is down, other consumer products are down.  So for Q4, it’s not an issue of the being able to sell, they’ll simply sell it through in Q4, but they won’t be ordering as much from us, and I think that’s pretty much a near-term correction.  The only other comment I can say to that is, you know, we don’t really know what the Q1-Q2 demands are going to be, but I don’t think it would be related to – we should get most that inventory flushed out in Q4. 
Vernon Essi – Needham & Company: Right. Okay. That’s helpful. Thanks a lot. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg from Stifel Nicolaus. Please proceed. 
Evan Wang – Stifel Nicolaus & Company: Yes, hi. This is Evan Wang calling in for Tore Svanberg. I would like to ask you about your new products that you mentioned in your prepared remarks. AC Power and white LED lighting. Could you give some more specifics on these new products; specifically, when do you think these might see some revenue growth – contribute to your revenue growth? 
Steve Pratt:  This is Steve. So I’ll take one product group at a time; both of the brand new for us in 2010. On the white LED front, we entered into the white LED space with backlighting as an extension of our CCFL business. So – and white LED lighting now getting into bulb replacement. These products that we’re introducing for the last six – well, we started back in 2009 with some streetlight applications and now we’re getting into the more mainstream bulb replacement this year.  We’ll see in 2011, single-digit type revenues. It takes time to get the design in and there’s a number of customers, a very fragmented market and we just have the – we’re doing the promotional campaign into the build replacement now as we speak. So we’re just getting into that space.  And then in AC Power, this too is a very MPS and we’re going to selectively go after the AC-offline universal input global type of AC applications. Especially if they’re related to a system solutions cell. If we have the white LED driver, we can also include the AC off light component of that. And that’s something that’s very unique compared to our peers.  And the revenue contribution, again, since especially since we’re going to be selective in our AC offline penetration, it will gradually grow through to 2011, but be relatively insignificant in 2011. 
Evan Wang – Stifel Nicolaus & Company: Just to clarify about your answer, so are you sort of implying that the AC Power would not be sold independently of the white LED drivers? 
Michael Hsing:  No. We see – this is Michael. We see the AC to DC power, it’s a big market and we’re selectively chose some very high-energy efficiency related product. We address only those to those market. That’s included in, as Steve said earlier in the LED lighting applications. 
Steve Pratt: Okay. So what Michael and I are saying is that if we – we’re going to be selective and it could be standalone offline solutions but it’s really where we add value, not just customers looking for a lower cost alternative. 
Evan Wang – Stifel Nicolaus & Company: Okay. Thank you for that clarification. My follow-up question is about your gross margin operating margin target model. You had said on the last earnings call that you were revising the model to 55% gross margin, 27% operating margin. Looking at your Q4 guidance and your run rate going forward, especially your OpEx plan, how should we think about you reaching your operating margin target ? What kind of timeframe are you looking at, and how might you [inaudible]? 
Rich Neely:  Okay, Evan. I’ll start out the answer and then turn it over to Michael. On the gross margin model, we still feel that that’s the right model, the 50 to 55. If we, you know, if we can – if the wafer costs go back to normal and we can absorb our capacity back, we would be about 55 points. So 55 to 56 points. So we’re about – we feel we’re – except of those extraordinary issues, we don’t feel there’s any problem with the 50 to 55% range. Although admittedly in the near term, it will take us a few quarters to get those two factors that he raised. So on the rest of it, Mike can comment. 
Michael Hsing:  Yes. As Rick said, earlier it’s kind of a disappointment in – but overall the company is in a good foundation and we haven’t changed any – have any strategy shift. In the first nine months we demonstrate we can go to topline and we can increase the bottom lines by huge amount. And we’ll continue that path. However, in the next couple of quarters, we do have a big hole to fill because the absence of Korean TV market. But in the few quarter after that, we believe we can grow out of that. 
Evan Wang – Stifel Nicolaus & Company: Thank you for answering my question. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Wang from Wedbush Securities. Please proceed. 
Patrick Wang – Wedbush Securities : Great, thanks. The first question I wanted to just follow up on the gross margin comments. You know, I want to kind of back out some of your one-time, your underutilization charges and your wafer – high-wafer cost. I guess it’s something kind of like 55 to 56%. I’m just curious, you know, when you think a little bit longer term when the market starts to stabilize a bit here, what do you think your steady margins would be I guess in the second half of next year, say all things equal.  And then just on that same line of thought here, your underutilization charges from your backend facility, when that does come back up sometime first quarter, I’m just curious, you know, how long does the other utilization charges hang around for? 
Michael Hsing:  Well, okay, all things equal, other than after the wafer cost reduced to a normal level, to a previous level, because we anticipated a huge growth in this year, we didn’t bought a lot of expensive wafers. And if we – if the price goes back to – down to the normal levels and if everything else keep it the same, and if we keep – we have a runway up to 50 to $60 million revenue per quarter, our gross margin will be somewhere in about 54 to 56% level. 
Patrick Wang – Wedbush Securities : Okay. And the, other utilization charges, how long does that hang around for? 
Rick Neely:  I think it’s reflective of you’ve got to get the – you’ve got to get your volume revenues up to absorb it. Again, it’s mostly fixed costs, so when we get to those revenue levels that Michael talked about, that’s when it would be fully absorbed. It will be partially absorbed along the way, but – 
Michael Hsing:  It will be partially from where we are – 
Rick Neely:  From where we are now to 60, but that’s what we see. 
Patrick Wang – Wedbush Securities : Okay. I mean, I guess my question is more directed towards the cycle time here. You know, it just takes, you know, I don’t know, three months to kind of get through that, or is this just one month? How quickly those charges disappear? 
Rick Neely:  Well, on the fab side, or on the test side it’s, you know, or cycle time is pretty short. In getting back, your other question, I can understand it better. We are still using the wafers we bought earlier in the year. There’s a three-month cycle time and then we’ve actually, since our demand has dropped, we are currently slowing down our labor purchases, but we still have in our fab whip line all the higher-priced wafers and that will continue through Q4 at least and probably into Q1. We had said that before that when we said in the last conference call we expect a 54 to 56% all year because of those higher-priced wafers; we weren’t going to be able to get them out of our web through this year and now it looks like that’s true for sure and will probably go somewhat into Q1. 
Patrick Wang – Wedbush Securities : Got you. Okay. And my other question had to do with revenues. I can you guys just talk a little bit about, you know, the – about some of the share loss that Korea, you know, how that impacted some of your other business as those customers, you know, if you guys have – are kind of on a black list for a period of time?  And then also, based on your conservative guidance, how much visibility in backlog coverage do you have here? Thanks. 
Rick Neely:  Steve, you want to start? 
Steve Pratt:  Yeah, sure. So some of – I answered some of this in the previous question, but just to follow up, you know, it’s ongoing with the TV market and Korea. In some customers it’s getting back the relationship, and we have not – really the biggest hit for MPS has been one application segment and that’s the TVs and monitors. So in other – in the large customers where they’re broad based and they’re into other applications such as networkings and [inaudible]. There is an overall MPS short-term issue at the accounts. They haven’t removed us, they haven’t found an alternative across the board in every application. Really, it was a select number of products focused in one application segment and we have to grow our way back in there. We have to get our reputation back in order and that will take some time.  And another significant TV monitor customer in Korea, we basically worked with them on making some tough choices in a particular design cycle and so our opportunity is as soon as the next design cycle in 2011. 
Michael Hsing:  We still have a lot of the clients in Korea. These are the storage – SST and – 
Steve Pratt:  There’s SST, there’s Top Box, there’s General networking, there’s cards, networking cards. There’s also the – 
Michael Hsing:  And LED. We still have a lot of revenue and we expect it to get in the 2011. The only setback is in the TV side, which – DC DC in for TV application, which we exposed in the – we have a very large exposure in the first nine months. 
Patrick Wang – Wedbush Securities : Okay. That’s helpful. And then can you help out with the backlog coverage? 
Rick Neely:  With backlog, we don’t give out backlog numbers because as they said, they’re not a reliable indicator in the quarter. But we do try and put our guidance together such that we’re comfortable with the revenue guidance range I would say we’re comfortable with the revenue guidance range that we put out. 
Patrick Wang – Wedbush Securities : Okay, great. Thanks so much, guys. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Doug Freedman from Gleacher and Company. Please proceed.
Doug Freedman – Gleacher & Company: Thanks for taking my question, guys. You know, if I could focus a little bit on the booking side of the equation, Rick you were able to give us what your sales outlook looked like, sort of linearly, can you tell us sort of how the bookings have progressed, not only during the quarter, but now that we’re about a month into the fourth quarter, how bookings have looked? Maybe give us a little bit of insight into what the book-to-bill will look like, maybe what you think book-to-bill is going to look like? 
Rick Neely:  Well, we actually don’t do the book-to-bill for the same reason as we’re a high-turns business and usually do 50/50. This is also been a very unusual nine months for the company. We’ve had more backlog than we’ve ever had because we’ve had parts in allocation. We’ve often had backlog much higher than these. Back in Q3 we had backlog higher than the quarter number because a lot of people were ordering parts we couldn’t deliver. We couldn’t even schedule them.  So looking at those numbers hasn’t really been able to help us out on the booking side. What we really see this quarter is when people took – the distributors took the orders and they rescheduled them into different periods, we didn’t release any cancelations, we just did what we call push out to reschedule. The distributor still wants the parts, they just don’t want as many in the current period.  So mostly in Q4, the bookings number wouldn’t tell you the activity, it’s really the backlog is in good shape, it’s mostly been rescheduled from the Q3 time, Q4 time. 
Michael Hsing:  Yeah, in the quarters we see push out and then we see pulling all within a couple of weeks times. 
Doug Freedman – Gleacher & Company: Are you still seeing push outs presently? I mean, are we – can you give us a sense of what you’ve seen in the last couple of weeks? 
Rick Neely:  Michael said it’s stabilized. 
Michael Hsing:  Yeah – 
Rick Neely:  It seems to be stabilized at this moment. 
Michael Hsing:  Yeah, stabilized in the beginning of the quarter we see a – well, not in the beginning, but in the middle of a quarter, so we see a lot of push out and then we see pull in now to sort of stabilize it. 
Doug Freedman – Gleacher & Company: Okay. Can you talk a little bit about what you’re seeing as far as ASP trends? It’s quite common when lead times do come in that we, you know, pricing has not been a real hot button for anybody lately, but now that lead times are returning to normal in the industry, are you starting to see early signs that customers are more price sensitive? You guys are going to be more price sensitive trying to buy wafers better, are your customers not going to be asking for lower prices as well? 
Michael Hsing:  Actually, our ASP is a very stable throughout the years. So customer now – customer is always out for lower – lower price and I think it’s a bigger issue for us is still dealing with the shipment allocation we just gone through that and that’s our biggest relationship issues with our customers. 
Doug Freedman – Gleacher & Company: Okay. Thank you. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Brian Piccioni from BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Brian Piccioni – BMO Capital Markets: Yes. So you can imagine most of my questions have been asked and answered. I was wondering if we could maybe get back to the new product comments, just in particular the AC to DC products. If you could maybe go into a little bit more detail. I mean, it’s a space that you’re relatively new to and one that has a lot of existing players. How do you expect to distinguish yourself in that space, and you know, if you could be specific as to the type of applications that you think you’re products will be particularly suited to. Thanks. 
Michael Hsing:  Okay. I’ll start first and then Steven can. It is a very large well-established market. At the same time there’s a lot of new requirements, EnergyStar and the European Code of Conduct, and also in China and Japan have a similar kind of requirements. That opened the door for MPS because we have these high-voltage technology, a process technology. We can – we have the capability as we go over a 1,000 volts on one – on the integrated power – version. So we don’t use a discrete device. There are very unique technologies and because of these new requirements, new regulations, they’ve really opened the door for a company like MPS. 
Steve Pratt:  And just to add a little bit more color on this, the market is huge. So like we’ve said earlier, we – our strategy is to really focus on the solution sell. So our first targets are where we’re already into existing accounts where the system is transitioning to meet EnergyStar requirements and have to switch their systems to have better light-load efficiency. For example, a set-top box, we’re already well entrenched into that space. It’s relatively easy for us to migrate in to the AC offline section there. Another good example is white LED lighting, the illumination segment of that. That’s an easier solution for MPS where we can add some value there completing the solution from AC all the way to DC driving the LEDs. Another example is where they meet the highest efficiency performance, like an adaptor. Some of the set-top boxes use adapters. That would be a target, adaptors for notebooks that are trying to get smaller, higher efficiency, less power dissipation, no load deficiency. 
Michael Hsing:  We are not talking about either general adopters for notebooks. Some are small, very ultra-mobile if you will and also these are mobile units and these require a very small, ultra-small adapters. Those are the areas we can provide value. 
Brian Piccioni – BMO Capital Markets:  Okay. Thanks for the background. I appreciate it. Thank you. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Nicholas Burley [ph] from Janney Capital Markets. Please proceed. 
Nicholas Burley [ph] Janney Capital Markets: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Not to bring up Korea again, but just looking at the 6 to $7 million decline that you guys are assuming for Q4, are there more designs coming in the first half that would continue to show some bleed on that front, or is that 6 to $7 million kind of worse-case scenario for what you guys are expecting? 
Rick Neely:  I’m just trying to clarify the question. You said, we expect – and this is a design loss, so they would carry forward into the next quarter if that’s your question. 
Nicholas Burley [ph] Janney Capital Markets: Are there more designs that are coming behind us that are going to be lost, or is this just one design cycle that all the sudden is just turning off and going – 
Rick Neely:  Okay. So there’s a combination. There’s some accounts where the design will carry over into 2011 and then there are other opportunities where we have to catch the next design cycle which happens also in 2011. So some are shorter term than others. 
Michael Hsing:  The question you asked, are there any other major second design, other like a 6 to $7 million magnitude lost in the Q1 and the answer is no. Only the major impact is the Korean customers. The other ones we haven’t – we don’t lose any major customers. 
Nicholas Burley [ph] Janney Capital Markets: Got you, yeah. I’m basically just trying to – I mean, backing into it, maybe 10 to $15 million worth of design wins that are going to be – that I need to take out of the model for 2011. I just was wondering if that’s the correct number roughly? 
Michael Hsing:  Oh no. All our new product we have introduced in the last couple of years and while in progress, still we can make a comment on it. All these LDLs as Rick said earlier, we start to have revenue ramping. 
Rick Neely:  There’s definitely other opportunities that are going to. 
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Rick Neely for closing remarks. 
Rick Neely:  Thank you everybody for – this was a long call and we look forward to talking with you next quarter. Thanks. 
Operator:  Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today’s conference. Thank you for your participation You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the second quarter 2010 Monolithic Power Systems, Incorporated earnings conference call. My name is Chanel and I’ll be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. We will be facilitating question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. (Operator Instructions).  As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Rick Neely, CFO. Please proceed.
Rick Neely: Good afternoon and welcome to the second quarter fiscal year 2010 Monolithic Power Systems conference call. Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS, is with me on today's call. In the course to today's conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risks and uncertainties. For example, our business outlook, including our business and financial outlook for the third quarter of 2010, projected third quarter 2010 revenues, gross margins and net margins, our expectations of the third quarter litigation, stock-based compensation and non-GAAP operating expenses; our target operating range for gross margins, net margins, and inventory; our expectations for revenue and net income growth beyond Q3 2010; our expected average non-GAAP tax rate for 2010; our expected production capacity in future quarters; our belief that MPS is well-positioned for future growth; the expected seasonality of our business and our expectations for future cost reductions and new product introductions; potential customer acceptance and the opportunities these present and the prospects of expanding our market share. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts or guarantees of future performance or events and are based on current expectations, estimates, beliefs, assumption, goals and objectives and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by these statements.  Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in our SEC filings, including but not limited to, our Form 10-K filed on April 29th, 2010 which is accessible through our website, www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today's call. We will be discussing operating expense and net income on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude charges related to stock-based compensation and in the case of net income, their related tax effects. We will also discuss our expected non-GAAP research and development and selling, general and administrative expense for the third quarter of 2010, which excludes our expected charges related to stock-based compensation. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I’d refer investors to this release, as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our website. I'd also like to remind you that today's conference call is being webcast live over the Internet and will be available for replay on our website for one year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. We would like to start this call by reviewing our second quarter fiscal year 2010 business highlights. Following this update, I will discuss our operating results. We will conclude by discussing our expectations for the third fiscal quarter of 2010. We will then open up the call to your questions. Let's start with the business highlights. In the second quarter, MPS experienced the best quarter in its history, growing revenue at 35% from the second quarter of the prior year to hit record net sales of $55.7 million. This figure is not only a new quarterly record for MPS, but it is a sequential increase of 11% from the prior quarter, when MPS set its previous record quarterly revenue total. This outstanding revenue performance also leads to our most profitable quarter in history with non-GAAP net income of $11.7 million. MPS continues to see strong demand in all of its major end markets and our second quarter revenues were limited by product’s availability, not customer orders. This quarter, MPS saw substantial growth in our DC to DC market. Our fastest growing product family in this segment continues to be our MiniMonster products.  MiniMonster sales grew over 255% from the second quarter of 2009 to over $9 million for the second quarter of 2010. MPS continues to rollout new MiniMonster solutions to support design activity for products such as the 2011 model year flat panel TV monitor and Blu-ray players.  In addition, we expanded our served available markets with the industry’s highest current density, highest input voltage, integrated DC to DC buck converters for computing and industrial application. We’ve also added to our industrial, telecom and networking portfolios for new introduction a 55-volt high-current DC to DC boost regulator that leverages our high-voltage and high-current process technology strength. In the lighting market, we introduced our first offline high brightness while LED driver for the LCD TD market and a 12 plus channel white LED drivers with expandability for large LCD panels.  The revenue growth opportunities that MPS is finding with our new products are driving an improved longer term outlook for our financial model. We now feel confident that for the third quarter of 2010, we can target non-GAAP net profit in the range of 22% to 27% sales as our new models up from our prior target of 20% to 25% of sales. In the manufacturing area, gross margin was 58.2% which was sequentially flat from the first quarter of 2010 and down slightly from the 59.1% gross margin recorded in the second quarter of 2009. Our internal days of inventory fell further to 57 days as very strong end demand kept us well below our target inventory range. Inventory dollars at our distributors grew due to shipment timing issue and remained at the lower end of our target range of 30 to 45 days of stock. Bottom line, non-GAAP net income was $11.7 million or $0.31 per fully diluted share. This resulted in non-GAAP net income of 21% of revenue. Our GAAP net income for the second quarter was $6.4 million or $0.17 per fully diluted share. Finally, today we announced a stock repurchase plan of up to $50 million to be executed between August 2010 and December 31, 2011 which allows us to increase value of the shareholders from the strong cash flow that MPS is generating. Let’s look at the financials in more detail, starting with the profit and loss statement on the revenue line. Second quarter 2010 net revenue of $55.7 million increased 11% sequentially from the first quarter of 2010 and were up 35% from the $41.2 million recorded in the second quarter of 2009. Breaking down the revenue by product type; first quarter DC to DC product sales were $45.6 million, up 13% or $5.3 million from the first quarter of 2010, and up 53% from the $29.7 million recorded in the year-ago quarter. This growth was led by our MiniMonster and LDO product family.  The MiniMonster line grew more than 255% year-over-year and also increased sequential sales from the first quarter of 2010 by 58%. Our new LDO products did very well in the second quarter, growing 169% from a year-ago and 121% from the prior quarter. The largest end markets for MPS in the DC to DC product family continued to be flat-panel TVs, general consumer electronics products, set-top boxes, routers and wireless LAN cards. Lighting control revenues for the second quarter were $7.5 million, which was about flat to the $7.4 million we did in the first quarter of 2010, and a small increase of 2% from the same quarter a year-ago.  As we discussed in the past, there has been a substantial revenue shift within the lighting control group as the preferred technical solution moves from CCFL backlight to while LED backlighting.  Our new white LED driver products, we grew revenues about 128% year-over-year to about $4 million per quarter in the second quarter of 2010. At the same time, our traditional CCFL inverters and CCFL controllers shrink 47% year-over-year. This year-over-year decline in traditional CCFL is likely to continue as it reflects the continuing shift in notebooks and other backlighting solutions from CCFL to white LED solutions. Audio revenues came in at $2.6 million, up slightly from the $2.5 million MPS did in the prior quarter, but 36% from the $4.1 million recorded in the second quarter of 2009 as we continued to manage our participation in this segment based on market conditions. Let’s move down at the gross margin line, as our second quarter gross margin was 58.2% flat to the 58.3% we did in the prior quarter of 2010, and down slightly from the 59.1% in the second quarter of 2009. This result was in line with our expectations and guidance for the quarter. We have been experiencing very tight labor capacity availability the past two quarters and we expect to catch up to end demand in the fourth quarter of 2010. Now, this is our reported expenses and operating margin. On a GAAP basis, our operating expenses were $25.6 million in the second quarter. This includes $23.4 million in R&D and SG&A expense, which includes $5.4 million for stock and compensation expense and litigation expense of $2.2 million. Compared with the first quarter of 2010, GAAP operating expenses were up by $2.6 million. The expense mix change is as follows. R&D increased by $745,000, SG&A increased by $1.2 million, litigation increased by $651,000. As a result, our GAAP operating profit of 12% was slightly down in the second quarter of 2010, compared to our GAAP operating expense of 13% in the first quarter of 2010. Compared with the second quarter of 2009, our GAAP operating expenses were up by $4.3 million with R&D expense up by $2.1 million, SG&A increasing by $2.3 million and litigation expense was flat to the second quarter of 2009. On a non-GAAP basis, our operating expenses excluding stocks and compensation, for the second quarter of 2010 were $20.2 million, up slightly from the $19.1 million we spent in the first quarter of 2010 and up from the $17.5 million we spent in the second quarter of 2009. Looking at the detail of second quarter non-GAAP spending, although the quarter-over-quarter increase was due to the litigation expense as we wrapped up the ITC case that covered our orders CCFL parts. Our combined R&D and SG&A expenses were flat from the first quarter of 2010. Compared to the second quarter of 2009, non-GAAP R&D costs were up by $1.7 million as we continued to grow our new product offerings and R&D teams. Non-GAAP SG&A spending was up $1 million from Q2 of the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount and commission. Finally, litigation expense in the second quarter was $2.2 million which was flat compared to second quarter of 2009. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 22.2% in the second quarter of 2010, compared with 20.5% in the prior quarter of 2010 and 15.8% in the second quarter of 2009, a very nice increase. Switching to the bottom line, on a GAAP basis, our Q2 2010 net income was $6.4 million or $0.17 per fully diluted share. On a non-GAAP basis, our Q2 2010 net income was $11.7 million or $0.31 per fully diluted share and we achieved a non-GAAP net profit percentage of 21% of sales in the second quarter. This result is computed with a non-GAAP tax rate of 7.5%. Let’s look at some of the major changes to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $209.3 million at the end of the second quarter of 2010, up from $195.1 million at the end of the first quarter of 2010 and up substantially from the $163.8 million we had on the book in the year-ago quarter. In Q2, MPS had operating cash flow of about $14.1 million. We purchased capital equipment and outfitted our new R&D building in Chengdu, China for a total of about $7.2 million in the second quarter, which was offset by cash proceeds of $7.7 million from option exercises by employees. Accounts receivables ended the second quarter at $30.3 million, compared with $24.5 million at the end of the first quarter of 2010 and $12.4 million at the end of the second quarter of 2009. The increase in receivables from the prior quarter were a result of our second quarter in a row of record revenues, higher shipments than normal for the third month of the quarter and a mix swing of relatively more shipments to customers with longer payment terms. Days sales outstanding were 50 days in Q2 2010 as a result of the elements I just described. In Q1 of 2010, our DSOs were 44 days and in Q2 2009 they were 28 days. Our internal inventories at the end of the second quarter were extremely low at $14.5 million or about 57 days of inventory on a historical basis as a result of the continuation of our record quarterly shipments in the second quarter. This compares with $14.6 million or 63 days of inventory at the end of the first quarter of 2010. Inventory in our distribution channels grew in dollars to match the Q2 revenue increase, but total days of distributor inventory were at the lower end of our target range of 30 to 45 days for the distribution channel, flat with the past two quarters. I would now like to turn to a discussion of general business conditions. MPS has had an extremely strong 2010, hitting all-time quarterly revenue records two quarters in a row. Geographically in the second quarter of 2010, MPS shipped 61% of revenues to Taiwan and China and 39% to other regions, with Korea performing particularly well in Q2. By segment, MPS had excellent growth in the industrial area as our power management products are penetrating the growing smart-meter market in automotive display and increased sales in the communication segment, primarily driven by new router and set-top box business. Last quarter, we talked about avalanche of new products in the past 18 months and we are now seeing the revenue results. In Q2, almost half of our revenue came from products introduced since the first quarter of 2008, a very significant achievement a good leading indicator of more growth to come.  In the second half of 2010, we expect significant new revenues in white LED drivers for monitors and power devices for panel manufacturers and high-power, high-voltage DC to DC converters including our new Intelli-Phase line for high-end graphics cards used in notebook computers.  Existing markets are running on all cylinders as MPS continues to grow. We estimate that our served available market has increased by $800 million to $1 billion with this new product push and believe this will set the stage for continued strong revenue growth in the future. I would now like to turn to our outlook for the third quarter of 2010. Q2 2010 was another record revenue quarter for MPS and we continue to see very healthy bookings. Our lead times remain in the range of about 12 weeks to 16 weeks.  Our second quarter revenue was constrained by product supply not customer demand. We made efforts to increase our production capacity aggressively at the beginning of the year and we are paying higher labor prices to a secure and more production volume. However, Q3 revenue will continue to be limited by product supply particularly for the new products released in the last 18 months.  We project third quarter 2010 revenues in the range of $66 million to $70 million with gross margin in the 54% to 56% range. We are running the business to maximize the bottom line, not solely focusing on maximizing gross margin. This year we saw great opportunity to grow our revenues rapidly and feel we are about at the optimum point for trading off revenue and gross margin for the rest of the year. In the future, we will react to market opportunities which again will determine our gross margins go up or down. Longer term, we would like to operate in the 50% to 55% gross margin range. Going forward, our focus will be on revenue and non-GAAP net profit growth.  For the third quarter 2010, we expect non-GAAP net profit percentage to be at the mid to upper end of our new revised net margin target model of 225 to 27% of sales. We expect stock-based compensation expense in the range of $4.7 million to $5.2 million. This forecast remains higher than historical averages as MPS issued performance grants at beginning of this year towards executive rather than time based grants we had used in the past.  The accounting rules for the performance based grants result in MPS having to record more of the total expense in the first year than under the typical four-year time based grant.  We expect non-GAAP research and development and selling, general and administrative expense to be about flat from Q2 2010 in the range of $18 million to $19 million. This estimate excludes the stock compensation estimate mentioned above. We expect litigation expense to decline to $500,000 to $700,000 due to the completion of our outstanding CCFL litigation. Finally, we expect our non-GAAP tax rate to remain in the range of 5% to 10%, based on our sales and profit patterns globally. In conclusion, we are pleased to report that MPS have made continuous investments in R&D and new product innovation in the past two years. It is clear that the new products have translated into significant growth in revenue. We’re delivering a broader product portfolio and it’s dramatically growing revenues and the bottom line. We expect to continue to execute and grow our market share and profits with this approach.  Now, we would like to open the microphone and take your questions.
Operator:  Thank you. (Operator Instructions). And your first question comes from the line of Steve Smigie of Raymond James.
Steve Smigie – Raymond James:  Great, thanks very much. Congratulations on the great solid revenue growth here. So, I guess, the first question is on the gross margin. So, is the majority of the sequential drop from the Q2 to Q3, is that based on paying higher to get the extra capacity or there are other factors in there?
Rick Neely:  Yes Steve, that’s it. Off the 3 percentage point drop, most of that is just higher wafer prices that we’ll be paying in Q3. We did get the capacity. You can see that in our revenue. But we had to pay higher wafer prices.
Michael Hsing:  Okay, go ahead.
Steve Smigie – Raymond James: I was going to ask – so it sounded like your new gross margin range is 50% to 55%. So I guess is that a GAAP 50% to 55%? And is that – I mean is that something that will happen near term? In the past, you sort of said you do have lower stuff and you kept performing better than that. So, I guess, I’m wondering if three quarters out, you get the capacity back or snap back up and then the 50% to 55% is maybe two years out before you really get there.
Michael Hsing: That’s exactly right. And we are – this is a long-term model, an 18 months to 24 months out. In the near – in the near quarters, we expect to remain the same or given the wafer price is getting better and so now we will again improve the gross margin, but I am not forecasting it. And usually when the wafer price is getting – wafer price is getting better, also the market gets more competitive.
Rick Neely: Also, Steve, there’s a very little difference in our GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin, so I really don’t talk about it. It’s the same numbers primarily.
Steve Smigie – Raymond James: Okay, great. If I could just sneak one more in. You guys are obviously benefiting from significant introduction of new products. I think you went from 2007 to 2008, 89 to 151 products and then went from 151 to 230 in 2009. What’s the pace for 2010? Does that 230 jump to 350 or something like that or is the numbers getting big enough that you don’t quite see that significant jumps?
Steve Pratt:  Hi Steve, this is Steve Pratt, Marketing Director.
Steve Smigie – Raymond James: Hi Steve.
Steve Pratt: Our plan for 2010 for the year is going to be similar to what we did in 2009. 2009 was a huge step, more than 60%, 70% more new products in ’09 and ’08. In 2010, we are going to be shifting, our products are going to be doing – while the same number of products introduced – in this similar number of products introduced in ’010, in ’09. But when you look at the complexity of the products in 2010, there will be more complicated DC to DC buck converters as opposed to 2009, where we introduced quite a few low dropout linear regulators and current limit switches.
Steve Smigie – Raymond James: Okay, great. Thanks a lot guys.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Vernon Essi from Needham & Company.
Vernon Essi – Needham & Company:  Thank you very much. I’m wondering if you could discuss a little bit about the lighting market. And, you had said, of course, obviously we’ve got the CCFL legacy business working against you there. Can you give us an understanding of the breakout on the LED versus the CCFL for the quarter?
Rick Neely:  Hi Vernon, this is Rick. Yes, basically, this is the crossover quarter and that of our majority of our revenue in lighting control is now white LED. So we did about $4 million of the $7.5 million was white LED. CCFL – the traditional CCFL inverter is down about $1 million and the rest of it is the CCFL controllers. And, Steve, you can comment on the –
Steve Pratt:  Yes, so as far as the market, we’re seeing very nice growth ramping in the second half of this year in the white LED backlighting space. And the market drivers there are in the panel manufacturers for notebook computers and for monitors and then a little bit longer term would be the TV space.
Vernon Essi – Needham & Company: Okay. And that that leads me to my other question. Any anecdotal signs out there on the notebook market; there seems to some supply interruptions and what have you. Any thoughts as to how that’s shaping out into the summer months here?
Steve Pratt: It’s too – it’s really early to tell for us. We’re seeing continued backlog buildup and we’re still seeing steady revenue through the second half of the year. There maybe some slight push-outs for other – as the other products catch up. But, overall – and remember that 2010, the second half of this year, we’re still a very – relatively small percentage of the notebook market. So we may not see it as significantly as some of the other players.
Vernon Essi – Needham & Company: No, I understand. I mean your revenue growth trajectory is very robust in this sequential transition, so it’s – you’re sort of an outlier sorts, and obviously I know you’ve got new products coming out and that is my last question, which is on Intelli-Phase, any update there? It sounds like you’ve got some interesting wins possibly there that are coming into the fold in the back half.
Steve Pratt:  Yes, Vernon, Intelli-Phase is a long-term selling process. This is a big product going to the CPU core and a new phase for us. And Intelli-Phase is the muscles behind the high-current multi-phase CPU core and power supply. So our emphasis hasn’t changed. It’s – we’re focusing on servers and that’s a longer term stuff.
Michael Hsing:  But to answer your question, in the short term, we do see the volumes are ramping up now in a different application. In graphics card as I said earlier and those product lifecycles are much shorter and we expect to ramp up now.
Vernon Essi – Needham & Company: Okay, so you’re primarily – just to be clear, you’re primarily with Intelli-Phase getting traction in graphics more than anywhere else right now?
Steve Pratt: In the short term, yes.
Michael Hsing: Yes.
Vernon Essi – Needham & Company: Okay.
Michael Hsing: And, also that, in some of the notebook in the near term.
Vernon Essi – Needham & Company: Okay.
Michael Hsing: In the midterm.
Vernon Essi – Needham & Company: Is midterm still this year or we’re talking 2011 year obviously?
Steve Pratt: No, 2011.
Vernon Essi – Needham & Company: Okay, very good. All right, thanks a lot.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore – Deutsche Bank: Hi guys, just want to dive into the gross margin side a little bit. Walk us through the availability side of things as you go forward on the wafer side. Is that from bringing on new foundry partners or is your capacity limited to the CapEx increases that would happen at your existing partners?
Rick Neely:  Hi Ross, I’ll start off. I mean, basically, we’ve just basically bought from our current partners, so we’ve gotten more capacity from our current partners. And, of course, they’ve taken advantage of the shortages to increase their prices, what they have done with all the other foundry customers, so we’re no different than that. But Michael can tell you about our efforts to expand into other partners.
Michael Hsing:  Yes, we are expanding – in a way we are engaging with other foundries to further reduce and minimize all the liabilities. And we take a very conservative approach and which is paying a higher wafer price to secure this year volume and that Q3 revenue is a reflect of that. And we’re expecting catching everything up and catch up most of our customer demand in the Q4.
Ross Seymore – Deutsche Bank: So, I guess, that leads to my next question. So, did you just say you’re kind of – you are going to be caught up in Q3, so Q4 would be kind of normal seasonality or is it going to take you through Q4 to catch up given the extra supply you purchased?
Rick Neely: Yes Ross, we’ve said in the script, we will be still product limited in Q3. We expect to catch up in Q4.
Ross Seymore – Deutsche Bank: So, all is being equal is being up much more than normal seasonal – to the extent normal is even an accurate term these days – being bigger than the normal third quarter, it doesn’t in anyway rob from the fourth quarter I guess is the way to read that?
Michael Hsing: Well, actually you can think as a normal seasonality. Now, we have a – and every quarter is big, every quarter is a record. And I remember in the past – in the third quarter, we jumped some 20% some and we did it again and [inaudible] demand limited and now at this time not the demand, it may even much bigger. We couldn’t deliver those – fulfill our customers’ requirements.
Ross Seymore – Deutsche Bank: So, I guess, the follow-up linking it back to my original gross margin question is, if we’re back to some resemblance of normal seasonality for the fourth and first quarters, those are usually down quarters. I would assume that that allows a little more levy on the demands from your foundries. Is that where you would expect pricing and/or kind of your scale to allow the gross margin to improve as your cost come down there?
Michael Hsing: At this point, we focus our wafer capacity and that’s our main focus to fulfill our customer’s demand. In Q4, we don’t see that clear now. And, although – and the demand is still quite strong for MPS product, but we can nail down the quarter yet.
Ross Seymore – Deutsche Bank: But, I guess, conceptually, if you were down in those quarters and normal seasonal, that would alleviate some of the capacity concerns?
Rick Neely:  So, Ross, I will jump in here. I mean, traditionally again, as you said, nothing’s been normal recently. Typically Q3 is our biggest quarter and Q4 is even down. So we would – that’s the normal historical pattern that hasn’t always held reasonably. And the issue I think the other question, the reason Michael and I can’t really answer it is, we’re in a competitive business that if demand goes down, wafer prices might go down or that might not, it’s just it’s unclear yet where that’s going to shakeout. So it’s not up to us of whether that wafer prices go down, you really have to look at the general demand.
Ross Seymore – Deutsche Bank: Okay, thank you.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Wang of Wedbush Securities.
Patrick Wang – Wedbush Securities:  Great, thanks, and congrats on the huge revenue guys. I guess, first question I just want to ask you about – about that guidance, when you think about the growth here in the third quarter, can you talk about some of the, I guess, bigger pieces are taking you guys up for such robust growth?
Steve Pratt:  Yes, it can. This is Steve again. Patrick, some of the growth drivers, obviously TVs, Blu-ray players are doing quite well and that’s been a consistent theme for MPS, so more of the same. Now looking beyond that, we’re very excited about industrial, automotive. In that segment, we will be closing out 2010 – the revenue contributions from that product family is going to be more than 10%, so we’re really excited about that product family. In other areas, we have communications, for example, set-top box. More products are going from an LDO to a DC to DC converter to comply to energy starts compliance and European Code of Conduct, so those are really good opportunities for MPS. And another segment, enterprise storage, we’re seeing very good growth in DC to DC power and also load protection solutions in enterprise storage.  And, the last, notebook computing, and in the short term, we’ll see a good second half in that space for DC to DC power. And, in a little bit longer term, moving into servers and gaming opportunities for our DC to DC power solutions.
Patrick Wang – Wedbush Securities: Okay, that’s helpful. And, I guess, another way to look at it was, geographically Korea has become a more and more important part of your business here. Are you guys continuing to see an uptick here in the third quarter? Is there any sort of mix geographically that any trends there that we should keep an eye on?
Steve Pratt: No, I think it’s – Patrick, more the same.
Patrick Wang – Wedbush Securities: Okay, all right, and I appreciate that. And then for my follow-up, I want to ask you a little bit more about gross margins. I don’t want – just want to make sure I understood it correctly. You guys got into a gross margin of 55% here in the quarter. Rick, you talked about a 50% to 55% longer term target. In the midterm, it sounds like when supplies get better, it almost sounds like your margins could improve again for – before coming down again. Did I get that right?
Rick Neely:  Yes, what we’re trying to do Patrick is, we think for the rest of this year we’ll be about the range we are right now, 54% to 56%. We wanted to – we’ve always said, we want to communicate where our business opportunities are and where the direction is. And so, we think if you look out in the next 18 months to 24 months, it’s more or likely to be below 55% and above 55%, so we wanted to communicate that.
Michael Hsing:  I wanted – whatever it takes, the bottom line is, I want to increase the EPS and whatever it takes.
Patrick Wang – Wedbush Securities: No, I think – I think that makes a lot of sense. And, I guess, just lastly, just on margins here. Again, I completely understand the reasoning behind this. And when we think about the previous target range, 58% to 63%, we think about the new longer term range of 50% to 55%. The delta there, how much of that you think is coming from contributions from higher costs, wafer costs, and how much of that is, you guys are extending your footprint by going to more cost competitive solutions for accelerating top line growth. I’m just kind of –
Michael Hsing: No, in this quarter and into the coming quarters, and the last quarters, and most of – all the gross margin impact is as Rick said it is mostly it’s from the higher wafer cost.
Patrick Wang – Wedbush Securities: Right, yes. No, I understand. But, when we talk about four to six quarters out, when you guys could be in that 50% to 55% range, I’m assuming that the wafer supplies starts to improve and you get that third foundry partner on line. At that point, it’s more about attacking the other sockets on the board, increasing your TAM and growing the top line, is that – is that what’s moving it?
Steve Pratt: Yes.
Patrick Wang – Wedbush Securities: Okay, thank you.
Steve Pratt: That’s exactly – our point is we’re expanding our footprint and so that’s our strategy, that’s going to get us the growth, and it will increase the top line and our net profit.
Patrick Wang – Wedbush Securities: Got you, okay. That makes a lot of sense. Congrats and good luck, guys.
Michael Hsing: Okay, thank you.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie of Raymond James.
Steve Smigie – Raymond James:  Great, thanks a lot for allowing the follow-ups here. So, I guess, in terms of thinking about revenue growth and gross margin going forward, it sounds like it’s something like a product like an Intelli-Phase or probably other products, you’re starting to get more into stuff like notebooks where – and ultimately I understand what you’re saying about server, but it seems like if you’re getting it more like some sort of computing applications like a notebook that maybe that’s part of the reason why you would be getting lower gross margin, but also you would have higher volumes.  And so, part of the question is it is part of the reason that you’re going down that you’re getting into applications where you’re going to have lower margin. And the second part of the question is, are you prepared to manufacturing wise handle really high – much higher volume orders, since a lot of that orders probably have now or probably not the multi-million dollar unit orders, so I’m just curious if you can talk through that.
Michael Hsing:  I think that all of the – but first of all it doesn’t – the way our companies are going down, we’re moving the long-term models to be – the gross margin to be lower and that’s because I see that – if we do that then we will significant increase the EPS, that’s the purpose. And, but it doesn’t mean we don’t – our products is not a competitive anymore, it is a huge market segment.  As Steve just said, in this year, we in the industrial applications and that we can end – we can exit the year as a – to be more than 10% of our revenue. Remember, we just started this segment about three – about three years ago, that’s a phenomenal growth and that these are all high margin business. But, I believe, we can grow the company much faster by lowering the gross margins and that we can be in a more – attack other consumer market.
Rick Neely:  Yes, I think that’s – just to add in Steve, if you go back to say a couple of years ago, we were doing 2% or 3% of our revenue in the industrial segment, we’re about 7% or 8% in this quarter. So we’ve significant change already. And, as everybody knows, you can get high volume in the consumer segment and the margins aren’t as high, but they’re very good volume and they definitely add to our bottom line, because I wanted to emphasize that we increased our net margin target model by two points, from 22% to 27%, so we think we can actually do better by going after this volume.
Steve Pratt:  And you also asked about the question, are we ready to handle that kind of volume? We absolutely are. And if you just look at the TV space, when you think about having multiple sockets per television or per panel, we’re already running at very high volumes, so we’re well prepared for that growth and moving – expanding into notebooks.
Steve Smigie – Raymond James: Okay. And the next question is, if you look at your SG&A as a percentage of revenue, I think you’re at a record there by quite a bit. And, you’ve introduced so many new products and will introduce more. Does it make sense at this point to meaningfully build up the sales force, maybe spend a little bit money? I mean, you’re getting great margins already. Would that also help drive higher growth?
Michael Hsing: Absolutely. We are talking about our sales force, our marketing teams about more than a couple of quarters. And we absolutely are creating a lot more bigger, stronger teams. And we just recently, we reassembled almost the entire regions. And it’s – we’re about to complete this transition.  
Steve Smigie – Raymond James:  Okay. And, the last question was just, could you give an update on the general illumination market and not so much the way LED drivers for the monitors, but I know there’s a lot of different end markets there and sort of how do you go to market there, given there that many, that many segments that you’re addressing?
Steve Pratt:  Yes, okay. Yes, we can – the lighting illumination market, it’s – it’s a very large potential market, its ramp up is slow, its adoption to white LED is from incandescent or fluorescent bulbs is relatively slow, so it’s – we’re preparing ourselves in the market with new products.  The products we have now serve a very small segment in the lower wattage the MR-16 type bulb replacement, some of the automotive interior decorative lighting. And then, in the long-term, we’ll be moving it to some many offline solutions in higher wattage solutions. So it’s – it’s a moderate size contributor for 2010 and I think much more in 2011. I describe the growth as a moderate.
Michael Hsing:  Let me clarify this, can we. We have – we introduced a couple of product that we have like a five, six products in about to release now. And then these are addressing – addresses the halogen replacement, fluorescent tube replacement, and also tree illumination. But the problem is, on the current market, it is limited by the LED supplies. The remote order LED is in shortage now. 
Steve Pratt: And the street lighting, Michael pointed out, mentioned street lighting. We’ve some good traction there, where the countries are getting subsidized. Some government subsidies are giving incentive to use LED solutions as alternative.
Steve Smigie – Raymond James: Okay, well, it sounds great. Well, good luck, that’s all. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg of Stifel Nicolaus.
Evan Wang – Stifel Nicolaus: Yes, hi, thank you for taking the questions. This is Evan Wang calling in for Tore Svanberg. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your ASP trend and how your record new products play into that? And maybe also what impact your gross margin has on the ASP?
Rick Neely:  Actually, Evan, we don’t talk about ASP, because it just depends on a product-by-product. And ASPs can actually go down and gross margins may go up. So it’s not a very good indicator, so we never discuss ASPs directly.
Evan Wang – Stifel Nicolaus: Okay, understood. And what about the composition of sales, it looks like that maybe shifting as well. What is the implication on – is there some other metrics that could be meaningful to look at such as the turns business in the quarter or long-term growth rate, not just now, your – when you are penetrating those markets and also what impact it might have on your sales force, et cetera?
Rick Neely: You probably have to repeat the question. If you’re asking how we’re doing in the outside market, well, we’re definitely gaining market share, our revenue is growing faster than the market. Can you be more specific about what you’re looking for?
Evan Wang – Stifel Nicolaus: Maybe you could add some color on the composition of your revenue. In other words, by end markets, what are some of the new markets and what those – what are the characteristics of these new markets that you are entering?
Michael Hsing:  Yes, Steve just mentioned it. And we have a router set-top box, the Blu-ray, TVs, and notebooks and – am I missing anything. These are main – [inaudible], anything else, okay. And these are the big items and it probably consisting – consists not more than 60% of the revenue. The rest of the stuff I can’t even count it.
Steve Pratt:  And then the product focus has been in the predominantly the DC to DC power where we excel in high voltage and at the highest current densities. And, for backlighting, white LED backlighting, our solutions, white LED solutions, multi-channel, single channel covering a broad range of white LED monitor sizes.
Evan Wang – Stifel Nicolaus: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator:  Your next comes from the line of Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer & Co.
Shawn Simmons – Oppenheimer & Co.: Hi guys, this is Shawn Simmons calling in for Rick. Just had a couple of questions for you. I guess, whenever you’re looking at the pricing environment out there, have you seen anything outside of just normally as [inaudible] or is that pricing becoming more competitive?
Michael Hsing:  Well, in this high-demand market, in the ASP – I mean, the general requirements from our customer is shipping product not talking – not negotiating shedding on the price.
Steve Pratt: So prices is kind of stable.
Shawn Simmons – Oppenheimer & Co.: Okay, great. And then, you mentioned that you left some revenue on the table this quarter. Could you guys possibly quantify that or and also looking out into 3Q, it sounds like you could leave a little bit on the top line there as well? Any color on that would be great.
Rick Neely:  I will. Yes, relatively, I’ll take it as – looking back or looking forward, you’re not able to do that because there’s too many pieces. But we’d estimate in Q2, it’s probably between $5 million and $10 million more we could have done, so that’s 60% to 65% is our general estimate of what Q2 could have been if we had the product. It’s hard to say about Q3, it’s too early to tell.
Shawn Simmons – Oppenheimer & Co.: Okay, great. That’s all from me. Thanks guys.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Doug Freedman, Gleacher & Company. 
Doug Freedman – Gleacher & Company: Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. Rick, your new net profit margin goal, given the seasonality that the company does see, is that a goal that you think you can keep to even in the down quarters? And, if so, how is that going to be achieved? Is that how much flexibility, is there are any operating lines?
Rick Neely:  Hi Doug. Yes, the thing with our target model, that’s where we want to build the company’s product to achieve and we expect to achieve in it the seasonably good quarters. In the weakest quarter of the year, we generally wouldn’t achieve it. But if we average it out, most of the quarters, we should be able to hit it.
Doug Freedman – Gleacher & Company: Okay. And can you talk a little bit – I think what people are really struggling with is the movement in the margins at a time when supply is tight and ASPs are holding up fairly well for your comments. Is there no possibility to be able to pass along the higher cost that you are seeing to your customers or whether in existing designs or even in future designs?
Michael Hsing:  Yes, you can do this. Of course, we always can increase the price and keep the margin. And but I see this is an opportunity for MPS. What I would really want is to secure the future volumes, future design wins, because we have a huge number of a product that we’ve released. And [inaudible] these products can turn into our revenue. And that’s why we didn’t have the cost increase as much as we could.
Steve Pratt:  We’re more concerned about a long-term relationship with our customers. And so we think the right decision is to, as much as we can, maintain where we are and focus on delivering products.
Doug Freedman – Gleacher & Company: Okay. And, Rick, onto a little bit more of a technical question, with the buyback and with the – you mentioned that there was cash provided this quarter due to share exercises, can you give us a projection of where you think share counts are going to look like and maybe a little bit going forward from there as well?
Rick Neely:  Well, my best estimate of the share count for Q3 is maybe 38.8 something like that. Right now, we’re at 38.4, probably it’d go up a little bit on a diluted basis in Q3.
Doug Freedman – Gleacher & Company: Okay. And then going back towards your Intelli-Phase product that marries up to a CPU power management controller. Have you guys had any progress on securing a partner for that or is that something that you’re still looking into doing, any progress you made there?
Steve Pratt: We have relationships with existing controller manufacturers, so we partner with them. And then, we’re continuing to develop that. 
Doug Freedman – Gleacher & Company: All right. And given your comments around supply, can you give us some comments about lead times, where you think lead – where are leads times presently in a number and where do you think how long will it be before they come down and what would you call normal?
Steve Pratt: Okay. Doug, so for the first half of the year, our lead times has been extending and there hasn’t been much change at all in general in the lead times between Q1 and Q2, so we’re around 12 weeks to 16 weeks in general for the products that have lead time issues.
Doug Freedman – Gleacher & Company: Any projection on when they’ll come back into is normal 8 weeks to 10 weeks.
Steve Pratt: Yes, normal is 8 weeks to 12 weeks, 8 weeks to 10 weeks. And like we had said earlier, the Q4 timeframe.
Doug Freedman – Gleacher & Company: All right, great. Thanks guys.
Michael Hsing:  If the demand does not go up as like in Q3.
Steve Pratt: I mean – and I will do the clarify Doug. We’re continuing to see improvements on individual products as we get – we’ve been able to get more capacity, we’re now shipping products from that increased capacity. So lead times are coming down and improving on individual products.
Michael Hsing: In the Q2 – Q1 conference call, I made a statement that I believe we can catch up in a few suite, but I was wrong, but the demand is even higher. So now I say it’s we believe we can catch up in Q4, that remains to be seen.
Operator:  Once again ladies and gentlemen, we ask that all participants please limit yourself to one question. Again that is one question. Your next question comes from the line of Gus Richard from Piper Jaffray.
Gus Richard – Piper Jaffray:  Thanks guys for taking my question. Let’s see, I’ve only got one. In the decision between growth and gross margin, what precipitated the thought here and what do you think – it’s a two part question – and what do you think the incremental growth rate is over nominal, can you get like 10%, 15% higher revenue growth because of this two philosophy. If you can just add a little bit of color as to why you did this and sort of what do you think it means for top line?
Michael Hsing:  For the top line, we said it, okay? We are a targeting about a 25% to 30% – 30% of the growth. In this year, we see our business, we can do a whole lot more than that. But, unfortunately, we didn’t – last year or the year before, we didn’t prepare for that kind of ramp.  And that during the futures, I see these kind of a – the product way to release in the last 18 months, we can do that. So that’s why we make – we made that kind of a position, the EPS, the way we look at the EPS, we’ll model the EPS and then we increase it dramatically.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike McConnell of Pacific Crest Securities.
Mike McConnell – Pacific Crest Securities: Thanks. I just had a question – again and not to beat on an old drum here – but just the choice here between, again, growth at the expense of gross margins. We’re looking into next year, I guess, where – are you going to be more aggressive with pricing, why wouldn’t and when we get into a normalized supply environment starts to see gross margins begin to tick back up, is there – or are we just now permanently going to be kind of moving pretty dramatically from your old target of 58% to 62% of – 50% to 55% I guess and you were expecting no improvement now as we move even into the later stages of next year as you start to see some supply improvements?
Michael Hsing:  I do whatever – again, okay? I do whatever to get the – to get the every penny out of that, out of any product. So I want to get the EPS up and whatever the gross margin ended up to be higher or lower, let it be. Since you guys want to put in a spreadsheet and you want gross margins, okay, we’ll give you a model number.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Tristan Gerra of Robert W. Baird
Tristan Gerra – Robert W. Baird: Hi, I’m going to unfortunately follow-up on the same line of question. In terms of new products or end markets, if you could specify where you feel the need to be more aggressive on the gross margin growth to maintain the growth that you’ve had achieved in the past, if you can just give more specifics on the product line and/or end markets?
Steve Pratt:  Well, it’s just expanding our footprints like some of the previous callers that we’ve responded to. So by extending our footprint into other growth markets, that’s going to give us the best return on top line and net profit.
Operator:  Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the Q&A session. I’d now like to turn the call back over to your CFO, Rick Neely.
Rick Neely: Well, thank you, everybody for attending the call and asking the questions. We look forward to speaking with you at the next quarterly conference call. Have a good week.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the presentation. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q1 2010 Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. earnings conference call. At this time, all attendees are in a listen-only mode and we will conduct a Q&A session at the end of today's remarks. (Operator Instructions) I would like to now turn the call over to your host for today's call, Mr. Rick Neely, Chief Financial Officer. Please proceed, sir.
Rick Neely: Good afternoon and welcome to the first quarter fiscal year 2010 Monolithic Power Systems conference call. Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS, is with me on today's call. In the course to today's conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risks and uncertainties. For example, our business outlook, including our business and financial outlook for the second quarter of 2010, projected second quarter 2010 revenues and gross margins, our expectations for second quarter litigation, stock-based compensation and non-GAAP operating expenses. Our target operating range for gross margins and inventory, our expectations for revenue and net income growth beyond Q2 2010, our expected average non-GAAP tax rate for 2010, our expected production capacity in future quarters, our belief that MPS is well-positioned for future growth, the expected seasonality of our business, our expectations for future cost reduction and new product introductions, potential customer acceptance and the opportunities these present and the prospects of expanding our market share. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts or guarantees of future performance or events and are based on current expectations, estimates, beliefs, assumptions, goals and objectives and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by these statements. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in our SEC filings, including but not limited to, our Form 10-K filed on February 16, 2010 which is accessible through our website, www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today's call. We will be discussing operating expense and net income on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude charges related to stock-based compensation and in the case of net income, their related tax effect. We will also discuss our expected non-GAAP research and development and selling, general and administrative expense for the second quarter of 2010, which excludes our expected charges related to stock-based compensation. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to this release, as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our website. I'd also like to remind you that today's conference call is being webcast live over the Internet and will be available for replay on our website for one year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. We would like to start this call by reviewing our first quarter fiscal year 2010 business highlights. Following this update, I will discuss our operating results. We will conclude by discussing our expectations for the second fiscal quarter of 2010. We will then open up the call to your questions. Let's start with the business highlights. MPS had an unprecedented first quarter, growing revenue 71% from the first quarter of the prior year and recording record net sales of $50.3 million. This figure is not only a new quarterly revenue record for MPS, but it is a sequential increase of 8% from the prior quarter and MPS typically sees a seasonal drop of 10% to 15% in our first quarter of the year. MPS saw strong demand in all of its major end markets. For the first quarter, MPS increased its DC to DC penetration as a result of the broad spectrum of new products we have released in the past 18 to 24 months. Of particular note, inside the DC to DC segment, our Q1 2010 MiniMonster sales growth rate was more than double the overall company growth rate compared to the first quarter of 2009 and we expect continued growth throughout this year. One example is our new high-voltage, high-current DC to DC buck converter family designed into 2010 model notebook computers for system regulation. These parts are ramping very well and will contribute material revenue in the second half of 2010. In the lighting market, our white LED revenues almost tripled in Q1 2010 compared to a year ago and are on track to grow well over 100% by year end. We continue to gain market share in white LED backlighting applications in 2010 and 2011 model notebook and netbook computers and LCD monitors that take advantage of our integration and high-voltage technology. An example of our market expansion in the white LED segment is our design and success in high brightness white LED lighting. We have several significant designs wins street lighting and decorative lighting in appliances and automotive interior decorative lighting as well. In the manufacturing area, gross margin was 58.3% which was up from the 57.6% gross margin recorded in the first quarter of 2009 and down slightly from the fourth quarter of 2009. Our internal days of inventory were 64 days, as strong end demand dropped us below our target range. Inventory dollars at our distributors grew slightly but remained at the lower end of our target range of 30 to 45 days of stock. Bottom line, non-GAAP net income was $9.9 million or $0.26 per fully diluted share. This resulted in non-GAAP net income of 20% of revenue. Our GAAP net income for the first quarter was $6.4 million or $0.17 per fully diluted share. Let's look at the financials in more detail, starting with the P&L. Looking at the revenue line, first quarter 2010 net revenue of $50.3 million increased 8% sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2009 and were up 71% from the $29.3 million recorded in the first quarter of 2009. Looking at our revenue by product type, first quarter DC to DC product sales were $40.3 million, up 12% from the fourth quarter of 2009 and up 91% from the $21.2 million recorded in the year-ago quarter. This growth was led by our MiniMonster product family which grew 154% year-over-year and increased sales from the fourth quarter of 2009 by 37%. We were also very pleased with the growth of some of our new product families in the DC to DC segment. Our combined LDO and current limit switch revenues were over $2 million in the first quarter, up 350% from a year ago. The largest end markets for MPS in the DC to DC product family continue to be flat-panel TVs, general consumer electronics products, set-top boxes, routers and wireless LAN cards. MPS also enjoyed its best results ever in the industrial segment in Q1, as sales to smart-meter customers have been ramping. Lighting control revenues for the first quarter were $7.4 million which was slightly up from the $7.3 million we did in the fourth quarter of 2009, but an increase of 59% from the same quarter a year ago. As we mentioned in our last conference call, within the Lighting control group, MPS had substantial year-over-year growth for its newer product releases of white LED drivers and backlight CCFL controllers, while the traditional CCFL inverters shrank 25% year-over-year. We only shipped about $1.5 million in traditional CCFL backlighting solutions in the first quarter of 2010. The year-over-year decline in traditional CCFL reflects the continuing shift to notebook and other backlighting from CCFL solutions to white LED solutions. Audio revenues came in at $2.5 million, down 23% from the $3.3 million recorded in the prior quarter and down 28% from the first quarter of 2009 as we continued to modulate our participation in this segment based on market conditions. Looking at the gross margin line, our first quarter gross margin was 58.3% compared to 58.7% in the prior quarter 2009 and 57.6% in the first quarter of 2009. This result was in line with our expectations and guidance for the quarter. As a reminder from our last conference call, we explained how we had priced some of our DC to DC products aggressively in the LCD TV market to both get design wins, but also to send existing sockets in the second half of 2009. This tactic was successful as evidenced by our record revenues in Q1 2010. But as expected, this has impacted our gross margin in the last few quarters. At the expense line, if you look at our GAAP operating expenses, they were $23 million in the first quarter which includes $21.4 million in R&D and SG&A expense, which includes $3.9 million for stock and compensation expense and litigation expense of $1.6 million. Compared with the fourth quarter of 2009, GAAP operating expenses were up by $82,000. The expense mix change is as follows. R&D increased by $674,000, SG&A increased by $208,000 and litigation decreased by $800,000. As a result, our GAAP operating profit was 13% in the first quarter 2010, compared with a GAAP operating expense of 9% in the fourth quarter of 2009. Compared to the first quarter of 2009, our GAAP operating expenses were up $5 million. R&D expense was up $2.9 million, SG&A was up $2.6 million and litigation expense decreased by $0.5 million from the first quarter of 2009. On a non-GAAP basis, if you look at our operating expenses excluding stock compensation, our non-GAAP operating expense for the first quarter of 2010 were $19.1 million, up slightly from the $18.8 million we spent in the fourth quarter of 2009 and up from the $14.6 million we spent in the first quarter of 2009. Our non-GAAP operating expenses grew significantly from the prior year, but the Q1 2009 numbers reflected the very tight, variable expense management we enforced due to the dramatic revenue decline in the first quarter of 2009 and this expense level was not a realistic operating rate. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, non-GAAP R&D costs were up by $691,000, as we continued to grow our R&D team and add more products to our portfolio. Non-GAAP SG&A spending was up $397,000 from Q4 of the prior year, primarily due to increased commissions and bonuses. Finally, litigation expense in the first quarter was $1.6 million which was down by $800,000 from the fourth quarter of 2009 due to reduced litigation activity. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 20.5% in the first quarter of 2010, compared with 18.5% in the fourth quarter of 2009 and 8% in the first quarter of 2009. Switching to the bottom line, on a GAAP basis, our Q1 2010 net income was $6.4 million or $0.17 per fully diluted share. On a non-GAAP basis, our Q1 '10 net income was $9.9 million or $0.26 per fully diluted share and we hit almost 19% of sales as our non-GAAP operating net profit percentage in the first quarter. This result is computed with a non-GAAP tax rate of 7.5%. Looking at the balance sheet, cash, cash equivalents and investments were $195.1 million at the end of the first quarter of 2010, up from $185.1 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2009 and up significantly from the $150.8 million on the books in the year-ago quarter. In Q1, MPS had operating cash flow of about $10.4 million. We purchased capital equipment and outfitted our new R&D building in Chengdu, China for a total of about $5.4 million in the first quarter, which was offset by cash proceeds of $5.1 million from the option exercises and employee stock purchases by employees. Accounts receivables ended the first quarter at $24.5 million, compared with $15.5 million at the end of 2009 and $13.4 million at the end of the first quarter of 2009. The increase in receivables from the prior quarter was the result of our record revenues, unusually high turns booking late in the quarter and a mix swing of relatively more shipments to customers with longer payment terms. Days sales outstanding were 44 days in Q1 of this year as a result of the elements I just described. In Q4 of 2009, our DSOs were 30 days and in Q1 2009 they were 41 days. Our internal inventories at the end of the first quarter were very lean at $14.6 million or about 64 days of inventory on a historical basis as a result of the record shipments in the first quarter. This compares with $19.6 million or 93 days of inventory at the end of the fourth quarter of 2009. Inventory in our distribution channel grew slightly in dollars to match the Q1 revenue increase and total days of distributor inventory was at the lower end of our target range of 30 to 45 days for the distribution channel. I would now like to turn to a discussion of general business conditions. MPS started the New Year in a very strong fashion, hitting a new all-time quarterly revenue record in a quarter that historically is our weakest seasonal period of the year. Geographically in the first quarter of 2010, MPS shipped 56% of revenues to Taiwan and China and 44% to other regions, with Korea, the U.S. and Europe performing well. MPS has made good progress in the U.S. and Southeast Asia regions this quarter, growing revenues by over $3 million or 149% from the first quarter of 2009. We have talked continuously about an avalanche of new products in the past 18 months and we are now seeing many of these go into initial volume production this year. We mentioned the very high percentage growth rate in our new current limit switch and LDO products, as we are making major strides in the storage and communications markets with these products. We expect to see our first significant ramp in notebook power management in the second half of 2010, as our new high-current DC-DC buck converter has several design wins that are planning to ramp. Similarly, we have new designs for our white LED backlight driver solutions that will increase our share in the LCD TV and monitor markets. The first quarter was a record unit shipment and revenue quarter for MPS, but as a result, we ran down our internal inventory and are experiencing some short-term bottlenecks in wafer capacity and product availability. We haven't addressed our back-end test capacity as we will open up a new 150,000 square foot R&D facility in Chengdu in July that will enable our existing test manufacturing floor to more than double in size. We are working very hard to catch up with the tremendous demand that we are seeing and expect to solve the wafer capacity shortages by the third quarter of this year. I would now like to turn to our outlook for the second quarter of 2010. Q1 2010 was a record revenue quarter for MPS in what is usually one of the lowest revenue quarters of the fiscal year for MPS. And we continue to see very good bookings activity. We expect second quarter 2010 revenue in the range of $53 million to $57 million. For the second quarter of 2010, we expect gross margins in a similar range to the first quarter of 2010. We expect stock-based compensation expense in the range of $5.0 to $5.5 million. This forecast is higher than previous run rates, as this year MPS is issuing performance grants to its executives rather than time-based grants as we did in the past. We believe this new practice better aligns shareholder and employee interests. However, the accounting rules for performance-based grants result in MPS having to record between 56% and 84% of the total grant value in the first year, rather than expenses the grants 25% per year under the typical four-year time-based grants. We expect non-GAAP research and development and selling, general and administrative expense in the range of $17.5 million to $19.5 million. This estimate excludes the stock compensation estimate mentioned above. We expect litigation expense in the range of $2.0 million to $2.4 million due to the ITC hearing process. Finally, we expect our non-GAAP tax rate to remain in the range of 5% to 10%, based on our sales and profit patterns globally. In conclusion, we are pleased to report that MPS had an outstanding first quarter of the year, hitting record revenues and continuing to innovate in technology. We are delivering on our promise to broaden our product portfolio and grow revenues above the industry average and see many long-term growth opportunities in our future. Now, we would like to open the microphone and take your questions.
Operator: Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg of Thomas Weisel Partners. Please proceed.
Tore Svanberg – Thomas Weisel Partners: I'm standing in for Tore. Congratulations on a great quarter. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what this capacity constraint may have done for your lead time. Is your lead time stretched out quite a bit or is it still within your expected range?
Rick Neely: Yes. I'm sorry. Let me introduce Steve Pratt who is our Marketing Director. He's with us on the call today. Michael and I and Steve are in the room, so Steve this is your call.
Steve Pratt: Good afternoon. So as you know, we've experienced unprecedented growth and sure, that's put a constraint on our lead times. Average lead times are 8 to 12 weeks.
Tore Svanberg – Thomas Weisel Partners: And what was it before?
Steve Pratt: Probably about half of that.
Tore Svanberg – Thomas Weisel Partners: And given the strength and the demand for your products and also just on the data that you may have. Can you sort of talk about what the outlook might be for the second half? Do you believe the strength will continue beyond the June quarter?
Michael Hsing: The new product introductions from the couple of years– we see the revenue coming in the second half of last year and then this year. In the past, we announced we have all these– a tremendous amount of new products introduced. Most of the new products, we haven't seen the revenue yet.
Tore Svanberg – Thomas Weisel Partners: That's great. Thank you very much.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Rick Schafer from Oppenheimer. Please proceed.
Rick Schafer – Oppenheimer: Hey guys, nice quarter. I've got a couple questions, actually. I'll start with one that just because there was some chatter out here recently about some Monolithic Power sort of share loss in TV power, specifically to AOS. I mean can you guys comment on what you're seeing in TV in terms of market share and maybe just talk about the competitive – I guess your competitive viewpoint right now?
Michael Hsing: Yes. You're right – in particularly, in the last few days I heard a lot more about AOS and our investor called me, instead of the one taking share was MPS, their solution is better. And I don't want to start with a pissing contest. If you don't want to do it, I will accommodate that. All the details in terms of all these negative comments for the MPS product, I'll let Steve respond to that.
Steve Pratt: Yes. So let me just start by making a short story on this. Last design cycle in the TV market, we did see AOS in certain markets and so we competed head-to-head and we beat them out. And in this design cycle, we're about to undertake, we're going to see the same thing and we have our next-generation product that is an improved version of what we were able to beat them out within the last design cycle. So we expect to continue to dominate in this space.
Rick Schafer – Oppenheimer: So you don't make much of the claims that they're lower – I guess you're less efficient at higher powers or any of that kind of stuff you've been hearing?
Steve Pratt: We did hear some of that and it was very interesting, because the product that we competed with a year ago is a different product that they compared us with, with their product. The product that we won is a product that we're promoting in last year's design cycle and that efficiency was actually better than the product that they compared with their part– their comparison part versus ours. The part that they compared us to isn't even recommended for new designs. It wasn't at the time and it's a five-year old part.
Rick Schafer – Oppenheimer: Okay. Okay. Let's put that to bed. The other question, maybe, I don't know for Rick or for Michael – but I mean do you guys have a feel for mix trends, sort of as we move through the year? I mean ultimately what I'm digging for is sort gross margin trends as we move through 2010. I mean it seems like pricing is more benign this year versus last year. It seems like MiniMonster, Intelli-Phase – some of your newer higher margin parts are ramping. I mean could gross margins sort of – should we think of them as kind ticking up slightly as we move through the year and getting back above 60% or should we just think of them kind of flat-line here?
Steve Pratt: Let me start with a comment on that, Rick. A year ago, we were very aggressively going after market share. So our prices were very aggressive. We're in a different market now. Our prices are much more stable this time around this year.
Michael Hsing: Particularly this year, if you reckon. Pratt, as you said, it's benign. And I don't want to speculate that the margin will go up. We won't say it until we do it, just like we always have done in the past. So just let's put it in that way.
Rick Schafer – Oppenheimer: Okay. Fair enough. And then maybe a question, just I know I'm jumping all over but on M&A– I mean you've seen a lot of tuck-in type M&A. It seems really to have accelerated in the analog space in particular in the last couple of quarters. You guys have got a decent multiple. You've got a great balance sheet. I mean what's your M&A– I guess how much does M&A figure into your growth plans and what areas would you focus on potentially?
Michael Hsing: So far, we haven't really seen any smaller companies that we can acquire that would be accretive. So far we haven't found one yet. But we are not ruling out that we acquire some smaller company for talent or for technology.
Rick Schafer – Oppenheimer: Okay. And then just a follow up, just clarification; on the capacity constraints you guys mentioned, is there any way to quantify what you might be leaving on the table here in 2Q or 3Q in terms of top line? And then that's it. Thanks a lot.
Rick Neely: Yeah, actually. Rick, that one's– as you know, our business is heavily churn dependent so it's difficult to estimate any exact numbers and we haven't spent much time doing that. Obviously, we did miss some potential business this quarter, but we still had record revenues and good guidance. So we don't stay up nights worrying how much. We work hard on fixing the capacity shortages.
Michael Hsing: It we actually started last year and we worked with our fab to increase– to resolve some bottleneck issues and also at the same time, we invested– we started a new building just for foreseeable testing for capacity issues. So this year, we're able to deliver this kind of revenue, particularly for Q1 and also for Q2 as we gave the guidance. For Q3, we don't see any constraints. If there is any, it's very minor.
Rick Schafer – Oppenheimer: Got it. Thanks guys.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
Bob Gujavarty – Deutsche Bank: Hi. This is Bob Gujavarty for Ross. Just a couple of quick questions; first on the CapEx; you mentioned you spent about $5.4 million. What should we think of for the full year CapEx now?
Rick Neely: Yeah. I think the full year would be closer to $15 million, because we're going to spend a significant amount on this new building to finish it off and a lot more test equipment than we had spent in the last year. So $15 million to $20 million would probably be a good range for the year.
Bob Gujavarty – Deutsche Bank: Okay. Great. And just kind of feathered in across the three quarters then?
Rick Neely: Yes.
Bob Gujavarty – Deutsche Bank: Okay. The other one was on DSOs. Your explanation made a lot of sense. So would you expect it to be a little bit of a spike here in Q2 and then trend lower in the back half and is that how we can think about it?
Rick Neely: That's how it works. I mean obviously instead of taking 100 divided by 4 and do 25 per year in a normal deal. You take 50% to 80% in the first year. So obviously it trends off. By quarter, it's a little hard to predict but certainly by the end of year it will be dropping down because it's front-loaded.
Bob Gujavarty – Deutsche Bank: Okay. Fair enough. And then certainly by next year it would be lower because you took most of the expense this year.
Rick Neely: Yes. For those grants that's what happens, yes.
Bob Gujavarty – Deutsche Bank: Okay. And just curious if you had any – this is kind of a similar question to the previous analyst – but did you have any delinquencies in the quarter that you'll be able to kind of ship in 2Q?
Rick Neely: Well, as I said in my previous answer, in terms of how much revenue didn't we get or delinquencies; as a company that's churn dependent without looking at the backlog as often, the delinquencies tend to be something hard to measure because in this churns business if you don't satisfy the order, it goes somewhere else. So it's hard to measure both of those. So we don't, again, spend a lot of time on measuring that. We spend a lot of time on fixing the problem.
Bob Gujavarty – Deutsche Bank: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Vernon Essi of Needham & Company. Please proceed.
Vernon Essi – Needham & Company: Thank you very much. Obviously just wanted to elaborate a little more on the investments your making and was curious just to think about the back-end spending that you're going through in bringing capacity online. When you say you're going to have enough capacity to meet Q3 demand, can you give us an idea of sort of the footprint size you're going to increase this or the throughput or any data that sort of makes us understand what kind of revenue range you can address over time before you have to revisit this again.
Steve Pratt: I'll kind of do the back-end and Michael who's working right now with expanding on the front end. On the back end, as I said, we put a new R&D building in place because our current test building has two floors. One floor is test and one is R&D. By moving the R&D next door to this brand new building, we'll more than double the test floor space. Plus, we spent almost $4 million this quarter on new tester that are coming online. And the testers we use can be purchased and we don't have a shortage of them. So the test capacity is already being fixed. So we don't see any back-end issue there. Michael is working on expanding our foundry capacity. He can talk about that.
Michael Hsing: Yeah. We started working on foundry capacity since the middle of last year. So we are glad we can get through this Q2. And Q3 the bottleneck will be further resolved and the capacity will be increased much more. However, you can't pin down the numbers. There are so many factors in it. But we feel very comfortable.
Steve Pratt: We're getting the wafer starts now that we believe we need. The problem is the lag of three months. If we could have those wafer starts three months ago, that would be great but we didn't. But we will catch it up.
Vernon Essi – Needham & Company: And to refresh, how many partners do you have right now that you're working with?
Michael Hsing: We are working with two, opening up the three, the third one.
Vernon Essi – Needham & Company: Okay. And then that's obviously what your working on right now is to get the third one on board?
Michael Hsing: Well the existing two are the majority of work and will come up from these two. The third one we just started and looking [ph].
Vernon Essi – Needham & Company: Okay. And then could you just anecdotally go over the end market demands and sort of where you've seen the most activity? Obviously you're in a little bit different position than most of the North American companies; having the exposure over in the Pac rim with more feet on the ground there. What did you see in the quarter that sort of surprised you on the upside? I mean there was broad demand, but is there anything that particularly was just very active relative to the rest?
Michael Hsing: Well, for the TV side, we saw a tremendous increase over Q4 of last and it will continue in the Q2 this year. But overall, every market segment increased quite a bit. Steve, if you have any comments?
Steve Pratt: No. I just want to reiterate what you already said, that TV unprecedented growth and TV extending into DVD players, blue-ray players and set-top box.
Michael Hsing: Yeah. And we obviously in the Q4 in the last year, in the last conference, I mentioned that we gained a lot share in the TV market. So it continued on and it is really to our surprise that we did so well in the market.
Vernon Essi – Needham & Company: Okay. And last question here, if you could take just a guesstimate broad brush stroke as to what the breakout of your revenue would be between consumer-driven end markets versus perhaps the IT enterprise side – if you have any idea?
Rick Neely: Yeah. Actually I looked at that, Vernon. It's actually similar to prior quarters. We generally have about 50% to 55% in consumer and Q1 was right in the middle of that range. Computing is only about 10% to 15% of our revenues now and Q1 was in the middle of that. And communications is about 30% and industrial rose up to 6% this time. So that's where we came out this quarter. About the same, what increased was industrial went up a couple of percentage points and com stayed strong at around 30%.
Vernon Essi – Needham & Company: Interesting. Okay. So it all grew kind of fairly linearly.
Rick Neely: It really did. Everything grew well and probably– the one sub-segment that we really like as we have been pointing out, but you can't see it because of the lighting control and the way it's reported is white LED revenue is about three times what they were ago on a quarterly basis. It's buried inside lighting control because you've got the decline of the traditional CCFL in there.
Vernon Essi – Needham & Company: And just for clarification. I'm sorry, one more question here. If you were to look at your LED lighting non-CCFL, if you do the back of the envelope calculation here – but what ratio of that would be backlighting versus just standard LED lighting?
Rick Neely: How much is backlighting versus say like floor lighting or something?
Steve Pratt: You mean in our business? The majority of it currently is backlighting. Yes, so we have two segments. We have the illumination which is the lighting bulb replacement type of market and then the backlighting. And the backlighting currently is dominating.
Vernon Essi – Needham & Company: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Patrick Wang of Wedbush Securities. Please proceed.
Patrick Wang – Wedbush Securities: Great. Thanks for taking my question. A couple of questions here, first off it looks like your first quarter was a little bit back-end loaded. I'm just kind of curious – what kind of linearity are you seeing for the second quarter? And then also, I know that your business is very broad in terms of products here. But what potentially could take you to that low end or the high end of the range of the guidance?
Rick Neely: Well, I'll start off on the linearity. As we've said on the call, Patrick, Q1 typically we have, shipments are less in the third month and the first month. But this quarter, we had strong shipments all the way through the quarter. In fact, a lot of churns in the month of March which was related to why our receivables are high because had a lot of churns that go into the last month. So that was what was different. This quarter, the shipment pattern is staying the same early on. I don't know whether it will continue – usually it's strong in the first two months and tapers off by the end, but we'll see how that goes. It's too early to say. But shipping patterns are still strong. Demand is still strong. Relative to what would make us go above the guidance, I think this quarter demand is ahead of supply, so it's really – this is one quarter where everything we can get out, we can probably ship.
Michael Hsing: Also it's because we have so many products and they depend on the demand of each product. And it's difficult to forecast.
Patrick Wang – Wedbush Securities: Okay. No that's fair. Alright and then second question; I just wanted to talk a little bit about the pricing environment again. I know as we moved through the year, component shortages are going to be alleviated for a lot – for you guys as well as some of your competitors. And I also know that you've got a bunch of new products – MiniMonster and such ramping. But what are you expecting in terms of the pricing environment in the back half of the year?
Michael Hsing: As far as we know, at least for our side, the new products have higher margins and compensates the existing products and so at least in the first half of the year, it's stabilized and in the last couple of quarters. And for the second half of the year, as I said earlier, I don't want to speculate what that gross margin is, but for pricings and for the new products introduction, I think it will be similar as in the past.
Steve Pratt: I see it as being fairly stable in the second half of the year as well.
Patrick Wang – Wedbush Securities: Okay. So I mean your sense is that we're going to be in a more normalized type environment a couple months out?
Steve Pratt: Yes. Correct.
Michael Hsing: Yes.
Patrick Wang – Wedbush Securities: Got you. And then also one of your more exciting design wins that I picked up recently is of course your MiniMonster shipments into a couple key high-profile notebook guys. Can you talk about some of the – can you give us just a little bit more detail in terms of how that came about, when that ramp is going to be and also who you're competing against and what kind of pricing you're seeing there?
Steve Pratt: Yes. I can shed some color on that. We competed against the discrete controller set combination. We beat them out on obviously the size factor. And that was the key and we were price competitive. And the whole architecture has changed in notebooks recently, which is to our advantage. And then what was –
Michael Hsing: I think that's your question, right?
Patrick Wang – Wedbush Securities: Yes. I mean just in terms of the ramp; I mean we knew that Intel ramped up their Calpella platform in January. I'm just kind of curious about the timing of – are we looking for the Calpella refresh?
Steve Pratt: That's right. Yes, I remember you asked that part. So yes, we're starting the ramp up right now.
Patrick Wang – Wedbush Securities: Got you. Okay. Great. Thanks. And the last question is on litigation. I guess Rick, litigation is a little bit higher in the second quarter than you're guiding and than I expected. Does that mean that's also going to drop off faster in the third quarter?
Rick Neely: Yeah. We'd expect it to drop off. This should be the last quarter at that range as far as we know. There's obviously the finishing of the ITC trial. There's a potential trial in July in a Northern district on the same patent. So that's where we get the 2.2. In Q3 it should be down, in Q4 down even further. I don't know the exact magnitude of dollars, but that's how you should look at it.
Patrick Wang – Wedbush Securities: Okay. Great. Congrats, guys. Thanks.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie of Raymond James. Please proceed.
Andrew – Raymond James: Hi. This is Andrew [ph] calling in for Steve. Rick, did you guys give a figure for new products for the quarter-released?
Rick Neely: No. This quarter we didn't. Steve might have one off the top of his head.
Steve Pratt: A number of new products? We released 15 products this quarter.
Andrew – Raymond James: And that's up from 21 last quarter, was it?
Steve Pratt: Up. It's actually down quarter-on-quarter.
Andrew – Raymond James: Oh. Okay.
Steve Pratt: Yes. But for the year it will be up. We'll end the year higher than last year.
Andrew – Raymond James: Right. Okay. Can you provide an update on the MeshConnect and Intelli-Phase?
Michael Hsing: We have a lot of designs and we are really pleased with the results and we expect the revenues in Q3 and in Q4.
Steve Pratt: First Intelli-Phase product in Q3 –
Michael Hsing: Yes. We have revenue now and we'll see some significant increase in the second half.
Steve Pratt: And then regarding MeshConnect, MeshConnect is not just an Intelli-Phase technology. We are using MeshConnect to cross many different DC to DC converter products and that's continuing to proliferate into other products and help us in performance and cost.
Rick Neely: But in terms of revenue, those are still in the design stage, not in the revenue ramping stage. The Intelli-Phase will be the first one out with that technology.
Andrew – Raymond James: Okay. Great. And then finally just any thoughts on a share count next quarter?
Rick Neely: Share count. The forecast for that– I can tell you about what we're thinking – see right now I'd say about 38 to 38.2.
Andrew – Raymond James: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot. Congratulations.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Gus Richard of Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.
Gus Richard – Piper Jaffray: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Hey Michael, on the backlight opportunity for LCD TV, do you have any thought– have people settled on architectures for models for the fourth quarter and sort of depending on which way people go and there are a lot of variations– how do you guys feel you're positioned?
Michael Hsing: The question you asked – we still don't know. And there's a lot of speculations on which architecture to go and our customers have multiple solutions and we offer multiple solutions. And until revenue hits, we will let you know.
Steve Pratt: It hasn't stabilized. It's disruptive, so we have to have multiple options and we do.
Gus Richard – Piper Jaffray: And when do you think that those decisions get made? Is it June timeframe?
Michael Hsing: I don't think that they will determine on one solution. I think that they will introduce all of them.
Steve Pratt: Yes. One architecture is not going to dominate. They're going to go into the market with different architectures, depending upon the size and the type of TV and the market. So it's going to be different architectures across the board for the year.
Gus Richard – Piper Jaffray: Okay. And then just– I know this is an odd question, just what is it that the customer cares about? Is it gamma and particularly in terms of the LED drivers, is it efficiency? Kind of help me out what's driving their thought process in trying to figure out where they're going.
Michael Hsing: Well, actually it's different models that require different things and we are kind of puzzled as to which direction. One is for efficiency the other is for better illumination and the one is doing the edge letting [ph] and it's obviously for size. And they have all kinds of requirements and we offered some very good solutions that we thought were best for efficiencies but it doesn't fit for all the models. Some customers – even within a customer they like our solution but other models they don't.
Steve Pratt: I mean there are subtle features that they are really architecting around is the whole cost of getting from the AC to the DC point to the wide LED, so that's a driver. And that's just based around the most cost-efficient and energy-efficient solution. And the other is dimming control. Those are a couple of key features.
Gus Richard – Piper Jaffray: Got it. Okay and then just to be clear on the MiniMonster design-ins in the notebooks. That was for utility regulators – the chipset memory and graphics, is that correct?
Michael Hsing: That's right.
Steve Pratt: Yes.
Gus Richard – Piper Jaffray: Okay. And then let's see – and then, sort of at the end of the quarter you guys had some acceleration. Was that driven by PC, TV or something else?
Rick Neely: What do you mean by acceleration, Gus?
Gus Richard – Piper Jaffray: It sounded like you had a strong back end of the quarter; right? Your DSOs were up, etc. So business got stronger at the end. Was it just across the board?
Rick Neely: No particular market. I mean demand was higher than supply so it was across the board.
Gus Richard – Piper Jaffray: Okay. And your primary constraints now– just last question and I'll leave you alone– is it testers or is it wafers?
Steve Pratt: Wafers.
Gus Richard – Piper Jaffray: Got it.
Michael Hsing: Wafers and some testers and so we're going to resolve this in this quarter.
Gus Richard – Piper Jaffray: Okay. Got it. I'll let the next person – nice quarter, guys. Thanks.
Operator: And your next question comes from the gentlemen from Thomas Weisel Partners standing in for Tore Svanberg. Please proceed.
Tore Svanberg – Thomas Weisel Partners: Yes. This is actually Tore Svanberg. Great quarter, I had a few follow ups. First of all, could you talk a little bit about your backlog and your churns in the upcoming June quarter? I assume since lead times have stretched out a little bit that getting as many churns has become a little bit more challenging. So just help me understand how that's going to play out please.
Rick Neely: Hi, Tore. I'm glad you're standing in for yourself this time. That's good. As you know, typically we don't talk about backlog and the reason is we're using roughly 50/50 churns and backlog, so there's not a lot of information. This will be another quarter of a reason not to do it, because we have very strong demand, people want to place a lot of orders and whether – it looks good, but we really have no problem with the demand this quarter. It looks very good, so that's what I would say on the bookings. Again, it's more of a supply challenge this quarter than a demand challenge. That's how I would characterize it.
Tore Svanberg – Thomas Weisel Partners: Yes. And in fact that was actually my point; I mean since your backlog is so strong, I was just wondering – and also with your lead times a little bit longer – can you actually get 50% churns in a quarter like this or that now going to be quite a bit lower?
Rick Neely: No. We wouldn't get – this would be clearly not.
Tore Svanberg – Thomas Weisel Partners: Okay. Okay very good. And you mentioned that the distribution inventory days were at the low end of the range of 30 to 45. How long do you expect that to continue? Are the distributors trying to get a little bit higher? Help me understand how that's going to play out for the next couple of quarters.
Rick Neely: In the near-term, as you know in the last couple of quarters before that, we actually were below 30 and we wanted the distributors to actually increase to get to what we considered the reasonable amount that they should carry. Now that's about where they are in low 30s and they probably won't change in the near-term until we have more product available. It's just everything they get in goes right out, so there won't be much change in that I would expect in the near-term.
Tore Svanberg – Thomas Weisel Partners: Great. And last question; obviously you're going start to ramp some more capacity here. Once you do those types of ramps, what type of revenue run rate will you be able to support at that point?
Michael Hsing: It's difficult to say. In the past conference call, I mentioned it somewhere 55 to 60 is our limit. And obviously in the second quarter this year we're within the limits. But last year, however, we worked with the fab capacities and also the test capacity and we're going to do a whole lot more. Until we deliver – until we are in order of these issues, I can't really tell where the bottlenecks are in overall of capacity.
Tore Svanberg – Thomas Weisel Partners: Very good. Great quarter. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Jason Schmidt of Craig-Hallum. Please proceed.
Jason Schmidt – Craig-Hallum: Hey guys. Great quarter. Wondering if with the strong first half you're seeing if you expect normal seasonality in Q3 and Q4?
Rick Neely: That's a question everybody has been asking us and I have to say – can't say, Michael?
Michael Hsing: Yeah. If it's a normal seasonality that would be increase of like 27% and 27% is out of $50, some million. It's a big number and I don't know if we can supply that. We probably can, but it will be difficult. But I'm not speculating what the market demand is.
Rick Neely: Q3, we don't really have a good view of Q3 at this point in time. So we'll put in the capacity to do everything we can and whether it's – generally this year I could say Jason that this year has not– the last three quarters have. None of the historical averages have applied. We did a plus 8% sequentially in Q1. We normally were down 10% or 15%. So it's hard to gauge what the Q3 will be like.
Jason Schmidt – Craig-Hallum: All right. Fair enough. And lastly, are you guys fearful that you're seeing any double ordering right now?
Steve Pratt: Actually, we spend a lot of time looking at double orders. We're constantly scrubbing the backlog and reviewing our distributors' inventories. So we think we're doing a pretty good job managing that.
Jason Schmidt – Craig-Hallum: Okay. Perfect. Thanks guys.
Operator: And gentlemen, at this time there are no more questions in the Q&A queue. I would like to now turn the call back over to Mr. Rick Neely for any closing remarks.
Rick Neely: Thank you, everyone for attending the call and we look forward to talking with you in three months. Take care.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for attending today's conference call. Your conference call is now ended. And you may now disconnect your lines. Have a nice day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Jasmine and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Rick Neely, Chief Financial Officer. Please proceed.
Rick Neely: Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2009 Monolithic Power Systems Conference Call. Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS is with me on today’s call. In the course of today’s conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risks and uncertainties. For example, our business outlook including our business and financial outlook for the first quarter 2010 projected first quarter and full-year 2010 revenues, net income and gross margin, our expectations for first quarter litigation, stock-based compensation and non-GAAP operating expenses, our target operating range for gross margins and inventory, our expectation for revenue and net income growth beyond Q110, our expected average non-GAAP tax rate for 2010, our expected pricing practices for 2010, our belief that MPS is well positioned for future growth, our expectations for future cost reductions and new product introductions, potential customer acceptance and the opportunities these present and the prospect of expanding our market share. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts or guarantees of future performance or events and are based on current expectations, estimates, beliefs, assumptions, goals and objectives and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by these statements. Risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our Form 10-K filed on February 27, 2009, and our Form 10-Q filed on October 22, 2009, which are accessible through our website, www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today's call. We will be discussing operating expense and net income on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude charges related to stock-based compensation, one-time net effect of a litigation provision reversal and in the case of net income, their related tax effects. We will also discuss our expected non-GAAP research and development, and selling, general and administrative expense for the first quarter of 2010, which excludes our expected charges, related to stock-based compensation. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to this release as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our website. I'd also like to remind you that today's conference call is being webcast live over the Internet and will be available for replay on our website for one year along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. We would like to start this call by reviewing our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2009 business highlights. Following this update, I will discuss our operating results. We will conclude by discussing our expectations for the first fiscal quarter of 2010. We will then open up the call to your questions. Let's start with the business highlights. MPS had an excellent fourth quarter growing revenues 34% from the prior year while recording net sales of $46.5 million. For the year, our 2009 revenue came in at $165 million, which was an increase of 3% over our 2008 total of $160.5 million. MPS clearly outperformed the analog industry this year as we grew our revenue while the current SIA and WSTS estimates are for the total analog industry revenues to shrink 10 to 12% year-over-year. For the fiscal year, MPS is one of the few analog semiconductor companies that were able to achieve positive revenue. All product lines except lighting control showed growth, and DC-to-DC revenues were up almost 14% from 2008 levels. This was a truly outstanding performance in a very tough year that reflects the success of our new product strategy. The fourth quarter saw the completion of a record number of new products releases for the year for MPS. For the year, we grew our new product introductions by more than 60%, a phenomenal achievement. In the fourth quarter, some of these new offerings included high-voltage white LED solutions for general lighting applications and large panel backlighting as well as a new monolithic integrated step-down converter for the notebook and netbook markets. In the manufacturing area, gross margin was 58.7%, which was up one point from the fourth quarter of 2008, but down two points from the third quarter of 2009. Our internal days of inventory remained below our target range coming in at 97 days while inventory at our distributors continued to be lean. Bottom line, non-GAAP net income was $7.7 million or $0.20 per fully diluted share. For 2009, our non-GAAP net income was $24.9 million or $.0.68 per share excluding stock compensation and a one-time litigation benefit. Our GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $4.7 million or $0.12 per fully diluted share. Let's look at the financial in a bit more detail. Starting with the P&L, at the top line of revenue, fourth quarter 2009 net revenues of $46.5 million decreased 3% sequentially from the third quarter of 2009 but were up 34% from the $34.7 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008. For the fiscal year 2009, MPS revenues were $165 million, up 3% from the $160.5 that were sold in 2008. If you look at our revenue by product type, fourth quarter DC-to-DC product sales were $36 million, down 2% from the third quarter of 2009 but up 38.5% from the $26 million recorded in the year-ago quarter. For the fiscal year, DC-to-DC revenues were $123.6 million, up 14% from $108.6 million that MPS did in 2008. This annual growth was led by our MiniMonster product family, which grew about 66% year-over-year and also increased sales in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter of 2009.  Our LDO product line had the highest annual percentage growth record in our DC-to-DC line though they started from a smaller base. The largest end markets for MPS in the DC-to-DC product family were flat panel TV, general consumer electronics product, set-top boxes and wireless LAN cards. Lighting control revenues for the fourth quarter were $7.3 million, a decrease of 14% from the third quarter of 2009, but an increase of 12% from the same quarter a year-ago. The quarterly sequential decline reflects the continuing shift of notebook and other backlighting from CCFL solutions to white LED solutions. For fiscal 2009, total lighting control revenues were $27.8 million, down 29% from the $39.1 million recorded in 2008. However, within the lightning control group, MPS has substantial year-over-year growth with its newer product releases of backlight CCFL controllers and white LED drivers, while the traditional CCFL inverters shrank by over 50% year-over-year. Audio revenues came in at $3.3 million, up 19% from the $2.7 million recorded in the prior quarter and up 47% from the fourth quarter of 2008. For fiscal 2009, audio revenues were 12.8 million, up 6% from the 11.6 million reported in 2008. We continue to operate this product line based on market conditions and therefore, we don’t expect any near-term growth in this product area. Let us move down to the gross margin line. Our fourth-quarter gross margin was 58.7% compared to 60.7% in the prior quarter of 2009 and 58% in the fourth quarter of 2008. In 2009, the market saw a dramatic shift away from our traditional CCFL backlighting solution to white LEDs. This happened faster than we expected and negatively impacted 2009 revenues by about $15 million year-over-year. We reacted by pricing some of our DC-to-DC products aggressively in the LCD TV market to both get design wins but also to sell existing sockets. This impacted our gross margin for the fourth quarter. The success of our strategy, however, is evident in our outstanding revenue growth relative to the general analog market in 2009. If you look at our operating expenses on a GAAP basis, they were $22.9 million in the fourth quarter. This includes $20.6 million in R&D and SG&A expense, which includes $4.2 million for stock compensation expense, and litigation expense of $2.4 million. Compared with the third quarter of 2009, GAAP operating expenses were up by $6.9 million. Expense mix changed as follows. R&D increased by $286,000, SG&A increased by $747,000, litigation decreased by $444,000. And in Q3 of 2009, there was a one-time credit or expense decrease for the net effect of the reversal of a litigation provision of $6.4 million that was not repeated in the fourth quarter. As a result, our GAAP operating profit was 9% in the fourth quarter compared to the GAAP operating profit of 27% in the third quarter of 2009. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2008, our GAAP operating expenses were up $5 million, R&D expenses up $1.1 million, SG&A was up $2.1 million and litigation expense increased by $1.8 million from the fourth quarter of 2008. On a non-GAAP basis, our operating expenses, excluding stock compensation and a one-time reversal of a litigation provision were $18.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2009, down from $19.2 million in the third quarter of 2009, and up from the $14.3 million we spent in the fourth quarter of 2008. Total non-GAAP operating expenses of $18.8 million in the fourth quarter were down $465,000 from the prior quarter, primarily due to a decrease in litigation expense. Non-GAAP R&D and SG&A costs were flat sequentially. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2008, non-GAAP R&D costs were up by $1.1 million as we continue to grow our R&D teams and broaden our product offering. But the 2009 figures reflect higher variable compensation than in the prior year. Non-GAAP SG&A spending was up $1.6 million from Q4 of the prior year. MPS performed well above the sales plan for the year compared to underperformance in the fourth quarter of 2008. Finally, litigation expense in the fourth quarter of $2.4 million was up $1.8 million from the fourth quarter of 2008 due to litigation in the ITC. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 18.5% in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared with 20.7% in the third quarter of 2009 and 17.1% in the fourth quarter of 2008. Switching to the bottom line. On a GAAP basis, our Q4 '09 net income was $4.7 million or $0.12 per fully diluted share. For the fiscal year, our GAAP net income was $19.7 million or $0.54 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, our Q4 '09 net income was $7.7 million or $0.20 per fully diluted share. This result is impaired with a non-GAAP tax rate of 12.5%. For the fiscal year excluding stock compensation and the one-time litigation benefit, our non-GAAP net income was $24.9 million or $0.68 per share. Now let's look at our balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalent and investments were $185.1 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2009, up from $169.2 million at the end of the third quarter of 2009, and up significantly from the $150 million on the books in the year ago quarter. In Q4, MPS had operating cash flow of about $15 million as we lowered our accounts receivable balances from the prior quarter. We purchased capital equipment of about $2.3 million in the fourth quarter, which is offset by cash proceeds of $2.8 million from option exercises by employees. Cash receivable ended the fourth quarter at $15.5 million compared with $19.5 million at the end of Q3 '09 and $9.1 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2008. The decrease in receivables from the prior quarter reflected our normal seasonal shipping patterns for the fourth quarter where more shipments are made earlier in the quarter and therefore are collected by the end of Q4. Days sales outstanding declined to 31 days in Q409 as a result of the shipment timing issue I just described. In Q4 of 2008, our DSOs were 24 days due to the dramatic growth in revenue at the beginning of the recession last year. Our internal inventories at the end of the fourth quarter were $19.6 million or about 93 days of inventory on a historical basis. This compares with $20.4 million or 98 days of inventory at the end of the third quarter of 2009. Inventory in our distribution channels shrank slightly in dollars to match the Q4 revenue pattern and total days of distributor inventory was at the low end of our target range of 30 to 45 days for the distribution channels. I would now like to turn to a discussion of general business conditions. MPS finished fiscal 2009 in style hitting record revenues for the fourth of the year as well as growing our annual revenue to a new high. Geographically, in the fourth quarter of 2009, MPS shipped 54% of revenues to Taiwan and China and 46% to other regions, with Korea and Europe performing particularly well. MPS continues to diversify its customer base as our shipments to regions outside of Taiwan and China increased from 42% in the fourth quarter of 2008 to the 46% just mentioned. In the new product area, MPS has continued to innovate rapidly with a record rate of new product introductions, increasing our number of new product introductions by over 60% from 2008. Some of the product highlights include the high-voltage white LED solutions that expand our served available market in LCD backlighting for a large panel and white LED general illumination solution that increase our total available market. We expect material revenue contribution from white LED backlighting solutions in the second half of 2010, particularly in the notebook, monitor and TV markets. In January, 2010, we sampled an industry leading monolithic integrated DC-to-DC buck converter that operates from a wide input voltage range from 5 volts up to 28 volts and delivers up to 6 Amps continuous load current. The combination of a wide input voltage range and industry leading ultra small FEPS [ph] makes this an ideal solution for a notebook computer that demand the highest sufficiency in a space critical application. The new process and product technology that we introduced in 2009 are progressing very well. The interconnect and wafer fabrication technology which we call MeshConnect [ph] and our 25 amp Intelli-Phase driver for microprocessor core power management in servers and notebook computing are both contributing to future cost reductions and significant future revenues as design win progress continues. 2009 was a recessionary year and MPS reacted aggressively. We used a few select products to secure and gain a significant share in a very competitive LCD TV market. This resulted in a relatively small reduction in gross margin percentage but we were able to grow our annual revenue despite a sharp decline in both our CCFL revenue and ASPs in general. For 2010, we expect our pricing approach to return to normal practices. Our best achievement in 2009 was the development and release of the new technology that will expand our market segments and reduce manufacturing cost in the future. Based on these technologies, we released a record number of new products in 2009. With these new products, we believe that we will penetrate new markets and continue to expand our market share on a much broader scale. We believe this strategy will enable MPS to accelerate our revenue and net income growth rate well above our analog [ph] competition in 2010. I would now like to turn to our outlook for the first quarter of 2010. As a reminder to everyone, the first quarter of the year is typically a drop of 7% to 15% in revenue from the fourth quarter and is usually the lowest revenue quarter of the fiscal year for MPS. Now, for the first time, we are seeing very good bookings activities for the first quarter of the year. We expect first quarter 2010 revenues in the range of $45 million to $49 million. For the first quarter of 2010, we expect gross margins flat to slightly down from the fourth quarter of 2009. We expect stock based compensation expense in the range of $3.2 million to $3.6 million. We expect non-GAAP research and development and selling general and administration expense in the range of $16 million to $17 million. This estimate excludes the stock compensation estimate mentioned above. We expect litigation expense in the range of $1.8 million to $2.2 million due to the ITC hearing process. Finally, we expect our non-GAAP tax rate to drop to the range of 5% to 10% based on our sales and profit patterns globally for the year 2010. In conclusion, we are pleased to report that MPS was one of the top performers in the semiconductor industry in 2009, executing very well in a challenging economic environment. We saw last year as an opportunity and we grew revenue despite a major transition for notebook CCFL backlighting to white LED backlighting. We will continue to execute a new product and technology development and broaden our market segment and expand geographically. We firmly believe that we can capture the current and long-term growth opportunities in front of us. And we are optimistic for our future. Now, we will like to open the microphone and take your questions.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Rick Schafer with Oppenheimer & Company. Please proceed.
Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Company:  Hey guys, nice quarter. I just had a couple of questions. I guess first, just on the gross margin down tick, can we get a little bit more color maybe on how short-term it might be? Is it like basically a short-term mix issue? It seemed to me that TV ought to continue to grow as a percentage of sales this year. And I guess I'm curious what kind of lingering impact the pricing action you took to take that share, I guess how does it play out with gross margin this year?
Michael Hsing:  Rick, let me tell you does it, happen, what had happened. Starting from the early part of a last year and during that period and despite of economic conditions, our outlook for the last year revenue wasn’t clear, because we were told by the panel makers that they were accelerating the LED backlighting much faster, that converged on the CCFL to LED in a much faster rate, because of some of the economic conditions. So we took very aggressive strategy as Rick had mentioned earlier, used some with the DC-to-DC product and we easily gained, at the time, we believe we can easily gain the market share. As I said it before, we compete in a consumer market with a 60% gross margin and with only 40% gross margin guidance.  Most of the consumer business on the semiconductor, they all have that kind of a margin. So we competed with our very high gross margins. So we made a decision, just lowered a couple of percentage, as a result you see today. And we grabbed a lot of market in the TV side. So now the question is what is it going forward? It is difficult for us to say it and because we have a lot of turn's business, TV volumes is difficult for us to forecast either. So we said, last quarter we indicated 58.7, in this quarters, in this we said a very similar number, but beyond that, it's very difficult for us to say. We don’t even know what the TV volume is, but overall we're not using the same strategy as the last year. We will maintain our new product gross margins and we're not selling silicon, we're selling solutions now. And we get the most, best margins out of that.
Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Company:  So to sum up, it sounds like, it sounded to me like you're saying gross margin actually probably has a little bit of tailwind, as we move forward in the second quarter and the rest of the year. Is that a fair take away from that Michael?
Michael Hsing:  It's difficult for us to say and I think in the first quarter, we said we will stay in the same range. And for going beyond, I know everyone of you, probably have putting the model in there. I would say that just I don’t clearly know the numbers and fluctuates a percent up or percent down, not going to surprise me. So I will say just for your own benefit to put in the 58%.
Richard Neely:  Yeah. Rick, maybe add in there, as we said, there is always a lag on both things. So the designs we got last year that the people are still shipping the TVs and things, and so there is a carry over effect on the margin. We intend to return to normal pricing practice this year, selling in the value of the technology, and that will kick in, but there's also a lag time to that. So I think somewhere again that makes it difficult but that’s the lag that you have to deal with in figuring it out.
Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Company:  Okay. Well, that helps. And then Rick, I know you mentioned record number of new products and stuff, can you give us, like maybe quantify the number of new parts you had out last year or in the fourth quarter and then maybe give an idea sort of in terms of your top line sort of how much is made up of new typically higher margin parts, let’s say like less than three year old kind of parts?
Richard Neely:  In terms of mix…
Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Company:  Yeah.
Richard Neely:  I mean, we do look at, the first 18 months to two year, it’s a small percentage as you would expect because of the 18 to 24 months design cycle. So that’s typically 5% or 10%. If we go back three years, it’s probably much higher than that, I don’t have a solid number for you on that one. Relative to the number of products, I'll let Steve Pratt [ph] who's our Marketing Director to step in.
Steve Pratt:  Okay. So in Q4, we released approximately 21 new products, and within that, there were actually more individual parts, but 21 release products to the field, that was in Q4. And a year ago, it's about twice as much in Q4 of '09 than in Q4 of '08.
Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Company:  Okay. All right. Well, thanks, guys.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Vernon Essi with Needham & Company. Please proceed.
Vernon Essi - Needham & Company:  Thank you very much. I wondered, if you could possibly, Rick, go over your discussion on the data points in the CCFL erosion versus LED gain and how we should look at that? I mean you gave sort of a 50% figure, could you just walk through that again, so we have something to hang on to here?
Rick Neely:  Yeah. Sure. The 50% was on a percentage basis, so I guess later on in the conversation, I said on a year-over-year basis, if you total up all the dollars, it dropped by about $15 million. So in 2008, we did 25 to 30, and in 2009, we did about 10 to 15 of CCFL, the classic CCFL inverter.
Michael Hsing:  The second part of the question is about LED.
Vernon Essi - Needham & Company:  Well, right. So obviously we should assume the rest of that balance is LED and then…
Michael Hsing:  Yes. A part of is LED for backlight for the notebook. Other one is in the general lighting market; we gain a part of bit.
Rick Neely:  Yes, the way to split it up, Vernon, if you take the number I reported of 7.3, less than half of that is our classic inverter, the rest of it is kind of split between CCFL controllers and then white LEDs, white LED drivers are a little bit better than the controllers. So those groups have both been keep growing as the classic inverter has been shrinking. So most of our white, currently most of our lighting control number is no longer CCFL, the majority are controllers or drivers.
Vernon Essi - Needham & Company:  And so then if we -- your whole point about being aggressive on price sounds somewhat of a Trojan Horse strategy on the DC-to-DC side to get to influence on the signal chain and grow it from there. Is that sort of the way we should be thinking about this? And I guess the follow-on obvious question is, when do you go back to the market and your vendors or your customers and try to renegotiate these prices? The people that you’ve unseated, how are they going to respond to that and how do you expect to deal with it?
Michael Hsing:  We already stopped that product. This is sort of like a one-time event. And as I said always in the past, I can -- anything what we do is in fact two years from now, but -- there is something I can do, and in fact about half year from, which I can turn the knob on the ASP, and I can grow the revenue, that’s what I did. And I see this is best way to grow the EPS for that extraordinary time. And so then to answer your question, we go back to the normal practice. And we don’t give away the product anymore. The reaction is normal, that's what’s MPS, we're selling solution, we're selling our values.
Vernon Essi - Needham & Company:  Okay. And then just to switchgears to MeshConnect [ph], is there a way to quantify sort of your expectations on proportion of revenue you expect to generate? I mean we’ve talk some pretty big market figures in the past now that the stuff is sampling, how should we thinking about that progression for 2010.
Michael Hsing:  I don’t see a major impact on a -- everybody is talking gross margin. On the gross margin, I don’t see a major impact on the gross margin thing. We released those products and these are -- some of them cannibalized our sales with low cost, so I expect those revenues start to increase in end of the year. And so the gross margin won't be impacted that much by the MeshConnect [ph] technology.
Vernon Essi - Needham & Company:  But my question wasn’t so much gross margin, but just in terms of proportion, given the dialog you are having with folks on that product, where do you expect that to be at the exit of the 2010 as a percent of sales for instance?
Michael Hsing: 
 :
Vernon Essi - Needham & Company:  That’s helpful. Thank you very much.
Michael Hsing:  Okay.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank:  Hey, guys. Just one last time looking at the gross margin side of things, you know, it all makes sense for a full year pricing strategy et cetera, but why did you really creep up just in this quarter given that you guided flat in gross margin? This quarter meaning the fourth quarter, I should say?
Rick Neely:  Yeah. If you are telling, why were you two points up the quarter, that one basically was relative to the turns, the turns came in the second half of the Q4 worse than we thought, so we were…
Michael Hsing: 
Y:
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank:  So the audio amp stuff going up, whatever 18%, 19% sequentially, that was the driver?
Rick Neely:  That was part of it and also DC-to-DC too.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank:  Got you. Okay. And then over into the revenue side of things, like you said earlier, Rick, usually you guys are down in the first quarter quite a bit, being up at all is a big change, do you think that’s at all pulling forward demand out of the second quarter?
Rick Neely:  That’s a really, really…
Steve Pratt:  Great question, we're going to ask you that question, but it’s okay.
 Michael Hsing:  I think if we didn’t do that within – quite aggressively early last year, I don’t think that we are going to grow revenue this first quarter. As we said, gross margins do similar to the last quarter, we still see -- and in this quarter, we did see a lot of TV shipments.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank:  Okay. So you just still taking share there?
Rick Neely:  I guess, the last question. You kind of gave the numbers, but for the lighting control business, it seems like the vast majority of the headwinds from CCFL are now behind us. Would you expect that final bit of CCFL to just completely disappear this year and how should we consider that process versus the other part of that segment growing?
Rick Neely:  Yeah. I think on a year-over-year comparison, we are kind of out of the woods, as you said, Ross. I think we are down to few million dollars a quarter and it may trickle off to a million by the end of the year. There is always a few applications.
Michael Hsing: theirs is always a few oddball [ph] applications not in the main stream anymore.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank: Got you. But you are not going to - you just don’t even have the revenues left to lose 15 million year-over-year.
 Rick Neely:  Exactly. We couldn’t lose 15 because there is not that much to lose.
 Michael Hsing:  So that’s why we didn’t do that, have a aggressive pricing strategy because we see the business going to normal, and we don’t have the hole to fill.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank:  Got you. Then the last one for me, I am not sure you actually can even answer but the update on the timing of any other cases with the litigation?
Rick Neely: I can update. The major updates is the ITC, the ITC trade court which originally I think had told us something like in February they’d gives us a decision, they have now postponed that to April for the first round, if you know the process. And the final round in August so it’s been pushed out at least three, four months for the ITC trial, that’s what we know.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank:  And did that just prolong this kind of 2 million a quarter issue until August or you kind of did all the spending you need to do till you now hear the decision?
Michael Hsing: It is -- you can just follow the model, we don’t even now. For your model, just keep the same, but overall this year, we expect that the litigation will go down.
Rick Neely:  It will go down from the last year may stretch out a little bit into another quarter, I think that’s probably accurate.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank:  Got you. Any idea of the down how much year-over-year, is that, or my guess is as good as yours?
Rick Neely: We will let you guess that one.
Michael Hsing:  We would be pretty much, it will be significantly lower, but all these cases, I can’t really control.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank:  Okay. Thanks, guys.
Rick Neely:  Hello?
Operator:  Ladies and gentlemen, due to the number of questions in queue, please keep your questions down to one question and one follow-up. Your next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie with Raymond James. Please proceed.
Steve Smigie - Raymond James:  Great. Thanks. Hoping you could talk a little bit more in the LED business, which categories within LED you see to be the big drivers in 2010? 
Michael Hsing:  Hi. I have Steve to answer.
Steve Pratt: Yes, so the big drivers for 2010 are going to be in the TV space and the monitor space.
Steve Smigie - Raymond James:  Okay. And so you don’t see like street lighting’s going take a while to get there and…
Steve Pratt : Street lighting and decorative lighting, those are the illumination segment and those are going to be a lesser extent still growing, but to a lesser extent of the white LED product.
Michael Hsing:  Yes, that market is still maturing and we are at the forefront of that?
 Rick Neely:  Yeah. I think the good news on that, Steve, is that we will have what we can consider probably significant revenue in that kind of market, which is more than a $1 million, which on an annual basis isn’t much, but it is a very good start for that type of product.
Steve Smigie - Raymond James: Okay. And if you could just talk a little bit to update on battery charger and Intelli-Phase and LDO stuff too? Thanks.
Rick Neely:  In the battery charger space, we have a new family of switching chargers. It’s our first product. Prior to that, it’s been all linear going into mobile phones, one cell devices. Now we can get into one and two cell higher current applications beyond just a phone. And so those products are currently in the design in phase, they are release products for MPS, and so they will contribute revenue in the later half of the 2010. And the end products, the end products that they are going into, the nice thing about that is beyond mobile phones, we’re seeing it in portable, POS terminals. We’re seeing it in any hand-held device, so it’s a very -- it’s a broad based application set, far beyond just the mobile phone application.
Steve Smigie - Raymond James: And the LDO stuff...
Michael Hsing:  And then in the LDO space, actually we’re very excited about the LDO product line. We have -- last year was a great year for new product introductions. We more than doubled our new products in that space and our revenue has done very well for these products. They are portfolio based going into a broad number of applications from mobile phone to industrial applications, HVAC, they are just used --and we have 1 amp, we have 2 amp solutions, which obviously are well beyond a handheld device. So those products are getting into a broader base of applications and our revenue is doing quite well in that space. 
Michael Hsing: And also the gross margins are doing really well. And usually LDO is associated with very low margin, these are very high performance product, and also we selectively go into, these are very high end applications.
Steve Smigie - Raymond James: So may be a few million dollars revenue from each of those categories this year?
Michael Hsing:  Yes. May be higher.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg With Thomas Weisel Partners. Please proceed.
Tore Svanberg - Thomas Weisel Partners:  Yes. Thank you. First question is looks like you are bookings are pretty strong so far in the quarter, so could you just talk a little bit about you backlog coverage or may be quantitatively talked about your confidence level with your revenue target for Q1?
 Rick Neely:  Yeah. Thanks Tore. If you had listened to our calls before, we don’t give out backlog numbers because typically it doesn’t mean that much given the high turns ratio we have. But we could say based on, as we said in the press release, very good bookings, above normal, well above normal, so obviously that would give us a higher confidence level.
Tore Svanberg - Thomas Weisel Partners:  Very good. And my follow-up, sort of coming back to gross margin issue, but there were reports out there that your gross margin is going to be lower because of any activity in the notebook market, but it just seems like it was solely in the TV market last year and it’s got nothing to do with notebooks this year.
 Michael Hsing:  That’s right. It’s mostly from LCD TV market and we have very little notebook. This is the first quarter the entire history of the company where we’re very little exposed to notebooks. The DC-to-DC has not quite ramped up yet but we have no intention to give the product up.
Tore Svanberg - Thomas Weisel Partners:  Okay. Let me just sneak in one last one. You know you talked about TV being a pretty important business for your second half of the year and the LED. Are we talking about multi-million dollar opportunity here or is this going to be more of hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Rick Neely:  It is hard to project because I don’t know those model will ramp up, and so it is difficult for us to say, but we will see by the end of the day, by the end of the year. And some customer will tell us, we are going to ramp this other one, the project is delayed, and I don’t have a very good grip on the real number yet.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Tristan Gerra with Robert Baird. Please proceed.
Tristan Gerra - Robert Baird:  Hi. Good afternoon. Did you have sales prepaid to small China-based distributors in the quarter and if so how did that compare with Q3?
Michael Hsing:  Yes, Tristan. We do for our small distributors in Asia, we generally do pre-payment terms, that’s one of the reasons our DSO hover around 30 days. The amount this quarter -- I don’t actually have the number in front of me but I know it wasn’t a significant change from the prior quarter. The biggest change in the DSO was really the timing pattern of the shipments, which allows us to collect it, not the pre-payments from the smaller Chinese vendors.
Tristan Gerra - Robert Baird:  Okay. So fair to assume that it’s going to be, it could be stable going forward as opposed to something that’s done opportunistically and could be lumpy from quarter to quarter.
Michael Hsing:  The thing that drives our DSO, while we are pretty strict on our payment terms, but the DSO will move up and down as you could historically up from 31 to 37, to pay down on when more shipments go out. If they go out early in the quarter, we collect it. If they go out more in the third month of the quarter, then we will have a higher DSO, that’s usually the pattern that you see.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Doug Freedman with Broadpoint. Please proceed.
Doug Freedman - Broadpoint:  Great. Thanks, guys, for taking my question. You have been forthcoming with your goal about growing the industry, would you mind sharing with us what you are expecting the industry growth rate next year to look like?
 Rick Neely:  What Rick means, the company is set up to beat the competition. We have a few models and we want to beat those companies, and that’s how all the stuff, the company operates, and the heart of each department, each segment is being measured on it. That’s what we meant. And of course, industrial growth, I think you guys know a lot better than we do. I only can keep, just keep executing, and whatever happens, we can -- if we can react, we react; if not, we let it be.
Doug Freedman - Broadpoint:  I guess can you give us some idea of, do you believe you are presently shipping to your customers’ demand levels or do you believe that they are in the process of building inventory or holding their inventories in line with their production levels?
 Rick Neely:  That’s a good question, Doug. I think that’s something everybody’s trying to figure out. What we can track, as we have said every time, our inventories, we can track our distis’ inventories, and both are staying at the lean levels as we mentioned, it’s harder for us to figure out down the stream. So as far as can we tell, we are ordering to demand, that we can see. Further up the chain, however, we’re usually unable to see the end retail chain, we don’t have data on that.
Michael Hsing: Yeah, I just heard the news, okay. I don’t know, you guys didn’t know that too. This year has more LCD buyers in this country than the last year, so I guess they are buying for the current shipping, I guess.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Arnab Chanda with Roth Capital. Please proceed.
Arnab Chanda - Roth Capital:  Thank you. Sorry, I probably have to beat a dead horse here, but a question about, if I can ask I mean hopefully the last question on gross margins, is it sort of related to the fact that your competitive utilization is low, so their pricing is more aggressive? And when that changes around, that should change your gross margins too? And then what the lag time, if that’s true, if you could may be elaborate on that a little bit?
Rick Neely:  Hi. Arnab. This is Rick. The lag time -- again on pricing, like if you win a deal today, and I think 3, 9, the chips that you already have designed in, and it is going to production and lasts for 12 months, if that could be the lag time. If you’re referring to last year, a lot of people were aggressive on pricing as you know because their capacities were empty and certainly what it seems to be this quarter, it’s capacity has filled up, I think generally both in the fabs and the assembly. So again I think that relates to our comment that we think we can get back to normal pricing practices this year and that’s one of the reasons the competitors built up their capacities a bit. So with that in mind that’s what we mean. Again as Michael said, the second half 2010 margin, it depends on the uptick of new things, the downtick of the old things, and we couldn’t make an accurate call, so we don’t try and go that far ahead. We only give the near-term guidance.
Arnab Chanda - Roth Capital:  Great. And then just one follow-up on the – if you are looking at your kind of revenue mix, normally Q1 and Q4 are down quite a bit and then Q2 and Q3 are up a lot. Given the fact that you are actually up in Q1 but your inventories are down, qualitatively speaking should we assume a little more muted but continuous growth or how does your internal models look on that?
Michael Hsing: As I said many, many times, our inventory is not quite like other companies related to our - our future revenues. And so we always manage it; shift the product to our customers, so we react very fast.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Pat Wang with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed.
Pat Wang - Wedbush Securities:  That’s pretty cool. It’s actually Wedbush but my answer -- my questions have been answered. Thanks, guys.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Auguste Richard with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.
Auguste Richard - Piper Jaffray:  Thanks for taking my question. And again it’s all related to the same thing. When I think of modeling your company going forward, if you have a weak gross margin quarter, would that imply that you are going to have a really strong top-line, because you are going to be taking share with the aggressive pricing that you’ve put in place? That’s how it’s going to work and so given the analog trade off between growth and gross margin, given that you are in economic whirlpool, last year, you just basically took the shots knowing you would gain the market share.
Michael Hsing: Absolutely. It was gross margin going down, okay. And without seeing the EPS going up, we screwed it up, okay. And I don't think we screwed it up, I think we - I'm glad I have made that decision last year. MPS is a small company, and despite of economic, we should have grow actually because the CCFL switch is going away from us, went away from us last year that rapidly, okay. We didn't expect it. And that's why I made a drastic different decision to grow the EPS.
Rick Neely:  Right. I think that's a great point because when we looked at our Q4 EPS, it's one of the best ones we have done in a Q4, and I kind of knew that if you look at Q1, it's normally our first quarter, as you mentioned, is a low revenue quarter. We are growing in this quarter with very good revenues. I expect, if you look at our guidance and do the math, you will probably end up with something around a 60% increase in EPS versus the last three years history So it's a significant improvement in EPS from what we have been doing, certainly it's going to show in the Q1 data.
Auguste Richard - Piper Jaffray: And let me just try one follow on. In talking to you guys over the year…
Rick Neely:  Hello?
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Brian Piccioni with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Brian Piccioni - BMO Capital Markets:  Thank you. I thought I missed the cut there. We have seen an impact to your business as LEDs have replaced cold cathode in backlighting and one of the hot trends in the television market is to go from white LEDs to multi-colored LEDs in order to improve the color gamut. Do you view that as being positive, negative or neutral for the backlighting business, for your backlighting business not for the..?
Michael Hsing: All of that is absolutely positive because we don't have CCFL solution for large panels such as the TV applications. Now we have a very good solution for LCD TV and as well as offline lighting, LED solution. So it's all positive.
Brian Piccioni - BMO Capital Markets:  I guess there would be more drivers because there's more LEDs as well?
Michael Hsing:  Not quite. Yes, lot of LEDs, depends on the how they construct it. They have a different, multiples screen, or they have one screen. It's all different. So you need a few solutions. So, how to do the backlighting for TV? It's not quite standardized like a CCFL. CCFL is pretty much, everybody doing the same way. But LEDs are not quite settled yet.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Craig Berger with FBR Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Craig Berger - FBR Capital Markets:  Hey, guys. Nice job on the results. Can you just remind us kind of where MiniMonster has penetrated in terms of end markets or applications and kind of what is still in front of us in terms of growth?
Michael Hsing: Some of the notebooks and little TVs and these are the non noticeable things, okay. But we have audio and telecommunications and set-top boxes and in many other applications.
Steve Pratt:  And industrial applications. I mean one of our advantages is, our technology is high voltage, and we have add some high-voltage products out now for well over a year, and so we are seeing revenue in those products with 50 and 60 volts input capability.
Craig Berger - FBR Capital Markets:  And then as part of that, a follow up question is, just can you talk about how much fab capacity you have available and whether you are seeing any production bottlenecks and then also as part of that, what you expect wafer price trends to do in the first half of the year? Thanks.
Michael Hsing: Overall, we don't have production constraints and although the revenue increased quite a bit. The shipment increased a lot. And we have a very good relationship with our foundry partners always. Any time we ship over 200 kinds of product and at any time, we would have some kind of allegation, but overall we don't have a problem.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh with ThinkEquity. Please proceed.
Vijay Rakesh - ThinkEquity:  Yeah. Hi, guys. Just looking at the DC-to-DC converter segment, can you give a breakdown by products, which are the key products and what percentage they are like handsets -- not handsets, but what are the rest of segments within DC-to-DC?
 Rick Neely: Hi, Vijay. In general, we don’t -- if you look at the company in total, it's similar to what we said in the past in terms of the range for the fourth quarter. About half our revenues is what we would call it consumer segment, about a third is communication, and computing is down to say 15%. But actually industrial grew to around 5%, given a lot of activity in smart meter. So the biggest interest, I think Michael made a comment, notebooks are now single-digit of our revenue, less than 10%, so that’s actually how it splits out. But DC-to-DC would be similar 
Vijay Rakesh - ThinkEquity: The mix is similar.
 Rick Neely: The mix are similar, yes.
Vijay Rakesh - ThinkEquity: And on the LED TV side, you mentioned you are trying to get in, did some aggressive pricing, you mentioned sockets there, but if you were to assume 15 million LED TVs for 2010, if you were to take a stab, what market share could you get exiting 2010?
 Michael Hsing:  It’s very difficult for us to address the market share because some large TV use six, seven DC-to-DC converters, and some are smaller, use one or two, and there are only a few LCD makers that will shift to these guys and we don’t know how to differentiate it, how do they use it.
Vijay Rakesh - ThinkEquity:  Okay.
Operator:  There are currently no more questions in the queue. I would now like to turn the call back over to your host for today, Mr. Rick Neely. Please proceed.
Rick Neely:  Thank you everyone for attending the call. We look forward to talking you in about three months for the Q1 call. Thanks, again.
Operator:  Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today’s conference. Thank you for your participation, you may now disconnect. Have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the third quarter 2009 Monolithic Power Systems Inc. earnings call. My name is Jeff, and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host for today, Mr. Rick Neely, Chief Financial Officer. Please proceed, sir.
Rick Neely: Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to the third quarter fiscal 2009 Monolithic Power Systems conference call. Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS is with me on today's call. In the course of today's conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty. For example, our business outlook, including our business and financial outlook for the fourth quarter of 2009; projected fourth quarter revenues and gross margins; our expectations for fourth quarter litigation, stock-based compensation and non-GAAP operating expenses, our target operating model range for gross margins and operating expenses, our expected average tax rate for 2009; our belief that MPS is well positioned for future growth; our expectations for future cost reductions, and new product introductions, potential customer acceptance and the opportunities these present. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts or guarantees of future performance or events and are based on current expectations, estimates, beliefs, assumptions, goals and objectives and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by these statements. Risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in our SEC filings, including, but not limited, to our Form 10-K filed on February 27, 2009 and our Form 10-Q filed on July 30, 2009, which are accessible through our website, www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today’s call. We will be discussing operating expense and net income on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude charges related to stock-based compensation, one time net effect of a litigation provision reversal, and in the case of net income their related tax effects. We will also discuss our expected non-GAAP research and development and selling, general, and administrative expense for the fourth quarter of 2009, which excludes our expected charges related to stock-based compensation. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to this release, as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our website. I would also like to remind you that today's conference call is being webcast live over the Internet and will be available for replay on our website for one-year along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. We would like to start this call by reviewing our third fiscal quarter 2009 business highlights. Following this update, I will discuss our operating results. We will conclude by discussing our expectations for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2009. We will then open up the call to your questions. Let's start with the business highlights. MPS had a healthy third quarter growing revenues 16.5% from the prior quarter while recording net sales of $48 million. This total almost reached the companies all-time quarterly revenue high of $48.9 million that were sold in the third quarter of 2008. This was an excellent achievement in an uncertain economic environment. MPS saw significant growth in its largest product family, the DC to DC product group in Q3. Total DC to DC revenues of $36.7 million in the third quarter were up almost 24% sequentially from the second quarter of 2009 and up 16% year-over-year. The third quarter also saw a record number of new product releases. These new offerings range from high-efficiency battery charger ICs for netbook PCs to new high-voltage white LED solutions for general lighting applications. We continue to strengthen our revenue diversity by using a very broad approach in developing solutions for computing consumer and industrial applications. In the manufacturing area, gross margin increased from the prior quarter to 60.7%, reflecting the gradual improvement in the market conditions. Our internal days of inventory dropped slightly below our target range coming in at 98 days while inventory at our distributors continue to be lean. Bottom line, non GAAP net income was $8.8 million or $0.24 per fully diluted share. Our GAAP net income for the quarter was $12.6 million or $0.34 per fully diluted share, which reflect a one-time credit of $6.4 million for the net effect of the reversal of a legal provision from 2007. Now let us go through the financials in more detail. On the P&L, starting at the revenue line, third quarter 2009 net revenue of $48 million increased 16.5% sequentially from the second quarter of 2009, and were about flat to the $48.9 million recorded in the third quarter of 2008. The third quarter is typically MPS' strongest revenue quarter and this year MPS' sales performed well once again in a recovering market. Let's break out our third-quarter revenue by product type. DC to DC product sales were $36.7 million, up 24% from the second quarter of 2009, and up 16% from the $31.7 million reported in the year ago quarter. The growth was led by our MiniMonster product family which is continuing to set sales records but all of the DC to DC product did well this quarter. The largest end markets for MPS in this product family were flat panel TVs, general consumer electronics products, set-top boxes and wireless LAN cards. Lighting control revenues for the third quarter were $8.5 million, an increase of 16% in the second quarter of 2009, but a decrease of 33% from the same quarter a year ago. The year-over-year decline reflects the continuing shift of notebooks and other backlighting from CCFL solutions to white LED solutions. However, within the lighting control group, MPS did report both sequential and year-over-year growth with its newer product releases of backlight controller and white LED drivers. Audio revenues came in at $2.7 million, down 34% from the $4.1 million reported in the prior quarter and down 38% from the third quarter of 2008. In this competitive environment, we don't expect any near-term growth in this group. Let us move down to the gross margin line. Third-quarter gross margin was 60.7% compared to 59.1% in the prior quarter of 2009 and 52.8% in the third quarter of 2008. This result met our expectations given the current economic conditions which saw a slightly improving product mix and pricing environment in the third quarter. Looking at our reported expenses and operating margins, our GAAP operating expenses were $60 million in the third quarter. This includes $19.5 million in R&D and SG&A expense, which includes $3.1 million for stock compensation expense, litigation expense of $2.8 million and a credit of $6.4 million as a result of the net effect of reversing a patent litigation provision, initially recorded in Q2 of 2007 for the Taiwan Sumida case. Comparing with the second quarter of 2009, GAAP operating expenses were down by $5.3 million. The expense mix changed as follows. R&D increased by $348,000, SG&A increased by $117,000, litigation increased by $578,000, a one-time credit for expense decreased for the net effect of the reversal of the litigation provision for $6.4 million. As a result, our GAAP operating profit was 27% in the third quarter, compared with a GAAP operating profit of 7% in the second quarter of 2009. Let us review our non -GAAP operating expenses. Excluding stock compensation and the net effect of the one-time legal provision reversal, our non-GAAP operating expenses for the third quarter of 2009 were $19.2 million compared to $17.5 million in the second quarter of 2009, and $16.8 million in the third quarter of 2008. The $1.7 million expense increase in the second quarter of this year was primarily due to higher litigation spending, which increased by almost $600,000 from the prior quarter and R&D costs grew by $626,000 to support the record number of new product introductions. SG&A costs grew $527,000 from the second quarter due to variable cost increases associated with the strong revenue growth performance. Compared to the third quarter of 2008, non -GAAP R&D costs were up by $722,000 as we continue to grow our R&D team and broaden our product offering. Non-GAAP SG&A spending was flat from Q3 of the prior year. Our non -GAAP operating margin was 20.6% in the third quarter of 2009 compared with 17% in the second quarter of 2009 and 28.4% in the third quarter of 2008. On the bottom line, our Q3 09 GAAP net income was $12.6 million or $0.34 per diluted share. On a non-GAAP basis, our Q3 09 net income was $8.8 million or $0.24 per fully diluted share. This result was computed with a non-GAAP tax rate of 12.5% within our expected average tax rate range for 2009 of 10% to 15%. Now let us look at some of same major changes to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $169.2 million at the end of the third quarter of 2009, up from $163.8 million at the end of the second quarter of 2009, and up significantly from the $128.8 million on the book in the year ago quarter. In Q3, MPS had operating cash flow of about $2.2 million as the strong net income figure was offset by an increase in accounts receivables. We spent about $2.3 million on capital in the third quarter which was more than offset by cash growth fees of $5.6 million from option exercises and purchases under employee stock options. Accounts receivables ended the third quarter at $19.5 million compared with $12.4 million at the end of Q2 09 and $18.8 million at the end of the third quarter of 2008. The increase in receivables reflected a similar pattern to our third quarter of 2008 where more shipments were made later in the quarter and therefore not collected by the end of Q3. However, as of today's call, MPS has collected approximately $10.4 million of the receivables that were outstanding debt the third quarter end. Days sales outstanding increased to 37 days in Q3 09 as a result of the shipment timing issue I just described which is in line with the 35 days we showed at the end of the third quarter of 2008. Our inventories at the end of the third quarter were $20.4 million or about 98 days of inventory on a historical basis. This compares with $20.1 million or 109 days of inventory at the end of the second quarter of 2009. Inventory in our distribution channels grew $5 million to support the higher revenues. The total days of inventory remained below our target range of 30 to 45 days of inventory for the distribution channel. I would now like to turn to a discussion of general business conditions. The third quarter of 2009 continued to show the positive product momentum that has made up for a slow start to the year. Geographically in the third quarter of 2009, MPS shipped 55% of revenues to Taiwan and China and 45% to other regions with Korea and Europe performing particularly well. MPS continues to diversify its customer base as our shipments to regions outside of Taiwan and China increased from 42% in the third quarter of 2008 to the 45% just mentioned. In the new product area, the highlight of the quarter was the record number of new products released across a board spectrum of applications. MPS has more than doubled its rate of new product introductions year-over-year. Some of the product highlights include high-voltage bright LED solutions that expand our presence in LCD backlighting and white LED illumination solutions that increase our served available market including street lighting and the replacement of halogen, incandescent and fluorescent bulb applications. We are also very pleased with the progress of our newer product families such as MiniMonsters, LDOs and white LED drivers. Some examples of where these products are going, include flat-panel TVs, monitors and cable modems for MiniMonsters, industrial applications for LDOs, and notebook and TV backlighting for white LED drivers. Finally, in the new process technology development area, we had a new interconnect and wafer fabrication technology in production which we call Mesh Connect [ph]. This unique technology, which has a patent pending, enables us to reduce our cost, increases the switching frequency by up to four times with a much higher packing density. Using this technology, we successfully introduce a 24 amp Intelli-Phase driver last quarter and we're looking forward to converting all of our product lines to use this proprietary approach. I would now like to move to our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2009. MPS continued its strong booking pattern from the second quarter in Q3 and while keeping channel inventory lean. The fourth quarter is typically a slight seasonal drop for MPS and therefore our expectations for revenues are in the range of $43 million to $46 million. Gross margin is expected to be at a similar level to the third quarter of 2009. We expect stock-based compensation expense in the range of 3.1 to $3.5 million. We expect non-GAAP research and development and selling general and administrative expenses in the range of $16.2 million to $17.2 million. This estimate excludes the stock compensation estimate mentioned above. Finally we expect litigation expense in the range of $2.6 million to $3 million due to the commencement of the ITC hearing this month. In conclusion, we are pleased to report that MPS once again performed very well in a difficult economic environment. We have been generating strong revenues, investing in R&D, and expanding our product families in geographic diversification. Our focus on the introduction and design in of very high-performance new products and product families will position MPS very well for future growth. Now we would like to open the microphone and take your questions.
Operator: (Operator instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Rick Schafer with Oppenheimer. Please proceed sir.
Rick Schafer – Oppenheimer: Hi guys, nice quarter. I just had a question actually just on your guidance and sort of what order patterns look like post golden week [ph], can you give us an idea maybe have you seen any unusual slowdown in bookings, can you give us any kind of answer, book to bill still positive, just seems like down 8% at the midpoint for 4Q, seems a little lower than seasonal, can you give us any color there, maybe what turns you need to get there for the fourth quarter?
Michael Hsing: Now we particularly this month we see a pretty normal business seasonal pattern. What I say normal, it's like a couple of years ago or so, and we see the lead times and the booking rate and it seems to me it is not like a couple of quarters ago. It is more normal I'd say.
Rick Neely: Yes, I think I would echo what Michael said, it seems to be behaving pretty normally this quarter. I think our midpoint is down 7% if I did the math right, Rick, but that typically we are down 5% to 10%. We have spent 3% in the best years and 10% in the worst years and last year was another year. So we think it is a reasonable expectation for the general market conditions we have.
Rick Schafer – Oppenheimer: Okay. And Rick, can you give us an idea of turns maybe, Rick, like what you need to do to get the fourth quarter midpoint?
Rick Neely: Nothing out of the ordinary. The bookings were good to support you know what I would call a normal amount of turns we go into the quarter with, so we are not – we don't see anything on the horizon that looks bad, it looks all pretty good for us actually.
Rick Schafer – Oppenheimer: Okay, can you – okay, that is fine. Just got a follow up question on your – I just was curious on the litigation front, you know is there anything that is getting pulled in from 2010 into the third and fourth quarter this year? I mean I guess sort of what's changed it , I know it's really hard to predict that litigation expenses but anyway to handicap what's going on there?
Michael Hsing: No, the current litigation is scheduled, everything is on time, and nothing delayed, and we expect it to have litigation expense much reduced in Q1.
Rick Neely: As you said, Rick, the hardest thing to predict is legal expenses, because you have to react to how the case moves and changes, and we always go in these things to do well, so we have to spend the money as necessary. So it is difficult always to forecast as you said, but the hearings we are starting now, but by the first half of next year, it will be done. So we don't – that is really the mountain we have to get through, and that is really what we're looking at.
Rick Schafer – Oppenheimer: Okay. So you still hope to wrap things up sort of May kind of timeframe, is that fair enough?
Michael Hsing: Probably earlier than that if everything according to schedule.
Rick Neely: Yes, per the schedule, there'll be a preliminary ruling in January and then both parties go back and then there is usually a final ruling in the May June timeframe, that is still the schedule.
Michael Hsing: Cost of all doing that is much less than have a trial.
Rick Schafer – Oppenheimer: Got it, got it.
Michael Hsing: So I expect that in Q1 it's much less.
Rick Schafer – Oppenheimer: Okay, thanks a lot guys.
Michael Hsing: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Vernon Essi with Needham & Company. Please proceed.
Vernon Essi – Needham & Company: Thank you very much. Wanted to just get some more color on the gross margin and sort of what went into that this quarter. I noticed your audio was down and wondering if the gross margin expansion was a function of mix or volume and sort of how that might play out over the next couple of quarters?
Rick Neely: Yes, Vernon, you're right. When we sell more DC to DC, that mix shift tends to help our gross margin, and that is the primary reason behind the increase in gross margin this quarter. Going forward, again, the audio will stay at those levels, so will probably be the same. That is why we gave the guidance that we expect to be in a similar range in Q3.
Vernon Essi – Needham & Company: (inaudible) the audio sort of more of a proactive function on you guys seem to sort of not let that business, you haven't really spent a lot of money on it, let's put it that way. Is that more of a function of the market or you sort of not pushing as hard as you used to?
Michael Hsing: We never, we only push hard one-time, three years ago. And we never pushed this product very hard. But I don't really expect that product line (inaudible) so maintain the current level alive and keep you know we don't expect to have any growth on it.
Vernon Essi – Needham & Company: Okay. And then just a follow up on the gross margin front, as you ramp the Mesh Connect, is there any startup costs you see with that, or do you expect now, obviously you think you're going to…
Michael Hsing: No, I don't think that the cost is already the past in the last couple of years and we spent a lot of effort in the last two years to develop this technology. Going forward is the design all the new products and lot of them were cannibalized our existing product and all the new products will be based on this technology.
Vernon Essi – Needham & Company: And when will the transition pass sort of the 50% of volume point for your products?
Michael Hsing: 50% of volume point, that will be difficult to say. Because some of it require customers qualifications and probably in the next year or so, end of next year, we will – I am just pulling numbers from a head…
Vernon Essi – Needham & Company: No, that is fine. I mean just to get an idea when…
Michael Hsing: Yes. Probably end of next year, or something like that, probably more than that. And we expect to move to the new technology very quickly.
Vernon Essi – Needham & Company: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg with Thomas Weisel Partners, please proceed.
Evan Wang – Thomas Weisel: Hi, thank you. This is Evan Wang calling in for Tore. I was wondering if you could comment on your new products and first I would like to congratulate you on doubling your rate of new product releases, I was wondering if you can provide some color on whether in general where analog products take some time to ramp and to contribute revenue materially, in this environment, do you see your that ramp shortening because customers are demanding more innovative products faster, would you see still a normal pace like you have more products in play?
Michael Hsing: To answer your – it is a long question, I answer your last part, last question first, it is the seems to me the designing cycle little bit shorter and we see couple of as I give you a couple of examples in Intelli-Phase and we sort of have a design wins in we would expecting some revenue sometime next year and other product like LED drivers for general lighting and we introduced both products not very long ago, now we see quite significant revenues coming. So to that question, yes, it is absolutely right, and customers looking for want more innovation, want more – looking for better product. And they are looking for their niche.
Evan Wang – Thomas Weisel: Great.
Michael Hsing: What's the other part of that? I forgot that one.
Evan Wang – Thomas Weisel: That's okay. I think you answered it very well. And I just have a, this is not really a question, but I think you gave some details on this litigation reversal and I was wondering if you could just go through the details again, and I was wondering if it has any bearing on, any ongoing cases now?
Rick Neely: No, and I'll answer that. It is history, if we dig up the Q2 2007 financial report, we recorded a provision for a settlement of Taiwan Sumida related to a case they had down in Texas with O2 Micro, but that case is under appeal, so we put our settlement amount was put into escrow for the last couple of years. It is in our balance sheet as restricted assets for a couple of years and then when we won the cases last year on the 722 patent, that reversed that decision. That was all appeal – the appeals were adopted and litigation processes is done, and therefore we reversed that settlement. We didn't need to – we don't need to pay that. So that's this quarter that was finally several years later completed and we reversed the position and the net effect is a $6.4 million credit.
Evan Wang – Thomas Weisel: Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Freedman with Broadpoint. Please proceed.
Doug Freedman – Broadpoint: Hi Michael and Rick, thanks for taking the time. If you could, I was interested in your commentary about your inventory coverage out of distribution, are you guys contemplating taking any actions to increase the amount of inventory being carried at yours distributors, and if so when and how do you handle that?
Rick Neely: I'll start and then Michael will finish. We have learned in the last 18 months it is better for us to carry it than our distributors, so we will probably keep them at the low-end of the range which is four weeks range, around 3 to 4 weeks, which is where we are right now. There is a lot of advantages to us from our perspective and the fact that we have all of our manufacturing in Asia, we can deliver products very quickly. So logistically, we can manage it pretty well. Michael?
Michael Hsing: Yes. In general, the mature product, we tend to have our distributors have more inventory. However, in the last couple of quarters, or even in the last years, we introduced a lot of new products, and these are designing and ramp production ramp very erratic. So it is better for MPS to keep all the inventory, so we can manage the inventory much better. However, in the when all those products are in the mature stage, and you'll probably see some inventory increase, and so the inventory has much less to do with our coming revenues in the next couple of quarters or so. So it is I know you guys want to figure out the inventory related to the next few quarters revenue, so in MPS case, it is not quite related.
Doug Freedman – Broadpoint: Okay, very good. Thanks for all the color there. During this earnings season, we have heard from a couple of companies talk about extended lead times in challenging environment to get product with some companies actually benefiting from their competitors inability to ship, can you talk whether you guys think you have seen any of that, and what the present situation is in sort of your end markets, and what you're feeling from your customer base?
Rick Neely: Yes. We actually haven't seen that in the types of products we are in, so I – also our marketing director Steve Pratt's with us, Steve, have you seen anything?
Steve Pratt: We only heard about it and haven't seen the effects of it. We have heard customers talking about it. So this is really in the early stage of delivery shortage.
Rick Neely: And it is no products of ours but it could be some secondary products.
Steve Pratt: So we expected there to be some opportunities, absolutely.
Doug Freedman – Broadpoint: And can you talk about what you're seeing right now as far as ASP trends in the marketplace and the aggressiveness or lack there of, of aggressive pricing from your competitors?
Michael Hsing: ASP, from the ASP side, it's we don't see much decline in Q2 and early late Q1 and early Q2. And so you can call it now stabilized.
Doug Freedman – Broadpoint: Great, that is great to hear. My last question is in regards to your relationships with large OEMs and whether you've received any more significant supplier qualifications this quarter or what your expectations are for the forward quarter?
Michael Hsing: Well actually we always want to minimize any spikes in the revenue concentration from any OEMs. So yes, we have a number of these design wins from major OEMs, but these if you want to have decent revenue spike up, that is our back pocket, but in general, if everything else doing good, and within that kind of thing happen.
Doug Freedman – Broadpoint: Great, thank you and congratulations on a strong quarter.
Michael Hsing: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Wang with Wedbush. Please proceed sir.
Patrick Wang – Wedbush: Thanks and great job on the quarter guys. First you know I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about the Intelli-Phase product and potentially what impact we saw maybe in the second half this year and a sense of how you think that is going to grow next year?
Michael Hsing: Yes, it is I talk we had a press release and I got excited about it both product and it is from our customers feedback these are really if I can call it revolution products, at least the big leap of faith in evolution path. Both products are design in and we see we are shipping initial samples and remember this is all in half year's time. And so we will expect to see some revenue next year.
Patrick Wang – Wedbush: Okay. Any sense of how you can maybe frame the magnitude of that impact?
Michael Hsing: Well, we address a huge market. This product line is only the first product on this new technology platform and we aim the market for CPU power, including mobile and as well as the service, and same as for graphics card. These all require very high current and very high power density, high-frequency switching frequency applications. So that product we have a product line coming out and it is all for this market. So the size of the market I guess you guys know better than we do so I am not giving – these are we estimate it over billion dollars. And so that is the first product for this new technology.
Patrick Wang – Wedbush: I seek, got you. Okay. And then you know just talk real quickly about Mesh Connect, I know you talk about it a little bit, can you go in little bit more detail in terms of the benefits, the performance, and then maybe Rick you can chime in and just on the impact to your cost structure?
Michael Hsing: Yes, okay. We spent a couple of years to study this very fundamental study, these are metallurgical junctions, and how to even the head expansion between the selections and the very thick metal. And so we resolved the problem and we using different from a different industry do this Mesh Connect. Okay these are mesh, metal mesh, and we grow on the die, and so that is the cost is much less than use multiple layer of metals. And second thing is the performance increase, however, we can produce because of the power densities in those metals can carry is much higher. Our device's die size is smaller. At the same time, the connection the distance much less, we can increase the frequencies by what we see now well over four times.
Rick Neely: On the cost side, Patrick, the main improvement not only to the densities and size that Michael talked about, we did this to eliminate gold wires. We have I think as Michael would correct me if I'm wrong, big lumps of copper there soldered whether, so really that way, that is help on the cost structure certainly going forward. It is really been the elimination of the gold wire with a better connect.
Patrick Wang – Wedbush: Okay. So it is sounds like this is a continuation of innovation beyond I guess your BCD, your proprietary BCD process, right?
Michael Hsing: It is a more beyond silicon process, this is really – it's a combination of silicon design and as well as the packaging side.
Patrick Wang – Wedbush: Got you. And then just one last quick one, just Rick in terms of OpEx, you are guiding OpEx a little bit higher in the fourth quarter, even though I mean typically you know maybe OpEx might be low, can you talk about where that increase is coming from?
Rick Neely: Actually the guidance is flat. R&D is I think the one place where it is going up, typically it flattens out in Q3. So if I look at our forecast, we are basically showing G&A is, our fabrication is flat. Sales and marketing and G&A is about flat so I'm not sure where you're getting the up. I think it is maybe a few hundred Ks…
Patrick Wang – Wedbush: Just a couple of hundreds, like about $300,000…
Rick Neely: Yes, ok.
Michael Hsing: They are probably in the noise range, and we expect to put a lot many products in Q4 too.
Rick Neely: There is one area where there will be some slight expense increases in sales and marketing area because we are out performing our plan in terms of revenue. In fact, one thing I would point out, based on midpoint of our guidance, we will actually have positive annual growth. We will be above $160 million this year. I don't know of too many companies actually growing the top line this year, so again that is above our expectations, the sales team is performing well, so there'll be higher commissions associated with that in Q4.
Patrick Wang – Wedbush: Okay, great job, and thanks so much.
Michael Hsing: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Arnab Chanda with Roth Capital. Please proceed.
Arnab Chanda – Roth Capital: Thanks. A couple of questions. First of all, either Rick or Michael, and do you think the negative effect of the CCFL will be offset by the positive effect of the LED transitions, the growth areas?
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we will pause momentarily as we have lost our speaker for the moment. I'm going to turn the music back on until we get Mr. Neely and the CEO back online. Thank you and we will pause momentarily. Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie with Raymond James. Please proceed.
Rick Neely: Well, actually you need to go back to Arnab Chanda.
Operator: Okay.
Rick Neely: Arnab didn't get his question, I'm sorry their phone went out, so Arnab needs to repeat his question.
Operator: Okay, one moment. Go ahead, Arnab, your line is open.
Arnab Chanda – Roth Capital: Thank you. I promise I didn't do anything.
Michael Hsing: Arnab, it's a tough question to have, our line just went down, I have at the appropriate then and then I consulted my lawyers.
Arnab Chanda – Roth Capital: Yes. I probably am not smart enough to ask a question that you need a lawyer for. Anyway. I have two questions, one is know it seems like in your lighting control business, you are seeing a transition between the growth area which is more LED driven and the kind of declining areas in CCFL, what timeframe will one kind of cross the other where you can get the benefit of the growth? And I have another follow-up.
Michael Hsing: Yes, it's good question. In the CCFL for the notebook backlight, in particularly for these types of applications, I don't see it die down to zero. And it will level off somewhere and always gives notebook application; we always have other applications that needs CCFL backlight because it is a few much cheaper than LED and for portable devices, the LEDs for portable. But it was a large one for wall display; I believe the CCFL still will have some market. So I don't expect it to die down completely. To answer your question when is the cross point, it is I really don't know when is the cross point, and we increase design activity in that LED backlight LED in general lighting started about a year ago or so. We introduced a lot of products that we see a lot of acceptance and also the market the same time is to ramp up very, very quickly. So my wild guess is sometimes in the next year and we see the growth sometimes in the second half of next year we see the growth in this product line.
Rick Neely: Yes, Arnab, I can add a little mechanical numbers to that. If you're looking at it year-over-year obviously the big comp, the last big comp we had was Q3 of 2008. But if you're starting at Q4 2008, I mean that was 6.5 in our usual Q1 drop but we did 7.3 in Q2, 8.5. We are actually growing again in the new products of lighting control, that is the white LED drivers and the controllers for monitors. CCFL, the traditional CCFL number has been about flat. If you go back three four quarters, it has been in the 3 to 4,000,000 range every quarter, that is it. I think Michael is right, it is not going to change much, it is not going to disappear, it is not going to change much, so the growth we're seeing, the differential in the last three or four quarters is all the newer stuff.
Michael Hsing: Compared to year ago CCFL for the notebook was down significantly, what was the numbers, I forgot, a few million dollars.
Rick Neely: Compared to one year ago, $6 million.
Michael Hsing: Yes, $6 million of reduction and so we made a wrap up in other products.
Arnab Chanda – Roth Capital: Well, I appreciate that. That was great. A lot of detail. One question on the margin structure, is it is very kind of macro thing, but Rick your revenues are up year-over-year. However, your R&D as a percentage of sales actually are higher this year than last year, is this part of that, you're kind of going what contrarian or you are investing more so that that helps in the future, I'm just curious what you thought process is? Thank you.
Michael Hsing: Absolutely. Our engineers are a lot more mature and we can put up lot more products and that is something I don't want to cut expense.
Rick Neely: I think we have already said in the past too that recessions are good for us, gives us opportunities to go and get design wins, so we have been pouring the coal on during the down times and other people cutback we have been adding and putting out more products than ever, so we think that it's the right strategy that will pay off. We don't as an R&D technical driven company, that is one area we don't mind spending a lot of money in.
Arnab Chanda – Roth Capital: So Rick just sorry just one quick follow-up to that should we assume that in the future depending on what kind of revenue growth you get, is R&D going to remain sort of growth with sales, or there is not going to be a lot of R&D leverage, it is more going to come from other areas or how do you want to speak about it?
Michael Hsing: Yes. As I said in the last conference, I don't expect the R&D costs will go tracking our revenue growth. In the history of MPS never did it. It was always somewhat lagging on expense side including R&D. And I don't see the next couple of quarters will jump up significantly because we have the record number of product release in Q3 and Q4 I expect to have a similar numbers may be slightly lower. And so in the next couple of quarters I don't see a significant jump, so our R&D expense will stay very similar. In the longer term, I don't see it will increase even more if it is not going down.
Arnab Chanda – Roth Capital: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie with Raymond James. Please proceed sir.
Steven Smigie – Raymond James: Great, thank you. I was wondering you guys could talk a little bit about how much revenue MiniMonster was in the quarter?
Rick Neely: Yes actually, as we said, last year we were kind of in the 5,000,000 to 10,000,000 range. This year we are closing in on a run rate that would put us in the $15 million to $20 million range so on an annualized run rate. So we are seeing significant growth in the MiniMonster lines.
Steve Richardson: Okay. And could you talk about breakout sort of other major product families, albeit LDO, Intelli-Phase, battery charges etc., just to get a sense of what are the other big chunks in there, in DC to DC?
Rick Neely: Well in DC to DC, the main mature products generate most of the revenues. We do highlight in our conference call the new growers but in terms of how much they contribute on a percentage wise it is not a lot but the fact is that they're growing at a very high rate is what we have highlighted. In terms of any individual products, I said the biggest single contributor of the product family is MiniMonsters.
Steven Smigie – Raymond James: Right. I was just asking I guess more about some of the older families.
Steve Pratt: 
Some of the older products…:
Rick Neely: Yes, Steve will…
Steve Pratt: LDOs we had (inaudible) over the last year, we've tripled our number of LDOs, and so those are gaining traction, so we are going to see very good – we are seeing already very good growth in that product family, just to name one, and that was a relatively very small product area for us, specially relative to MiniMonster.
Steven Smigie – Raymond James: Okay, last question…
Michael Hsing: Main of these products increase give us a million or two million kind of dollar revenues and so we ended up in MiniMonster really significant but every one of them is a big number. And all these things, we are making all kind of other things. Just like it is a rangefinder and those kinds of things that we see pretty good market and thermostats that is another one. And many products I mean in we don't even have to name what the product line how to fit in the product line, so we have lot of these kinds of things. And by the way our reporting system is not very informative and we will probably do some change.
Steven Smigie – Raymond James: Okay, great. Thanks.
Rick Neely: Steve, another product area just as another example, current limit switches, we have done a very good job of expanding our product into what we call portfolio which is described as a part that can go into many applications, many customers, and the current limit switch line has grown significantly going after. It is predominantly portfolio based, many customers, and that is starting to gain traction.
Michael Hsing: I think we call it smart – what is it, smart use…
Rick Neely: ECUs [ph], that is a segment of this. Yes. (inaudible) USB switch which is a more traditional kind of limit switch.
Steven Smigie – Raymond James: Okay. And then just on within the LED piece of the lighting business, can you talk about sort of where you are now in terms of how much is say notebooks versus other products you are in, just give us some sense of what the breakout is now, which ones are going to be your biggest growers?
Michael Hsing: We have a notebook and a netbook, these are – I don't have exactly the breakdown here, but the general lighting is pretty significant product. Maybe Rick can tell us you something.
Rick Neely: Yes, we have – like usual with MPS, the way we try and do it is to spread out is that if you take all of our white LED, probably the smallest portion, the portion we used to sell into was mobile handsets, and that is a pretty small number now. But the bigger numbers for us now recently has been monitors, flat-panel TVs, and the consumer devices like GPS.
Steven Smigie – Raymond James: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed sir.
Bob Gujavarty – Deutsche Bank: Hi. This is Bob Gujavarty for Ross Seymore. Hi guys. I notice obviously audio amps was found. I also noticed QonQ your Korea related revenue was down and there is obviously chatter about some key Korean customers cutting back on orders. Was that impact – did you see any of that in the quarter?
Michael Hsing: Probably obvious sort of revenue is lower and some of it is made due to the impact on the orders slower in the first. Our competitive make regarding to those market, it is difficult for us to say.
Bob Gujavarty – Deutsche Bank: Okay, fair enough. On a more positive note, it seemed like year on year, you've done a great job in boosting your revenue from US and Europe and is that really a function of your expanded sales channel or the new products, can you talk about your strategy there. I think you concertedly effort – you have a concerted effort to increase your revenue from the US and Europe.
Michael Hsing: Yes. This US Europe and Japan we calculated about 50% of the entire analog market and we thought in those market is only about four years ago and some of it is only three years ago and so we did really, really well. And ASP is very different in China Taiwan market is much lower, the US Europe particularly much, much higher. So by no means we will give up and we just started and we do really well and we continue to do well. Usually we don't design any product only for those markets and all the product we do is fixed for everything.
Bob Gujavarty – Deutsche Bank: Okay. Just a quick follow-up. You mentioned ASPs in those market were a little better, so do you think over time as you penetrate those markets, there is an opportunity to kind of boost your ASP as you get more revenues from US Europe and Japan?
Michael Hsing: Yes, if we don't grow Taiwan, China side, yes, ASP will go up. By no means we would slow down the growth in the China and Taiwan market. And so how we balance that I really can't tell. If the Asian markets grow faster probably ASP will decline a little bit.
Bob Gujavarty – Deutsche Bank: Okay, fair enough. Thanks guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Gus Richard with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.
Gus Richard – Piper Jaffray: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. I had a number of questions on your LED driver for the general lighting, I'm assuming that it's an AC to DC product, is that correct?
Michael Hsing: Not quite. AC to DC is sort of we haven't generated significant revenue in the product line but those are not for general lighting yet. But those are we have is on the DC side and after convert to AC to DC all product is driving the lamps on the DC side.
Gus Richard – Piper Jaffray: Okay. So it is not a complete solution for lighting, not for general-purpose lighting?
Rick Neely: No.
Michael Hsing: No, not yet.
Gus Richard – Piper Jaffray: Okay, and then…
Michael Hsing: But will be soon release those products. We have released those products already.
Gus Richard – Piper Jaffray: Okay. And then sort of what power range can your product handle?
Michael Hsing: We can handle 50, 70 W power.
Gus Richard – Piper Jaffray: Okay. So like a normal 250 W bulb would put out, sort of…
Michael Hsing: It is a group of LEDs in a different, our product will take 60 watts power.
Gus Richard – Piper Jaffray: Okay. And then just switching gears here, it looks like you know you guys are pretty comfortable with the inventory that you have in the channel, a little bit of a push right at the end of the quarter, is it fair to say you’re your customers you feel pretty comfortable that you are at a point where the push to get product out the door is somewhat slowed, people kind of comfortable with their inventory position and not expediting and nervous of the availability?
Michael Hsing: We keep the inventory we our customers as I said earlier the business kind of in normal seasonal pattern now and our disti doesn't push us, only our customers, because we do – we use our disti as a logistic fulfillment, and we have a direct link with our customers and we can ship within 24 hours and so we don't see that now.
Gus Richard – Piper Jaffray: Okay. And then the last one from me, I would assume the Intelli-Phase product, the order of market penetration likely graphics, notebooks and server last?
Michael Hsing: Yes.
Gus Richard – Piper Jaffray: Okay. And could you just talk a little bit about you know which level of graphics card is low end, mid range or high-end graphics the Intelli-Phase is going after?
Rick Neely: Steve, you can talk about it?
Steve Pratt: Yes, it is the high end. It is definitely the high-end where these are add-on on graphic cards, not once that are in typically low-end models, the high-end that need extreme power density, multi phase and a lot of cooling expertise.
Michael Hsing: But you are only talking about Intelli-Phase right?
Gus Richard – Piper Jaffray: Correct.
Michael Hsing: All right. We have other products where really MiniMonsters I said a couple of years ago designed for notebook for the graphics market and we see a lot of revenue from that.
Gus Richard – Piper Jaffray: Okay, got it. And sort of graphics might come in for you first half of next year or second half?
Michael Hsing: What we will see is dependent on I can is dependent on our customers, or depend on the graphics chip makers and if they delay it, we will delay it, and definitely sometime next year. I don't expect that much of a delay.
Gus Richard – Piper Jaffray: Okay, right. Thanks so much.
Michael Hsing: Okay.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tristan Gerra with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.
Joanne Anzley – Robert W. Baird: Hi. This is Joanne Anzley [ph] calling in for Tristan. My first question in regards to distribution, do you expect to ship ahead or below sell-through in the fourth quarter?
Rick Neely: Yes, Joanne, you see most of the distributors in Asia; those are all done on a sell-in basis. In terms of the disties, I think Q3, we don't have other reselling partners, pretty well net, they go through inventory a little bit, but we had higher sales, so it turned out to be about even. Q4 is typically the reason for us it is seasonally down is what I would call a two-month quarter, by December things are pretty quiet. They don't take a lot of products in because they don't want them by year end. So typically Q4 is an even quarter, sell-through versus what they bring in to even pushing out a little more than they take in because most distributors on a calendar year end, they don't want to show a lot of parts on the balance sheet at year end.
Joanne Anzley – Robert W. Baird: Okay, thank you. And then just a preliminary sense of first quarter, initial thoughts, do you think it can track above seasonal?
Rick Neely: We have very little visibility into Q1. I could only refer you to the normal seasonal pattern; Q1 is always our lowest quarter. That is our typical seasonality but we don't have any actual other than looking at history we have no view as one yet, it is too early for us.
Joanne Anzley – Robert W. Baird: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Mr. Neely, there are no more questions in the queue at this time.
Rick Neely: Okay. Well, thank you everybody and we look forward to talking with you on our next call.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation, you may now disconnect. Have a great day.

Operator: Welcome to the Second Quarter 2009 Monolithic Power Systems Incorporated Earnings Call. My name is Louisa, and I will be your operator for today. At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Rick Neely, Chief Financial Officer. Please proceed sir.
Rick Neely: Good afternoon and welcome to the second quarter fiscal 2009 Monolithic Power Systems conference call. Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS is with me on today's call. In the course of today's conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty. For example, our business outlook, including our business and financial outlook for the third quarter of 2009; projected third quarter revenues and gross margins; our expectations for third quarter litigation, stock-based compensation, and non-GAAP operating expenses, our target operating model range for gross margins and operating expenses, our expected average tax rate for 2009; our belief that MPS is well positioned for future growth; new product introductions, potential customer acceptance and the various opportunities these present and inventory levels and projected changes in inventory levels. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts or guarantees of future performance or events and are based on current expectations, estimates, beliefs, assumptions, goals and objectives and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by these statements. Risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in our SEC filings, including, but not limited, to our Form 10-K filed on February 27, 2009 and our Form 10-Q filed on April 28, 2009, which are accessible through our website, www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today’s call. We will be discussing operating expense and net income on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude charges related to stock-based compensation and in the case of net income their related tax effects. We will also discuss our expected non-GAAP research and development and selling, general, and administrative expense for the third quarter of 2009, which excludes our expected charges related to stock-based compensation. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to this release, as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our website. I would also like to remind you that today's conference call is being webcast live over the Internet and will be available for replay on our website for one-year along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. We would like to start this call by reviewing our second fiscal quarter 2009 business highlights. Following this update, I will discuss our operating results. We will conclude by discussing our expectations for the third fiscal quarter of 2009. We will then open up the call to your questions. Let's start with the business highlights. MPS rebounded dramatically from the first quarter of the year by notching a sequential revenue increase of 40%, recording net sales of $41.2 million with the second quarter of 2009. This total was about flat to the $41.5 million MPS sold in the second quarter of 2008, and excellent achievement given the worldwide economic slowdown. MPS saw sequential growth across all segments and product families in Q2. As we noted last quarter, several of our newest product families continue to see both sequential growth and year-over-year revenue growth in the second quarter. We are very excited to announce that we have shipped our first pilot production unit of our new 25 amp Intelli-Phase driver family this month, which is a tremendous accomplishment for our products is first fully functional silicon within the first quarter of this year. This new product family opens up high-end product markets for MPS, such as core power to notebooks, high performance graphics cards, communications equipment and servers. In the manufacturing area, gross margin moved up to 59.1%, which met our expectations for this metric. Our days of inventory dropped back to our target range coming in at 109 days and inventory at distributors remain very lean even with the big jump in Q2 revenue. Bottom line, non-GAAP net income was $6.1 million, or $0.17 per fully diluted share. Let’s look at the financials in more detail. Staring with the P&L, on the revenue line, second quarter 2009 net revenues of $41.2 million increased 40% sequentially from the first quarter of 2009. We were about flat to the $41.5 million recorded in the second quarter of 2008. This sequential increase in revenue reflected a rebound in demand across all product areas from the depressed levels of the first quarter of the year. Let's break down our second quarter revenue by product type. DC to DC product sales were $29.7 million, up 40% from the first quarter of 2009 and up 11% from the $26.8 million reported in the year ago quarter. The main reason for this increase was the good performance of the consumer and communications end markets for MPS, which includes products such as flat panel TVs, general consumer electronics products, set-top boxes, modems and wireless LAN cards. Lighting control revenues for the second quarter were $7.3 million, a significant increase of 57% from the first quarter of 2009, but a decrease of 35% from the same quarter a year-ago. This mixed performance reflects that historically, the first quarter is our weakest seasonal demand quarter for backlighting revenue. The 57% sequential performance reflects a bounce up from the typically low demand levels in the first quarter due to the seasonality as well as the global recession. On a macro level, the year-over-year revenue decline reflects the continuing shift of notebook backlighting from CCFL solutions to white LED solutions. Audio revenues came in at $4.1 million, up 18% from the $3.5 million recorded in the prior quarter and up 20% from the second quarter of 2008. Let's move down to the gross margin line. Our second quarter gross margin was 59.1% compared to 57.6% in the prior quarter of 2009 and 53% in the second quarter of 2008. This result is at the lower end of our target range and met our expectation given the current economic condition. In positive economic cycles we have operated at the mid-upper end of our target range of 58% to 63% gross margin, but during difficult times we expect to operate at the lower end of this range due to reduced demand and pricing pressure. Looking at the reported expenses and operating margins, our GAAP operating expenses were $21.3 million in the second quarter. This includes $19.1 million in R&D and SG&A expense, which includes $3.8 million for stock compensation expense and litigation expense of $2.2 million. Compared with the first quarter of 2009, GAAP operating expenses were up by $3.3 million. The expense mix changed as follows: R&D increased by $1.6 million; SG&A increased by $1.5 million and litigation increased by $0.2 million. Our GAAP operating profit was 7% in the second quarter compared with a GAAP operating loss of 4% in the first quarter of 2009. Let's review our expenses on a non-GAAP basis. Excluding stock compensation, our non-GAAP operating expenses for the second quarter of 2009 was $17.5 million compared to $14.6 million in the first quarter of 2009 and $18.6 million in the second quarter of 2008. The $2.9 million expense increase from the first quarter this year, is primarily due to higher variable spending such as commission, travel and bonuses that were curtailed in Q1 '09. Compared to the second quarter of 2008, non-GAAP R&D costs were up $839,000 as we continue to strengthen our R&D [piece] by adding headcount.  Non-GAAP SG&A expense was only up $130,000 from Q2 of the prior year. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 17% in the second quarter of 2009 compared with 8% in the first quarter of 2009 and 18% from the second quarter of 2008. On the bottom line, our Q2 '09 GAAP net income was $3.2 million or $0.09 per fully diluted share. On a non-GAAP basis, our Q2 '09 net income was $6.1 million or $0.17 per fully diluted share. This result is computed with a non-GAAP tax rate of 12.5% within our expected average tax rate range for 2009 of 10% to 15%. We continue to be proud of the fact that MPS has been profitable on a non-GAAP basis excluding stock compensation and litigation settlement since our IPO in Q4 of 2004. Let's move down to the balance sheet and look at some of the major changes this quarter. Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and investments were $163.8 million at the end of the second quarter of 2009, up from $150.8 million in the first quarter of 2009, and up significantly from the $126.8 million on the books in the year ago quarter. In Q2, MPS had operating cash flow of about $13.7 million as the late Q1 surge in receivables was collected. We spent about $3.8 million on capital in the second quarter, which is largely offset by cash proceeds of $3.1 million from option exercises and purchases under employee stock plans. Accounts receivable ended the second quarter at $12.4 million compared with $13.4 million at the end of Q1 '09, and $13 million at the end of the second quarter of 2008. The decrease in receivables was due to the fact that the majority of Q1 '09 shipments were made later in the quarter and therefore collected by the end of the second quarter. Day sales outstanding declined in Q2 ‘09 to 28 days, as a result of the shipment timing issue I just described. Our inventories at the end of the second quarter were $20.1 million, or about 109 days of inventory basis. This compares with $18.6 million, or 136 days of inventory at the end of the first quarter of 2009. Inventory in our distribution channels grew slightly in dollars, but the large increase in quarterly revenue meant that we came in well below our target range of 30 to 45 days of inventory for distributors for the quarter. I would now like to turn to discussion of general business conditions. The second quarter of 2009 made up very slow start to the year, as the revenue increased sequentially across all product groups. Geographically, in the second quarter of 2009, MPS shipped 56% of revenue to Taiwan and China, and 44% to other regions, with Korea performing particularly well. MPS continues to diversify its customer base, as our shipment to regions outside of Taiwan and China increased from 38% in the second quarter of 2008 to 44% just mentioned. In the new product area, the highlight of the quarter was the initial production shipments of our Intelli-Phase driver family optimized for multiphase system core voltage power supplies in product such as notebook, computer, graphics cards and blade servers. This family is the worlds first monolithic integrated driver plus high side and low side MOSFET resulting in a 50% to 60% improvement in total solution side in system cost. This rapid ramp to initial pilot production confirms our belief the customers are very excited about the potential benefit of this innovative product family. We also released other high performance product such our new 50V buck converter for industrial and automotive application and ultra small 3 MHz synchronous buck converter for handheld and portable application and a 50V (inaudible) white LED driver for notebook and netbook backlighting application. Some of our other new product families such as MiniMonster, USB Current-Limit Switches, and LDOs continued the sequential and year-over-year revenue growth in the second quarter of 2009. Some examples, where all of these products are going include the flat panel TVs and communication products for MiniMonster, portable computing for USB Current-Limit Switches and multimedia applications for LDOs. I would now like to turn to our outlook for the third quarter of 2009. MPS saw very strong bookings and healthy backlogs in the second quarter far above normal as the channel had to restocks from the low order rates in late 2008 and early 2009. For the third quarter, visibility has slightly improved, but still less than normal due to the economic downturn. Channel inventories are lean, so we believe that third quarter revenue should reflect actual demand. Our expectations for Q2 revenues are in the range of $42 million to $46 million. Gross margin is expected to be at a lower end of our target range of 58% to 63%. We expect stock-based compensation expense in the range of $3.5 million to $3.9 million. We expect non-GAAP research and development, and selling, general and administrative expense in the range of $15.3 million to $16.3 million. This estimate excludes the stock compensation estimate mentioned above. Finally we expect litigation expense in the range of $1.8 million to $2.2 million due to the commencement of the ITC hearing in October. In conclusion, we are pleased to report that executed very well in the difficult economic environment. We grew revenues sharply, but still control by inventory channels closely. We are growing revenue in new product family and continuing our geographic diversification. We are focused on introduction and design of very high performance new products and product families. We believe these actions will position MPS very well, for future growth. Now, we would like to open the microphone and take in your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Rick Schafer with Oppenheimer. Please proceed.
Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer: Hey guys, nice quarter. I had a couple of questions for you. The first one, it looks like on the revenue line looks like we are on track to the first half to be flatter maybe even show some growth year-over-year in 2009. What are your expectations if you’re looking at the second half for demand? You said were basically shipping to demand. I think at this point it sounds like you don’t features anymore restocking left to happen in the channel. I guess basically what are you looking out for the second half?
Michael Hsing: Rick, so far in the way and outlook is a pretty good. It’s difficult for me to say the general business like conditions because we asked to do this. More company shippings below $0.50 parts on them, but I'm excited about all the new product and other designing activities happened in the last years and early this year. We believe we are kicking in the second half of this year.
Rick Neely: Just to add a little bit more related to Michael's comment, as we said in the call, the visibility is little bit better. Instead of two week orderly times, we are getting maybe four weeks. So, we are getting some visibility that’s better, but as Michael said, as a smaller company, we can't really project into Q4; we can really just look at the current quarter.
Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer: Rick, you mentioned that you are below that low end of your target range for just [three] days of inventory below 30. If the channel inventories are still basically too low, there could be some restocking?
Rick Neely: That’s a good question. The main point we see there is that the distributors don’t have any extra inventory. So, any orders they get will be coming right through and therefore reflect demand. In terms of restocking, I think that would have to probably maybe more psychological of whether people thought things are going to get better and they wanted to have more parts or not. So, I am not sure that’s going to happen or not.
Michael Hsing: Yes, overall we believe we can control the inventories much better than our distributors. Secondly, during all these new product ramp, especially we need to control the inventories, because the demand will be sporadic and erratic for the new product ramp. We don’t know when will it start to ramp and what the quantity it will ramp. So, we will continue to operate it very lean in the distribution side.
Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer: Michael, on the first quarter conference call you mentioned you are really nervous about the second half. Are you feeling better about the second half and the demand for today versus? 
Michael Hsing: Yes, generally. The business we look forward there and our customers are a lot more upbeat but we are still cautious on the existing products.
Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer: Then just one follow-up question on gross margin. You mentioned that you expect it to be at the lower end of your range for the third quarter. Should we expect it to actually move up, in percentage terms it should be up sequentially versus what we saw? I guess how much of an offset is pricing right now?
Michael Hsing: It's difficult for us to say. Our competitors have slashed the big price and so we will follow it. At the same time we introduced a lot of new products which have a much higher gross margins depending on when and what the quality, the ramp in the second half of the year. It's a very difficult for us to predict that. However, I don’t see that we will dramatically drop or dramatically increase in the next couple of quarters.
Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer: Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg with Thomas Weisel Partners. Please proceed.
Tore Svanberg - Thomas Weisel Partners: I had a question on your guidance, $42 million to $46 million. I know you usually don’t backlog or bookings, but could you maybe at least just qualitatively talk about how you're tracking through the low end of that range, especially now that we're already a month into the quarter?
Rick Neely: Tore, as you mentioned, we don’t give our backlog because given the short lead times we have, it's not really indicative of things. I would just go back to how MPS gives our guidance. We have a good short-term process that if you look at our track record is pretty good. So, we feel comfortable with this range. That's about all I could add unless Michael adds something more.
Michael Hsing: Yes, as I've said in the previous questions and my answer to Rick's question. So the second half, we feel optimistic in the existing product and more excited by the new products of course. So, everything so far is positive.
Tore Svanberg - Thomas Weisel Partners: Maybe I can ask the question differently. You mentioned June was a very strong month at least based on you DSOs. Is July perhaps even a little bit stronger than June?
Michael Hsing: I don't have that data. I believe it's about the same.
Tore Svanberg - Thomas Weisel Partners: Great and congratulations on getting the Intelli-Phase product run out so quickly. Could you maybe talk a little bit about when you expect to start to see some revenue contributions on that product line please?
Michael Hsing: It's a new product and it's in the high end of notebook and it's the new product line. And they plan to ramp in the end of the year or beginning early next year. But, we don't know what the quantity that will be, but the Intelli-Phase just only the initial introductions. We are targeting the big market, entire notebook, high-end, low-end and medium-end, we want everything. And with this kind of cost and the performance we expect to have a bigger market share.
Tore Svanberg - Thomas Weisel Partners: Last question, last quarter you talked about maybe getting some traction in the automotive market, could you may be update us on the company's position in automotive please?
Michael Hsing: Automotive market is very small. And we introduced some very special product in for surge protection or the product DC to DC with very high energy surge protections and those start to generate some revenues very, very small as you know in automotive particularly and they ramped product very, very slowly. That’s the area, we focus on it for next couple of years and I believe we will general, it’s our long-term investment.
Rick Neely: Yes, as we said, we have introduced some 50V buck converters, which fit right in to the automotive market. So, again it takes time to get the design. We got those types of product. 
Unidentified speaker: It’s a very long design cycle and selective on what we decide to get in to automotive and that’s also across over to industrial. So, that will actually, probably ramp up quicker then the automotive segment. 
Rick Neely: That was obviously prior to our marketing directives.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Wang with Wedbush. Please proceed.
Patrick Wang - Wedbush Morgan: Thanks so much and also great quarter guys. Couple of questions, I guess first just on the margins. It looks like you guys are now officially expanding your margin target to 58 to 63. Can you talk a little bit about kind of the thought process there?
Michael Hsing: Well, as I hope we can ramp our new product fast enough to go up to increase margin (Inaudible), but that’s not the purpose, okay. We want the market shares and we want to increase our top line. Margin is really a secondary to MPS. Is really a measurements, how well our products performing in the market.
Rick Neely:
 :
Patrick Wang - Wedbush Morgan: It wasn't too surprising, but I want to see if there is anything else there. The second questionnaire just in terms of lighting during the second quarter, can you talk a little bit about the breakdown that we got the most benefit in lighting. I know you guys [a ton of] content in notebooks and you ramping monitors, but could you help us out within these moving pieces?
Michael Hsing: Yes. I tell you that, the CCFL for notebooks and that we see the demand is dropping. CCFL controllers, I mean the control for monitors and those products are doing well and as well as the LED lighting. They're doing well.
Patrick Wang - Wedbush Morgan: Okay. Because you maybe perhaps help us breakout a little bit between LED and CCFL for today?
Michael Hsing: I don't have the numbers. Rick do you have the numbers?
Rick Neely: Yes, I can have. We are basically right now, white LEDs is up at the higher numbers, its 1.5 million to 2 million a quarter now, white LEDs. Controllers are similar numbers in the rest of CCFL.
Patrick Wang - Wedbush Morgan: Then also I guess, just on the Intelli-Phase products we launched. I know that in terms of a timing and unit, but in terms of the content for notebook and the positive impact there. Can you talk about the growth you see there?
Michael Hsing: It's difficult for us to gauge. I think that we're targeting the overall like a $6, $7 in the content and now I think we are very close to it now.
Rick Neely: Well, where we are talking about having the product introduced that can I guess to that number.
Michael Hsing: Yes.
Rick Neely: Now in terms of designs and have that kind of content, we don’t have any design like that yet. So, we have to work our way into it. The Intelli-Phase damn its helps a lot that’s several dollars.
Unidentified Company Speaker: That’s a big ASP.
Rick Neely: Big ASP about $2 to $3.
Unidentified Company Speaker: We already in, so that’s like Rick said that’s $2 to $3 adder depending upon the number of phases. So, that will be good share, a good incremental revenue increase over time.
Patrick Wang - Wedbush Morgan: The last question, here I guess this is for you Rick, how should we think about OpEx, if we exclude litigation I guess as a percentage of sales going forward. I know that I think some of your expenses start to come back in from the depressed levels earlier, but if you could help us think about that just qualitatively beyond Q3 would be great. Thank you.
Rick Neely: Yes, I think qualitatively, what MPS sees is, we are going full board on keeping our R&D strong and also not only we have so many products and probably have more products we can handle in the fields. So, we are increasing our field application resources. So, at the same time, actually when you look at the details G&A expenses are flat to down year-over-year. So, we are not growing G&A, which is appropriate for this company, but we are putting, we believe we have more opportunities and we are not cutting hiring. In fact hiring, an increase in expenses will keep doing that, as we see a lot opportunities in new markets and products and therefore, as Michael have said we now have something we’ve been working out for several years, but we have not only our core of 25 or so engineers in the US that we designs. We have a similar number overseas that are now contributing. So, we have a big new product machine and that’s going to keep going for MPS. So, in terms of how many dollars decrease the quarter that’s hard to say. You can see our guidance in Q3, Patrick, is fairly flattish from Q2 not as much. So that's more or less than what to expect once you take away Q1. As I said before it was not a normal quarter, we cut every expense we could. We were hitting north of $40 million, we are back to normal expenses.
Patrick Wang - Wedbush Morgan: And is that mid to high 30s as a percentage of sales, is that kind of the fair way of thinking about that?
Rick Neely: Mid to high 30s what?
Patrick Wang - Wedbush Morgan: As a percentage of sales?
Rick Neely: For total?
Patrick Wang - Wedbush Morgan: For all expense, excluding litigations.
Rick Neely: Yes, that's about we are running now. As some of these new products kick in, you will start to leverage that R&D more, but right now we are in the build-up phase.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Tristan Gerra with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.
Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird: Hi, good afternoon. Your revenues from China were up 60% sequentially. What is your expectation for China in Q3? It looks like your guidance implies a significant slowdown and I am just wondering if the mix potentially also had a little bit of an impact on gross margin?
Rick Neely: Yes, Tristan. One of thing is that we report our revenues on the shipped-to basis. So China tends to build good chunk of electronic products even if the orders are taken in Japan or Taiwan, they all have their own factories in China. So it looks like China is building lots of things. They are not consuming most of that. So it's really a building number. So it's really hard to say that it has anything to do with demand. So, we really look at the total number and the numbers in the other countries show you what's produced in those countries as well, but the China one is more of a catchall for the entire electronics products. It doesn’t really have any implication as to what's going on.
Michael Hsing: The number is not a demand creation. But the real demand creation is in China for MPS is relatively not as big and as we strengthen our teams, we will see the revenue will steadily grown.
Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird: Then in terms of wafer supply, what are the pricing trend outlook for the second half and would you have any expectation for potential pricings, strengthening as utilization rates have picked up and continue to pickup in Q3?
Michael Hsing: I think the pricing pressure is in the recent quarters. I said in the coming quarters, it will be a relief, much less than in Q1 and Q2 and especially Q2. And, so that’s my comment.
Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird: Okay, but no big bounce back, nothing that could be material that you can see for the time being?
Michael Hsing: Certainly in our business, I never see a price increase. Certainly not the MPS business model. We only want to increase the gross margin by introducing a new product.
Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird: Okay, and then finally are you feeling somewhat constrained at the backend or do you have enough of the people you need there and do you see the potential for allocation in the overall industry later this year?
Michael Hsing: MPS, if you look at the history, MPS have never constrained buyer supply of our man powers and we continue to do that same way. We are very nimble, very quick reactions and we will meet the growth and as I said in the previous conference, we want to manage our growth to 20% to 30% in a normal economic condition.
Rick Neely : Now just to add to that, Tristan, one of things, if you note in the conference call, we had a fairly increase in capital spending for the quarter, up to $3.8 million. Most of that was additional production equipment for the backend, which actually is going to support, free up our production to produce more, at the same time support the R&D. So, that was part of the CapEx increase was to do exactly that. As Michael said, we make sure we have enough capacity to both support the R&D product engineering works and upsite productions.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vernon Essi with Needham & Company. Please proceed.
Vernon Essi - Needham & Company: Just to follow on the geographic question. I think, Rick in your prepared comments you said Korea was one of the bigger areas of growth. Are we to assume that a majority of that delta from the China revenues sequentially was going to Korea or was it pretty much across all regions?
Rick Neely: Korea had a good quarter. In this economic environment, the Korean TV and consumer goods makers have been doing well and that’s reflected in our numbers as well.
Vernon Essi - Needham & Company: Then just in that same event on Taiwan also is up nice sequentially. Are we to assume that was probably lighting driven?
Rick Neely: Yes, it was a snapback. The Q1 was just a dismal quarter for backlighting and Q2 picked up, that was the main [reason].
Vernon Essi - Needham & Company: Okay. And, then going out on your favorite topic on litigation, I'm wondering what we should be looking for in the fourth quarter? You have big event coming up in Q3. Is this going to tone down a lot or should we be looking for a relatively consistent number from Q3 to Q4?
Rick Neely: Yes, the trial starts in October and it's not over. There is a first hearing and then the second hearing what I’ll continue on to May of 2010. So, probably look at the similar levels would be my best estimate. It's very difficult to estimate the legal fees. So, that’s my best estimate.
Michael Hsing: Our similar question I will definitely controlled by the judge.
Vernon Essi - Needham & Company: Then finally, on Intelli-Phase just in terms of that [dark], can you just go through again what ASP implications you're looking at on that product to get to the dollar content numbers you were articulating earlier?
Michael Hsing: The notebook now, have a two or three phase, and majority is three phase, and I'll let Steve comment about the pricing.
Rick Neely: By the way Steve perhaps our Marketing Director, so I just to make sure that everyone understood the third person talking now.
Steve Lim: So, each phase is just under a dollar, and so in notebook. So, with three phases you're close to $3 a strike there and that also modulates to some extent by volume. Then there's also probably hasn’t been brought up yet, is there is the server segment, which will be more phases and more dollar content. Back to the notebook phase, a lot of that under a dollar per phase, just under a dollar per phase and that’s really get a sizable contribution to the netbook dollar content.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie with Raymond James. Please proceed.
Steve Smigie - Raymond James: I think you could talk a little bit about the products, at the end of last year you had introduced about 150 new products in 2008. How many of those are going to be ramping revenue license second half as you talked (Inaudible) all those ramping or is it some of those ramping and then you to have, how the FAEs to get the rest of the products out. Help me understand that?
Michael Hsing: Let me answer the question. I think you lose our product in the count and so do I. The best answer for our Marketing Director to answer that.
Steve Lim: We actually released about half the products you mentioned, okay.
Rick Neely: I think the one basically it was the total number, Steven.
Steve Smigie - Raymond James: Total number, right okay.
Steve Lim: We released well under that. So, the traction takes about two years, okay. So, you are not going to get material revenue this year, of course a few of those products will take off and in general we expect a material gain in revenue from 2008 releases will be in the 2010 timeframe.
Unidentified Company Speaker: What we do highlight, Steve is when we have very fast product production for example with Intelli-Phase without the highlights because that's a leading indicator that people like the product.
Steve Smigie - Raymond James: Right and that the product was so surprising how quickly you got that out, was there something specific about what you guys did there (Inaudible) out faster than others?
Rick Neely: We actually been working on it since 2008 and we put a lot of resources in to that. So, I think it was MPS putting the resources in to it and then working closely with several notebook and server customers to make that work for those individual accounts.
Steve Smigie - Raymond James: Then just fairly on the whiting, on the LED product and white LED drivers. How much of that business its there is still sort of like legacy white LED business versus new stuff ramping?
Steve Lim:  Most of that all new.
Michael Hsing: Yes, most of all is new. Since you mentioned the LED lighting and that we see the big opportunities both in the display market as well as general lighting. We see our products are doing really well out there. We will continue to bring a few more significant products in the area. 
Steve Smigie - Raymond James: Last question (inaudible) is within on the display side, how much of that market is point CCFL market and how much is LED at this point you think? 
Michael Hsing:  Rick, you maybe, you have numbers.
Rick Neely:  The current shipment volume, CCFL still slightly ahead, but the new design seem to be mostly white LED. 
Michael Hsing: You’re talking about design. Talk about revenues.
Rick Neely: Revenues are still, CCFL that it will shrink the other way. 
Steve Smigie - Raymond James: At the end of this place being produced by your customers, how many, what percentage of what they are producing now is 17 versus? 
Michael Hsing:  In LCD still a smaller numbers and I think in the large format. The notebook side and I see 50% of notebook it’s already in the LED displayed. Only 15, 17 inch large panel is still use CCFL. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank: A couple of gross margin related questions, when you talk about the low end, going a little low end if your historic range, because what's going on in macro that make a ton of sense. Approximately how good is macro have to get again before you think that pressure abates or is it really going to be driven your gross margin going back up going to be driven more by the new product penetration. 
Michael Hsing:  Let me answer your first part of question first. We have in the end of Q1 and Q2 times in a timeframe the competitors slashed price relatively in a very high percentage and so we followed. Majority of our products are expected a [bit] and new product introductions is distracted. And as you look at it in the last two or three years, we are very stable. And so by this event and our margin dropped a couple of percent. I don’t see in the near future that it will jump back to the 63%. And after it really depend on our new product introductions and the speed of acceptance.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank: You don't control how those products ramp necessarily with your customers, but, if it's the middle of next year or end of this year versus end of next year, what sort of percent of your revenues will be coming from those new products, just to give us an idea how we should expect them to ramp?
Rick Neely: Ross, as we had said actually in our last conference call and I probably repeated for this conference call is for 2009, we don’t expect much change in the environment that would affect those margins. The difficult economic environment (inaudible). So, we don’t expect any boost from that this year. As to whether it happens in the middle of next year, you guys and the economist can try and figure that out. We don’t really know that. So, as Michael said, we are going to focus on the new product. That is not an issue, it's just a reality. If you remember [Steve Bratz] commented, with an 18 month to two-year design cycle, for us we are excited. We ship a few hundred thousand dollars of a product. While there isn't enough of that obviously to effect the gross margin. So, it takes a while to get enough of those new products in there to affect the gross margin. So, we wouldn’t expect a general number and that’s an '010 event.
Michael Hsing: But MPS again, for margin is secondary to us. Although we may swing up 1% or 1.5%. It's very possible because the revenue numbers keep increase and becomes normal. So more predictable in the Q1 or Q2 time. And we can optimize on (inaudible) and so I’m not surprising we’ll go up about a couple of percent or so. But overall, we do not focus on our margins. We focus on our product and introductions and getting out more market shares and also getting to a new market.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank: Great, then a follow-up question. It's not so much gross margin related and I realized you are not guiding for the fourth quarter, but historically you are usually down 3% to 5% sequentially or so with your normal seasonality in the fourth quarter. Given what’s going on in macro, the snapback you are seeing right now, lengthening lead times, short inventory, lean inventory I should say et cetera. Could you just walk us through what the puts and takes might be, that would make the fourth quarter of this year either kind of a normal seasonality better than normal, worse than normal?
Michael Hsing: Well, it’s very difficult for us to say. This year looking from today, this year will be a normal year, but I can’t really forecast just based on what I am pulling the number from my hair.
Rick Neely : I think that’s a normal year as you said, Ross. It's down 5% to 7%. Something like that will be the typical normal year. What would make it better would be some unusual positive activity. I think what will make it worse is Christmas is gloomy and even lower, so I don't which way that's going to happen. So we are not trying to predict that. I think we are just, keep doing that.
Michael Hsing: First, you try to answer your question.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of [Arnab Chanda] with (inaudible). Please proceed.
Unidentified Analyst: Normally if you have revenue growth, you should probably see some margin expansion excluding pricing I would guess. Based on the guidance that you gave, should we assume margins are basically flat because the low end of the range is a little bit hard for me to understand. At the same time, we have revenues going down, should that go the opposite direction? If you could kind of explain that, that will be great.
Steve Lim: I will start off and then Michael can finish. The assumption that when revenue goes up, gross margin goes up, that's not true for fabless companies. We don’t get any OpEx, we don’t get any leverage out of increased margins except the mix. And the mix can change or the number of products can change, but a fabless company gets nothing out of ups or downs per se. That's the advantage and so I wouldn't go along with increased revenue equals higher gross margin, not for us.
Michael Hsing: Yes, that's kind of business (inaudible). But we have so many different products. And it depend on which side have a more volume. So, it would change and again I don't see it’s a 1% swing, so it's very usual. So far you'll see our history is very steady. We don't swing a lot and other than that, we can't say any thing more.
Unidentified analyst: Well, the reason I mention is you did see a 40% revenue growth and margins it go up from Q1 to Q2. So, is it mostly just mix and pricing that really drives the margin we say for you.
Rick Neely:  Mix in pricing, we had. In Q1 when revenue was way down at $29 million, we do have back end (inaudible), it doesn’t have much impact on margin, but maybe a point, whether it’s way underutilized that’s now gone. So, there is a slight impact that was part of the uptick, but the rest of that was mix. DC, DC grew well and that’s a good margin. 
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks, Rick. Can I ask you question about your new products you are taking about Intelli-Phase driver. Couple of things about, one is that, could you talk about what (inaudible) expansion that affords you, when all the products are released. Then secondly it seem like you were able to release the products very quickly especially for compare to competition. Is this because you have a benefit in process, is there an operational benefit or is that something that you are doing, that’s a little bit different and how sustainable that lead is. Thank you. 
Rick Neely: There is other driver is out there, but where the first model. I think when we integrated one in the small side and that’s due to our technology and I’ll tap it up. 
Steve Lim:  Regarding the technology we are replacing is not just existing solution, but the way we designed our part, it’s a Monolithic part that runs at a higher frequency. That’s it external components and that total solution is getting, is a significant region, why customers are gravitating to our solution and higher efficiency. 
Unidentified Analyst: On the [TAM] question? 
Steve Lim:  The TAM question?
Michael Hsing: We can use term our sales guidance. It’s huge. I think that’s more of a joke. That’s why missing up. In the notebook phase you can take $2 or $3, multiple times notebooks.
Steve Lim: It's doubling our server market.
Michael Hsing: It doubles our servile market. In servers, we are not in servers. So, it's pretty much you can think the same.
Steve Lim: 100% increase in server market.
Michael Hsing: 100% increase to servers and how big is the server market. I think those are five plus dollars for server at least it multiply 10 times a server. So, you can figure that out.
Steve Lim:  It’s a huge. That’s not a joke.
Michael Hsing: Yes. That’s not a joke.
Steve Lim: We increased roughly over $1 billion.
Unidentified Analyst: That is a huge a number, okay. One last question, if I could, about your lighting control business. Obviously, most of its CCFL, you know from your commentary what I didn’t understand exactly was do you think you will have higher or lower share in LED versus CCFL and is that a benefit for you or is there crossover time, where one will decline and the other will grow? If you could just clod to and describe that a little bit, that would great?
Michael Hsing:  Absolutely, one is decline the other one is going to increase. In LED lightings, we spread over in many different areas. So, that market we see will increase and market size will increase and as so is our product. CCFL particularly for in notebook was upside.
Rick Neely:  I think when we look at it. Our CCFL backlight it was a very specific difficult product area with four, three guys in it, but it wasn’t very big. White LED will have a lot more competitors. At the same time at it’s a lot bigger market. The reason we called, we named it lighting and control, it's not just backlight in for notebook anymore. It's general lighting. It’s a home lighting. It's industrial lighting. There is a lot of lighting in white LED over the next five years that we see big opportunities. So, I think what you'll see is, our individual share will be a lot percentage vise smaller, but the markets a lot bigger.
Unidentified Analyst: So, Rick, just the one last question about that, the growth LED assumes decline of CCFL and that product line grows. Is it a couple of years away or is it can be faster than that?
Rick Neely: That’s actually, I’ll expect you analyst to earn the money and figure that out.
Michael Hsing: We don’t try.
Unidentified Analyst: We like your backup model, Rick, but then we can tell you. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Freedman with Broadpoint AmTech. Please proceed.
Doug Freedman - Broadpoint AmTech: Thanks again for taking my question and great quarter that you put up. I guess a lot of questions have been asked and answered, but if you could talk a little bit about the audio market, what trends you see there, and then I may double back on one or two things just for clarification.
Michael Hsing: Yes. You mentioned that at the least favor of a product line. That’s a loss of gross margins and we tried to stabilize. Although we see still see some growth and Doug, I don't like the product line and then we try to minimize the effect.
Rick Neely: It's not a product emphasis for MPS. We're not putting the same resources that what we putting into Intelli-Phase. Though it's a difficult market it is highly competitive. So, it's not an emphasis for MPS.
Doug Freedman - Broadpoint AmTech: Is it safe to say that Intelli-Phase ramping, offsetting, audio trends would be positive to gross margins as from a mixed transition?
Michael Hsing: It's not a one-to-one, and we have a lot of products, become offset and I make sure of that. So, we have all the other products, I'm very excited about it, but overall we still manage at 20% to 30% growth in the normal economic conditions.
Doug Freedman - Broadpoint AmTech: Okay and then Rick any chance you can offer a CapEx number for the full year?
Rick Neely: Yes, actually a good question. For the year, so far it's been probably about 5 to 6. It will probably stand another similar amount in the second half. So it's probably 8 to 10. 
Doug Freedman - Broadpoint AmTech: If I could just sort of revisit some of your commentary as far as the market and what you're seeing, would it be correct to say that you think you're book-to-bill for this September quarter is going to look flat and that would mean that you are shipping to demand. I am having troubling understanding your commentary as far as distribution inventories remain lean, but remind me, I believe you're still on a sell-in accounting base. Any chance that distribution would stock up and that you would shift maybe above demand levels and that you would end up, if you could just talk a little bit about some of those comments that to me don't seem to go completely hand in hand. 
Rick Neely: We are in the selling basis. So even though we grew revenue a lot, I want to assure investors that we didn't grow revenue by putting a bunch of product in the distribution. So distribution inventories are up slightly, but on a days basis we're well below the 30 days target. So, the main purpose of that Doug was to assure people we didn't get the number by putting a bunch of products in the distributors. So, the second part of your question, the distributor is typically in a difficult and economic environment, because in the selling mode, they cannot return parts to it. They can't get price changes and so forth. What they buy, they keep. So, they tend to be more reluctant to stock inventory and they only do it with what I would call real demand and that was the nature of the comment. It's likely in this environment that what they are selling through and ordering from us is called real demand because they are nervous about stocking. Now that's just our belief, we don't have a core side on that. But that was really the nature of the comment. Does that answer your question?
Doug Freedman - Broadpoint AmTech:  Yes.
Steve Lim: One thing that Rick had pointed out, the revenue effect of the stocking in the distribution with expect the revenue numbers, we don’t actually from a financial side. That’s what Rick sees, from that real operation side and we do believe and we can control the inventory much better than our distributors. All our product shipped out from [Shandong] China. And within a day or two, we can reach to our customers. There is no reason for our distributor to stock inventory. However, now to me is unusual time because we have like a 50 or 70 new product ramping. And we can control the rate of the ramping, that's why we control that inventories. But in a steady state time we do want to stop the inventory in our distributions. 
Doug Freedman - Broadpoint AmTech: Rick, can you talk about. You have had very strong cash performance. What's your present deal on the future use of cash and share account, whether you would enter into reengaging a buyback program?
Rick Neely: Yes, I can the same comment I made last quarter, where we are happy, we were a big cash generator but in the difficult economic times, you can never have enough cash. So at this time, we're going to hold on to it. We did a good buyback last year which helped to keep our share account flat year-over-year. On the other hand in these conditions, we still believe we are not out of the woods and more cash is better. So, that's what we are doing for now.
Operator: At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Rick Neely for any closing remarks. Sir?
Rick Neely: Well, thank you everyone for listening to our call. And we look forward to chatting with you at the end of the third quarter. Thanks.
Michael Hsing: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This now concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect and have a great day.

Operator: Welcome to the Q1 2009 Monolithic Power Systems Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. My name is Heather and I will be your audio coordinator for today. At this time all participant are in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session toward the end of today’s conference. (Operator instructions) And now I would turn the presentation over to your host for today’s conference, Mr. Rick Neely, Chief Financial Officer. Please proceed sir.
Rick Neely: Good afternoon and welcome to the first quarter fiscal 2009 Monolithic Power Systems conference call. Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS, is with me on today's call. In the course of today's conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risks and uncertainties. For example, our business outlook, including our business and financial outlook for the second quarter of 2009; projected second quarter revenues and gross margins; our expectations for the second quarter, litigation, stock compensation, and non-GAAP operating expenses, our target operating model range for gross margins and operating expenses; research and development, and selling, general, and administrative expenses; our second quarter projected business activity levels,; our expected average tax rate for 2009; our belief that MPS is well-positioned for future growth; new product introductions, potential customer acceptance and the various opportunities these present, including their impact on revenue growth rates and finally; inventory levels and projected changes in inventory levels. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts or guarantees of future performance or events and are based on current expectations, estimates, beliefs, assumptions, goals and objectives and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by these statements. Risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our Form 10-K filed on February 27th, 2009, which is accessible through our website, www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today’s call. We will be discussing operating expense and net income on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude charges related to stock-based compensation and their related tax effects. We will also discuss our expected non-GAAP research and development and selling, general, and administrative expense for the second quarter of 2009, which excludes our expected charges related to stock-based compensation. A table that outlines a reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to this release, as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our website. I would also like to remind you that today's conference call is being webcast live over the Internet and will be available for replay on our website for one year along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. We would like to start this call by reviewing our first fiscal quarter 2009 business highlights. Following this update, I will discuss our operating results. We will conclude by discussing our expectations for the second fiscal quarter 2009. We will then open up the call to your questions. Let's start with the business highlights. MPS results this quarter reflect the impact of the global recession as we recorded revenues of $29.3 million, a decrease of 17% from the prior year and down 16% sequentially. However, we saw increased bookings and churns activities in the second half of the quarter, which allowed MPS to come in at the high end of its revenue guidance for the quarter. While overall, revenue declined, MPS was excited to see that several of our new product families saw both, sequential growth and year-over-year revenue growth in Q1. In previous calls we have highlighted the tremendous number of new product introductions that the company executed in 2007 and 2008 and we continue to see both, design wins progress as well as revenue growth from these new product families, expanding our footprint into untapped market segments. Given the normal time lags from product introductions to significant revenue ramps, MPS feels that it's on-track to see greater contributions from these new products in the second half of 2009 and even more uptake in 2010. We sampled the 25A version of our new driverMOS family in this first quarter, which is another cornerstone technology development for MPS. This new product line opens up high-end product markets for MPS such as high-performance graphics cards, communications equipment and servers. In the manufacturing area, the lower revenue levels in the first quarter led to a gross margin of 58%, which met our expectations for this metric. Our own inventories were down slightly from the fourth quarter at $18.6 million but inventory at our distributors dropped significantly as they trimmed their stock to reflect the new demand environment. Bottom line, non-GAAP net income was $2.3 million or $0.06 per fully diluted share. Now let's look at the financials in more detail. On the P&L, starting with the revenue line, first quarter 2009 net revenues of $29.3 million declined 17% from the first quarter of 2008, and were down 15% sequentially from the $34.7 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008. This sequential decline was slightly higher than our normal seasonal drop. We believe this was due to the current global economic conditions. During this quarter, MPS has changed its revenue classification in order to reflect changing market trends. We will now root for a new category of revenue called Lighting Control, which will include all of our products that are directly involved in that function, such as CCFL inverters, CCFL controllers, and white LED drivers for both general lighting and high-performance LED panel backlighting. The following revenue statistics reflect this new classification, so let's break down our first quarter by product type. DC to DC product sales were $21.2 million, down 13% from the $24.2 million reported in the year-ago quarter and down 19% from the fourth quarter of 2008. The main reason for this decline was a global drop in electronics demand in the first quarter of the year. Lighting control revenues for the first quarter were $4.7 million, a decrease of 45% from the same quarter a year ago and a decline of 28% from the fourth quarter of 2008. Historically, the first quarter is our weakest seasonal demand quarter for back-lighting revenue. Combining these seasonality with a recession driven drop in OEM orders for in-products such as notebooks, monitors and other screens, we saw significant impact to this revenue segment. Audio revenues came in at $3.5 million, up 27% from $2.8 million recorded in the year ago quarter and up 58% from the fourth quarter of 2008. This result reflects a success of several major consumer product manufactures in the LCD TV space who are the major customers for our audio line. Moving down to the gross margin line, our first quarter gross margin was 57.6% compared to 63.2% in the same quarter of 2008 and 58% in the fourth quarter of 2008. Though these result is below our normal target range, it met our expectations given our current low revenue levels. Compared to our peak revenue in the third quarter of 2008, the drop in volume translates to about two point reduction in gross margin due to relative fixed cost spread over a lower revenue base, even though we reduced our cost in our test operations in Q1. In positive economic cycles, we have operated at the mid to upper end of target range at 60% to 63% gross margin, but during difficult times we would expect to operate at or slightly below the lower end of this range. Lets look at our reported expense and the operating margins on a GAAP basis, our GAAP operating expenses were $18 million in the first quarter. This includes $15.9 million in R&D and SG&A expense, which includes $3.3 million for stock compensation expense and litigation expense of $2 million. Compared with the fourth quarter of 2008, GAAP operating expenses were flat at the $18 million. The expense mix changed as follows: R&D decreased by $1. million; SG&A decreased by $248,000; litigation increased by $1.5 million. Our GAAP operating loss was 4% in the first quarter compared with an operating margin of 6% in the fourth quarter of 2008. On a non-GAAP basis, lets look at our expenses. Excluding stock compensation, our non-GAAP operating expenses for the first quarter of 2009 were $14.6 million compared to $14.3 million in the first quarter of 2008, and $14.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. The $332,000 million expense increase from the fourth quarter of 2008 was due to higher legal spending associated with O2 Micro case coming before the ITC later this year.  Non-GAAP R&D costs showed a sequential decline of $952,000 as we controlled our variable costs closely. Non-GAAP SG&A spending also declined from the fourth quarter of 2008 by a $168,000 primarily in sales and marketing as revenue produced lower commission. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 8% in the first quarter of 2009 compared with 17% in the fourth quarter of 2008. On the bottom line, our Q1 GAAP net loss was $728,000 or $0.02 per basic share. On a non-GAAP basis we had net income in Q1 of $2.3 million or $0.06 per fully diluted share. This result is computed with a non-GAAP tax rate of 12.5% within our expected average tax rate range for 2009 of 10% to 15%. We are proud of the fact that MPS has been continuously profitable on a non-GAAP basis excluding stock compensation and litigation settlements since our IPO in Q4 of 2004. Let's look at some of the changes to the balance sheet this quarter. Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and investments were $150.8 million at the end of the first quarter of 2009, up significantly from the $115.6 million in the first quarter of 2008, and up slightly from the $150 million at 2008 year end. In Q1, MPS had operating cash flow of a little less than $1 million as working capital increases for receivables absorbed significant cash. We spent about $1.3 million on capital in the first quarter, which was offset by cash proceeds of about $1.5 million for options and employee stock plans. Accounts receivable ended the first quarter at $13.4 compared with $9.1 million at the end of Q4 '08, and $11.3 million at the end of the first quarter of 2008. The increase in receivables was a result of unusual changes in orders and shipments in the past two quarters. In Q4 '08, the majority of shipments were made early in the quarter as demand dropped dramatically from November to year end. In contrast, in Q1 the majority of shipments were made later in the quarter, after mid-February when business activity picked up, thus our receivable balances increased. Most of these receivables have already been collected as of this conference call. Days sales outstanding rose in Q1 to 41 days as a result of a shipment timing issue I just described. We have not seen any deterioration in the credit quality of our receivables and expect to return to our normal DSO range of 30 to 35 days in future quarters. Our inventory at the end of the first quarter were $18.6 million or about 136 days of inventory on a historical basis. This compares with $18.9 million or 118 days of inventory at the end of the fourth quarter of 2008. Our goal this quarter was to keep our internal inventories about flat and focus on reducing distributor channel inventory. We were very successful, as inventory in our distribution channel dropped by over $4 million and came in below our target range of 30 to 45 days by the end of the quarter. We are comfortable with our internal inventory level as on a forward basis using the midpoint of revenue guidance for Q2, our Q1 ending inventory day would be below 110 days, which is where our normal operating range is. I would now like to turning to a discussion of general business conditions. The first quarter of 2009 got off to a very slow start, as the electronic supply chain was in the midst of significant inventory destocking as a reaction to the global economic difficulty. We started to see some small rush orders in later January, which indicated to us inventory levels are very low and some manufactures were experiencing stock-outs. This proved to be the case as larger volume churns orders increased to very good levels in later February and March and our Q1 revenue came in at the high end of guidance range. Geographically, in the first quarter of 2009 MPS shift 47% of revenue to Taiwan and China and 53% to other region with Korea and Europe performing particularly well. In the new product area, the highlight of the quarter was the introduction of a new driverMOS family, which now includes both a 20A and a 25A version, that are the most powerful in their class that fit into 5 by 5 millimeter package. This new product family will open up the high performance graphic card, communication equipment and server power management markets to MPS and the initial customer reaction has been very positive. We also sampled our first 600 volt gate driver, which works with any AC offline supply straight of the line, which could be used in end products such as power supplies and telecommunication equipment. This innovative product is a great example of MPS's technology, capability. Another notable performance this quarter was the continued sequential growth of three of our new product families MiniMonster, battery charger and LDOs. Some examples of where these products are going include flat panel TVs and communication products for MiniMonsters, cell phones or battery chargers and multimedia applications for LDOs. I would now like to turn to our outlook for the second quarter of 2009. MPS began the first quarter with very weak bookings, but business activity picked up after Chinese New Year and we were able to come in at the upper end of our guidance range. While our second quarter bookings and backlog are very healthy, we remain cautious as to the underlying nature of the demand. Channel inventories have been rebuilt but we do not yet have visibility to the likely run rate for the second half of the year. Therefore, we will continue to guide using a wider revenue range with our expectations for Q2 revenue in the range $36 to $40 million. Gross margin is expected to be slightly below the lower end of our target range of 60% to 63%. We expect stock-based compensation expense in the range of $3.5 to $3.8 million. We expect non-GAAP research and development, and selling, general and administrative expense in the range of $14 to $16 million. This estimate excludes the stock-compensation estimates mentioned above. Finally, we expect litigation expense in the range of $2.3 to $2.7 million In conclusion, we are pleased to report that despite a tough economic environment, MPS performed well. We remained profitable and cash flow positive without layoffs and controlled our inventory channels closely. We are growing revenues in product families introduced in 2007 and 2008, and continuing our geographic diversification. We are using this period to focus on design wins and introduction of very high performance new products and product families. We feel these actions will position MPS very well for future growth. Now we would like to open up the microphone and take your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question is from the line of Vijay Rakesh with ThinkEquity. Please proceed.
Vijay Rakesh - ThinkEquity:  Hi guys, good quarter. Just on the, you mentioned still looking for signs of demand in the second half, I was wondering if you can focus on your product cycles. What are the key product cycles to watch for you in the second half of the year?
Michael Hsing: Second half of the year or second half of the first quarter?
Vijay Rakesh – ThinkEquity(:  Second half of this year, what are the product cycles sticking out?
Michael Hsing: In general and so far in the first quarter as Rick recommended, we have a breadth of new product line, and introduced at end of last year, and they are doing well. And in the first quarter in all of our product line, new and old, they all increased the booking quite significantly.
Rick Neely: That's right, I think once ---
Michael Hsing: So I can’t -- the second half, okay. I don't see second half I can't see it. What will be coming in the second half of the 2009.
Rick Neely: Yes, by product cycle which you see Vijay is, obviously the notebooks are pretty weak in Q4 and Q1. So our computing revenue is low. We are starting to see some of that come backs. So that's really market related one. As Michael said in terms of the overall demand the biggest groups for us are really come in consumer and communications types of products, and we are doing pretty well in those end market. Though we can't predict the end market demand. So, we have a lot of products spread across all the major markets. So, that's how we are covering our bets. We don't know which one will go, so we have a lot of thoughts.
Michael Hsing: This is a strategic reason why we have -- we don't focus on a single market. We have so many products, the company now will have well over 200 products. And we want to focus on a different market.
Vijay Rakesh - ThinkEquity: Got it, one last question. Your litigation expense seems to be little high 2.3, 2.7, how do you see that, do you see that coming down in Q3? Can you give us some more color to it?
Michael Hsing: It is very difficult to predict the litigation because it has its own course and we can't really predict that. In Q3, a lot of things can happen. So we don't want to make any comment.
Vijay Rakesh - ThinkEquity: All right, great, thanks.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Rick Schafer with Oppenheimer. Please proceed.
Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer: Hi, guys nice quarter. I just have a couple of questions for you. I guess the first is any comment on order pattern in the first quarter, can you give us any color on what you are seeing so far? I guess this month is almost up here in April. Was it safe to say I guess that orders have returned to sort of normal seasonal patterns and any comment on visibility or cancellations would be great there?
Michael Hsing: We don't see any significant cancellations. But overall and across all the products and the product line, we all see the increased bookings. And it seems February.
Rick Neely: Well, I think the other thing we see Rick is, the volatility of bookings is quite higher than it normally is. So when you talk about normal bookings, we are not seeing the kind of normal, we see periods where there is no bookings and then periods where there is a rash of bookings. And so there is that kind of fanatic character to the bookings that we see. So it's not really not behaving in a normal pattern right now, we're in a strong segment. But the behavior has been unusual.
Michael Hsing: That’s correct.
Rick Schafer – Oppenheimer: Okay. Can you tell you us what churns are, I think churns are only like 12% or some thing last quarter, what churns are at this point or from the beginning of the quarter wherever you want to give us?
Michael Hsing : I think I don't have a quantifying numbers and that Rick can tell you. In the last quarter and I mean December quarter, we have a lot of cancellations, in the last months of the quarter and we don’t have -- net booking is zero and so almost zero. In Q1, we have a lot of erratic orders. So that's why we give a very wide guidance, we didn't know what to expect. And it seems to have smoothed out a little bit recently but we still see not a point.
Rick Neely: And I think further, we don't talk about the percentage of churns, because particularly in this environment it's not really meaningful. Because we use that percentage, I can put out a number that you can read in our 10-K. e started in January 1, our backlog for first quarter was $10 million. So obviously that would have told you it had normal 50-50 if you use that, we would had ad $20 million quarter in Q1, but we didn't, we had $29 million. So I don’t think in this environment the churns ratios are about useful as a metric and we are not going to give them out.
Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer: Okay. and then this is a second question, Rick. You have alluded to a utilization rate, I think you said cost you about 2 points of gross margin in the first quarter. Can you give us an idea what like Chengdu utilization rate is for Q2 or what you expect it will be and…?
Rick Neely: Utilization is kind of - actually they're quite busy doing a lot of work on R&D products, so it's not that the people were sitting around, and we did have a couple of weeks shutdown in Chinese New Year in Q1.
Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer: Right.
Rick Neely: So the utilization rate, the problem is, the cost in Chengdu is relatively fixed in that the vast majority of costs are deprecation and building and supply but not labor. So whether I do $49 million of revenue like I did in Q3 or $29 million in Q1, there isn’t much change in the cost but it's spread over a much different base. So it's not really utilization, it's just a overhead to the degree that it's just a spread over a larger base.
Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer: So you do -- I guess just to be clear with that, do you see it as sort of another 100 basis points or 200 basis point drag?
Rick Neely: Yes, obviously the guidance we gave this quarter it will drop out to a small number.
Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer: Right. Thanks a lot, guys.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Steve Smigie with Raymond James. Please proceed.
Steven Smigie - Raymond James: Hi great, thanks guys. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about how much you think of the guidance comes from the success you're having with new products versus sale of pick up at the end markets.
Michael Hsing: I think that actually we see across all the products. As I just said I don’t -- I wish I can say a lot more specific about the nature of our business is spread around, it's so far apart. We have some more related consumer product like TVs and also the projectors, if you characterize as a consumer product and printers and as well as some as other industrial parts and [power] meters and those kind of things that we all saw a volume increase just recently.
Rick Neely: As I said, on the new products we had sequential growth, if you take [MiniMonsters, battery charges and LDOs altogether, they all had sequential growth, each one of them individually and together quarter-over-quarter. So that was -- that can show you that we are getting a good chunk of it from new products because obviously we dropped in Q1 from Q4 but we actually grew those three segments. Now they are small but they continue to add every quarter. So, that’s -- I would not split it as Michael said, between demand versus new products. Its both but we are very happy. The thing we focused on is a new product because that’s what we could control.
Michael Hsing: Exactly, I just want to add it. In the new product, I want to see how that new product was and that drives the margin and that drives the future revenues and we are very happy to see all the new products and when we introduced them at last year, see a very healthy growth. At the same time also we introduced these automotive products and those has a 60 volts of [protection] and we introduced in the market and that surprisingly we see orders.
Steven Smigie - Raymond James: Okay, and it seems like US maybe double almost triple numbers of products that you introduced and just in terms of starting to generate revenue from those new products, are we in the sort of first or second inning of revenues that we are going to see from these products coming out?
Michael Hsing: Yes.
Rick Neely: Remember, as we said, a lot of the new products were late’07. The first MiniMonster is just the first couple of more in ’07 and then in ’08 we have a big search [MOSFET] way that would not show till the second half of '09 and 2010?
Michael Hsing: Well into the second or third ending, if you recollect what you said. And we will migrate to lot more product lines and as Rick mentioned the 600 volt that is AC to DC product. And we will have more products introduced in the area. And those products are focused on a small form factors and power supply, which really can bring a value.
Steven Smigie - Raymond James: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vernon Essi with Needham & Company. Please proceed.
Vernon Essi - Needham & Company: Thanks for taking my questions, nice quarter. I wanted to just dive into the growth you had in Korea. It was very strong sequentially and I am wondering if that was more leaning towards the -- which end markets I mean assuming either TV or handsets and any more color there?
Michael Hsing: In Korea there's only two of that they have a handset and the flat panel. And as you know, we have a little exposure in the handsets markets. Yes it has lot to do with the TVs.
Vernon Essi - Needham & Company: Okay. And on that front I assume that the growth sales in audio as well as the traditional CCFL front or did you get AC-to-DC contact on the television?
Michael Hsing: Yes we did have a AC to-DC contact, I mean that increased quite a bit from Korea.
Rick Neely: In Korea, but it's not just on the [overheads]. We have a lot of power management in the Korea market.
Vernon Essi - Needham & Company: And then just follow on the gross margin, I am trying to put my logic head-on on the statement, you will be below this certain range. Are you implying that you will be below 60% or the low end of that range you provide?
Rick Neely: Well we said slightly below the range, below 60%.
Vernon Essi - Needham & Company: Okay. Right. Thanks for the clarification.
Operator: And your next question is from the line of Johnny Brown with Stevens Inc. Please proceed.
Johnny Brown - Stevens Inc.:  Hey guys, as a follow up to that gross margin. I hate to beat a dead horse here, but since it was mainly utilization that was pressuring margins, and you can see a nice uptick in revenue next quarter, I would assume it would be an increase sequentially gross margins are probably between 58% in the low end of the range to 60%?
Rick Neely: Well, that's parsing it down to the guidance, I think that’s slightly below it we were are 58, so you can make your own conclusion. I think one thing to keep in mind, which we also mentioned in the call is that were we are increasing our revenues some and that the impact on our -- we don’t do a lot of manufacturing, we just have a test facility. So it doesn’t have a lot, one to two points and that's going to shrink. So the rest of it is, the fact is that we're operating in a difficult environment, where price competitions are really tough. We've seen very difficult pricing in course and outside the shop and everybody's margins and everybody there have seen. So that's why even in tough times you're just as you wrap up your revenue a little bit, you are not going to have a huge jump in margins.…
Michael Hsing: Well it's a percent of a change, it's not the price to me. And we don’t -- this is not a exact science, meaning that we wish you can put a little lot more accuracy before you guys, but it's a future business and in this kind of a messy environment, we really can't give you any predictions, any closely.
Johnny Brown - Stevens Inc.: Yes. Yes. That’s fair enough. I think we're just trying to get a picture of a longer term, whether we were going to come down little bit higher or a little bit lower than where you have been operating.
Michael Hsing: Yes, I think that you remember I think four years ago we said that gross margin in the longer term [world] will go down. And believe me, the [world] will down from longer term.
Johnny Brown – Stevens Inc.: Okay and then just real quick operating expenses, R&D came down pretty significantly in the quarter, I was wondering if you could talk about the reasons for that and then give a little bit more color for second quarter guidance for R&D, the relationship between which one is going to increase the most, R&D or SG&A.
Rick Neely: Yes, I mean R&D and SG&A both drops significantly in Q1 because as we mentioned in the prior call, a good portion of our comp, salary costs are kind of bonus based and given the numbers that we were possible, we did make a lot of money, so the bonuses, they were lot more than normally. So the R&D number that's the main reasons for the drop. Also R&Ds new product reduction is -- there is a fair amount of cyclicality, there is no -- we just introduced fewer products in Q1 because we don’t introduce this time in Q4, that's not a sign of anything there, its just a timing of things coming out. So with a few -- just fewer products in terms of making cost and then the bonus drops. Same thing in SG&A, again it was much lower in Q4 primarily on the variable cost. Now Q2 as we said in our guidance, they both will go up about the same amount. I would say that your Q2 R&D would be similar to Q4, '08 and your Q2 SG&A will be similar to Q4, Q3 even very similar to that of those revenue levels.
Johnny Brown – Stevens Inc.: Okay, thanks a lot guys.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Patrick Wang with Wedbush Morgan Securities. Please proceed.
Patrick Wang - Wedbush Morgan Securities: Yes thanks and great quarter guys. First off Mike, you guys had some greater second quarter guidance there. Can you, I guess give us a sense of or even perhaps ballpark, I guess how much coverage you've got when we think about your guidance maybe to the lower end $36 million?
Mike Hsing: The last quarter, as I said we released what the percentage of our bookings, because this is very unusual time and now we sort of, as I said earlier, we got orders that's not as erratic, its much smoother than before. So we will go back to the normal mode and we don't release that number anymore.
Rick Neely: And the normal mode means that we show our guidance – that’s something the company has a reasonable (chart) making and that's the way MPS has always done it, and that’s how we doing it this quarter. So that’s where I would leave it.
Patrick Wang - Wedbush Morgan Securities: And Rick historically I mean you've been in 40 to 50% churns rate before. Is that generally the size of the coverage you've guide here and how we should think about it or something kind of in between?
Michael Hsing: I think as I said it earlier, we'd become -- its not quite at normal and we still see some erratic things happening and its close to normal.
Patrick Wang - Wedbush Morgan Securities: Okay great. And then second Rick I want to ask you a little bit talk about, a talk about gross margins a bit more. So I think in the fourth quarter when we kind of backed out some inventory reserves and underwriting charges here, your normalized gross margins was in the 61% range and it looks like in Q1, we back up this two points we are at, its about 60%. I was wondering the delta there, if that was due to product mix with lighting and audio being at the higher or if there was some ASP pressure and then also what revenue levels you think that the underwriting charges start to rolling off so that they can cross the 60% margin level again?
Rick Neely: I think most of the things are true. There is definitely ASP pressure, we talked about that and I think everybody, every [airline] company would say that that's impacting the overall numbers, as we said I think now that we're up to the upper 30s in revenue the [step up] operation overhead will not be a significant factor, maybe half a point or a point. So then you're really down to mix. On the mix side, typically the newer products and some of the more technologically innovative DC products will tend to have higher margins, and some of our older products, which typically include some of the backlighting products, tend to have lower margins just because they're older and haven’t yielded cost improvement.
Michael Hsing: And older has a lower margin.
Rick Neely: That is a mix issue, and you could see how much we really sold our products and you can use that for your mix calculations.
Patrick Wang - Wedbush Morgan Securities: Okay, great. And if I could just squeeze one last one in. OpEx up a little bit more in Q2 due to high revenues. How should we think about OpEx in the back half of the year? Thanks so much.
Rick Neely: The back half of the year, again you can model those – they will look similar to -- in one sense to the numbers of when we're hitting last year 35, 40 million of revenue range, which is about, which you would expect the OpEx to be. So OpEx, we actually haven’t increased our hiring significantly but its optimal and we're going back to paying bonuses and things, to reward our employees. So that’s what will increase the OpEx back up.
Michael Hsing: It's a really, we don't have any specific visibility, it's very, very poor. And we don’t have any set numbers for OpEx and the company has a building function. So if the company is doing well, the OpEx will go higher. The company is making less money and the OpEx will be lower. So that’s how we operate.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Doug Freedman with Broadpoint. Please proceed.
Doug Freedman - Broadpoint AmTech: Congratulations again guys on a nice quarter in a tough environment. Can you talk a little bit Rick about your plan for Q2? You mentioned in your commentary that distis inventory is at the low end or below the low end of your target of 30 days. With your revenue plan, can you remind us again sell-in, sell-out and whether you are going to be increasing the amount of inventory held at distis in a Q2 as a result of your revenue growth forecast.
Rick Neely: We are in a sell-in model. 99% of our revenue is in Asia and that’s all sell-in. So as we mentioned that will drop our distis inventory in Q1 to below our target range and the amount of drop is over $4 million. So part of Q2 number, obviously, is those guys restocking now. In terms of where we are aiming for, that’s an interesting question because trying to figure out what the future demand of this thing have going to be is interesting question. So, we usually do a good job of being conservative and making sure we don’t put too much into the distri channel so that always been our practice. But, again, you can certainly see some of Q2 number it is, just the distis reselling.
Doug Freedman - Broadpoint AmTech: Can you remind us what percentage of sales is being handled through distribution at this point
Rick Neely: Probably 70% to 75%. We have some larger direct customers that lot of Korea is not through distribution, but everything else pretty much is.
Michael Hsing: But I want to emphasize that 80% of the revenue is emitting by our (SAE) and our sales persons. We use the disti as a fulfillment.
Doug Freedman - Broadpoint AmTech: If I could actually so have you actually added any heads to your sales department in the quarter. Is there any headcount addition plans for the year that we should take into account given that you guys seem to be right back on track pretty quickly here. 
Michael Hsing: The answer is yes. We do very conservatively because as our strategy is to expand geographical and the 50% of the market is outside Asia and in particularly in the U.S. and the Europe. So we are cautiously adding any people in the rest of the year.
Doug Freedman - Broadpoint AmTech: If I could sneak one last one in, I know the driver DriverMOS product really has the potential to have really strong revenue addition to the company. Any interest in sharing with us what you think those projections could look like? And if you need a controller alliance or if you are doing an internal control to support that product family, what direction do you think you are going to take with that? That would be helpful and thanks again.
Michael Hsing: So far the feedback is a very strong and it’s very clear. It is a single chip product. For this kind of application particularly in a notebook, we're the only company who can make such a product. I can’t say it is a revolution product, but we have a technical lead by far. Naturally, also to answer your second part of the question, the controllers that’s a piece that we don't have. But it doesn’t mean we will not sell the 25 current, it's well received in the market, but we're looking to the controller portion of that business.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Gus Richard with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.
Gus Richard - Piper Jaffray:  Just wanted again to talk about a little bit about gross margins. Normally in the analog market, you see the pricing pressure and new designs and it seems like you're seeing it a little bit sooner than one would expect. Can you talk about how the [ASP] pressure is manifesting itself? Is there something different here than in past cycles?
Michael Hsing: It is particularly after the first quarter we see a new projects and they negotiate a price a little more than used to be. Do I answer your questions?
Gus Richard - Piper Jaffray: So it is hitting you a little bit sooner than normal cycles on a prior cycle on a downturn?
Michael Hsing: It is particularly for the older products than existing product.
Gus Richard - Piper Jaffray: For existing products at your time.
Michael Hsing: Yes. For the newer products, we see a feasible far technical lead and that we expect to have a higher gross margin.
Gus Richard - Piper Jaffray: Then just if you talk a little bit, I think I know where the MiniMonsters and battery charges are going, but your LDO products are seeing some nice growth there. Is there any particular end market or application as like a bypass or replacement or is there something else that's a market describing it?
Michael Hsing: And we introduce some LDO is and I usually was associated with name of the rotten food. But we don't do that, don't capital our products. We see utilize our process technology. We can design and produce some very high performance LDOs, which fits in very particular socket. Therefore, those are products have a higher margin.
Gus Richard - Piper Jaffray: Just any color on where they are used or is it...
Michael Hsing: Those are for wireless side and same time are for, you see some products in a desktop, not a desktop computers and any box, the LDO is used for conditioning the line. So that's where we are targeting to.
Operator: Your question is from line of Evan Wang with Thomas Weisel Partners. Please proceed.
Evan Wang - Thomas Weisel Partners: I am calling in for Tore. Congratulations on the quarter. I have a question about your new Lighting Control unit. Could you give us some quality to believe and maybe breakdown among your CCFL, LED product or discuss how they performed in past quarter?
Rick Neely: As I mentioned before, we just reshuffled that a little bit, Evan. In fact, if we look at our 10-Q on the back, I think it's an item five, page 38 of the 10-Q. There is a table that shows that reconciliation going back. To summarize it, primarily lighting control right now is and has been a major product of MPS in cell inverters. That's been our first product the company ever made and it's still a significant product for us. The reason it is in there is that's the direction the market is heading for lighting of netbooks and notebooks and lot of other things. So, the [wider it is], is not a large number, it's probably 1 million to 1.5 million in recent quarters. So the rest of it is traditional backlighting products that we have.
Evan Wang - Thomas Weisel Partners:  One other question is about your ASP. You mentioned about some ASP pressure. I was wondering if you could talk about your expectation going forward. Do you expect that pressure to significantly increase or have you already seen that and it's basically just going to be ongoing?
Michael Hsing:  Yes. Always we see pricing pressures. Pricing never go up, it only can go down. As I said in the last question, we do see some higher pricing pressure in the last couple of months. I think you are aware of it. A lot of the major supplier, they have lowered the price. MPS, by no means, will give up.
Rick Neely: The difference in the recession versus in boom times, people are moving pretty quickly to get designs and things out. They're always are cost-conscious, but they may not ever get around to really negotiating on the power management shift that hard. In the recession, they go for every penny from everybody, and that's why the ASP pressure is tougher in a recession on everybody. How long that's going to last is anyone's guess.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank: Any big difference between your three segments as far as what's going to drive the growth in the second quarter? 
Michael Hsing: When we see the audio of DC to DC and actually they are very much the same. I think the DC to DC wakes up little more than the first quarter.
Rick Neely: Right. There is a little bit of a pick up on the computing side. We’re actually doing very well in communications products with modems and switches and wireless and set-top boxes. So we see a recovery in our business in communications. So that should do well. Computing will pick up a little bit. And then as Michael said, the DC/DC which spreads over a lot of different places is going to get back to [normal].
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank: Would you get cared to give just a rough estimate on your end market split by those sort of segments computing, communications, handsets, et cetera?
Michael Hsing: It's a very difficult and we try to do it. And so far we are not success with our auditors. It's by just the nature of the product that how we document it internally, and it's difficult for us to track. Once it goes to a Fox.com, he is a large contract manufacturing, then you don’t know where the product goes.
Rick Neely: We can rank them for you though. In terms of those percent, there's a thing that people may – because historically, we did a lot of business in the computing, that’s actually number three of those three. Now the biggest is consumer and then not too far behind is communications. We were actually dong a lot more in communications and people probably know. Computing is actually number three of those three. So, we can rank those and their percentages were hard to define, but we can tell you the ranking right now.
Michael Hsing: Auditors won’t let us to say.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank: You guys put handsets in consumer or communications?
Rick Neely: Communications. 
Michael Hsing: Yes, handsets in the communication, but we only have a very small portion of it in the handsets.
Rick Neely: Handsets were not big business for us.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank: Then a couple of housekeeping questions. What do you guys expect stock comp and your tax rate to be for this full year?
Rick Neely: For the tax rate we gave the range of 10% to 15% non-GAAP. I think we were 8% in Q1, so we were thinking 10 to 15 as the range I’ve been giving people for tax rate. Stock comp wise, we would forecast the midpoint around 3.6 or so. It's probably going to stay in that general range. It obviously depends on what the stock price does and some of the other factors in the model, but we don’t expect a tremendous amount of increase in shares granted. But we’ll just kind of flatten it from where we are. It would be a good deal.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Tore Svanberg with Thomas Wiesel Partners. Please proceed.
Tore Svanberg - Thomas Wiesel Partners: A few questions, first of all, just coming back to the distribution inventory. So you feel like you’re going to be in balance with distribution orders in the June quarter or are you just going to continue to under ship them in the June quarter?
Michael Hsing: In general, we believe we can manage the inventories much better than our distributors and particularly for those new products. And now that inventory in the distributor is very, very low. It really depends on the order pattern from our customer and we may or may not, I'll get Rick again to add something, but now not only if it’s all time low, it’s a very low now.
Rick Neely: And I think Michael is correct. We transferred the conservative side on the disti inventory as we have a good facility in China that could rapidly build and deliver products. There is no reason for us to stack them up, but this season we don't. So, recently, we pretty much in '07, '08 except for that fourth quarter when they had everything fell apart for everybody, we were under that 30 days numbers. So, we're back to that being well under the 30 days numbers. So, we're back to kind of levels that we're in the past and that's kind of where we want to keep it. Again, it’s not totally in our control. It’s been difficult for the distributors and ODMs to gauge end market demand. So, there's a bit of a guessing game going on there, but our practice is to try and keep that channel fairly linked.
Michael Hsing: To answer it little more clearly for the second quarters, no, we are not going to restock that inventory in our disti because the orders are erratic and I think that we can manage a whole lot better than our distributors. So, this is not. It's still kind of in the abnormal time.
Tore Svanberg - Thomas Wiesel Partners: Then just want to understand the utilization going forward, so obviously, your own inventory is going to be down a lot in Q2. So, when do we start to see an uptick in utilization? Would it sort of start halfway through the quarter and then you get the full benefit by Q3?
Rick Neely: Thus far in Q2, you won't see much of an impact of our revenue we'll be closing. And again, we have a facility size for the $40 million plus that we did in the second half of '08, and we're closing in on it. So as we're closing in on those types of numbers that will shrink.
Michael Hsing: And you particularly mentioned that Q3, I don't the pendulum swings back and we don't know. We are very, very cautious. Frankly, I am very worried. Ordering patent is very strong and Q3 is difficult to say. But whenever, as I said, the market is up or down, we will react in.
Tore Svanberg - Thomas Wiesel Partners: My follow-up question, looks like you are doing a great job outside of Taiwan and China to gain some share and you mentioned that Korea and Europe is particularly strong. Do you expect that trend to continue throughout the rest of the year? Were those two regions really driving this growth?
Michael Hsing: Europe, well. Because we've said live on TV we have very little to do with the handsets. And that relates to consumer behaviors, and in this market I really can't tell.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Michael McConnell with Pacific Crest Securities. Please proceed.
Michael McConnell - Pacific Crest Securities: Should we look at the pricing situation is more driven by the competition with respect to their own utilization. I imagine some of your competitors running at the price utilization rates. They're pricing it at their variable costs. So is there a threshold we should think about with your competitor's utilization rates, where they're more apt, at least looking historically to maybe ease up on the pricing pressure and the quoting, the quotes you're giving your customer base?
Rick Neely: That's a new question, because that's something that we've seen. Again, to remind people on the gross margin side, one other things we looked at is, we're at the lower end of our target range. So we looked at what other companies were doing in the analog space, and we are still number two in the industry by the way. So we're not outside of the leader, we are number two in the industry. So though we're not where we want to be, we are still doing pretty well. So to that end what you pointed out that the gross margins are particularly somewhat larger comparative to have around fab to drop fairly significantly, and therefore, they are covering that by doing some very low price deals. And that typically goes away as soon as they get their fabs up to and if they are down to 40% to 50% utilization level then you might go sell them up, you get 70% or 80% where they stop doing that. Typically, I don't know. I can't predict their behavior, but that's usually what I have seen in the past in my semiconductor experience. So yes, I think we are in this period where the dealing looks now right in the market is based on those types and as the business goes a up little bit more, they reduce their capacity, and therefore, they don't need to that kind of pricing.
Michael Hsing: Eventually, that clears out. But that's the point of my comment about during the recession there is more of this price competition.
Michael McConnell - Pacific Crest Securities: The second question would just be with respect to Q3, we have a pretty difficult sequential comparison just given the end of restocking activity and the big growth, we're now expecting for Q2. Seasonally, that's your strongest quarter from a sequential basis. Should we, without having lot of visibility mute our expectations if given a tougher compare with Q2 for topline growth?
Michael Hsing: I wish I can give a clear answer. We just scratch our head. We don't know what to expect and --
Rick Neely: I will agree with Mike. We don't know what to expect. But one of the things I can look at is, nothing in the last six months has behaved historically. In another words, this historical model say, Q3 up x% or whatever. I would be cautious in using those. Look at a couple of fact that I just see, one is the, I think the world gross domestic product is forecasting a decline in 2009 for the first time since World War II. The portion 500 had an 85% drop in fibers last year for a first time ever. So there is lots of general economic news, I think you would say, wow, this is not a period to use historical model so that's probably one thing I would point out.
Michael Hsing: I think, I interpret Rick's answer. We really rely on you guys to tell us what is the expectation.
Michael McConnell - Pacific Crest Securities: But I guess suffice to say though, looking forward beyond kind of the restocking dynamic we're seeing with Q2 after two very difficult quarters for the industry and now the big growth in Q2 and second half growth, at least your topline should be more commensurate with end consumption. Is that fair to say?
Rick Neely: I think that's probably…
Michael Hsing: I think that we always hear, I have a fear that the pendulum swings back. And because I am too shocked that last October-November and I guess sort of a waking up and I see, okay, the pendulum is going to swing back. I really have a fear about that.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Q&A portion of today's call. I would like to turn the presentation back over to your host Mr. Rick Neely for closing remarks.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2008 Monolithic Power Systems Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. My name is Eric. I will be your audio coordinator for today. And at this time all participant are in a listen-only mode. We will facilitate the question-and-answer session toward the end of the presentation. (Operator instructions) I would now like to turn your pan over to your host, Mr. Rick Neely, Chief Financial Officer. Please proceed.
Rick Neely: Thank you, Eric. Good afternoon and welcome to the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2008 Monolithic Power Systems conference call. Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS, is with me on today's call. In the course of today's conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risks and uncertainties, for example, our business outlook, including our business and financial outlook for the first quarter of 2009; projected first quarter net revenues and gross margins; our expectations for first quarter litigation, stock compensation, and non-GAAP research and development, and selling, general, and administrative expenses; our target operating model range for gross margins; planned new product introductions, potential customer acceptance and the various opportunities these present; our focus on cutting variable costs; our relative competitive position; our management of production cycles; inventory levels and projected changes in inventory levels; anticipated outcomes and schedules of our pending litigation; and finally our plans to weather the current economic conditions and use 2009 to position the Company to grow revenues in the future once end customer demand returns. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts or guarantees of future performance or events and are based on current expectations, estimates, beliefs, assumptions, goals and objectives and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by these statements. Risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our third quarter Form 10-Q filed on October 23rd, 2008, which is accessible through our website, www.monolithicpower.com, and our 2008 Form 10-K to be filed on or before March 17th, 2009. Also, please note that during this call we will discuss net income and operating expense on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude charges related to stock-based compensation, legal settlement, and provision cost, and one-time lease write-downs or write-ups and the related tax effects. We will also discuss our expected non-GAAP research and development and selling, general, and administrative expense for the first quarter of 2009, which excludes our expected charges related to stock-based compensation. A table that outlines the differences between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to this release as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our website. I'd also like to remind you that today's conference call is being webcast live over the Internet and will be available for replay on our website for one year. We would like to start this call by reviewing our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2008 business highlights. Following this update, I will discuss our financial results. I will then turn the call over to Michael and he will conclude with an overview of current business condition. We will then open up the call to your questions. Let's start with the business highlights. MPS had a good year in 2008 as we grew our annual revenue by 20% over 2007, setting a new yearly revenue record of $160.5 million. Our fourth quarter revenues were $34.7 million, a decrease of 10% from the fourth quarter of 2007 as end product demand dropped precipitously due to the global economic slowdown. Non-GAAP earnings for the year grew faster than revenues as non-GAAP EPS was up 22% from our 2007 performance coming in at $0.90 per share. In the product arena, MPS had a stellar year. Our output of new product introduction set new records as our expanded design teams worldwide were able to use MPS’ innovative process and design technology to come up with many new products and product families. In 2008, we saw production quantity shipments of our high-current, high voltage MiniMonsters product family and our new batter charger family, which together accounted for over $10 million of new revenue. Our regional growth strategy continued outside of our traditional strength in Greater China with 41% of our sales from outside that region. Our expanded product portfolio has allowed MPS to penetrate larger end customers as evidenced by our sales to our Top 25 end customers, all of which are over $1 million in annual revenue, which grew 45% year-over-year. We believe all of these activities have prepared the Company for excellent growth prospects once the worldwide economy recovers. In the manufacturing area, MPS saw the impact of dramatically reduced end market demand in the fourth quarter as our gross margin came in at 58% for the quarter. While we were able to drop our inventory dollars from the third quarter by $3.4 million, the tremendous fall off in end customer demand resulted in increased inventory reserves and lower capacity utilization. For the fiscal year, our gross margin was 62%. As business declined in the fourth quarter, we focused on improving working capital and as a result we increased cash, cash equivalents, short term restricted cash and investments by $21 million in the quarter to about $150 million as of December 31, 2008. On the expense side, our non-GAAP operating expenses were $14.3 million, down $2.5 million from the third quarter of 2008 as we moved rapidly to reduce variable spending. Now, let’s look at the financials in more detail. On the P&L, starting at the revenue line, fourth quarter 2008 net revenue of $34.7 million declined 10% from the fourth quarter of 2007 as a result of the dramatic fall off in worldwide demand. This is reflected in the 29% sequential decrease in revenue from the $48.9 million we had in Q3 ’08. For the fiscal year revenue was $150.5 million, up 20% from 2007 revenue $134 million. Let’s break out our fourth quarter and 2008 revenue by product line. DC to DC product sales were $27.3 million, up 8% from the $25.3 million reported in the year-ago quarter and down 20% from the third quarter of 2008. Year-over-year our DC to DC products grew from $86.7 million in 2007 to $115.4 million in 2008, an increase of 33%. The majority of this growth came in the communications segment, with products such as modems, routers, servers, and wireless LAN, flat panel TVs, set top box, and other consumer products such as digital video recorders and digital picture frame. As mentioned before, our new MiniMonster and battery charger products made significant contribution to the DC to DC growth in 2008. CCFL revenues for the fourth quarter were $5.2 million, a decrease of 46% from the same quarter a year ago and down 49% from the prior quarter. For the year, total CCFL revenues were $32.3 million, a decrease of 10% from the $35.7 million sold in 2007. Audio revenues for the fourth quarter came in at $2.2 million, down 37% from the $3.5 million recorded in the year ago quarter and down 50% from the third quarter of 2008. Fiscal 2008 revenue fro audio totaled $12.8 million, an increase of 11% from 2007. Looking at the gross margin line, our fourth quarter gross margin was 58% compared to 63.9% in the same quarter of 2007, and 52.8% in the prior quarter. Our base line margins were fairly consistent with prior quarters, but due to the decline in end demand, we increased our inventory reserves and had some capacity under utilization in our test facility. These two factors took about three to four percentage points off of our gross margin for Q4. For the year, our gross margin was 61.9%. Moving down and looking at reported expense and operating margin, our GAAP operating expenses were $17.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. This includes $17.3 million in R&D and SG&A expense, which includes $3.6 million for stock compensation expense and litigation expense of $594,000. Compared with the fourth quarter of 2007, GAAP operating expenses increased by $1.2 million. This amount is made of a decrease in litigation costs of $449,000, an increase in R&D spending of $1.8 million and a decrease in SG&A spending of $94,000. I would now like to review our non-GAAP operating expenses. Excluding stock compensation, our non-GAAP operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2008 were $14.3 million compared to $13.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2007, and down sequentially from the $16.8 million in the third quarter of 2008. The $2.5 million expense decrease from the prior quarter of 2008 was due to reduced spending across the board as MPS decreased its variable spending in the fourth quarter to compensate for reduced sales revenue. Our non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2008 was 17%, down 12 percentage points from Q4’07 and down 12 percentage points from the 29% recorded in the prior quarter. Our fourth quarter and 2008 GAAP net income was – for the fourth quarter GAAP net income was $3.2 million or a profit of $0.09 per fully diluted share. This compares to a profit of $9.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2007 or $0.26 per fully diluted share. In the third quarter of 2008 MPS recorded a net profit of $10.5 million or $0.29 per fully diluted share. For the fiscal year MPS earned $24.2 million or $0.67 per fully diluted share, compared with a profit of $11.6 million or $0.33 per fully diluted share in 2007. Net margin was 9% for the quarter and 15% for the year. Looking at the quarter and the year net income on a non-GAAP basis, for the fourth quarter of 2008 we had net income of $5.5 million or $0.16 per fully diluted share, which excludes stock compensation expense of $3.7 million and a related tax effect of $1.4 million and uses an estimated tax rate of 15%. In comparison, for the fourth quarter of 2007, the non-GAAP net income was $9.2 million or $0.26 per share, which excludes stock compensation expense of $3.2 million and an adjusted tax amount of $3.2 million. For the fiscal year on a non-GAAP basis, MPS earned $32.3 million or $0.90 per share. This compares to a non-GAAP net income of $25.7 million or $0.73 per share in 2007. Non-GAAP net margin was 15% for the quarter and 20% for the year. Now, I would like to discuss some of the major changes in the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents, current restricted cash, and investments were $150 million at the end of the fourth quarter and fiscal year, up from $129 million at the end of the third quarter of 2008 and up $32 million from the $180 million recorded a year ago. The increase in cash from September 30, 2008 came from operating cash flow of about $27 million, which includes an increase in working capital of $19 million. This was offset by capital expenditures of $1 million and the completion of the stock buyback program for $5 million, resulting in quarter-over-quarter cash growth of $21 million. Accounts receivable ended the fourth quarter at $9.1 million compared with $18.8 million at end of Q3 ’08, and up slightly from the $8.2 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2007. Collections were good for the quarter as our days sales outstanding finished at 24 days for Q4 2008 compared with 35 days at end of the third quarter of 2008 and 19 days at the end of 2007. Our inventories at the end of the quarter were $18.9 million or about 118 days of inventory. This compares with $22.3 million or 112 days of inventory at the end of the prior quarter. A year ago, at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, our inventories totaled $17.5 million or about 114 days of inventory. In our distribution channel, the dollars of inventory held by distributors at the end of the fourth quarter declined as well from the third quarter of 2008. We were able to manage our inventory – our internal inventories to a reasonable level this quarter despite the large demand swings. Going forward, we may manage our production cycles to both meet anticipated demand, but also take advantage of cost efficiencies in the supply chain. To conclude my portion of this call, I would like to discuss our outlook for the first quarter of 2009. Our revenue guidance for Q1 is in the range of $24 million to $29 million, reflecting the extreme drop in general worldwide demand and lack of visibility for the first quarter of the year. Gross margin is expected to be below the lower end of our target range of 60% to 63%. We expect stock based compensation expense in the range of $3.5 million to $3.8 million. We expect non-GAAP research and development and selling, general, and administrative expense in the range of $12.5 million to $13.5 million. This estimate excludes the stock compensation estimates mentioned above. And finally, we expect litigation expense in the range of $1.5 million to $2.0 million. I would now like to turn the call over to Michael for a discussion of general business conditions.
Michael Hsing: Thank you, Rick. In the first three quarters of 2008, MPS had good growth and excellent new product execution. We outgrew the industry and gained the market share. However, like other analog companies, our booking slowed dramatically in the fourth quarter, which was substantially different from our normal seasonality pattern. Typical seasonality will see the fourth quarter revenue flat or slightly lower than the third quarter. This is the first time we had almost a 30% revenue decline in one quarter. The outlook for 2009 is still very uncertain. Our customers are not giving us their usual forecast. Therefore, it is difficult for us to predict the revenue accurately. However, in comparison with the last November or December we do see some booking improvements especially after Chinese New Year, but the overall rate of the bookings is still erratic and below our expectations. MPS has always maintained a lean and adaptive culture. Our operation cost – our operating cost will reflects with the revenue growth and the profitability. Last November was an extraordinary fast business transition from good to bad. We were able to reduce both our inventory and the variable cost substantially. MPS remained profitable. Overall, we see the downturn as a business opportunity. Internally, we can strengthen our lean and a nimble culture and build a stronger team. Externally, like other – any other downturn, customers are more open to look at our innovative products. As a result, we are seeing more opportunity for our products. MPS history has proven that we are on the right track. We are continuing to stay on the course with our execution strategy, which is, one, continue to develop new innovative technologies and maintain our superiority. Two, diversify our new product portfolio to address many different markets. And three, expanding our global presence especially sales in North America and the Europe. I am optimistic about our future. As Rick mentioned, we had a stellar year in 2008 for product development. These new products have generated many new opportunities for MPS particularly we have had excellent customer feedbacks about the newly released fully integrated single chip high current DriverMOS family known as Gazela [ph]. This is the industry first 20 M DriverMOS that fits in a 5x5 millimeter package. And it enables our customers to reduce their size up to 60%. This product family is targeting network servers, graphics processors, and the notebook CPU market. In summary, with the breadth of new products released in 2008, I am confident that when the macro economic conditions stabilize MPS will resume its growth. Now, we’d like to open the microphone and take your questions.
Operator: (Operator instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Rick Schafer with Oppenheimer & Co. Please proceed.
Rick Schafer – Oppenheimer & Co.: Hey guys, I had a couple of questions for you following up I guess the first is just on – I know you – just a little more color maybe on eh order patterns you guys have seen since October. I know – Michael I know you have mentioned it’s gotten better this year but since Chinese New Year, could you give us an idea sort of the magnitude of the uptick in bookings or is – or what you’re trying to say is that bookings are just declining at a less bad rate or they are becoming less bad. I mean how do we think about your order patterns?
Michael Hsing: It is much less bad compared with November or December. The November-December is in a – particularly December is going backwards. And now in January and as I’ve said after Chinese New Year the orders go forward. We had a pretty good bookings Richard can talk about it, but still the booking rate is still very erratic, as I’ve said.
Rick Neely: Yes, Rick, as Michael said, this quarter, we started the quarter with a lower backlog than we ever had. At the same time, after Chinese New Year, we had better bookings, so if you balance the two out, it’s better, but it’s – I think I would use your characterization of it’s less bad, but it’s probably not good, but it’s less bad, so to speak.
Rick Schafer – Oppenheimer & Co.: Okay, so you usually give us number I mean can you give us an idea of the like sort of the level of turns you need to make let’s say the midpoint of the top line guidance.
Michael Hsing: Yes, we usually don’t give any details, but this is unprecedented and I think it’s – we should tell our shareholders lot more clear. We have currently about – the booking at the 90% our lower end – lower end of our guidance. But we – it’s very difficult to – for us to forecast what’s next week, because as I said very erratic.
Rick Schafer – Oppenheimer & Co.: Okay. That’s great and then – okay, so that’s great. And then just a second question. You’ve done a nice job cutting costs so far and kind of keeping up with the revenue declines, but I mean it seems like ’09 revs are probably tracking to little more than $100 million this year give or take I guess, which is similar to a couple of years ago. I guess what would you guys need to see to sort of take a harder look at cutting cost or how much could you really cut from here without jeopardizing future growth? Can – any kind of idea of magnitude or do you quantify that at all?
Rick Neely: Well, I’ll start off and then Mike will probably finish it. I mean as you can see from the decline in operating expense, we have a large variable component to our expenses, primarily bonuses. We have some obviously moves we took, we had a shutdown in December, that helped out. We have (inaudible) travel down like most people, but primarily it’s our bonuses and so what you see in Q1 if you look at our guidance, Rick, that reflects pretty much no bonuses. We operate in Silicon Valley unlike some other companies, I guess. We don’t make any money, we don’t pay any bonuses. So that’s what Q1 reflects. However, if business picks up we’ll – we will pay some bonuses if it picks up. If it doesn’t, we won't. So I don’t really know how to answer your question of trend. I can just tell you in quarter like Q1 where it looks like we will be marginally profitable we don’t pay any bonuses and that helps operating expenses. In terms of how long we would have to go to make any structural changes, Michael can probably speak to that.
Michael Hsing: I don’t – MPS, as I said, has always operated a very lean – we have a very lean culture. And – so our expenditures and most of it related to our sales commissions and also performance bonus is – will directly related to the profitability and the revenue growth. So in the first quarter of this year it’s automatic in it sets itself. And we don’t just – revenues – lower revenue, lower profit and low operation cost.
Rick Schafer – Oppenheimer & Co.: Okay. And then just one last question I guess on the P&L. Rick or Michael, do you guys anticipate a further inventory charge in the first quarter? I mean you said gross margin will be below the target range a little bit again. Can you give us an idea of the magnitude of how much below maybe and if it’s just – is it just reflecting under utilization or is it also – is there a further inventory charge coming?
Rick Neely: Yes, the inventory charge will depend on how demand looks for the future. The primary outlook right now is under utilization as – as you know our test here in Chengdu, most any test areas are very heavily fixed cost and a lot of the machines in there and depreciation. So, it doesn’t matter whether you run them or not, there is a certain amount of cost. And that’s reflected in the – the gross margin impact this quarter is primarily going to be from the model is primarily capacity utilization. We would expect that to turn around of course, as business picks up.
Operator: (Operator instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Doug Freedman with AmTech. Please proceed.
Doug Freedman – AmTech: Thanks guys. Thanks for taking my question. Looking at your results, DC to DC converters down 20%, really outperformed the LED business there, the – backlighting business. Can you talk a little bit about what contributed to sort of relative strength in DC to DC or are you seeing new wins that are starting to ship in sample volumes or is it just that the end market that that sells into weren’t down as much or there wasn’t as much inventory? What explanation can you offer?
Rick Neely: Well part of it, Doug is – as Michael talked on the new products – but part of it like we said, we generated 10 – over $10 million of new product revenue in 2008 from MiniMonsters and battery charges that was zero in the year before. So that helped contribute with those types of new products. Michael?
Michael Hsing: Yes, did you say – okay, I heard the – I guess I heard the wrong question. Was it declined?
Rick Neely: Well no, DC to DC was relatively better than backlight – 
Michael Hsing: Yes, okay, okay, I got that, okay. Yes, DC to DC, but as I said we released a lot of new products and we have – generated a lot of activity in last – second half of the last year. And we (inaudible) we expected this year will pick up the – some revenues, but this year we can't really foresee what will happen.
Rick Neely: Yes, I probably could answer maybe the next question someone will ask in advance later on, the decline in CCFL was more in relation to the notebook market really fell off the cliff. If you just see some of the other companies in the backlighting business or the GPU business, it’s – Q4 saw an extreme drop in demand. So that’s – it’s more of a demand drop on the CCFL side that caused that to go down so much.
Doug Freedman – AmTech: Great. Can you talk a little bit about sort of tracking your design wins and maybe a little bit more color on the relative value of the design wins that you’ve achieved in the last quarter?
Michael Hsing: In the last quarter, in the DriverMOS and obviously the new product that we beta tested in many customer place. And we had very good feedback. Our customers are excited about it and so we are continuing to work with them and try to get some design wins. That’s one area. The other area lower current levels, 4-5 amp current levels and we are designing into many different places and if I mention one of them it will be a small percentage. So I just mention one just for information. Again, the TV, okay, we continue to win design wins in the TV side set top box in Europe and among other industrial applications. So, every one of them are very – contributes to very small revenues.
Rick Neely: Yes, as you know, Doug, typically in our business and certainly for MPS, we don’t have any design wins that bring in $50 million or anything like that. We have a whole bunch of small ones that add up cumulatively. But we don’t have the kind of business where one or two design wins drive lots of revenue.
Doug Freedman – AmTech: Alright, terrific and I’ll jump back into queue. I have some more questions. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Wang with Wedbush Morgan. Please proceed.
Patrick Wang – Wedbush Morgan: Yes, hey guys. Thanks for the opportunity to ask questions here. First, hey, can you talk a little bit more about inventories here just I guess expectations is as if – if your channel inventory does get any leaner from this point, then also if you can give us I guess what finished goods and maybe quantify the reserves you guys took last quarter.
Michael Hsing: Yes, in a normal climate I’ve said it many times – I said many times before that our inventory level is not usually related to our future business and sometimes we strategically pile up more inventory than other. So this time in – our inventory in the channels are extremely low and we may or may not increase and depend on if we – - depend on our customers – our customers’ demand. So at this time it’s not clear.
Rick Neely: Yes, the in-channel – as we said we dropped inventory there, we dropped our own. In terms of the color of our inventory split, Patrick, we increased reserve right around $1 million, so $1 million of the drop is reserve related. The rest is actual decline. And it was declined in finished goods.
Patrick Wang – Wedbush Morgan: Okay. And also just to get some clarification, I guess, Mike, on your comment there so is it fair to say that a lot of the inventory burn in the channel is over with at this point?
Michael Hsing: Yes and they declined slightly from the last quarter and so – but we want to and we believe, always believe, we can manage inventory a lot better than our distributors. And so we still keep them lean and so at the same time we’ll try to find out what’s our customer demand.
Patrick Wang – Wedbush Morgan: Okay, got you. And as my follow-up here, I just want to ask you a little bit more about gross margins here. I know that I guess Richard said that was it – about three or four points was lower due to the inventory reserves and under utilization. If we think about Q1 gross margins here, and I know that you said that a lot of that’s due to under utilization here. Beyond that, if we were to back out the charges in Q4, we get to kind of like 61-ish gross margin. Is that the fair normalized level to think about for Q2 and beyond? 
Rick Neely: Yes, maybe I read it too quickly, but part of my script was that our base line gross margins remained about the same. So if you took what the – take away the extraordinary capacity or inventories we’d be 61-62 without those extraordinary situations.
Patrick Wang – Wedbush Morgan: Okay, perfect. Thanks so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Stoss with Craig-Hallum Capital. Please proceed.
Anthony Stoss – Craig-Hallum Capital: Hi guys, just wondering if you are – what you are hearing from your customers in terms of order push-outs model that you guys were expected to be in, also if you could comment on the network market, has there been any share changes? And also if, Michael, if you can give us a sense of how many new products do you might launch in 2009? Thanks.
Rick Neely: Okay, Tony, hi. I will start a little bit – the issues of the push-outs were a Q4 phenomenon that a lot of – when Michael said November, December what happened was all the orders that came in were matched by orders that got pushed out to the next quarter. So that was why the end of the year was bad for everybody in the business. We haven’t, after those push-outs there we haven’t seen as much of that this quarter. It sort of hit the bottom. But – so I don’t see any more of that right now. That was more a Q4 phenomenon. I will turn it over to Mike.
Michael Hsing: Anthony, last question is about a number of products that we are going to release and – it’s – the members of – it varies quite a bit. Last year we introduced like 70 products and so this year I don’t expect that number will be lower than that. And so as we increase our design engineering and the products I predict will be more.
Anthony Stoss – Craig-Hallum Capital: Okay, and then also if one of you guys could comment on where you stand share any changes at all that you can tell?
Michael Hsing: No there is a – I think that the worst time is around too fast and customer hasn’t really reacted that. And as far as we see we haven’t lost any socket.
Anthony Stoss – Craig-Hallum Capital: Okay, great, thanks guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vernon Essi, Needham and Company. Please proceed.
Vernon Essi – Needham & Company: Thanks for taking my question and I apologize for beating a dead horse here on gross margin gain, but I just want to ask a point of clarification. Rich are you saying you are not going to have any reserve charges in the first quarter.
Rick Neely: Well, no, I said I don’t know.
Vernon Essi – Needham & Company: You don’t know, I am sorry, okay.
Rick Neely: So, that’ why we guided where we did. So I – if you look at just the numbers, remember what we are doing – you just take the midpoint of our guidance, it’s about half of what we were doing six months. So obviously our factory, we can't downsize it by half. So, there is three or four points. About three points that hit the gross margins from that. There may or may not be any change in inventory reserves, I just don’t know. It’s a four month forward look for us and we do it. We’ll figure that out when we get to the end of the quarter.
Vernon Essi – Needham & Company: Okay, sure understand that. Thanks for clarifying. And I’ve heard your comments on this but how did pricing hold up and what’s your outlook on sort of how things are out there in terms of environment.
Rick Neely: Well, Michael will answer that one.
Michael Hsing: The pricing is continuously sliding down and sliding down faster but at the same time we introduced a lot of new products in the second half of last year and we see lot activities. So I can't really tell whether – which way our gross margin will go. I think that in the near quarters – near future, I don’t expect a large swing.
Vernon Essi – Needham & Company: Okay. So you mean you’ve always been pretty good at balancing that on the foundry side. So you are in a zone where you feel that’s not slipping faster on the pricing side versus your cost side, correct?
Michael Hsing: No, I said that that foundry side, of course, they are in a very empty too, so they really want like any other company want us to starting wafers and with a favorable cost, and the same times our customers also ask the price down. And so – but my point is that the new product that we’ve released in the last – second half of last year, usually will contribute the – to a favorable gross margins but in – during this times we can't really see whether – how, we can't really predict how fast our customer would adapt To the new solutions.
Vernon Essi – Needham & Company: Okay. And then just my last question here. If you were to rank your end target markets in 2009, trying to – if you can work through the noise level of an inventory rebuild, what would the – would you sort of say would be your top end markets going into the end of 2009 from a demand perspective? I mean I am trying to get a gauge here on your design activity. I mean where do you see the most robust dollar content opportunities right now?
Michael Hsing: Obviously – we can't increase our notebook content from a year ago from last year maybe a couple of dollars and get to $5-$6 and we keep increase the content in TV fro $3 or $4 to even more $6 to $7. And the (inaudible) area and we have a new DriverMOS product and we are expecting doing well and start to – start second half of this year’s or early next year. So, I don’t know if you – if I answered your question.
Rick Neely: I think Michael got them all. There is a couple of smaller ones, Vern, that we did well in this year. We had very good growth in set top boxes this year. We also had good growth in what we call our communications area, which is the modems, routers, servers, and switches. So those – I mean the communications area grew by about 40% some this year and set top box almost doubled this year. So again the dollars are smaller but I think they will keep contributing.
Vernon Essi – Needham & Company: Okay. That’s very helpful. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of` Sukhi Nagesh with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
Sukhi Nagesh – Deutsche Bank: Yes, hi, thanks for taking my question. Rick, just a couple housekeeping questions here. What does your – what do you expect the interest income and your tax expenses for the first quarter?
Rick Neely: The tax rate for the year we expect to be between 10% to 12% although that depends on profitability. If we don’t make any money, your tax rate will drop real bad. If – on interest income, unfortunately treasury rates are quite low and overall interest rates are low. So we would expect to probably decline. Even though our cash balances are larger the interest income percentage is lower. So we probably are right now looking at less interest income in ’09 than ’08.
Sukhi Nagesh – Deutsche Bank: Okay. That’s helpful. And then on the revenue segment for the first quarter if you were to rank the three segments that you usually give out, how would you rank them in terms of which one would be better than expected – better than the other segments.
Rick Neely: Well the – of the three segments, as you noticed even from this year where we grew DC to DC 32% and the Company average was 20%, almost all of our new products in the last few years and all of our technology expansion has been in the DC to DC area. It’s also the area which is a $6 billion market for power management. We have a long ways to go to continue to gain market share. Backlighting, which was our traditional market, that was the first market for the Company, is a smaller, more restricted market, and that’s flattened out and we didn’t expect much there. We expect most of the growth in DC to DC.
Sukhi Nagesh – Deutsche Bank: Got it. And then a follow-up to that. Are the margins in DC to DC better than CCFL? And how should that – how should the mix play out?
Rick Neely: It depends. The newer products tend to have better margins but older products, even an older DC to DC product; we tend to have margin compression. So, it’s more of a mix issue than not. As CCFL products tend to be older, their margins tend to be a little bit lower. And that’s another way to look at it.
Sukhi Nagesh – Deutsche Bank: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Gus Richard with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.
Gus Richard – Piper Jaffray: Yes, thanks for taking my question. Michael, can you characterize the designing activity that you are doing currently? Is it mostly for new products or is it more for cost reductions for existing products?
Michael Hsing: It’s not a cost – okay, actually we do both. And – but I have to correct my – correction to your question is that okay, it’s not a cost reduce and cost it’s – we increase the dollar content to replace our existing product. Our product especially in the DC to DC and our unit price will slightly increase and to cannibalize our older generation. The reason we can do that is because we need to bring in more components. The newer product, of course, and I am excited about the DriverMOS family and this opens up another market, which we don’t – we didn’t have before.
Gus Richard – Piper Jaffray: Okay and then Rick, just a couple of quick ones. Currently the order rate is very spotty. Is that just the fact that customers are ordering from just immediate need and you know even if they don’t kind of thing?
Rick Neely: I would say that’s correct. I mean what you saw obviously in January was quite because everybody was on vacation either in the U.S. or when we got back everyone went on vacation for Chinese New Year. So, yes, we’ve seen some more regularity in February, but again, it’s just a few weeks. So, I think given the situation of the ODMs and so forth I think they are ordering when a customer screams at them and they order from us. But it’s pretty much hand and mouth as far we can tell. That’s why it’s erratic.
Michael Hsing: Yes I – in a – just logically per se, the November the last – in November in December have a zero booking almost and net – and so they stop enough. They had to order something and I – but I can’t foresee whether they keep going up or it’s going to flat out or going down later. So I can't really predict that.
Gus Richard – Piper Jaffray: Okay, thanks so much.
Operator: (Operator instructions) Your next question comes from the line of` Tore Svanberg with Thomas Weisel Partners. Please proceed.
Tore Svanberg – Thomas Weisel Partners: Yes, thank you. First question, just coming back to the (inaudible) bookings I realize it’s erratic, but any area that’s relatively performing better than others at this point.
Michael Hsing: No, we have a pulling and some new products in – across the – or our across product family. And these are just spikes.
Tore Svanberg – Thomas Weisel Partners: Very good. And Michael on the 8698, which you just launched, seems like a pretty good product, and you mentioned graphic servers and notebook as a house for that product, but which of those three would you start to see the first revenue and when would you actually materialize the revenue?
Michael Hsing: This product is only for the – is the first product we released in a family, which is for the notebook application. We have other products for servers and graphics cards. So the revenue I expected will be from notebook first.
Tore Svanberg – Thomas Weisel Partners: Great. And lastly on the legal expenses, they continue to be quite lumpy, so how do we model – how should we model those expenses going forward.
Michael Hsing: It’s always very difficult and Tore you know and you have been with us for – cover us for many years. The legal expense is really controlled by the court and by our outside lawyers and I really can't – can't really give you a very accurate description and so – we just leave it like $1.5 million to $2 million in first quarter.
Tore Svanberg – Thomas Weisel Partners: Fair enough. And then just lastly on the gross margin and without the – an inventory – a potential inventory or non-inventory reserve this quarter, gross margin will still be up sequentially, right, Rick?
Rick Neely: Are you talking Q4?
Tore Svanberg – Thomas Weisel Partners: No, in Q1. So – 
Rick Neely: Q1, I mean the biggest issue in Q1, Tore is some under utilization capacity and we have our test facilities mostly in fixed cost, it’s mostly a building with a bunch of machines and so you’ve got that cost whether you run them or not. So, the biggest impact to gross margin this quarter is the – three or four points on the capacity side assuming we get back to a normalized run rate soon that will go back up.
Michael Hsing: Yes, we – Rick said it earlier, whether we were right of – keep further writing off inventory in Q1 or not, we haven’t really made it – make that decision yet. Because – we talk to our customers and try to find out what the demand will be. So – and depend on that and we will make a decision in which product will be right up and other ones are not. So still early, we don’t – we try very hard to find those information.
Tore Svanberg – Thomas Weisel Partners: Understood. Thank you very much.
Michael Hsing: Okay.
Operator: The next question comes form the line of Craig Hettenbach with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Ian – Goldman Sachs: Hi guys, this is Ian [ph] in for Craig. Can you talk a little bit about, I think Michael you made the comment that you are seeing more opportunity because of this dislocation. Can you talk a little bit about where that is either by channel or customer or product?
Michael Hsing: I think our business is 80% to 90% is (inaudible) own design. Our channels don’t do that design, okay, and is all MPS. It’s actually across the board. And from industrial application and set top boxes and even TV so we so lot more demand. And from the – particularly from – not, sorry, not demand, the design win – the designing activity and particularly from these – the product that we released in the second half of last year.
Rick Neely: Yes, just to add another comment that we had talked about in the call was that the as MPS as – in the last couple of years has broadened its product portfolio we can now – so we said – so we said on the call was that our growth in the Top 25 meaning the Top 25 end customers are all (inaudible) million dollars. We grew 45% year-over-year even though the – our Company average is 20. So, it just shows that we are starting to get these design opportunities at major accounts all – in parts of the world we haven’t been in before in all different kinds of segments. So I think that’s really what we wanted to emphasize.
Ian – Goldman Sachs: Okay, thanks. And then just Rick, with the cash moving up, can you tell us how you are thinking about buybacks and sources and uses of cash in 2009? Thanks.
Rick Neely: Well, we did one in last year, but this is the year where everyone – cash is king, so we are going to keep our $150 million this year till we see the light at the end of the tunnel so to speak. So we don’t have any plans to do that this year.
Ian – Goldman Sachs: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Question comes from the line of Dan Myers with Crosslink. Please proceed.
Dan Myers – Crosslink: Hey, Rick, just a housekeeping issue. You gave non-GAAP OpEx of $12.5 million to $13.5 million and then litigation of $1.5 million to $2 million.
Rick Neely: Correct.
Dan Myers – Crosslink: Is the litigation inside the OpEx?
Rick Neely: No, that’s additive. I mean the $12.5 to $13.5 million is your R&D, SG&A – 
Dan Myers – Crosslink: Okay, and so you don’t consider litigation as part of this – it’s – so we should look at a total of $14 million to $15.5 million?
Rick Neely: Right.
Michael Hsing: So, we – that’s a historical reason. We always listed in a separate format.
Rick Neely: My goal someday is to have it all combined in there, Dan. Someday I would like to do that.
Dan Myers – Crosslink: Well, you’d like that litigation to be zero someday.
Rick Neely: That’s exactly my point. You got it.
Dan Myers – Crosslink: Okay, perfect. Thank you very much. Good quarter.
Rick Neely: Okay.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Johnny Brown with Stephens Inc. Please proceed.
Johnny Brown – Stephens Inc.: Hey, Rick and Michael, thanks for taking my question. You mentioned that you are 90% booked to the low end of guidance currently. I was wondering if you’d be willing to give your lead times. I imagine they are pretty low right now. So where are those running currently?
Michael Hsing: It varies and the order that we got in the last few weeks or few days, are rush orders.
Rick Neely: Yes, so we are keeping – our lead times are very short. We have a lot of pretty much all the product are available if people want it. So that was Michael’s point. People are putting in rush orders because I think everybody in the channels didn’t order anything for three months. So they are finding shortages and you are starting to see that show up, but that causes the erratic nature of it. So, as we said, we booked and shipped – our booking and shipping to-date is over 90% low end but that’s where we put the guidance so that we would – in this environment be conservative in how we look at it.
Michael Hsing: I mean frankly, (inaudible) 24 to 29 is a very wide range. And how do we come up at 24, it’s not a very, very scientific estimate. It’s a – in a – so we can – we try to do a whole lot better that’s all we can do at this time.
Johnny Brown – Stephens Inc.: Okay, good job guys, thanks a lot.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh with ThinkEquity. Please proceed.
Vijay Rakesh – ThinkEquity: Yes, hi guys. I am just – you just said the litigation expense was kind of a wild card here. But as we look out for the year do you have any idea of – do you expect this to kind of flat for a couple of quarters. I know there is – I mean do we have a court date or do you expect that span two quarters?
Michael Hsing: The court days – the problem in my experience, the court days always change and so I – and it really then depends on the court days and so I can't really give you like which quarter is how much.
Vijay Rakesh – ThinkEquity: Okay. So conservatively kind of hold it steady for a couple of quarters is what I think?
Rick Neely: Yes, yes.
Michael Hsing: Yes.
Vijay Rakesh – ThinkEquity: And when you look at your product segments I know you said you had a couple of wins in TV on the CCFL side and TVs for the year, but most of the traction is on the DC to DC side. So for the year do you expect exiting the year kind of DC to DC kind of to be much higher like 75% to 80% of revenues and the audio should be significantly lower from where it is as a mix?
Michael Hsing: From – yes, from the past history, that’s the trend and we – majority of our product introduced in the last year is mostly are – these are DC to DC products. Yes, your assumption is correct.
Rick Neely: Yes, let me add, the majority of the audio revenue is in TVs and so it just kind of depends on how that market goes. If it goes better, it would go up, if it doesn’t it will go down.
Vijay Rakesh – ThinkEquity: Got it. And one last question here is obviously with the kind of the macro the top line is coming down a little bit, and pretty much in line with peers. But how can we get some leverage in the model. I know (inaudible) rate is coming down but the litigation is going up a little bit but where else do you have the – what levers do you have with the model to get some earnings leverage?
Rick Neely: Well the main thing we are doing we are controlling what we can. We made major steps in dropping our operating expenses. We dropped inventory, we improved our working capital. So we are doing all the right financial moves we can do. That’s a thing that affected everybody is if nobody is buying cars from Toyota or electronic products from Sony, we are not going to sell any chips either. So, the problem with the worldwide demand is affecting everybody. So what we – we can't affect the top line near term. That’s the situation. So we are trying and take a leverage where we can control it. We are keeping our costs lean and dropping off the excess, that’s what we can do.
Vijay Rakesh – ThinkEquity: Got it. Okay, great. Thanks a lot guys.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call over for closing remarks.
Michael Hsing: Well, thank you everybody.
Rick Neely: Thank you as well. We’ll see you next quarter.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today’s conference. This concludes our presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.

Operator:  Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the quarter three 2008 Monolithic Power Systems Inc. earnings conference call. My name is Ms. Allen, I will be your operator for today. (Operator instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Rick Neely, CFO and Mr. Michael Hsing, CEO. Please proceed sir.
Rick Neely: Good afternoon and welcome to the third quarter fiscal 2008 Monolithic Power Systems conference call. Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS, is with me on today's call. In the course of today's conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risks and uncertainties, for example, our business outlook including our business and financial outlook for the fourth quarter of 2008 projected fourth quarter revenues and gross margins, our expectations for fourth quarter litigations, stock-based compensation, and non-GAAP operating expenses, our target operating model range for gross margins and operating expenses, our fourth quarter projected business activity level, our projected average tax rate for 2008, our belief that MPS is well positioned for future growth, new product introductions, potential customer acceptance and the various opportunities these present including their impact on revenue growth rate, expected growth or declines in our product line, end market applications, geographic markets including opportunities in non greater China markets, and finally, inventory levels and projected changes in inventory levels. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts or guarantees of future performance or events and are based on current expectations, estimates, beliefs, assumptions, goals and objectives and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by these statements. Risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in our SEC filings including, but not limited to, our Form 10Q filed on July 31, 2008, which is accessible through our Web site, www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today's call. We will be discussing operating expense and net income on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude charges related to stock-based compensation, legal settlement, and a reversal of our lease write-offs that were recorded previously and the related tax effects. We will also discuss our expected non-GAAP research and development and selling, general, and administrative expense for the fourth quarter of 2008, which excluded our expected charges related to stock-based compensation. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to this release as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our Web site. I'd also like to remind you that today's conference call is being webcast live over the Internet and will be available for replay on our Web site for one year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. We would like to start this call by reviewing our third fiscal quarter 2008 business highlights. Following this update, I will discuss our operating results. We will conclude by discussing our expectations for the fourth fiscal quarter 2008. We will then open up the call to your questions. Let's start with the business highlights. MPS is pleased to report another all-time record sales quarter as we recorded revenues of $48.9 million, an increase of 22% over the third quarter of 2007 and up 18% sequentially. We have introduced a tremendous number of new products over the past 24 months expanding our footprint into market segments previously unserved. To illustrate the scope of our expansion, at the end of 2006, MPS offered 71 products across 11 product families. Now, as of the end of the third quarter of 2008, MPS is able to ship 151 products in 16 different product families, a more than doubling of our product footprint in the market. We are accelerating our growth particularly in the US and Europe, non-greater China revenues increased to 41% of MPS revenues year to date in comparison to 35% for the first nine months of 2007. We see a lot more opportunities in these new areas in the coming years. In the manufacturing area, we continued to operate in the upper end of our target model in the third quarter recording a gross margin of 62.8%. Our inventories dropped to 112 days in Q3. On the expense side, non-GAAP operating expenses were $16.8 million, down $1.8 million from the second quarter of 2008 when we incurred significant legal costs in patent litigations. Bottom line non-GAAP net income was a record $12.1 million or $0.33 per fully diluted share. Now, let’s look at the financials in more detail. On the profit and loss statement, third quarter 2008 net revenues of $48.9 million grew 22% in the third quarter of 2007 and were up sequentially 18% from the $41.5 million recorded in the prior quarter. Let me break down our third quarter revenue by product line. DC to DC product sales were $34.1 million up 33% from the $25.6 million recorded in the year-ago quarter and up $5.6 million or 20% from the second quarter of 2008. The majority of this growth came in the wireless communications storage set-top box, and general consumer markets. LCD backlight revenues for the third quarter were $10.3 million, a decrease of 6% from the same quarter a year ago but up 9% from the prior quarter. As we saw last quarter, MPS unit shipments for the notebook computer portion of this segment increased about 11% year over year but CCFL unit shipment into multimedia applications such as portable DVD players and digital picture frames declined significantly from the prior year. The net effect of these two trends along with normal ASP declines account for the flat revenue trend in our backlight business. Audio revenues came in at $4.4 million up 21% from the $3.7 million recorded in the year-ago quarter and up 28% from the second quarter of 2008. This result reflects our continuing success with several major consumer product customers in the LCD TV space. Let’s move down to the gross margin line. Our third quarter gross margin was 62.8% compared to 63.5% in the same quarter of 2007 and 53% in the prior quarter. We are very pleased with our abilities to manage our expanding production activities while maintaining strong cost controls despite the negative environment for higher factory cost and competition from lower price Asian companies. Looking at reported expenses and operating margin, our GAAP operating expenses were $20.1 million in the third quarter. This includes $19 million in R&D and SG&A expense which has a component of $3.3 million for stock compensation expense, and litigation expense of $1.1 million. Compared with the third quarter of 2007, GAAP operating expenses increased by $3.1 million, this amount is comprised of a decrease in litigation cost of $362,000, an increase in R&D spend of $1.9 million, an increase in SG&A spend of $1.5 million. Our GAAP operating margin was 22% in the third quarter up from 21% in the prior year. I would now like to review our non-GAAP operating expenses. Excluding stock compensation, our non-GAAP operating expenses for the third quarter of 2008 were $16.8 million compared to $13.9 million in the third quarter of 2007, and $18.6 million in the second quarter of 2008. The $1.8 million expense decrease from the second quarter of 2008 was primarily due to lower legal spending of our jury trial within our technology earlier this year. Non-GAAP R&D cost showed a sequential increase of $743, 000 as we continued our aggressive schedule of new product introduction and hiring. Sales, G&A spending grew by $680,000 primarily in the sales and marketing arena as we grew our field sales and application teams worldwide to sell our bounty of new products. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 28% which nearly matches our achievement of 29% in the year-ago quarter. On the net income basis, our GAAP net income for the third quarter was $10.5 million or $0.29 per fully diluted share, a new record for MPL. This compares favorably with the net income of $9 million recorded a year ago or $0.25 per fully diluted share. The third quarter non-GAAP net income on a non-GAAP basis, our Q3 ’08 net income was $12.1 million or $0.33 per share. This result is computed with a non-GAAP tax rate of 15%, our expected average tax rate for 2008. Compared to the prior year, MPS increased its non-GAAP net income by $2.4 million or 25% year over year. Finally, we bought back about $6.1 million of our stock in the third quarter as part of our authorized $25 million share repurchase plan. As of this conference call, we have now completed the share buyback program which retired 1.4 million shares at an average price of $17.31 since our buyback program started in the first quarter of this fiscal year. Now, let’s look at some of the major changes to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and investments were $128.8 million at the end of the third quarter up from $101.8 million at the end of the third quarter of 2007. In Q3 MPS had operating cash flow of about $3.4 million and stock issuances of $5.8 million. This was offset by capital spending of $1.1 million and a stock buyback of $6.1 million. Accounts receivable end of the third quarter were $18.8 million compared with $13 million at the end of Q2 ’08 and $12.8 million at the end of third quarter of 2007 reflecting the record revenues that MPS achieved. Days sales outstanding remained at normal levels for MPS coming in at 35 days for the third quarter of 2008, this is up somewhat from the 29 days recorded at the end of the prior quarter. Our inventories at the end of the third quarter were $22.3 million or about 112 days of inventory. This compares with $24.1 million or 143 days at the end of the prior quarter. Looking back, at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2007, our inventories totaled $15.8 million or about 98 days of inventory. As we expected in our last quarter conference call, our overall inventory position did return to normal ranges in the third quarter following a buildup in die banks in the prior quarter to position MPS for second half growth. Inventories in our distribution channel remained on the leader side as inventory ended up at the lower end of our target range of 30 to 45 days at the end of the quarter. I would now like to turn to a discussion of general business conditions. We saw record revenues for the third quarter of 2008, our seasonally best quarter. We continued to introduce new products and product families that are doing very well in applications and market segments we have not served before. Geographically in the first nine months of 2008, 59% of MPS sales were shipped to Taiwan and China and 41% to other regions. This compares favorably to the first nine months of 2007 when MPS had 65% of our sales in Taiwan and China. In addition to our strategy to improve our regional strength, MPS is becoming a new product machine as we mentioned at the beginning of this call. We have leveraged our design team in the past two years by using our cutting edge BCD plus process technology to create ever more innovative designs. Our line card [ph] has expanded significantly growing from 71 products at the end of 2006 to 89 by the second half of 2007 and all those 151 products available on our line card in the second half of 2008. We have also added three new product families this year all of which contain multiple new products. This allows MPS to call our larger customers who have always liked our technical performance but wanted a broader selection of power management products before committing to major programs with MPS. Now, our expanded range of products and product families has positioned MPS to be able to serve these larger customers. In the new product area, some of our new product families are ranged with the automotive segment and e-fuse [ph] for general application. We are introducing a new 15A DC to DC in the MiniMonster family and a series of the world’s smallest 12 volts 2A-4A synchronous box. Our MiniMonster product line produced record shipments in Q3 spread among the notebook, power, flat panel TV, printer, graphics gaming, and wireless communication segments. All of these efforts plus many more new products should help MPS maintain our above-average industry revenue growth rates in the future. While MPS has been doing well and we continue to deliver innovative products, we recognize that the last few weeks has seen a deterioration in general demand for electronic products as a result of the worldwide financial crisis and associated macroeconomic slowdown. With this in mind, we turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2008. Despite excellent execution, MPS is affected by the current economic crisis. For the fourth quarter of 2008, our normal seasonality in the consumer segment typically means that the fourth quarter is somewhat down sequentially from the third quarter. We have noticed some cancellations and delays in new projects. On the other hand we also see many of our new products starting to ramp up to volume production. Therefore, our Q4 revenue is very uncertain compared with prior years. Our Q4 revenue guidance is in a wider range of $39 million to $43 million. Gross margin is expected to be in the mid-to-upper end of our target range of 60% to 63%. We expect stock-based compensation expense in the range of $3.4 million to $3.8 million. We expect non-GAAP research and development and selling, general and administrative expense in the range of $15.2 million to $15.8 million. This estimate excludes the stock compensation expense estimates as mentioned above. Finally, we expect litigation expense in the range of $700,000 to $1 million. In conclusion, we are pleased to report that overall we are happy with our recent progress. MPS had a record third quarter. We grew faster than the overall analog market with 22% year-over-year revenue growth. More importantly, we became a more diversified company both in our current revenue stream and our product portfolio. We grew our US, Europe, Korea and Japan revenue and introduced record numbers of new products and product families. In these uncertain times, MPS is very well positioned for future growth; Now, we would like to open the microphone and take your questions.
Operator:  (Operator instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
Ryan Goodman – Merrill Lynch: Hi guys, this is Ryan Goodman for Srini. I just wanted to touch on the OpEx again, it looks like R&D has stepped up this quarter which I think we knew was going to happen with the new product developments and SG&A stepped up a bit too but given what we are seeing going on in the macro environment, I see you are now in kind of that top of that 14% to 16% range, how should we think about that going forward? It looks like it is flattening out a bit in Q4. Are you going to be operating more towards an absolute dollar target to keep the product developments going or is it possible you would have to pull that down maybe if the environment does not improve?
Rick Neely: Financially we are in good shape. This company is an engineering driven company, we expect to continue to develop a lot of products and put our muzzle behind the engineering which is what we are doing. At the same time, you have to sell the products, so sales and marketing will continue to grow. We are cognizant of the overall economic environment and we always control our expenses to that but as Michael will say, we’ll let him chip in, the typical answer is you find good R&D guys in the area.
Michael Hsing: We see huge opportunity both geographically or in the product market site. Geographically we see Europe, US and at Japan that we have a huge opportunity. Even at greater China we see we need other products to grow the revenue. So, we have a huge opportunity ahead of us. We don’t manage these numbers quarter by quarter, everything what we do effect two years later. So, our future is bright, we keep the investment.
Ryan Goodman – Merrill Lynch: Okay and then just a follow-up kind of on a different topic, just with the CCFL space, I know you have been talking for some time now, now that that two (inaudible) drivers are going to be primarily in the desktop monitor space, we are getting close I just wanted to touch on that, have you really made any progress in that space so far, I know you have kind of been in the product development area and you had a product coming up, are you getting any revenue from that yet and just how is that looking for early ’09?
Michael Hsing: Yes, we do. We haven’t really broke out that number yet but we see a very good shipment in the LCD monitor now.
Ryan Goodman – Merrill Lynch: Okay, guys, thanks a lot.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rick Schafer with Oppenheimer. Please proceed.
Rick Schafer – Oppenheimer: Hi guys, got a couple of questions. I guess the first is, I guess you just talked about sort of the impact on the current market conditions on your outlook, I am curious how much impact you guys are seeing on the ramp of some of your new design wins, especially some of your higher current, higher volt stuff in the DC to DC side of the business?
Michael Hsing: We at this time like any other company particularly in MPS because we are in the ramping stage and our customers will not give us a very clear picture. For them, they do not know either. For what I am saying is we design it in, we are ready to have a good shipment, a good steep ramp and we don’t know now. That is the reason why we give a wider than normal guidance.
Rick Schafer – Oppenheimer: Okay but it sounded like the turns number was pretty comparable to past quarters I guess, is that fair to say Rick or Mike?
Rick Neely: Actually, the problem with this quarter is we don’t think it is going to behave like historical patterns. The bookings are pretty good but the turns are the concern because everything seems to be slowing down. So, there is nothing wrong with the backlog but we do rely as usual on a good amount of turns and we are just not sure what is going to happen later in the quarter.
Rick Schafer – Oppenheimer: Okay and then second question Rick, we know you are fabless, what kind of gross margin impact are we likely to see, let’s say (inaudible) let’s say worst case flattish type revenue growth next year for you guys, what kind of impact would that have on your gross margins?
Rick Neely: As you said, the advantage of being a fabless company is that it does not really impact us. Our facility in Chengdu does tests only and doesn’t have that much of an impact one way or the other. So, it is really down to pricing and product mix not capacity.
Rick Schafer – Oppenheimer: Then just part of that question, if you look at your OpEx line, I know you maybe touched on that earlier question, how much control – if we assumed a flattish type revenue environment next year, how much control do you guys have over OpEx and would you be able to just sort of keep that in line with your top line growth rate or how realistic would that be?
Michael Hsing: First of all I don’t think we should react to anything now. As I said earlier, our near future is uncertain and we have huge design wins across the entire spectrum of the analog power management market and so we expect to ramp, but given the current conditions, we are concerned, we will react very quickly as always MPS is but we don’t do anything now.
Rick Neely: Yes, I think Michael has a good point, the part just like many companies, we pay healthy bonuses and we have sales commissions, those are the variable parts that change when revenue changes. So obviously those would vary. That tends to happen and that is a part that is built into our expense structure so that will vary the rest of it as I said we don’t need to jump right now. I think Michael has made a good point.
Rick Schafer – Oppenheimer: Okay, thanks guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
Ross Seymore – Deutsche Bank: Hi guys. Can you give any granularity into the assumption on our guidance, you talked a little bit about the backlog being good but the bookings being weak, are you kind of assuming that the high end of your range assumes something that continues on what you are seeing now on bookings or gets worse, so any granularity on that would be helpful.
Rick Neely: Yes, you are asking your own question Ross. These are the wider range if things go pretty good, it could be the higher end if things go worse, it could be the lower end. That’s kind of how to go about it.
Michael Hsing: We are going in the quarter, it felt like a normal quarter then the world turned upside down. We talked to – I was in Asia, I came back on Sunday and I was in that part of the world, I talked to our customers, our sales guys and their input is as certain as our financial world. One day 1000 points up and the other day 1000 points down but our pocket is not as bad as that.
Ross Seymore – Deutsche Bank: So, I guess the high end of your revenue range assumes business condition stay the same as what you have seen in kind of the last three weeks, is that what you are saying, in the low as if they continue to worsen?
Michael Hsing: Yes, we won’t put it (inaudible) and frankly okay, we can’t tell in a very clear way which customer project pushed out. We see porting too. So, all new products ramp that is where the uncertainty is on.
Ross Seymore – Deutsche Bank: I guess one final quick one, what do you think your channel inventory did quarter over quarter and what do you expect it to do given your guidance?
Rick Neely: I know it is buried probably somewhere in the call Ross but again, our distributors at the lower end at the 30-day to 45-day target, they are at the lower end of that, low 30s. So our distributor channels leaned and as you can see our own inventories dropped where we wanted them to be, so we have kept our inventories where we want them, we kept the channel inventories lean. So, basically, what you are seeing in our results Q3 and Q4 is simply in demand. We pretty much reflect that now because our channel inventories are lean, Q3 people built a lot of products in Q4 they look like they are building less and that is pretty much what you are seeing. It’s now inventory is lean, our projecting inventory is Q4 will be in the same level. So, you are pretty much watching end demand happen is what we see.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Wang with Wedbush Morgan Securities. Please proceed.
Patrick Wang – Wedbush Morgan Securities:  Hi guys. Nice numbers by the way for the third quarter. Just wanted to talk real quick on cancellations and delays you guys talked about, I was just hoping you guys could maybe kind of help quantify kind of what you are seeing out there just in terms of cancellations and pull-ins also what kind of parts that the movement with orders are involved with, is it DC to DC if it is particularly in monitors, what is happening there?
Michael Hsing: Your voice is very low. I believe your question is you wanted more color on the uncertainty, right?
Rick Neely: And if you see any cancellations, what are they and –
Patrick Wang – Wedbush Morgan Securities: Moving parts –
Michael Hsing: Yes, okay. Cancellations are more related to the consumer side. Some new projects and particularly in new projects we expected to ramp and didn’t happen. So, we got a feedback from our customers that the projects are delayed or they have some inventory issues but on the other hand, we see the other projects did ramp up as we expected.
Patrick Wang – Wedbush Morgan Securities: Okay, in terms of the pull-ins, was there a particular type of product, particular end market that was getting pulled in or was it pretty mixture?
Michael Hsing: Across the board some of them end consumer, other ones are in the industrial type of applications.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg with Thomas Weisel Partners. Please proceed.
Tore Svanberg – Thomas Weisel Partners: Yes, thank you a couple of questions. First of all, you now have more than 150 products in the product family, so could you talk a little bit about the percentage of those products that are contributing to revenue today and what is behind the question is obviously trying to understand how far you are in this pretty impressive ramp in the products that you have?
Rick Neely: Yes I will start with – on the numbers wise, some of the new product families we just introduced this year and therefore there is very little revenue today. That is typical of the three new product families like the USB protection devices and things like that and power over Ethernet controllers they are just entered the market. But some of the ones we have introduced in the last year, MiniMonsters had record sales and that is again up to the point and not quite 10% of the revenues but it is a good number. Battery chargers are getting up to good numbers as well. So we are continuing to see those but what we are really talking about in the call was this year we have introduced a whole bunch more products and therefore you typically get almost just sample revenues in your first year. So, that’s not going to leveraged next year for most of the new product families, but the ones we introduced last year, the MiniMonsters and battery chargers are really starting to have good contributions.
Tore Svanberg – Thomas Weisel Partners: So, is it safe to say that not even half of the 151 products are contributing revenues at this point?
Rick Neely: This year, if you do the math, we introduced about 60 some this year.
Michael Hsing: We don’t actually have a clear breakdown now.
Rick Neely: Most of them would not be.
Michael Hsing: It is okay. Most of them – we don’t have the data now but somewhere in the company we do have it. We can talk to you after the conference call.
Rick Neely: But typically if we introduce things in Q1 we might be in a little revenue things introduced in the last six months, no, you just don’t technically. You don’t get the production volumes that quickly.
Michael Hsing: Usually all the new products will have any meaningful revenue about 12 to 18 months later.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vernon Essi with Needham & Company. Please proceed.
Vernon Essi – Needham & Company: Thank you. You guys are not going to escape this without me asking about audio. Very solid performance there and we attribute that delta to the television market to the most part.
Michael Hsing: Yes. You know it is not my favorite topic.
Vernon Essi – Needham & Company: No, I am waiting for you to take effect in the DC to DC so we don’t have to talk about it anymore.
Michael Hsing: Yes, the audio, there are no changes in its story. It is the lowest margin across our product family. So, and also it is concentrated in the TV market and some other applications too but mostly TV. So, that is not what we want to be, we want to diversify.
Vernon Essi – Needham & Company: Sure. I understand it is sort of a Trojan horse question here but on that market did you see the same sort of growth delta in the DC to DC side for televisions?
Michael Hsing: DC to DC yes. I think DC to DC side we have a more diverse and a lot more sockets depending on the customers and depending on the TV design and so we shipped different products to different customers. For the audio side, it is very simple there are a couple of products for the entire need. So, it is very concentrated and that is not what we want to be.
Rick Neely: You are right Vernon some of the DC growth TVs, flat panel TVs are a good market for our chips and they grew in Q3.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Gus Richard from Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.
Gus Richard – Piper Jaffray: Thanks for taking my question. Just on the balance sheet that it is still low but the accounts receivables have popped up a bit in terms of days and I was wondering if there was any particular explanation for that.
Rick Neely: No, I answered your question. It did up pop up, our shipping patterns are a little bit different than normal. That was all – it’s really just the timing, we’ve already collected most of the cash, so it is just a timing issue, it will straighten itself out next quarter.
Gus Richard – Piper Jaffray: Okay, got it. Then, you have already touched on a couple of new products, how is it the traction in the new high performance LDLs going? Are you guys getting some design momentum there?
Michael Hsing: Yes, we are ramping up but the number is too small but the ramp rate, we really like that. Few customers have accepted the product and they have proven, they are successful and we will have more products in that area.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Ian Yen – Goldman Sachs: Hi guys, this is Ian Yen [ph] for Craig. Just a question on order strength by end market, did you happen to notice any differences in the order patterns, say LCD TV stronger than consumers, stronger than set top or was the weakness all pretty much the same?
Michael Hsing: Yes, until a few weeks ago everything to us looked normal and I talked to our customers and everything is like our financial market, crashed.
Rick Neely: It is a little bit like this, I don’t think there is any sector that is unaffected, the industrial, etc. everything consumer seems to be down. I mean, there are other companies that reported before us that have a much higher industrial component have seen the same thing. So, I think it is a general contraction, there is not any one market that is doing well, actually.
Ian Yen – Goldman Sachs: Okay, similarly looking forward, I guess by your real product families are you expecting them all to be sort of be around the average or do you anticipate a divergence of maybe one of those (inaudible) or you DC to DC converters?
Michael Hsing: The divergence, we have a different product family. In Rick’s script we said we introduced a few product families, these are the things we didn’t have before, like the easy-to-use electronic fuse and that is a big opportunity for us as a general application. Lot of products needs that, we just replace the electronic fuse – we replace the mechanical fuse. So, that is only an example but we have other products, high voltage products, automotives and other things the LDLs and we do a lot of things now.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Freedman from American Technology Research. Please proceed.
Doug Freedman – American Technology Research:  Hi guys, thanks for taking my question, hopefully it is not something that has been asked. I am jumping on different conference calls here. Can you talk a little bit about your fab transfer activities? I know you presently over rode [ph] ASMC and have plans to add a second one, how is that progressing?
Michael Hsing: Yes, they are progressing well. Our customers qualify them and the volume is still in the ramping period.
Doug Freedman – American Technology Research: Rick, can you give us any color that it may or may not have on the gross margins or the structure of the business?
Rick Neely: I don’t think there will be changes one way or the other. What it does is spread our risk which is good. We will have two sources. Again we are putting that, the easiest thing to do at a new fab is put newer products so you qualify the new customer on a new fab and you don’t have to requalify old guys. So, that’s why it is ramping. It is putting new things into the 8 inch, so we are very good at getting competitive prices any way so I don’t think it will impact our margins. It just gives us a better risk profile and choices between suppliers.
Operator: (Operator instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Wang from Wedbush Morgan Securities. Please proceed.
Patrick Wang – Wedbush Morgan Securities:  Just a quick follow-up here. First one, in the third quarter it looks like your revenues in China had slowed down a bit, anything going on there?
Rick Neely: You are talking about the –
Patrick Wang – Wedbush Morgan Securities: Just the geographic distribution there, I saw that Korea had grown nicely, Taiwan grew nicely, a lot of points grew nicely China actually declined just slightly.
Rick Neely: As you know, China represents where the product are built. So, tracing back as we talked about in the call, we are really happy with our results in Japan, Korea, Europe and US and so China is really a matter of mix with some projects we used to be in, we don’t have any more, we talked about some of the consumer devices that were not in any more. At the same time we are gaining a lot of meat projects in Japan, Korea and the US. So, that’s been the mix, a lot of the consumer devices that we were hot last year, remember we were talking about digital picture frame, that’s a big decrease this year and things like that.
Patrick Wang – Wedbush Morgan Securities: Okay, and then on the inventory side, I saw that (inaudible) came down a bit here. What do you think inventory does just in terms of your balance sheet next quarter here?
Rick Neely: I don’t want to spend a lot of time forecasting inventory. We talked last quarter where we want to operate, we want to operate about where we are, is about where we want to be.
Michael Hsing: The company will react skillfully but I don’t really think wherever we need to build, we build it. The company has a lot of cash and also the product has a very long life cycle. So, depending on any given period of time and depending on our customers and depending on our product ramp, we will stop the inventory but we don’t use that as our measurement.
Rick Neely: We typically want to keep things on die form. The other thing which we found is it is better for us to keep our distributors at a lean amount that keeps our finger on the demand. So, we will keep the distributors at the lower end of the ranges and we will keep the inventory ourselves. We are going to stick with that strategy, it seems to be working.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Smigie of Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Please proceed.
Steven Smigie – Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Typically your Q1 is down about 10% to 15% sequentially, do you think that normal seasonality plays out or do you think given the decline, is it a model for Q4 that will probably be less than that?
Michael Hsing: At this time, no. I really can’t tell you that. If you asked me the same question last year this time, I would have said we believe it will be normal Q1 and our revenue patterns follow the seasonality, but this year I really don’t know.
Steven Smigie – Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: I think you guys said you have included your buybacks, would you start another one?
Michael Hsing: At this time though, we are still studying it, we don’t have any plans yet.
Operator: At this time, there are no additional questions in queue. I would now like to turn the call over to Rick Neely, CFO for any closing remarks.
Rick Neely: Alright. Thank you for listening into our third quarter call and we look forward to chatting with you next year when we cover the fiscal year. Thanks a lot.
Operator:  Thank you for your participation in today’s conference. This concludes the presentation. Good day.

Operator: Welcome to the second quarter 2008 Monolithic Power Systems Inc. earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Rick Neely, Chief Financial Officer of MPS.
Rick Neely: Welcome to the second quarter fiscal 2008 Monolithic Power Systems conference call. Michael Hsing, CEO and founder of MPS, is with me on today's call.  In the course of today's conference call, we will make forwardlooking statements and projections that involve risks and uncertainties. For example, our business outlook including our business and financial outlook for the third quarter of 2008 projected third quarter revenues and gross margins; our expectations for third quarter litigation, stockbased compensation, and nonGAAP operating expenses; our target operating model range for gross margins and operating expenses; our third quarter projected bookings; our projected average tax rate for 2008; our feeling that MPS is well positioned for future growth; land and new product introductions; potential customer acceptance and the various opportunities these present; expected growth or declines in our product line; inmarket applications and geographic markets; and, finally, inventory levels and projected changes in inventory levels.  Forwardlooking statements are not historical facts or guarantees of future performance or events and are based on current expectations, estimates, beliefs, assumptions, goals and objectives and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by these statements.  Risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in our SEC filings, including, but are not limited to, our 2007 form 10K/A filed or March 12, 2008, which is accessible through our website, www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today's call.  We will be discussing operating expense and net income on both a GAAP and a nonGAAP basis. These nonGAAP financial measures exclude charges related to stockbased compensation, legal settlement, and provision costs and their related tax effects. We will also discuss our expected nonGAAP research and development and selling, general, and administrative expense for the third quarter of 2008, which excludes our expected charges related to stockbased compensation.  A table that outlines the differences between the nonGAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to this release as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our website.  I'd also like to remind you that today's conference call is being webcast live over the internet and will be available for replay on our website for one year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today.  We would like to start this call by reviewing our second fiscal quarter 2008 business highlights. Following this update, I will discuss our operating results. We will conclude by discussing our expectations for the third fiscal quarter of 2008. We will then open up the call to your questions. Let's start with the business highlights. MPS is pleased to report our best sales quarter ever as we recorded revenues of $41.5 million, an increase of 35% over the second quarter of 2007 and above our guidance for the quarter. We have talked extensively about our many new product introductions over the past 1824 months, and these efforts are clearly bearing fruit. Our new highcurrent, highvoltage MiniMonsters product family and our new battery charger product family continue to grow nicely for early stage products.  We are also seeing steady growth in our core DC to DC products, and expansion into a variety of markets such as set-top boxes, and new products requiring greater than 40 volts operating rating. These products are typically used in printers, automotive, and industrial applications. Regionally, we continue to make very good progress in growing our revenues outside of greater China. In the manufacturing area, we met our expectations, maintaining our gross margin in the upper end of our target model for the second quarter, recording a gross margin of 63%. On the expense side, nonGAAP operating expenses were $18.6 million, up from the first quarter of 2008 as we incurred significant legal costs in our litigation with Linear Technology. We also saw heavy new product introduction expenses that increased our R&D spending. Bottom line, nonGAAP net income was $7.1 million or $0.20 per share. Now let's look at the financials in more detail. Looking at the P&L, on the revenue line, second quarter 2008 net revenues of $41.5 million grew 35% from the second quarter of 2007 and were up sequentially by 17% from the $35.4 million recorded in the prior quarter. Let me break down our second quarter revenue by product line.  DC to DC product sales were $28.6 million, up 50% from the $19.1 million recorded in the year ago quarter and up $3.1 million or 12% from the first quarter of 2008. The majority of this growth came in the flat panel TV, communications, set-top box, and general consumer markets.  We continue to see increasing sales volumes in our new MiniMonster and battery charger products, as we mentioned before. LCD backlight revenues for the second quarter were $9.5 million, an increase of 5% from the same quarter a year ago and up 31% from the prior quarter. Drilling down into this market segment, MPS saw its unit shipments for the notebook portion increase 35% yearoveryear.  But also saw its CCFL unit shipments into the multimedia applications, such as portable DVD players and digital picture frames, decline by almost 70% from the prior year. The net effect of these two trends, along with normal ASP declines, account for the lowerthanaverage annual revenue growth in our backlight business. Audio revenues came in at $3.4 million, up 26% from the $2.7 million recorded in the year ago quarter and up 25% from the first quarter of 2008. This product area is growing due to our continued success with several major consumer product customers in the LCD TV space. Let's move down to the gross margin line. Our second quarter gross margin was 63.0% compared to 63.5% in the same quarter of 2007 and 63.2% in the prior quarter. We are very pleased with our execution in managing our production processes and maintaining strong cost control in spite of the negative environment for higher production costs and lower price Asian competitors. If you look at our GAAP operating expenses, they were $21.8 million in the second quarter. This includes $17.5 million in R&D and SG&A expense, which includes $3.2 million for stock compensation expense under FAS 123R accounting rule and litigation expense of $4.3 million. Compared with the second quarter of 2007, GAAP operating expenses decreased by $5.1 million.  This amount comprises an increase in litigation costs of $266,000; a decrease in litigation settlement costs of $9.8 million; an increase in R&D spending of $2.2 million; an increase in SG&A spending of $1.8 million; and, finally, we had a onetime lease credit in Q2 2007 that did not reoccur in 2008. And that had a net effect of increasing expenses by $496,000. Our GAAP operating margin was 10% in the second quarter, up significantly from the negative 24% in the prior year.  I would now like to review our nonGAAP operating expenses. Excluding stock compensation, our nonGAAP operating expenses for the second quarter of 2008 were $18.6 million, compared to $15.2 million in the second quarter of 2007 and $14.3 million in the first quarter of 2008.  The $4.3 million expense increase from the first quarter of 2008 was primarily due to our jury trial with Linear Technology in June. Based on the court's ruling that MPS did not breach the 2005 settlement agreement, MPS has the right to seek recovery of its legal fees.  NonGAAP R&D costs showed a sequential increase of $841,000. As we continued an aggressive schedule of new product introduction and hiring, SG&A spending declined by $100,000 as onetime charges for changes in our distribution channel did not reoccur. Our nonGAAP operating margin was 18.5%; but if you exclude legal expense, we had a 29% nonGAAP operating margin. Looking to the bottom line for Q2, our GAAP net income for the second quarter was $4.6 million or $0.13 per fully diluted share. This compares quite favorably with the GAAP loss of $6.4 million recorded a year ago, which was heavily impacted by a onetime legal settlement of $9.8 million. Our nonGAAP net income in the second quarter on a nonGAAP basis, our Q2 net income was $7.1 million or $0.20 per share. This result is computed with a nonGAAP tax rate of 15%, our expected average tax rate for 2008.  Compared to the prior year, and excluding both stock compensation and the onetime settlement, MPS increased its nonGAAP net income by $2.9 million or 69% yearoveryear. Finally, we bought back about $4.4 million of our stock in the second quarter as part of our authorized $25 million share repurchase plan. We have now purchased a cumulative total of $13.9 million or approximately 775,000 shares at an average price of $17.97 since our buyback program started in the first quarter of this fiscal year. Now let's look at some of the major changes to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash in investments, were $126.8 million at the end of the second quarter of 2008, up from $92.3 million at the end of the second quarter of 2007 and up $11.2 million from the $115.6 million recorded at the end of Q1 2008. In Q2, MPS had operating cash flow of about $10.4 million and stock option exercises of $6.6 million. This was offset by capital spending of $1.2 million and the stock buyback of $4.4 million. Accounts receivable ended the second quarter at $13 million, compared with $11.3 million at the end of Q1 2008 and $8 million at the end of the second quarter of 2007. Day’s sales outstanding, or DSO, remained at normal levels for MPS coming in at 29 days for the second quarter of 2008. This is flat to the 29 days recorded at the end of the prior quarter. Our inventories at the end of the second quarter were $24.1 million or about 143 days of inventory. This compares with $16.4 million or 114 days of inventory at the end of the prior quarter. Looking back at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2007, our inventories totaled $11.9 million or about 96 days of inventory. All of the inventory increase from the first quarter of 2008 was in the die and work-in-process segments. Our finished goods inventory actually declined from Q1 2008 and dropped almost $2 million from the end of December 2007.  Our distribution channel also declined as our days of inventory ended up below our target range of 3045 days at the end of the quarter. Therefore, in order to service our anticipated increased second half demand, MPS will utilize more of our internal inventory stocks. We anticipate that our inventory days will decline to about 100120 days by the end of 2008. I would now like to turn to a discussion of general business conditions. We saw excellent revenue growth in the second quarter of 2008, achieving record sales for MPS. Our new product families are doing very well in design and market segments we have not served before, and we are pleased with their early revenue contributions as a result.  Geographically, in the first half of 2008, 59% of MPS sales were shipped to Taiwan and China and 41% to other regions. This compares favorably to the first half of 2007 when MPS had 66 percent of our sales in greater China. In addition to our strategy to improve our regional strength, MPS is seeing broad gains in a variety of diverse market segments, what we would like to call the singledigit percentage success model.  This reference to single digits is the fact that many of our innovative, highly integrated parts can be used in a whole host of inmarket applications. No one application is huge, but the cumulative effect of getting two or three or five percent of our sales in a wide variety of segments is part of the fuel behind our extraordinary sales growth record.  For example, we have grown our revenues in the set-top box end market by a factor of four times from Q2 2007. And we now have about five or six percent of our total sales in these products. Our fully integrated synchronous buck converters provide ideal price and performance for this application. This is just one example of the power of a single-digit market model. MPS in general has a very broad market and end application coverage, providing both multiple opportunities for growth but also some buffers should any one segment suffer from poor market dynamics. In the new product area, we are introducing a new series of highly integrated, very cost effective CCFL controllers from the monitor segment. These products should see production revenues in 2009. Our new 40volt DC to DC converters are being used in laser printers, car accessories, and industrial applications like utility meters. All of these efforts, plus many more new products, should help MPS maintain our well above industry average revenue growth rates in the future. Now, turning to our outlook for the third quarter of 2008. Our revenue guidance is in the range of $46 million to $49 million, reflecting growing demand for our products in the third quarter of the year. Gross margin is expected to be in the mid to upper end of our target range of 6063%. We expect stockbased compensation expense in the range of $3.2 million to $3.6 million. We expect nonGAAP research and development and selling, general and administrative expense in the range of $15 million to $16 million. This estimate excludes the stock compensation estimates mentioned above. Finally, we expect litigation expense in the range of $1.4 million to $1.8 million.  In conclusion, we are pleased to report that MPS had an excellent second quarter. We grew much faster than the overall analog market with 35% yearoveryear revenue growth. Once again, MPS is proving that its key initiatives of (1) continuing to introduce new, highperformance power management products at a faster rate and (2) continuing to expand both our global market presence and multiple inmarket applications is the right strategy for success. MPS feels very well positioned for future growth. Now we would like to open the microphones and take your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Tore Svanberg - Thomas Weisel Partners.
Tore Svanberg Thomas Weisel Partners: First of all, on your guidance and the range there, can you just talk a little about some of the moving parts, what gets you to the lower end, what maybe gets you to the higher end of that range, please.
Rick Neely: Which parts of the guidance?
Tore Svanberg Thomas Weisel Partners: Sorry, the revenue.
Rick Neely: In general, Q3 is our strongest quarter. Everything tends to go up in Q3. That's generally how it works. Michael, I don't know if you have any more to add.
Michael Hsing: We don't have any in the low end or the high end, they all generally move up. All our new products are doing extremely well so that contributes part of it.
Tore Svanberg Thomas Weisel Partners : Can you also talk a little bit about visibility? What are some of your customers telling you about current demand?
Michael Hsing: Customer current demand is all across the board. We see other companies saying the consumer business weak, and we see it very strong. Again, we're a small company relative to others; there's a lot of opportunity for MPS.
Rick Neely : I would say when you look at our bookings for Q3, we feel our bookings are good and will support our guidance for Q3. That's what we see in near term. We can't comment on other companies' situations, but that's what we see.
Tore Svanberg Thomas Weisel: Also on the litigation with Linear Technology, can you just elaborate a little bit more on what we should now expect going forward? Both as far as maybe getting some moneys back, but maybe more important, just on your own competitive positioning in the marketplace.
Michael Hsing: We will continue to develop our products, so this lawsuit is not really into the future product, it's in the past, the product we never shipped. We shipped less than $100.
Tore Svanberg Thomas Weisel: I guess what I am getting to is were you blocked with those products and now you can actually go and win some of those sockets. I guess that's what I am getting to.
Michael Hsing: The product actually would never ship any meaningful amount. So those products, we never intend to sell those products.
Tore Svanberg Thomas Weisel: And then how about recouping some of the legal expenses?
Rick Neely: On the contract side, our judge's ruling allows us the right to ask for our legal fees; and we definitely intend to ask for our legal fees back. The case actually has not concluded yet. The reason is there's a little bit of spending in Q3 is there's a third section of the case that the judge is going to be hearing later on this fall; and, at that point, he'll issue his final ruling. But the judge has already ruled on the contract side that we did not breach the agreement, and the agreement has a clear clause in there that the loser has to pay the other's legal fees. That's what it says.
Operator: Your next question comes from Craig Hettenbach - Goldman Sachs.
Craig Hettenbach Goldman Sachs: Rick, on the gross margin front, with guidance of mid to upper end of the range, can you just talk looking out over the next year or so at some point ways that gross margins might settle out or, more importantly, how you've been able to keep the gross margins at that upper end of the range.
Rick Neely: As we said, our guidance actually on gross margin is the same as it's been for probably the last two or three quarters, mid to upper end. In the past year or two, we've been a little bit over the upper end of our range. And we've always said we felt glad, lucky, and happy to be there. Again we expected to grow the company. We expect to maintain our revenue growth in the 25% range by doing the kind of gross margins we're doing. Right now, we're still operating at a good level, mid to upper end.  The factors that come in play are, on the downside, there's lowerpriced Asian competitors. On the upside, our regional growth into areas, particularly like Europe and the U.S., and market applications such as industrial, tend to give you slightly better margins. So that's one factor on the upside.  Another factor on the upside is the new products, which tend to be a little bit higher margin. The balance between those three elements of new regions and applications and new products and then lowerpriced Asian competition, that's what will determine where it's going to go. In terms of us reading the tea leaves, it's difficult to say. Michael, do you have any comments?
Michael Hsing: I don't have any comment, but overall for MPS to become a much bigger company, and the margin pressure is always there. But we try very hard to introduce new products and develop new technology. That's what will give MPS the edge.
Craig Hettenbach Goldman Sachs: And then if I can have a followup, Rick, on the inventory front. Any more color in terms of on an absolute basis where the inventory might trend in Q3 and into Q4.
Rick Neely: Right now, we're already at 120 days. The way it just worked out. We don't time our inventory purchases, but we bought a lot of die and that's how it ended up at the end of the quarter. We're already at 120. I expect we'll be about that in Q3. We'll probably be more like 100 days by the end of the year. We usually do this, the second half is our big demand period. If we can buy die strategically, we do that. Again, our finished goods declined. We didn't build a lot of packages, we just built up the die bank.
Operator: Your next question comes from Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer.
Rick Schafer Oppenheimer: Just wanted the follow up on the inventory question. Were there any production issues maybe that you saw in the second quarter, maybe related to the earthquake, the Chengdu back end package and test facility that you have.
Michael Hsing: Actually none at all. We have a capacity for our second year and as you see in the past, we always built our inventory in the first half to meet second half demand. These are not vegetables or bananas. Our products last for seven to ten years. We're not really worried about the high inventory.
Rick Schafer Oppenheimer: I was interested because it looked like your finished goods really didn't change much but your WIP almost doubled, I think, sequentially.
Rick Neely: Almost doubled, like 7080% up. 
Michael Hsing: Compared to the past, we talk about it before, and we ran way too low. Now, we have over 200 products and a lot are new and we have to stock all these inventories and are waiting for all those products for ramping.
Rick Neely: I would have to comment, too, Michael and I are amazed that the company went through a major earthquake in Chengdu. But the team in China did a tremendous job. 24 hours after the earthquake all the IT was up; and 48 hours later we were ready to go and producing parts. It had no impact. We have a brand new factory, very well built apparently. Good news. We managed to get through that with no protobation. As you can see there's no impact on the numbers.
Rick Schafer Oppenheimer: I think you explained really well what's going on in the second and third quarter with the litigation maybe a little bit higher than I had modeled. If we look forward like into the fourth quarter or even looking into next year, what's sort of a normalized litigation run rate for you guys? Is it million and a quarter or half a million and a quarter?
Rick Neely: It's hard to give the range, but we can say there's no major litigation scheduled at this time. Smaller debts tend to add up, but maybe your range the reasonable.
Michael Hsing : The reason we can't comment is that we don't have any, litigation is an unforeseeable event, and we can't control our Q2 cost. Your model is probably in the range. Our Q2 cost is higher, the litigation cost is higher than they are modeled, too. In future, we can't really tell; but as far as I know, we have no major cases going on anymore.
Rick Schafer Oppenheimer: Just on the notebook CCFL market. I don't know if there's a way to quantify or talk about maybe some of the shared gains that you've seen there, what you think your share will get back up to in notebook, where do you think it's going, that kind of thing. And maybe as part of that, can you talk about any plans for the LCD TV market in terms of CCFL?
Rick Neely: I'll start with the market. We did look at it because, on a unit basis, as we said, we're doing fine in the notebook market. If we grow our units 35% yearoveryear I think we're maintaining our share in notebooks, and the notebook market is good. Where we saw a slight drop-off was with these smaller portable devices like DVD players and digital picture frames. They were hot in 2007 and then switched to different solutions, and that happens all the time. In our mainstream notebook market, we think we're doing fine in market share. In terms of the other products, Mike?
Michael Hsing:   To Rick's point, we saw smaller LCD panels switch to LED and also the trend started in the notebook side, and we all saw that. The unit numbers for smaller panels dropped quite a bit in CCFL shipments. But on the notebook, we gained quite a bit. For the revenue side, we don't grow that much because of the price. The price erosion is pretty bad. We'll still maintain a relatively good margin. As I said in the past, in the last quarter, the CCFLs for notebooks and for small panels, it's a mature market; and we don't see a big growth. Last time we said it was flat to slight growth. For the TV side, we don't have a major shipment for CCFL backlight and have a lot of DC to DC products.
Rick Neely: In backlight, our major CCFL growth driver in the future will be a segment we haven't served, the monitor segment. We have some new products were introducing now. We think we should get some growth on the monitor segment next year. Again, notebooks will probably be maturing. The monitors we should see some growth. TVs, we really don't make backlighting products for that market.
Rick Schafer Oppenheimer: Michael, just to clarify, when you say pricing is getting kind of rough or worse in CCFL, to you what's rough? Is 20% a year, 15% a year kind of range or is it worse?
Michael Hsing: No, it's because last year we won the lawsuit and we get back in the game. And so we get back to game at a better price, we want the market and want those shares. And these are very profitable for MPS. So the price is worse than previous year that we were in.
Rick Schafer Oppenheimer: Can you tell us again what terms are this quarter versus last quarter, and that's all I have. Your sales terms for the current quarter versus last quarter. Is it sort of roughly the same as they were last quarter, are they lower? Higher?
Rick Neely: Our bookings were good. The typical bookings for Q3, which is a bigger quarter, so our bookings in Q2 support those.
Michael Hsing: We don't see a surprise.
Rick Neely: It's what we expected for this type of quarter.
Operator: Your next question comes from Doug Freedman - American Technical Research. 
Doug Freedman American Technology Research : Can you talk a little bit about efforts to expand your sales footprint, what's gong on there as far as head count and programs in distribution as you try to broaden your sales reach.
Michael Hsing:   I don't have a clear number for you now. We definitely are expanding the U.S. sales team and application teams. You know the sales people and application people, the application engineer is really the person to sell the product, as well as in Europe and Japan. Over the past history, we are always on the conservative side. And the sales grows a lot faster than the [inaudible] grows and the world maintains the same way.
Doug Freedman American Technology Research : Are you finding a larger percentage of sales coming through the distribution or do you think that it will in the future?
Michael Hsing: We try to do in different regions, and they’re different stories. In Europe, we do a lot of sell by ourselves and use a rep rather than [distributor]. In the U.S. and Japan we must rely on [distributors].
Doug Freedman American Technology Research : Did you offer the blended ASP in the quarter?
Rick Neely: We don't do that because we have so many different products with so many different price ranges, it doesn't come up with anything.
Michael Hsing: It's difficult for us. Overall product line we're getting a few percentage difference with our average.
Rick Neely: Typically, we don't give a blended ASP because of the breadth of our products.
Doug Freedman American Technology Research : New products introduced in the quarter and how many you expect to introduce next quarter?
Michael Hsing: I don't have the numbers. We still are on track and, as I said before, we expect about 30 to 40 new products every year. This year, we're better than that.
Rick Neely: We're better than that. I guess I could go the other way. On the R&D side, the reason we're up above maybe some guidance or above last quarter was $400,000 or $500,000 or extra mass costs and all those go to new products. Just on the expense side, we’re spending on a lot of new products. We don't spend a lot of time counting them, but the expenses show up there in the R&D area.
Operator: Your next question comes from Vernon Essi - Needham and Company.
Vernon Essi Needham and Company: Just wanted to revisit the geographic question and make sure that I understand what you're trying to get at here with the situation with China in terms of revenue coming down. You're obviously increasing your exposure in other regions. First of all, what specific region would you say, if you were to look over the last two quarters, that's grown the most relative to the others? And where do you see most of that growth delta coming from?
Rick Neely: I have the advantage that we just filed our Q today, so I can just look at this past six months versus 2007; and one of the bigger growths, for example, Europe was $3 million in the first six months of 2007 and $5.5 million in first half of 2008. Similarly, same things in Japan; we grew from $4.7 million to $7.7 million. So, again, Japan and Europe are two good examples of much higher than company growth rate in areas where we get good advantages from the technical innovation of our products; and we can get good prices.
Vernon Essi Needham and Company : Both of these, do you expect to have good seasonality into the rest of the year?
Rick Neely: Yes.
Vernon Essi Needham and Company : One other point you talked earlier about, and this is a question on a lot of our minds. You got a lot of mixed results out there from different companies. Some people are seeing a weaker consumer cycle. I am just trying to figure out, and your guidance is great relative to a lot of other companies, and you're not really coming out and saying this, but is it safe to assume that you are seeing increased dollar penetration within same accounts across most of the accounts or do you feel as though you're seeing true organic growth rates at the end market?
Michael Hsing: I think it's everything what you said. This year, a lot of new products, we got into a lot of new accounts where we were not in last year. Also the regional growth and these new accounts. And so the existing accounts and existing products were also doing really well. All of the above. I can't really tell you what's the future. Again, same as last quarter, I said I see the blue skies and I don't know if the horizon is a cliff or not.
Rick Neely: It does go both ways. For example, in set-top boxes, we have always done well in Europe; and now we're starting to get those designs into U.S. as well. Same solution, but these are new customers we hadn't served before. But we're taking that solution to other customers. So that's some of the growth in the set-top box.  For example, markets where we know the customers very well, like notebooks, we're starting to ship some MiniMonster power, power management into notebooks. That increases our dollar content in notebooks. Same thing in TVs. We've done very well in TVs, but the MiniMonsters are coming in and increasing our content in the TVs. It's a combination. Some of our markets, it's an additional, wider customer base like set-top box and, in other markets, it's increasing dollar content as well.
Operator: Your next question comes from Bob Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank.
Bob Gujavarty Deutsche Bank: You mentioned you spent $4.4 million on buybacks. How many shares did you repurchase?
Rick Neely: I would have to look it up.
Michael Hsing: I think the average price was 17 something.
Rick Neely: In the quarter, we repurchased about 220,000 in the quarter.
Bob Gujavarty Deutsche Bank: How much was depreciation in the quarter?
Rick Neely: Depreciation was about $1.5 million.
Bob Gujavarty Deutsche Bank: We talked about this LED CCFL transition, you always comment that LED is still too expensive. Have you seen any further movement to LED? What’s your guess on what the LED penetration in notebooks would be, let's say at the end of this year?
Michael Hsing: I don't know what the percentage. I think I said it before, 2009 is the year and they will have a bigger transition. We expect that.
Rick Neely:   The trend is moving the way we thought. I don't know how much the percentage is, but it's definitely going as people expected it.
Michael Hsing: 2008 is still smaller numbers. 2009 could be a very meaningful number.
Bob Gujavarty Deutsche Bank: And you will have the product ready for that transition in 2009?
Michael Hsing: We have a product in the pipeline.
Operator: Your next question comes from Steve Smigie - Raymond James.
Steve Smigie Raymond James: I'm curious on the set-top box wins that you're getting, is that from traditional set-top boxes, HD stuff, are you seeing wins in like IP TV set-top boxes?
Rick Neely: I am using that as a broad category. The IP boxes, converter boxes, cable boxes, sort of similar, some have different functions.
Michael Hsing: In the U.S. and with HDTV, digital TV, that will help us.
Rick Neely: The analog conversion to digital settop box. 
Michael Hsing: We try hard not to have a huge impact on MPS revenues. I know it grow much faster than any other category. We maintain 25 percent growth every year.
Steve Smigie Raymond James: Sometimes you break out MiniMonsters, I think it's a dollar amount revenue, any thoughts on share count for Q3? And interest income for Q3?
Rick Neely: In terms of share count, I think we're about 36 and change. I think that's where we're heading. A lot of it depends on stock price, which will make the fully diluted number different, kind of in the $36 million range is about where we're at. On the MiniMonsters, as I said, we try not to give out exact numbers. We're very pleased that we're at the upper end of our range of our expectations for the year it looks like, on MiniMonsters in terms of dollars. So that's the good news.
Michael Hsing: We're happy with the sales. As we expected, they're in the upper end of our expectations.
Steve Smigie Raymond James: And the interest income?
Rick Neely: Interest income is down a little bit because interest rates are down across the board. I think everybody is the same, interest rate is down to 2%. I think it's about $800,000 maybe as a forecast. I would have to go back and recalculate.
Operator: Your next question comes from Vijay Rakesh - ThinkPanmure.
Vijay Rakesh ThinkPanmure: On the gross margin side, what are the levers you are seeing as you go forward on improving that one way or the other?
Rick Neely: The main way an established company improves the gross margin is with new products and new applications which have better pricing, that's the main thrust is selling into new regions where [inaudible] more integration. At the same time, new products. Those things will help us a lot. The things that always push on the downside, which Michael mentioned, as you get larger, there's always more price pressure to take volume deals. There's always low price Asian competitors out there.  So, the balance of those things depends on what happens. We've been very good in the last two years. We stayed at the upper end of our target range for quite some time. We work hard at it and we can't predict exactly what's going on. We are happy with being one of the top gross margin guys in the industry.
Vijay Rakesh ThinkPanmure: As you look at your notebook side, you mentioned some new [inaudible]. Do you have any new Tier 1 in the notebook side in Q2 you expect in Q3?
Michael Hsing: Tier 1. I don't have answers. We may have, but we certainly ship a lot of volume to it. The MiniMonster products in smaller, small PCs, student PCs, EPC, we ship quite a bit numbers on EPC. For the Tier 1, we're either design or either there's a product shipping. It's progressing every quarter. I don’t know. Certainly, there's a large volume yet.
Vijay Rakesh ThinkPanmure: The DC to DC converters look like very nice pickup. Any vertical markets, like the set-top box, that you're seeing good growth on the DC to DC converter side you see going forward?
Michael Hsing: Actually, the settop box, is one of our components to our revenue. These revenues are not going to be significant. These are single digit. We have a lot of these TVs and other single digits. Is it noticeable? We have many, many others. Lot are one or two percent of our business. It's really difficult to tell.
Operator: Your next question comes from Michael McConnell - Pacific Crest Securities.
Michael McConnell Pacific Crest Securities: Rick, just wanted to ask on the inventory front. Obviously being now at 120 days, you've already made considerable progress from how you finished the quarter. I have got to ask, just with the sell in model, how comfortable are you with the amount of inventory you're carrying on the balance sheet, that the distributors don't drop inventories even further than maybe what you are seeing historically. A much bigger competitor had a problem with that this past quarter. Can you just talk about if there's any risk associated with that?
Rick Neely: What we do is we try and manage a range. We like the distributors to carry 30 to 45 days. As I mentioned on the call, they're actually below that. On an average basis, they're below what we want them to take. If they take a little more, we'd be happy. Nearterm, that's not the issue for MPS. We had very low channel inventories at the end of the quarter, so I'm not concerned right now.
Michael McConnell Pacific Crest Securities : Just looking at the lead times, can you just comment on your lead times, what they were last quarter, what they are currently and what's been the trend over the last couple quarters.
Michael Hsing: In the past, we see about 30 days, about 26 to 30 days. We don't see any significant change this time.
Michael McConnell Pacific Crest Securities : So you haven't been bringing this down?
Michael Hsing: The lead time is our business, a term business.
Rick Neely: Four to six weeks is what we typically do. That's been working fine. There hasn't been any change in that.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ryan Goodman - Merrill Lynch.
Ryan Goodman Merrill Lynch : Can you help me understand how you're thinking about R&D and SG&A in terms of getting your [inaudible] model. Are you like specifically with the R&D, are you growing that as a percentage of revenue or is there a fixed dollar amount you're targeting for each year?
Rick Neely: Right now, if you look at it on a nonGAAP basis, our R&D is around 16% to 17% of sales. Our goal is have it between 14% and 16%, so we're at the upper end of our goal. That's not one, we want to spend the money. This year we had a very heavy new product introduction, so I am happy to be at 16%17% in R&D.  At the same time, as we heard in the phone call, sales and marketing have to grow because there's a lot of new regional applications we can get into, but we have to hire the sales and applications teams to do it. The area where we are actually getting leverage, it's not broken out, but G&A is declining as a percentage of sales because you don't need additional people that way. We're getting leverage on G&A. We're probably going to grow sales and marketing.  R&D, we're a technology company, we're an innovative new product company, so that's what we do and we're not going to save money in R&D, that's not the place to do it. I would say this year, if you look at the Q3 guidance, it's about where we will stay. It's a good year to continue to invest in R&D.
Ryan Goodman Merrill Lynch : I know you get asked this every quarter for an end market break-out and you usually don't give it, but maybe you can help me understand at this point, do you think consumer now is taking up a bigger chunk of your revenue now than notebooks?
Rick Neely: The notebook now, when I did the math, is 16% to 18%. Notebook continues to decline as a key part of our business because we're getting much bigger and the notebook market is mature and flat. It's definitely in the 16% to 18% range.
Ryan Goodman Merrill Lynch: Is that including the converters going into the notebooks?
Rick Neely: That's just the CCFL. I don't know, the power going in there a still fairly small. Notebooks are well under 20%, that's what I know. What was the other part of your question?
Ryan Goodman Merrill Lynch: That was it, actually, if the consumer had passed notebooks. I wasn’t sure how much the DC to DC business was actually going into notebooks.
Michael Hsing: It's a small number. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Patrick Wang - Wedbush Morgan Securities.
Patrick Wang Wedbush Morgan Securities: Quick question on CCFL revenues. Looks like revenues snapped back pretty well in Q2 versus Q1. Does a lot of that have to do with the ramp of a customer you recently regained?
Michael Hsing: Yes. We gained a lot of customers, and unit volume grew more spectacularly. The revenue grows slightly. There's a new significant dollar we can make and that's we want these units.
Rick Neely: The other part of it, Q1, as we said in our call last quarter, Q1 CCFL revenue was abnormally low. There was a bit of a, there wasn't a lot of ordering going on across the board, so some of it was more of a seasonal pickup and the rest, as Michael said, was some design.
Patrick Wang Wedbush Morgan Securities: I know you talked about aggressive pricing recently here. As we think about Q3 and Q4, what are you expecting in terms of ASP erosion on that same market?
Michael Hsing: The price erosion in the last couple of years, or this year, is slightly more than two years ago. We continuously introduce new product and ramping these new product and growing the different regions and also cost cutting, too. That's why we're very lucky. We're still staying in the 63% range.
Patrick Wang Wedbush Morgan Securities: As I think about OpEx from a dollar perspective, how would I look at SG&A and R&D to grow from Q2 to Q3?
Rick Neely: If you look at the guidance, most of that growth will come in R&D. Twothirds of the growth in the guidance I gave would be R&D and maybe a third would be sales and marketing.
Patrick Wang Wedbush Morgan Securities: Also in the quarter, you guys had a nice 15% nonGAAP tax rate. How should we be thinking about tax rate next quarter and on a longer-term basis?
Rick Neely: Again, now that I'm halfway through the year, I can forecast the tax rate. Actually, no one can of forecast the tax rate accurately, but it looks like the range is somewhere between 12% and 17% would be the average rate. You kind of hit a 14% or 15% number. That's where the average is likely to be and that's my current view.
Patrick Wang Wedbush Morgan Securities: Do you have an update on the high voltage and high current products you started sampling?
Michael Hsing: We introduced a 40 volts, and we have a 60 volts and higher voltages, some 100volt products. These are in the telecommunications, automotive applications, and printers, laser printers and picture printers. That's where we are in now.
Operator: Your next question comes from Craig Berger - FBR Capital Markets.
Craig Berger FBR Capital Markets : Rick, on the taxes, is 15% what we should be dialing in for 2009?
Rick Neely: That's my nonGAAP rates for this year. Next year, that would be good for 2009.
Craig Berger FBR Capital Markets : On the high voltage stuff, since you talked about it, how much of the R&D is being spent on high voltage or other more advanced products, newer stuff than MiniMonster?
Michael Hsing: I can't really tell because it all into one single technology, which is ECD plus. And we have many design guys and design of other products. There were several products that will go for the telecommunications market.
Craig Berger FBR Capital Markets : When you said MiniMonster was coming in towards the high end of your range of expectations, what was that range of expectations?
Rick Neely: We try and stay away from the numbers. But we have said before all we needed was $5 million or $10 million in MiniMonsters this year to be very happy. So you can take it at the upper end of that range.
Operator: Your last question comes from Gus Richard - Piper Jaffray.
Gus Richard Piper Jaffray: First of all, on your inventory internally, do you include die bank and finished goods or is that WIP?
Rick Neely: WIP.
Gus Richard Piper Jaffray: You generally ship to your customers in two to four weeks if need be, right?
Rick Neely: Our cycle time on the back end, assuming we have everything lined up, that's about it.
Michael Hsing: I don't know if you meant the WIP in the back. Those are not in the inventory. We have a die bank and a finished goods.
Rick Neely: In the 10Q, it will show the work in progress includes the die bank and WIP, and finished goods is where the products with packages are.
Gus Richard Piper Jaffray: Which I imagine is pretty small.
Rick Neely: As I said, it's down for the yearend and down for the quarter. Finished goods, we built up the die bank and so that we can respond, from die to finished products, it's two to four weeks, depending on what kind of product.
Gus Richard Piper Jaffray: Are your distributors pulling for more inventory at this point given that you're below the target range or are they comfortable with your ability to deliver what they need?
Michael Hsing: I think the key is we believe we can manage the inventory better than distributors. That's the main reason. They always have, because we're ramping so many new products now and they always complain about the shortage of this product and that product. So we built up a lot of inventory for the new product and they always ask for more.
Rick Neely: I think Michael has got a good point. Our preference is rather than let the distributor guess, if we hold the die bank and can get it to them in two to four weeks, that covers our general lead times. The fact also that we have, the distributors know we have a large die bank and that makes them feel a little better about not having a lot of finished goods.
Operator: There are no further calls.
Rick Neely: Thank you everybody for listening to the call. It's taken over an hour, but I appreciate your questions and look forward to talking to you in about three months at our next call.

Operator: Good afternoon Ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2007 Monolithic Power Systems, Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. C. Richard Neely Jr., Chief Financial Officer. Please proceed.
Richard Neely: Good afternoon and welcome to the Third Quarter Fiscal 2007 Monolithic Power Systems Conference Call. Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS, is with me on today’s call. In the course of today’s conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, for example, our business outlook including our business and financial outlook with the fourth quarter of 2007, projected fourth quarter net revenues and gross margins, our expectations for fourth quarter and litigation, stock compensation and non-GAAP operating expenses, our target operating model range for gross margins and operating expenses, continuing market acceptance of our MiniMonster LDO battery charger and other high performance products, plan new product introductions, potential customer acceptance in the various opportunities these present, our process development, design activities and relative competitive position, expected growth or decline in our product lines and geographic markets and finally anticipated outcomes and schedules of our pending litigations. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts or guarantee of future performance or events and are based on current expectations, estimates, beliefs, assumptions, goals, and objectives and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by these statements. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in SEC Fillings including but not limited to our second quarter Form 10-Q filed on August 1st, 2007, which is accessible through our website, www.monolithicpower.com. Also please note that during this call, we will discuss net income and operating expense on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude charges related to stock-based compensation, legal settlement and provision cost and one-time lease write-downs or write-ups and their related tax effects. We will also discuss our expected non-GAAP research and development and selling general and administrative expense for the fourth quarter of 2007 which excludes our expected charges related to stock-based compensation. A table that outlines the differences between non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings with these which we have filled with the SEC. Now we refer investors to this release as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our website. I’d also like remind you that today’s conference call is being webcast live over the internet and will be available for replay on our website for one year. We would like to start this call by reviewing our third quarter of 2007 business highlights. Following this update, I would discuss our financial results then we will conclude by discussing our expectations with the fourth fiscal quarter of 2007. We will then open up the call to your questions. So let us start with the business highlights. MPS set a new record for revenue in the third quarter of 2007 as demand for our products was very strong. Our third quarter revenues exceeded our updated guidance as we recorded our best quarter in the company’s history with revenues of $40.2 million and non-GAAP earnings of $0.27 per share. MPS maintained solid gross margins with 63.5% and closed the quarter with over $101 million in cash and cash equivalence. For new product introductions, we increased shipment of early production quantities of our new high current, high voltage MiniMonsters product family in the third quarter. We are also seeing good design activity for this product family in multiple key target markets such as large flat panel TV, telecommunication equipment, set-top boxes, high-end desktops, servers and notebooks. Early revenue levels are meeting our expectations and we continue to be optimistic about the MiniMonster family. We are also seeing good activities in our new LDO and battery charger products in different market segments. We believe these high speed, high precision, low power consumption products will be winners in these markets. The third quarter also saw a resurgence of growth in the TTFL product area as MPS was able to take advantage of this significant sequential growth in the notebook computer market. In the manufacturing arena, MPS was able to offset pricing pressures in our older product offerings with greater cost efficiency and maintained our gross margin in the upper end of our target model for the third quarter of 2007 recording a gross margin of 63.5%. Our inventory days were flat at 98 days as we filled the strong demand from our distributor’s inventory and kept our own stocks intact to the prior quarter. We continue to grow our cash balances as we increased cash and cash equivalents by $9.5 million in the quarter to $101.8 million as of September 30, 2007. On the expense side, our non-GAAP operating expenses were $13.9 million down $1.2 million from the second quarter of 2007 as our third quarter litigation spending was $1.5 million as a result of reduced activities in the ’02 micro case and we avoided some trial expense as a result of the settlement with Taiwan’s Sumida. Now let’s look at the financials in more detail. Turning to the P&L, on the revenue line, third quarter of 2007 net revenues of $40.2 million grew 47% from the third quarter of 2006 and above our guidance going into the quarter and the update given in mid September. This compares to net revenues of $30.8 million in the prior quarter, an increase of 30% sequentially. Revenue breakdown of our third quarter revenue by product line, DC to DC product sales were $25.6 million up 36% from the $18.8 million recorded in the year ago quarter and up 34% from the second quarter of 2007. Year-over-year, our DC to DC products grew in the flat panel TV, set-top box, GPS and digital picture frame markets as some examples. We also started to see meaningful sales volumes in some of our newer product areas such as battery chargers and LDOs. The LCD backlight revenues for the third quarter were $10.9 million, an increase of 47% from the same quarter a year ago and up 21% from the prior quarter. This exceeded our expectations for revenues in this product area as we grew our business with existing customers as the notebook segment saw a good growth in the quarter. Audio revenues once again hit record levels coming in at $3.7 million up 262% from the $1 million recorded in year ago quarter and up 34% from Q2 2007. This performance reflects the continuing production ramp at several consumer product customers in the LCD TV space. Let’s move down to the gross margin line. Our third quarter gross margin was 63.5% compared to 65.6% in the same quarter of 2006 and flat to the 63.5% in the prior quarter. Despite strong ASP pressures in some of our older product offerings, MPS was able to maintain stable gross margins. This was largely due to excellent cost control and efficiencies. Let us look at our reported expenses on a GAAP basis. On a GAAP operating basis, our expenses were $17 million in the third quarter. This includes $15.5 million in R&D and SG&A expense, which includes $3.1 million for stock compensation expense under FAS 123, our accounting rules and litigation expense of $1.5 million. Compared with the third quarter of 2006, GAAP operating expenses decreased by $1.5 million. This amount comprises of an increase in stock compensation expense of $226,000.00, a decrease in litigation cost of $1.6 million, an increase in R&D spending of $1.6 million, an increase in SG&A spending of $964,000.00 and a decrease in one-time charges of $3 million as we record a legal settlement with Micro in the prior year. Now I would like to review our non-GAAP operating expenses. Excluding stock compensation, our non-GAAP operating expenses for the third quarter or $13.9 million compared to $12.7 million in the third quarter of 2006 and $15.2 million in the second quarter of 2007. The $1.3 million expense decreased from the second quarter of 2007 was due to litigation spending which decreased by $2.6 million from the second quarter of 2007. Non-GAAP R&D costs were up $687,000.00 as we increased new product introduction and employee bonuses, non-GAAP sales, general and administrative cost increased by $644,000.00 due to higher commissions and employee bonus costs. Our third quarter GAAP net income was $8.3 million or a profit of $0.23 per fully diluted share. This compares to a net loss of $1.9 million for the third quarter of 2006 or $0.06 per basic share. In the prior quarter, MPS recorded a net loss of $6.4 million or $0.20 per basic share. On a non-GAAP basis for the third quarter of 2007, we had net income of $9.7 million or $0.27 per fully diluted share which excludes stock comp expense of $3.2 million and a related tax effect of $1.8 million and uses an estimated tax rate of 25%. In comparison for the third quarter of 2006, the non-GAAP net income was $3.9 million or $0.12 per share which included stock comp expense of $3.2 million and included an adjusted tax amount of $207,000.00. Let’s look at some of the major changes on the balance sheet this quarter. Cash, cash equivalents, current restricted cash and investments were $101.8 million at the end of the third quarter, up from $92.3 million at the end of the second quarter of 2007 and up $27.8 million from the $74 million recorded a year ago. The increase in cash from June 30, 2007 came from operating cash flow of about $12.6 million in stock option exercises and ESPP purchases which is our employee stock purchase plan of about $6.3 million. This was offset by an increase in inventory and working capital of $7.3 million and capital expenditures of $2.1 million resulting in quarter-over-quarter cash growth of $9.5 million. Accounts receivable into the third quarter of $12.8 million compared with $8 million at the end of Q2 ’07 and up from the $9.6 million at the end of the third quarter of 2006. Collections continue to be well-managed as our days sales outstanding were 29 days at the end of Q3’2007 compared with 24 days at the end of the second quarter of 2007 and 32 days at the end of the third quarter of 2006. Our inventories at the end of the quarter were $15.8 million or about 98 days of inventory. This compares with $11.9 million or 96 days of inventory at the end of the prior quarter. Looking back at the end of the third quarter fiscal of 2006, our inventory totalled $7.4 million or about 72 days of inventory. We kept our internal inventory level higher than normal in the third quarter to offset low distributor channel inventory and meet our October shipment schedules, and we are comfortable with this level of inventory. I would now like to turn to a discussion of general business conditions. We had outstanding revenue and booking activity in the third quarter as all three MPS product lines grew in concert. This growth came from a combination of new business penetration as well as general market growth in notebook computers, flat panel TVs and consumer accessories. Geographically, in the third quarter of 2007, 65% of MPS sales were shipped to Taiwan and China and 35% to other regions with the largest growth in Europe and Korea from the second quarter. US revenues are also showing significant growth in diverse markets with excellent momentum going into 2008. For the CCFL product line, sales for the third quarter of 2007 did very well. But the legal issues largely behind us, we participated in the strong third quarter growth of the notebook segment of the computation market and we believe we will be able to gain back some market share in the inverter portion in the backlighting market in the near future. In the new product area, we are very excited about several new product initiatives beyond the well publicized MiniMonster family. One of the new product families that are getting a lot of design attention is our high-voltage 40 volt DC to DC offering. This is an ideal product for the automotive and industrial markets and our application team has seen very heavy activity. Another product family we are excited about is our next generation battery charger family. We plan to release about five products by end of this year and they will offer features and cost advantages that are unrivalled by any existing competitor. Finally, we’re seeing growing revenues in our high performance LDO products area. We see all these compelling solutions as very high potential products for MPS in 2008 and 2009. Now turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2007, our revenue guidance is in the range of $37 to $39 million reflecting normal seasonal patterns for our products in the fourth quarter. Gross margin is expected to continue in upper end of our target range of 60% to 63%. We expect stock based compensation expense in the range of $3.0 to $3.5 million. We expect non-GAAP research and development and selling, general and administrative expense in the range of $12.5 to $13.5 million. This estimate excludes the stock compensation estimates mentioned above. Finally, we expect litigation expense in the range of $1.5 to $1.8 million. In conclusion, we are pleased to report that MPS set record quarterly revenues and stronger in the third quarter of 2007. All three product lines grew sequentially at double digit rates as new applications are beginning to kick in for the existing products and the product introductions. For the past 18 months they are starting to generate noticeable revenues. We continue to generate significant cash adding over $9 million over the prior quarter figures. We see normal revenue guidance for our heavily consume rated business in the fourth quarter and are optimistic that our many new products including the MiniMonster, battery charger, high performance LDO, and high voltage products that are based on our BCD plus process technology will add substantial revenues for the company in the future. Now we would like to open the microphone and take your question.
Operator: And your first question comes from the line of Vernon Essi with Needham & Company, please proceed.
Vernon Essi - Needham & Company: Thank you, nice numbers there. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of what the market breakouts might look out, I know you don’t normally disclose that, but can we get an understanding of, and it’s obviously broad but is there any specific area you would highlight more than any others that grew stronger quarter on quarter.
Michael Hsing: We had a press release a few weeks ago, but we see the stronger demand from the LCD TVs and the notebook.
Vernon Essi - Needham & Company: I understand but I am sorry Michael, I apologize. I am talking about into the guidance in the fourth quarter.
Michael Hsing: In the fourth quarter, our business is a kind of turn business, but that we expect a strong demand in it from the consumer side like LCD TV.
Richard Neely Jr.: And Vernon by segment, there isn’t any particular guidance, all the segments will probably go down a little bit. That’s sort of the outlook and that’s based on just the seasonal patterns, but there’s no one segment will go down more than the other. We expect them all to decline slightly.
Vernon Essi - Needham & Company: Your next Gen product line especially focusing on battery charger, what’s the power range you are looking at and what application?
Michael Hsing: Battery charger is only one of the products, and we introduced several other ones like high performance, high speed LDOs and high voltage products. To answer the question exactly these are for switching chargers and the linear chargers, so we have few products that were either released or still in line. And those are charging currents are from one, two, three, four amp current
Vernon Essi - Needham & Company: And then finally, just in terms of inventory level that are out there, a lot of companies are seeing pull downs on their inventory levels in the channel, you seem to be holding yourself well. Any thoughts on how that might play out into the end of the year? Do you feel comfortable with where you’re at with your distribution partners?
Richard Neely Jr.: Yes, as we mentioned on the call Vernon, our channel inventory levels are actually a little bit lower than normal so we feel that the channel is well under control and so we are ourselves have reasonable inventories but we’re doing significantly higher revenue and volumes obviously in the second half. So we are keeping the inventory ourselves, but our distributor channels are fairly lean.
Vernon Essi - Needham & Company: Okay, thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Rick Schafer with CIBC, please proceed.
Rick Schafer - CIBC World Markets: Hey guys, just got a couple of questions for you. First, it seems like you guys finished the September quarter very strong, upside even from your pre-announcement. Can you comment and give us any flavor for book to bill, it seems like it is ought to be positive, if I’m off base there, maybe comment a little bit on what turned this quarter compared to the last, and have you actually started to see things, sort of start slowing down seasonally or is this just your kind of basing this on years past kind of normal seasonality.
Richard Neely Jr.: Yes Rick, truth is that, we don’t put out bookings and backlog numbers because we have a heavy component turns like most analog company. We saw good bookings this quarter that will support our Q4 guidance. So, that’s about as far as we can say on the booking. Bookings were reasonable so that they could support the guidance, so we see it as a normal quarter on booking. Relative to how the market is trending, Michael will chime in on that.
Michael Hsing: Yes, on the bookings, we never can accurately predict it and we don’t have a clear pattern. The market trend is that we are still a small company and we can not accurately predict what the market is. But we do see a strong demand from LCD panels that are related to the business. So, they are going well, and as we see in the third quarter, fourth quarter, we still see the similar trend but we don’t know how long it will continue.
Rick Schafer - CIBC World Markets: Okay, so you haven’t actually seen the start of seasonally sort of soften up yet?
Michael Hsing : No.
Richard Neely Jr.: It is too early. That would be a December situation. I mean, it’s October and November, we can’t tell yet.
Rick Schafer - CIBC World Markets: Okay. But Rick, is it safe to say that turns are pretty similar to this quarter to where you where last quarter?
Richard Neely Jr.: Yes, I would say that is safe to say.
Rick Schafer - CIBC World Markets: Okay, and another question, if you could comment on the sort of success you’re seeing, I know you talked about CCFL and the notebook stuff being up, I think it’s 20% or 21% sequentially, I know you talked about share gains as we look in ‘08, do you think we’re already starting to see some share gains, or is that really something that we are going to rely on next year?
Michael Hsing : Well, the CCFL, clearly the legal risk is behind us, and I can’t really quantify whether it’s from a market share gain or it is from the market itself, the unit volume increased by itself. So, next year, we will feel good about it.
Rick Schafer - CIBC World Markets: Hey Michael, then part of that, are you getting calls from some of your former customers maybe that are thinking about coming back or starting to look at Monolithic parts again or?
Michael Hsing: Yes, absolutely, we started right after the trial, and we’ve seen the increase of activity.
Rick Schafer - CIBC World Markets: Okay.
Richard Neely Jr.: And, we have seen an increase, but you won’t see the revenue because it is nine to 12 months, so you have the spring model, hopefully, will be in some of those that spring a little late, but it is just too early to get anything else.
Rick Schafer - CIBC World Markets: Okay, that’s where I was getting at, Rick, thanks. That was what I was trying to dig for when we might start seeing it on the top line. And then the last question, if you can give any color on, sort of, you probably would not give the number, but if you do, that’s great, but I’d be curious with the relative profitability of some of your core CCFL business might be, versus let’s say the DC to DC biz and then if you could give us any idea of, is MiniMonster big enough now to be talked about separately. I mean, is it 5% of rev gen or any idea where MiniMonster sits?
Richard Neely Jr.: Okay, first one, our gross margin that we do have, we have a range between all the products at a fairly narrow range, so as we said before, the DC to DC products tend to be a little bit higher and CCFL is more middle of our range, but there isn’t a broad separation, in other words, we do not have 80% product and 40% product. Everything is fairly narrow gross margin range so we do not break it out. On the MiniMonster side, you have to remember the first product sample shipped a year ago, actually less than that, nine months ago, so nine to 10 months ago. So, the fact we have as much revenue as we have, we’re really excited because that’s the fastest growing product we had, but we’re not releasing numbers because we don’t want to put them out separately. It’s something we look at internally because we look at it as a ramp over 19 to 24 months. Now the fact we’re shipping things in nine months is amazing to us. So that’s really how we see it.
Michael Hsing: But let’s put it that way, that is one of the fastest, if not one the fastest growing product in the history of the company, and other than the initial CCFL product back ten years ago, but the product line grew really well and we’re very excited about it.
Rick Schafer - CIBC World Markets: Within DC to DC and MiniMonsters, I’m assuming.
Richard Neely Jr.: It’s in there.
Rick Schafer - CIBC World Markets: But I’m saying, but its higher margin even within DC to DC, is that safe to guess?
Michael Hsing: Currently, the volume is small, the margins are higher. So by the way, it is better that the volume would be significantly larger. The margins will be in our business model.
Richard Neely Jr.: It would be the same as the old DC parts, I think.
Rick Schafer - CIBC World Markets: Okay, great thanks, guys.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Craig Berger with FBR, please proceed.
Craig Berger – FBR : Good afternoon, guys. Nice job. Quick question on the audio, it looks like it’s $3.7 million this quarter, that’s getting to be I guess fairly significant. What are the customers programs that that’s ramping into? Who are the customers and kind of what’s the outlook from here?
Michael Hsing: We can’t release the customer name, but we have a couple of new products, some large TV makers, they designed the thing and the revenue showed up. This is not a typical MPS business. We want to get as many customers as we can, but this audio product line is just our field customers and we try to broaden up, and again this is one of our product line is that we don’t see as a high growth as the MiniMonster product family.
Craig Berger – FBR : Michael, so it’s still a pet project of yours or has it graduated beyond the pet project at this point?
Michael Hsing: What I said is that it went beyond that, and we tried to get more engineers to enhance the engineering capability in our product line.
Craig Berger – FBR : And moving over to the inventories, your inventories went up. You said you’re carrying more because these are carrying so little, can you help us understand what this two weeks of inventory is, maybe what lead time trends have done and how you got comfort around your customer inventory levels?
Richard Neely Jr.: Okay, Craig, on our distributor inventory levels, we typically target for them to have around 30 to 45 days and we’re below that minimum level in to the quarter end and in fact forecasted it in the next quarter, so we know their inventories are lean, we get reports on a continuous basis, we check those and so forth. So our inventories are actually flat Q2 to Q3. Typically, we would drop a little bit in Q3. We’ve kept them flat because we know our channel inventories are lower than normal, so that’s how we’ve been managing it.
Craig Berger – FBR: How do you know or how do you gain comfort that maybe customers aren’t stock piling inventory, the OEMs, how do we gain comfort that we’re not going to wake up on January 2nd and have a big inventory problem?
Richard Neely Jr.: I get that question often and I can tell you we control our inventories, our distributors and their sell through, but there’s multiple, probably five level deep from an analog product to the retail shelf is probably five or six levels and we’re honest, we have no idea if that’s fine or our retail people have inventories or not. We don’t have that kind of visibility. We just try and control our near term customer interfaces that we understand and manage from there. There’s no way we have any of that visibility.
Craig Berger – FBR: How are your lead times or pricing trends with your foundry suppliers in case you needed more upside?
Michael Hsing: We still have room to grow. We can grow there and also we have a lot of inventory too, and we’re not worried about it for our products in near future.
Craig Berger – FDR: Last question for Rick, can you just remind us what normal seasonality looks like in the first quarter and whether you think there are any factors that might cause us to diverge from normal seasonality this year?
Richard Neely Jr.: Okay, Craig, as you know typically Q3 is our biggest quarter and there is a slight drop off to Q4 which is what our guidance shows, and Q1, because almost all of our products are shipped to Asia and all the manufacturing is in Asia and there is a holiday period of ten days or so, we typically see a 10% to 15% reduction in Q1 revenues and as far as we can tell at this moment, but we’re not giving any guidance for Q1 ’08, we see that kind of seasonality is likely. So that’s typically what happens.
Michael Hsing: Our product line and the characteristic of our product hasn’t really changed, so we expect 2008, the trend would be similar to 2007 or 2006 with a lower first half revenue will be lower in the first half and higher on the second half.
Craig Berger – FDR: Thanks a lot guys.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Steven Park with Wedbush, please proceed.
Steven Park – Wedbush : Hi, I just had a quick question about kind of the longer term growth rate for the CCFL and the DC to DC business, is that something in the 20% to 25% or is that something better than that?
Richard Neely Jr.: Our target for the company, Steven has to grow around 20% to 25% and trying to break it out by product line is too difficult to call. I think in general, we believe a lot of our new products in introduction have been the DC to DC area. We expect that to grow strongly. CCFL in general is a more mature product line, however, the notebook has been growing very quickly, so I don’t know, the fact of it is our mature product line right now is being offset by very good notebook growth. As you know a lot of desktops have been replaced by notebooks and this continue to be the trend, so we just look at the general mix and it’s probably 20% to 25% over time. That’s how we target the company part introduction strategy and that’s how we target this company to grow.
Steven Park – Wedbush : The 20% to 25%, does that kind of incorporate the market share potential gains for LCD TVs or is that more just kind of something added later on top?
Richard Neely Jr.: In general, we only have a few markets where we can track our products fairly easily. A lot of our customers, we have 2000 customers spread across 50 different market areas, so the ones that we know we have some concentration in are in notebook computers with the backlighting and a lot of our business in Japan and Korea and in Europe are on TVs, the DC to DC power management, so those are areas we know. But in general, many of our DC products can be used inside different markets, so meaning from a disk drive to a hand held to a TV to a set-top box, so it’s often difficult for us to assign broad market characteristics, what we do is look at the product where we have it and then we try to increase penetration within the market that we’ve gotten a foothold in, that’s more typical MPS strategy.
Steven Park – Wedbush : Okay, just one more question, regarding kind of gross margins in the longer term, a year out or two, do you expect them to kind of maintain at the kind of 62% to 63% level or can we see some potential upside on that in the kind of the out year?
Richard Neely Jr.: We feel fortunate that the upper end of our range, we’ve been able at the higher end of the range, but our goal is not gross margin expansion, it is bottom line margin expansion. So we have a long way to go to get our bottom line margin expansion and we want to grow revenues. Size is more important for us on the revenue side. If our gross margins are in the current range that we’ve talked about will happen, we’re not trying to improve gross margins, but we know if we grow revenue 20% to 25% a year, we will be improving our bottom line.
Michael Hsing: We are really concentrating on the top line and the bottom line and long term business model again is in the higher 50s and low 60s gross margins.
Steven Park – Wedbush : Okay, thank you.
Operator: And your next question from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank, please proceed.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities: Thanks, guys and congrats again on a strong quarter, what’s your expectation for your own inventory at the end of the fourth quarter? Would it go down or up sequentially?
Richard Neely Jr.: It would be about the same level. Again, we’re keeping our channel inventories lean so we’ve got a mixture. We have enough because there are a lot of turns, we have a lot of turns in business, so I expect to stay around in the same level.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities: When do you expect the channel inventory to do?
Richard Neely Jr.: About the same as well, that’s our current outlook.
Michael Hsing: Could be a little higher, could be a little lower and so we don’t expect to have a drastic business change.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities: Okay, that makes sense, and then the linearity of orders in the quarter, given that you positively pre-announced and then beat that number. Is it safe to assume strength continues through the very end of the quarter?
Richard Neely Jr.: Yes, we had customer requests that we had to turn, so we even beat our number by a little bit than we thought, so it’s not a huge amount, but enough to push us over the top there.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities: You guys have these products that you’re talking about, whether it be the MiniMonsters, the battery chargers, LDOs, et cetera, what way would you suggest to us to be able to track the progress of those products within your business and the implications be there for revenues, gross margins or both?
Michael Hsing: Because as Rick said earlier, we have so many customers and we have so many products, each product only contributes a little bit on the revenue growth side. And so it’s kind of difficult, but we can talk about it, we can keep talking about our product introductions and our product designing activities, and they are sort of in different markets, and that’s all we can do frankly.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities: So for us, externally we just rely on what you tell us every quarter pretty much?
Michael Hsing: Oh yes. We tell you exactly what we know.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities: Okay, and then the last question for me is in the APEC side of things, how should be we think APECs if your goal is to grow the top line 20% to 25% year-over-year, how scalable is the APEC, how fast do you, how fast do you have to grow that to deliver that sort of sale?
Richard Neely Jr.: To answer your question, Ross, in general, right now, at this stage of the company, we probably can’t grow R&D that fast if we try. It’s difficult to find the skilled people. We’ve grown a lot this year, but I doubt we can keep up with that growth rate in R&D. G&A doesn’t really have to grow that fast, but we get a lot of scaling and leverage at our current size. Probably the one area that in the near term should grow is sales because we have a lot of sales channels to build out in sales and marketing, we would expect to model that growth with sales growth because per GAAP we had only have five or six sales guys in the US right now and similarly in Europe, so there are many areas of the world where we can increase our penetration by increasing our sales and marketing growth.  We’re very careful. Michael and I are very conservative, so we’re not going to overspend, but we would expect sales and marketing to grow with sales and R&D and G&A would be a little bit less just one of the factors, R&D because it’s difficult and G&A because we don’t really need to grow that fast.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities: What percentage roughly of SG&A is the S?
Richard Neely Jr.: I think it’s about 60/40.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities: 60/40 sales to G&A or the other way around?
Richard Neely Jr.: Sales and marketing basically.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities: Sales and marketing is 60?
Richard Neely Jr.: The marketing is higher than G&A.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities: Okay. That’s helpful. Thanks and congrats again.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tori Sanburg with Thomas Weisel Partners, please proceed.
Tori Sanburg - Thomas Weisel Partners: Good afternoon, great quarter. A couple of questions, first of all, Mike you mentioned the TV market still seems strong here in October. Have you seen any changes at all in the notebook market so far?
Michael Hsing: Still very similar, and we don’t know how long it will last.
Richard Neely Jr.: We’ve seen market data. Q3 was a big unit quarter and Q4 there’s supposed to be slight growth, so that’s our plan, but we haven’t seen any corroborating evidence there, one way or the other.
Tori Sanburg - Thomas Weisel Partners: Did you run into any supply constraint issues in your markets not necessarily your products but from other component makers?
Michael Hsing: No, we don’t notice that, either for the notebook business or TV business, we are small component shipping for those ODMs or for us it is difficult to know what their constraint was at all.
Tori Sanburg - Thomas Weisel Partners: I know you don’t give booking data, but could you talk qualitatively about forecast from your customers. Are those forecasts getting better same or worse?
Michael Hsing: I think they’re similar and they are very much to hold to seasonality, just like in the last year.
Richard Neely Jr.: In terms of quality, Tori, I can’t recognize any change, better or worse.
Tori Sanburg - Thomas Weisel Partners: Okay. And you mentioned you plan to release five new charger products by the end of the year, what would be some of the main applications for those chargers?
Michael Hsing: I don’t know if the five chargers are out there. We plan to release a number of the LDO products and the chargers and some other high voltage products in the recent quarter.
Tori Sanburg - Thomas Weisel Partners: Okay, and your 40-volt products, when should we expect to see some revenue from those?
Michael Hsing: Any product that we introduce, we expect to see the revenue about 12 to 18 months and that’s almost all of our products will follow that similar pattern, other than our MiniMonster product, we see ramping up a lot faster.
Tori Sanburg - Thomas Weisel Partners: And then just lastly, would you care to break just roughly by end market your revenues? Meaning is notebook half, is it a third, just trying to get a bit of flavor of that?
Michael Hsing: For those new products?
Tori Sanburg - Thomas Weisel Partners: No, your total revenues this quarter.
Michael Hsing: Total revenues, then Rick can answer that.
Richard Neely Jr.: Well, the only one you can reliably do is to look at the CCFL number knowing that most of that are notebook computers and then you can divide that by notebook units, other than that it’s too difficult because, again the same DC power measure chip can be in five different applications and we don’t get that kind of data from our supply chain so it’s more of a guess. The only one that we haven’t really, couldn’t get a handle on is CCFL because it’s a unique part. No one else has one and it only goes one place.
Tori Sanburg - Thomas Weisel Partners: Okay, just one final question, could you give us tax guidance for Q4 and ’08 please?
Richard Neely Jr.: I said the non-GAAP rates for the year will stay at around 25%. Our effective tax rate for the year is about that right now. Quarter by quarter, it’s hard to say, but that’s probably fair for ’07 and if we have any changes for ’08, we’ll let you know in the next call.
Tori Sanburg - Thomas Weisel Partners: Great quarter again, thanks.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs, please proceed.
Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs: Hi, thanks very much. Rick, just wanted to clarify one more item on the inventory, so were you basically saying that your channel inventory declined during the quarter?
Richard Neely Jr.: Yes.
Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs: So really, your shipments that you kind of look at them on an end market perspective were even higher than what you reported because you’re facing that head wind?
Richard Neely Jr.: We don’t do a resale but I guess.
Michael Hsing: That’s the difference, yes.
Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs: Right, but you recognized those, right?
Michael Hsing: Right.
Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Why do you think your distributors are reducing inventories of your products when they’re facing such a significant growth?
Michael Hsing: Well, because remember almost two years ago, we had inventories issues from our distributors and so we control very tightly. We tightened the leash since then.
Richard Neely Jr.: Well, we tightened the leash. The other part too is it’s just the basic economics of it or the amount of inventories substantially higher. They have to pay us in 30 days, so if we just look back and I mean, our revenue numbers are 50% higher almost than a year ago, so the distributor just from a cash basis, they are just being a little bit lean as well.
Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs: Okay, that’s helpful, and then secondly, I think you had said last quarter that at some point in the quarter it led to your CCFL products for an allocation with your customers, your business grew roughly in line with notebook shipments, so that seems okay, but did you get any sense at all that you might have over shipped end demand? Is that the kind of thing you’d be able to see from where you sit?
Michael Hsing: Well, so far, we ship what our customers buy. And we look at the overall market the same way as you do and then when our Q4 and the Q1 with the notebook, it is a notebook volume.
Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs: Okay, and now on the DC to DC business which is up 34% sequentially and that’s I think the second best sequential growth you’ve had in that business ever, what are some of the chunkier items in there you can call out for us just to understand a little bit what drove that significant growth, were there significant designs that ramped or what else can you point to, to help us understand?
Michael Hsing: As I said, actually back a year and a half ago, we said that we will have a lot of design wins in the flat TV area, and this is the result of that, and this year in the third quarter and at this quarter, we’ve seen a significant TV unit growth and MPS is ultimately benefiting from it.
Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs: Sure, I know you can’t really distinguish kind of where exactly your chips end up in the end markets, but you have a sense of whether TVs may be close to half of your DC to DC business?
Michael Hsing: Oh no. Not near that. We see that a few percentage of the growth either come from the TV side. That’s how we can identify a clear winner from the rest of the market. Actually, overall, our product applications, we have more applications and all these applications and the units are growing, the units grew in the third quarter.
Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs: Okay, and then just lastly, I think Rick was mentioning that there has been some increased traction in some of the broader based markets in the US, is that for your Abnet relationship or are there channels?
Richard Neely Jr.: It’s both. Abnet is doing well. I mean doing per quarter what we did per year, a year ago, so the sales team is pleased because as you recall, when we signed up Abnet last year, they had to start from scratch. They are basically out there to get new design in industrial and smaller markets in the US that we don’t have the sales channel to cover so they have to start from scratch and do that 18 months design cycle just like we would with any product and they’re doing a good job, pretty much 18 months into it they’re starting to get some good traction. The other part of Michael’s comment was more about business that doesn’t show up in the US numbers, but gets transferred to Asia. So the design team and sales team in the US are doing a good job generating a lot of business that ends up being built in Asia, but the design win is done in the US.
Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie with Raymond James, please proceed.
Steven Smigie - Raymond James: I was hoping you could talk a little bit about seasonality after Q1 and also it seems like Q2 would be a pretty big ramp and then Q3 even bigger ramp and then Q4 back down a little bit.
Richard Neely Jr.: That’s typically how it happens. Q1 typically goes down 10% to 15%, some of it is just you just take the number of days of the Chinese New Year divided by the number of manufacturing days and you almost come up with that number. Ours are not the kind of products that people backlog. They buy them when they need them and when the factories are running, they don’t buy them but we’re pretty basic products that they expect to have available so they don’t order six months in advance, so that’s why we typically have the Q1 dip. And Q2 goes up, Q3 is our strongest quarter right now because of our strong notebook and consumer mix. Q4 is usually flat to slightly down, that’s our typical Q4, so what you’ll find is the second half is usually, it’s more like a 55/45 spread or whatever. If you take your annual number and it will be much greater in the second half or 60/40, I guess, is more likely.  The second half is significantly higher than the first half. So it does make us a little difficult to model from some of the larger companies where they’re all spread out kind to tend to have incremental quarterly growth and we have surges and decline, but because we’re a smaller company dependent on different markets, we don’t have the broad industrial, medical markets so sort of even it out.
Steven Smigie - Raymond James: Okay, and specifically, what do you expect seasonality to be for Q2 next year?
Richard Neely Jr.: Next year, it’s too early to call that.
Michael Hsing: I think it will just follow as I said earlier, I think it will follow our past. and Q2 will be stronger than Q1 and the Q1 is the weakest.
Richard Neely Jr.: Q3 is stronger.
Michael Hsing: Q3 is the strongest and much stronger than Q2 and Q4 is flat or a little lower. That is the pattern that we had in the last four or five years.
Steven Smigie - Raymond James: Okay, turning to your operating expenses, touching on a little bit on some questions asked earlier. I was looking at the percentage of revenue in this quarter, it dropped pretty significantly. I understand the way you explained your GAAP and non-GAAP stuff right and I guess partly I would guess that was just because you had such fast revenue growth. And so, as I look out to this, the quarter you have got in here seems like that percentage should come back up again and then, with that, it kicked back up even a little bit more, Q1 is you have that sort of revenue weakness there but maybe, right now, again as we get into ’08, sort of following up a bit on earlier questions there.
Richard Neely Jr.: Yes, that is correct, and in Q3, I mean our non-GAAP operating income was 29% so it almost hit our model 30. Obviously, Q4 expenses will creep up a little bit as they always do and revenue will flatten out and will go down slightly so, the margins will drop a little bit.  In Q1, they dropped even further and then they go back up so you have to average an amount for the year. Our operating expenses do not fluctuate a lot. So, when you have a big quarter, the only thing that it fluctuated in this quarter was the variable expenses for rep commissions and sales commissions of course and things like that will go up but in general, you grow your business 30% a quarter, you don’t increase your apex that much in a chip company. So that is what you will see, the operating margins will move with the sales movement.
Steven Smigie - Raymond James: Okay, great thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sung Perry with Lieberman. Please proceed.
Sung Perry - Lieberman: Hey guys, great quarter. I just have a couple of questions. First thing, on the CCFL side, did you guys gain any share this quarter or the benefits of that is all really next year.
Michael Hsing: The benefits, benefit from litigation is next year. This year, we don’t know. I don’t think so. Our loyal customers, they have a volume ramp up and our units grew with them.
Sung Perry - Lieberman: So, it is just market trend right there, so if you gained any share from all the litigations that is all next year, that still has to come?
Richard Neely Jr.: Yeah, I guess.
Michael Hsing: I do not think so, they can design that thing that quick.
Richard Neely Jr.: Yeah, it takes nine to 12 months, I think. Many people have used MPS in the past, so we might have a faster design cycle than normal, but even that is a nine to 12 months and no one is going to stop their notebook production line to put it there, they’re going to wait until the next models come out next spring.
Michael Hsing: But it could happen.
Sung Perry - Lieberman: Are you saying next year is too quick, or are you saying this year is too quick?
Richard Neely Jr.: This year.
Michael Hsing: I mean, this year is too quick. Logically, that would be too quick, although, it can happen.
Richard Neely Jr.: Typically, they are not going to stop their production line to replace them unless there is some major reason, but they would look at you for their next set of notebook models with a typical release a new line in the spring, or the next set of notebook models that come out, that’s what we’re competing for.
Sung Perry - Lieberman: So hopefully that helps next year. How big is the Abnet relationship for you guys and what kind of potential if we look a couple of years out kind of what US distribution could do for you guys.
Michael Hsing: Well, the US analog business market is still very, very large. So we don’t separate that reporting on the Abnet revenue now, but
Sung Perry - Lieberman: Is it 10% of revs yet?
Michael Hsing: No, its not 10% now. If its 10%, probably, we would report it. It’s a very lucrative market and we have very high hopes in it.
Sung Perry - Lieberman: As we look longer term, is that something that 10% to 20% of rev in a couple of years out or it is incremental?
Michael Hsing: It is difficult. Abnet business is slow, steady growth. We do not expect to have 20 or more than 20% in the next couple of years.
Richard Neely: Yeah that would be 10%to 20% and actually, yours would be too high, it would be less than that.
Sung Perry - Lieberman: I see, and can you talk about some of the new products that you are introducing. I mean, before you used to talk mostly about, MiniMonsters. Can you go through the MiniMonsters, the LDOs, the battery chargers, just in terms of kind of the time that you are addressing, how much time growth did you get in ’08, in ’09?
Michael Hsing: We do not have a clear, but we now expanded our extent greatly and we don’t have those products, and there are a lot of units out there, a lot of products that we’re getting. So, those are products we would just focus on. The key is we’re focused on broadening our product line and same customers, same design engineers, same system design engineers that we talk to, they can use not only one product, they can use a whole range of a product from MPS. I mean, the efficiency of ourselves will increase as we grow.
Sung Perry - Lieberman: Can you maybe do a high level for some of these products? I mean, are these kind of, the different products you are talking about, are these kind of fifty to a hundred million SIMS, or hundred to five hundred or how should we be thinking about these.
Michael Hsing: All the are new products including MiniMonsters, okay are close to a billion.
Sung Perry - Lieberman: Each of them or all combined.
Michael Hsing: Combined.
Sung Perry - Lieberman: Okay, okay. And what is your current stand right now, you think, before all these new products?
Michael Hsing: Very low.
Sung Perry - Lieberman: No, I mean but is your stand going from 500 to a billion or is it going from 200 to a billion?
Richard Neely, Jr.: Oh, I mean for example, high current or high voltage, until we have the MiniMonsters family, we have zero, we didn’t have any products that served that and same thing, with the battery charger and the LDOs we didn’t have a product. So, Mike will talk to you about the SAM, our SAM is low, we do not sell a lot of them yet.
Sung Perry - Lieberman: Okay, so you are saying that it is kind of like billion dollars of additional market and you know you are hoping to get whatever portion of that basically, okay. And how much do you need to forward spend there, I mean, if you are running at a hundred million dollars a year or slightly more than that and you have an opportunity that is massively greater. How do you need to forward spend a lot, or you can target a lot of that with your existing and the past investment?
Richard Neely, Jr.: Well, our current R&D is that spending. The products that we are making now, that are introduced will produce revenue of 18 to 24 months from now. So, it’s always the case in general of most analogue companies. What you spend on R&D now is your two years forward products so we are spending that money now. That’s why our R&D is growing significantly this year and that we’ve talked a lot about every quarter . All the new product introductions and all the new product costs and the new product maps and all those types of things, we’ve talked about the increases in our R&D this year which have been substantial, but that’s what we’re doing, we’re putting out these products. We should see the revenues going forward.
Michael Hsing: Well the key is that we have settled down but suddenly we will get a wing of our customers, our competitors, very difficult to dig us out and we expand from there.
Sung Perry - Lieberman: Now, in terms of the DC to DC market and all the new products that are coming, I mean, should we expect similar sort of growth in ’08 or does it accelerate, or is it really ’09 where things start to really kick in the high gear again with all the new stuff lining up?
Richard Neely, Jr.: I’ll give you my answer first, as the CFO I am more concerned and I think 20% to 25% is really good in the analog market so I’d be happy with that. I do not know about Michael though.
Michael Hsing: Well, last time we grew 100% and the year after we grew 6% and the Wall Street didn’t give us any credit and you guys are looking at us as we grew 20%. That is what we targeted 20%.
Sung Perry - Lieberman: Okay, so you are hoping to do more but you don’t want to promise anything?
Richard Neely, Jr: That is right.
Sung Perry - Lieberman: Okay, thank you guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Krishna Shankar with JMP Securities. Please proceed.
Krishna Shankar - JMP Securities: Yes, congratulations on a good quarter also and I have a couple of questions, one, as we look at your exposure to notebooks, is the CCFL part of your revenues pretty much a proxy for notebook or are there products in the other areas we should look at for your notebook exposure?
Richard Neely, Jr: Well CCFL does include, we do have some half bridge and full bridge parts and some going to monitors and TVs but the vast majority goes in the notebooks. They also go into similar size screens. I mean there are products with screens of that size, a notebook type screen that are lit by CCFL by single lamps. So yeah, generally, it is relatively closed proxy, it’s probably 80% or 85% of the revenue goes in a notebook.
Krishna Shankar - JMP Securities: Okay, and as you ramp out all the new products in both MiniMonster and DC to DC, as you look at ’08 or maybe ’09 can you talk about exposure to other more stable markets which don’t have as much seasonality such as industrial medical, telecom and areas like that.
Richard Neely, Jr: Michael is going to answer but I got one little tidbit that I just got from the sales guy that kind of gives you how long it takes to get in the industrial market, just last week you if you remember we are in 2007. Last week, our sales guys were very excited, there’s a major industrial guy in the US, we won’t give the name of the equipment maker, that has invited MPS to bid on the Next Generation product which is the 2009 contract which will start taking effect in 2011 and run through 2016. Okay, so that’s the US industrial market, it takes a long time to get in but once you’re in, you’re in it for a long time. So the US we’re talking here is excited about getting them a contract, it’s not going to kick in for three years, but industrial designs will turn over in five or seven years in the US. So, that is the problem with the growth, it’s slow and steady but it takes years to have fast growth. MPS has really been built on the faster growing consumer business side in Asia, so let us turn over the Michael to see some of the current issues.
Michael Hsing: Well, I want to really clarify this, the perception is that growth is not only from the MiniMonsters. All the older products this year grew really well, as in the beginning of the last year; I said we wanted to focus on a different market segments and we did. As a result this year, we grew as we expected.
Krishna Shankar - JMP Securities: Okay great. Can you reiterate you longer term model again for growth and operating margins?
Robert Neely, Jr.: Well, operating margin, our target is to have operating margins with non-GAAP with store comp of 30% to 32% that’s our target, we are pretty much almost there this quarter. So that’s our goal. If you keep growing revenues so we can reach that operating margin.
Krishna Shankar - JMP Securities: Okay, and my final question is, can you talk about the competitive environment whether it is new and used analogue companies or other Asian analog companies. Can you talk about the competitive environment in general?
Michael Hsing: Well, we compete multiple analogue companies in US and the analogue business is still dominated by the US companies, and that we compete with almost all the US companies. Asia companies are still small, but they are growing.
Krishna Shankar - JMP Securities: Okay, thank you.
Michael Hsing: Okay.
Operator: And there are no further questions in queue at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Neely for closing remarks.
Robert Neely: Well, thank you everyone for participating on our third quarter conference call. We look forward to a full set of industrial meetings in November which has been announced on our website and we look forward to talking to you for the fourth quarter results next year. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you for your attendance in today’s presentation. This concludes the conference. You may now disconnect. Goodbye.
Robert Neely: Thank you.
