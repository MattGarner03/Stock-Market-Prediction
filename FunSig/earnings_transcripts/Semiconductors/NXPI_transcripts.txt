===== 2025 Q1  (2025-04-29 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the NXP First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference call is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Jeff Palmer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Jeff Palmer: Thank you, Tanya, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to NXP Semiconductor's first quarter earnings call. With me on the call today is Kurt Sievers, NXP's President and CEO; and Bill Betz, our CFO. The call today is being recorded and will be available for replay from our corporate website. Today's call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause NXP's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the macroeconomic impact on the specific end markets in which we operate, the sale of new and existing products and our expectations for the financial results for the second quarter of 2025. NSP undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements. For a full disclosure on forward-looking statements, please refer to our press release. Additionally, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are driven primarily by discrete events that management does not consider to be directly related to NXP's underlying core operating performance. Pursuant to Regulation G, NXP has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our first quarter 2025 earnings press release, which will be furnished to the SEC on Form 8-K and available on NXP's website in the Investor Relations section. Now, I'd like to pass the call to Kurt.
Kurt Sievers: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining our call today. I will review our quarter one performance and then discuss our guidance for quarter two. Beginning with quarter one, our revenue was $10 million better than the midpoint of our guidance. The revenue trends in the mobile and communication infrastructure markets were slightly above expectations, while performance in the automotive and industrial and IoT markets were slightly below our expectations. Taken together, NXP delivered Q1 revenue of $2.84 billion, a decrease of 9% year-on-year. Non-GAAP operating margin in quarter one was 31.9%, 260 points below the year ago period and about 40 basis points above the midpoint of our guidance. Year-on-year performance was a result of the lower revenue and related gross profit fall through, partially offset by lower operating expenses. From a channel perspective, distribution inventory was in line with our guidance at 9 weeks below our long-term target of 11 weeks. From a direct sales perspective, we continue to support Western Tier 1 auto customers with their ongoing digestion of on hand inventory against the backdrop of a cloudy automotive demand environment. Now, let me turn to our expectations for the second quarter. We are operating in a very uncertain environment influenced by tariffs with volatile direct and indirect effects. As of today, the direct impact of the current tariffs is immaterial to our financials. However, the indirect impacts of current tariffs related to future and demand and supply chain remains unknown. As of now, we are not seeing any abnormal customer order pull-ins or push-outs which could be associated with the tariffs. And other than the potential indirect impacts of tariffs, we are seeing some positive trends. These trends include improving distribution customer backlog levels as well as stabilized order signals from our direct customers. Additionally, we are experiencing an increase in short cycle orders as well as some spot product shortages leading to customer escalations. Taken together, these trends have historically been indicative of the early innings of improving cycle dynamics. Therefore, our guidance reflects these improving cycle trends and the immaterial direct tariff impact, but we have not incorporated any judgment of indirect impact from tariffs. Given the uncertain macro environment, we are only providing guidance for the second quarter. We are guiding Q2 revenue to $2.9 billion, down 7% versus the second quarter of 2024, and up 2% sequentially. At the midpoint, we expect the following trends in our business during quarter two. Automotive is expected to be flat versus quarter two 2024 and up in the low single-digit percent range versus quarter one 2025. Industrial and IoT is expected to be down in the mid-teens percent range year-on-year and up in the mid-single-digit percent range versus quarter one 2025. Mobile is expected to be down in the mid-single-digit percent range on both the year-on-year and the sequential basis. And finally, communication infrastructure and other is expected to be down in the high 20% range versus quarter two '24, flat versus quarter one '25. Our outlook assumes that we will continue to undership end demand in automotive, and we expect channel inventory to be flattish at 9 weeks against our long-term target of 11 weeks. Before turning to your questions, I would like to review a strategic acquisition which we announced in the first quarter. On February 10, we announced the intention to acquire Kinara for $307 million, an industry leader in high-performance, energy efficient, and programmable neural processes. This acquisition provides a scalable platform for AI-powered edge-based systems combining NXP's broad portfolio of processing, connectivity, security, and advanced analog solutions with Kinara's AI NPU hardware and software. We believe there is an inflection point in the industrial and IoT markets which is creating demand for intelligent edge AI compute solutions. Customers need high-performance, secure low-power processing which takes place locally at the edge. This eliminates the requirement to connect to the cloud for the execution of AI models in order to meet the critical latency, security, and real-time edge requirements. Kinara already has meaningful customer engagements within the factory automation, building and energy management, healthcare, and smart home end markets. We expect the regulatory approval should be complete by the end of second quarter. The transaction will not have a material impact on the financial model shared at our Investor Day in November. We expect Kinara to be accretive to our current financial model by 2028 and it will accelerate our overall position in the industrial and IoT markets. In summary, NXP's first quarter results and guidance for the second quarter underpin Porsche's optimism that NXP continues to effectively navigate with challenging set of market conditions. We are operating in a very uncertain environment influenced by tariffs with volatile direct and indirect effects. Considering these external factors, we are redoubling our efforts to manage what is in our direct control, enabling NXP to drive solid profitability and earnings. Now, finally, on a more personal note, after deep reflection, I have decided to retire from NXP at the end of 2025. My past 30 proud years with NXP, including 7 years as President and 5 years as CEO, have been hugely fulfilling. I am incredibly thankful for the invaluable privilege to work with so many amazing people and having the opportunity to co-create NXP's future and drive technological leadership for a better world. For three decades, I've passionately prioritized and dedicated my energy to NXP and all of our stakeholders. Now, the time has come to start planning for a shift and focus on my personal journey. I am looking forward to entering the next chapter of my life in good health, taking more time for family, friends, and personal passions. And I would like to congratulate Rafael on his promotion to President of NXP. I look much forward to the next six months of transition period before Rafael assumes the Chief Executive Officer role for NXP in October. Worked very closely together with all of you in the upcoming period. Building on more than 10 years of experience in NXP, Rafael will be an excellent leader to execute on NXP strategy to bring intelligent systems to the edge in the automotive and industrial IoT end markets. And with that, I would like to pass the call over to you Bill, for a review of our financial performance.
Bill Betz: Thank you, Kurt, and good morning to everyone on today's call. As Kurt has already covered the drivers of the revenue during Q1 and provided our revenue outlook for Q2, I will move to the financial highlights. Overall, our Q1 financial performance was good. Revenue was slightly above the midpoint of our guidance range, while gross profit was in line and operating expenses were below the midpoint of our guidance. Taken together, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.64 or $0.05, better than the midpoint of our guidance. We continue to manage sales into the distribution channel consistent with our guidance of 9 weeks. Now, moving to the details of Q1. Total revenue was $2.84 billion, down 9% year-on-year, slightly above the midpoint of our guidance range. We generated $1.59 billion in non-GAAP gross profit and reported a non-GAAP gross margin of 56.1%, down 210 basis points a year-on-year, and 20 basis points below the midpoint of our guidance range due to product and channel mix. Total non-GAAP operating expenses $686 million, or 24.2% of revenue, down $50 million year-on-year, and $14 million below the midpoint of our guidance range. From a total operating profit perspective, non-GAAP operating profit was $904 million, and non-GAAP operating margin was 31.9%, down 260 basis points year on year, and 40 basis points above the midpoint of our guidance range. Non-GAAP interest expense was $80 million, while taxes for ongoing operations were $143 million, or a 17.4% non-GAAP effective tax rate. Non-controlling interest was $7 million, and results from equity account investees associated with our joint venture manufacturing partnerships was $1 million. Taken together, below the line items were $3 million unfavorable, which is our guidance. Stock based compensation, which is not included in our non-GAAP earnings was $127 million. Now, I would like to turn to the changes in our cash in debt. Our total debt at the end of Q1 was $11.73 billion, up $871 million sequentially due to a combination of a second tranche of the European investment bank loan and the initial results of our new commercial paper program. Our ending cash balance was $3.99 billion, up $696 million sequentially due to the cumulative effect of additional liquidity, capital returns, CapEx investments and cash generation during the quarter. The resulting net debt was $7.74 billion and we exited the quarter with a trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA of $4.89 billion. Our ratio of net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of Q1 was 1.6x, and our 12-month adjusted EBITDA interest coverage ratio was 19.2x. During Q1, we repurchased $303 million of our shares and paid $258 million in cash dividends. After the end of the quarter and through April 25th, we bought an additional $90 million of our shares under an established 10b5-1 program. Turning to working capital metrics, days of inventory was 169 days, an increase of 18 days sequentially and slavish on a dollar basis. Days receivable were 34 days, up 4 days sequentially and days payable were 62 days, down 3 days sequentially. Taken together, our cash conversion cycle was 141 days. Cash flow from operations was $565 million, and net CapEx was $138 million or 5% of revenue, resulting in non-GAAP free cash flow of $427 million or 15% of revenue. During Q1, we paid a $125 million capacity access fee related to VSMC, which is included in our cash flow from operations. Additionally, we paid $16 million into ESMC, our equity accounting foundry joint venture under construction in Germany and a $20 million into VSMC, our equity accounted Foundry joint venture under construction in Sinaloa, both of which are included in our cash flow from investing. Now, turning to our expectations for the second quarter. As Kurt mentioned, we anticipate Q2 revenue to be $2.9 billion plus or minus about $100 million. At the midpoint, this is down about 7% year-on-year and up about 2% sequentially. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be 56.3%, plus or minus 50 basis points. Operating expenses are expected to be about $710 million plus or minus about $10 million. The sequential increase is driven by the normal annual merit increases and the previously disclosed annual license payment modestly offset by our ongoing restructuring to make room for the three pending acquisitions. Taken together, we see non-GAAP operating margin to be 31.8% at the midpoint. Please note our second quarter guidance does not incorporate the three pending acquisitions. We estimate non-GAAP financial expense to be about $88 million. We expect the non-GAAP tax rate to be 17.4% of profit before tax. Non-controlling interest will be about $9 million and results from equity account investees about $2 million. For Q2, we suggest for modeling purposes, you use an average share count of 255 million shares. We expect stock-based compensation, which is not included in our non-GAAP guidance to be $115 million. Taken together at the midpoint, this implies a non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.66. Furthermore, we continue to operate our internal fabs in the low 70% range, and we expect our days of inventory to be flattish into Q2. Turning to uses of cash, we expect capital expenditures to be around 4% of that. We will pay a $35 million capacity access fee to VSMC. Additionally, we will make a $60 million equity investment into ESMC and a $50 million equity investment into VSMC, our two equity accounted foundry joint ventures under construction. Pending the regulatory approval of the three acquisitions, it will result in a cash payment of $1.1 billion and we will redeem the $500 million tranche of debt due in May from our current cash balance of $4 billion. After closing these acquisitions, our ongoing restructuring actions are intended to enable NXP to get into its stated long-term operating expense model of 23% in the second half of 2025. In closing, I would like to highlight a few focus areas for NXP. First, as Kurt mentioned in his prepared remarks, our outlook does not consider unknown indirect and market demand impacts because of global tariffs, while the direct impact of the current tariffs are immaterial to our financial guidance. Second, with the upcoming CEO transition, there is no change to our long-term financial model and capital allocation strategy, and lastly, we are operating in a very uncertain environment influenced by global tariffs. Considering these external factors on the end markets we operate, we are redoubling our efforts to manage what is in our direct control, enabling NXP to drive solid profitability and earnings while executing our growth strategy. With that, I would like to now turn it back to the operator for your question.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will be coming from Christopher Muse of Cantor Fitzgerald.
Christopher Muse : Kurt, you will clearly be very missed. Thank you for everything that you have done over the last five years and obviously before that as President. I guess maybe first question, you highlighted in your prepared remarks the Kinara acquisition, but you have also made acquisitions with Aviva and TTTech. I guess my question is this. As you think about competition from China in the MCU world, how much of these acquisitions are defensive in terms of a world where MCU discrete purchases probably decrease and focus on software is more important or conversely more offensive in terms of true differentiation both in the auto and in the industrial side of things where you look to really separate yourselves?
Kurt Sievers: Many thanks, and good morning, CJ. Indeed, we have had three acquisitions now, Kinara, Aviva, and TTTech Auto. Kinara is the AI edge compute, which I just discussed briefly on the call. Aviva is about asynchronous connectivity in the car between displays and cameras and for very high data rates in one direction versus not in the other, so clearly beating what Ethernet can do. And TTTech Auto is indeed a very strong software complement to our platform. And to answer your question in brief, this is clearly an offensive addition, complement to our product strategy as we have it today to make us more differentiated with our compute portfolio. I was a little bit hesitating, CJ, because it's not just the compute portfolio because especially the Aviva and TTTech Auto is the whole offering with our core right platform for the software region. Clearly, this will come to good play in China, but I have to emphasize, CJ, not only in China. I mean, this is a global offering, but it will certainly also further help our, China for China strategy.
Christopher Muse: Very helpful. Then as a quick follow-up, could you give us a kind of, level set where we are in the auto correction? You talked about under-shipping and demand. I guess, when you now expect excess inventory to be digested and how are you thinking from a geographic perspective? I think three months ago, you talked about China strong, America is kind of slowly recovering and Europe weak. Is that kind of consistent with where we are again today?
Kurt Sievers: Yes. Actually, quarter two guidance is a bit of a turning point. Above and beyond the comments I made in my prepared remarks about better backlog with some distribution customers, about stabilization of the order patterns from direct customers, some early innings of escalations because of supply shortages with very short-term orders. But the turning point of order in the second quarter is actually in my view that second quarter we are flat year-on-year. And that's the first time after five quarters. So, we look now back to five quarters of year-on-year declines in automotive and this second quarter of calendar 2025 is the first time that we are flat. It is indeed, CJ, a combination of a stabilizing order pattern from the direct customers with somewhat slower digestion of above inventory in the Western Tier 1s. I'd say, some was slower because some of them are done and we still have a few left, which are still absorbing over inventory. So, this is still under shipping through their end demand. At the same time, we see a pretty nice pickup in order pace, especially from Asia for the second quarter automotive. And Asia here is a combination of China and Japan. There admittedly that also has seasonal components. China automotive is always seasonally weak in Q1 and then picks up the pace in Q2 and that's exactly what we see. And in Japan, there is another element, which makes Q2 always stronger than Q1, which has to do with the price adjustment. I talked about global pricing, in the last earnings call, and I hope I made a clear comment that most of the Western customers will settle pricing for the full year by January 1. For Japan, that is by April 1. And natural customer behavior is that they hesitate to buy before they have the new prices. So, Japan was waiting, and that's why we see now an uptick in Japan into the second quarter. Since it will be one of the next questions for sure, I'd say it upfront. With having all the price negotiations with the large customers now settled for the year, I can reconfirm and with confidence what I said last earnings, which is we will have for this year a low single-digit price erosion for the whole company for the year. So, no change to what we said last year. It's just that now the confidence is fully in place, since we also closed and operate and execute in Japan.
Operator: Our next question will be coming from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore : Hi, guys. Thanks for having me ask a couple of questions. And Kurt, I want to echo what CJ said. Thank you so much for all your help over the years and congrats and best of luck in retirement. So, I guess my first question is, I know you talked about the direct and indirect not really having an impact on the tariff front. But can you just talk a little bit about how NXP is viewed by the customers and by the various governments? I know where you're technically headquartered, but are you a U.S. company to China? Are your U.S. China for China play? Or does the U.S. consider you a European company? Just trying to talk through the manufacturing footprints you have and the flexibility that might provide.
Kurt Sievers: Yeah, thanks. Thanks, Ross, and good morning. Let me first reiterate indeed what I said about direct and indirect impact. The direct impact of the current tariffs we consider immaterial to our financial guidance. So there is a tiny little bit, but it is immaterial. Therefore, consider zero. What I did say about the indirect impact is that it is completely confusing because things are changing by the day. I think today is another reiteration planned for the 25% auto. So that keeps changing and we don't see a consistent pattern. But I would also clearly say we have been very busy talking to all of our customers across the world, asking them what they plan to do, what they have possibly done. And there is neither pull in nor push out effects at this point in time. And we also don't, we didn't really foresee anything for the second quarter from an indirect perspective. So that's why the comment in my prepared remarks. The second part of your question is indeed yielding something we essentially see as an opportunity. Especially in China, Ross, as we are seen and of course we position ourselves that way as a European company. Very clearly as a European company with a lot of our manufacturing operations, given our hybrid manufacturing strategy outside of the U.S. so that makes us, I'd say a pretty much appreciated partner for the industry and our customers in China. Now, tariffs have been exempted and coming and going over the last couple of weeks. But clearly, we've seen an opportunity with our China for China strategy from these tariffs. Because our manufacturing structure and our hybrid manufacturing network, which I think I've discussed over the past couple of quarters already, which is very much emphasizing and strongly building a local manufacturing network, is a positive in this. So it's not just how we are seen, Ross, but it's also factually such that I think more than a third of our China for China business today is already manufactured in China. So we already have made a lot of progress in leveraging this advantage. Now, you also asked, are we seen in the U.S.? Well, both in the U.S., we are seen as a U.S. company, which means we are complying with anything that is being asked from us. But I think that the part which gives us potentially a boost and we try to leverage is that the Chinese are seeing us as European and we have already spent, I'd say, two years of changing our supply network to be a better partner from a China for China manufacturing perspective.
Ross Seymore: I guess for my follow-up, I just want to pivot over to the industrial side of things. You gave a lot of color about the order patterns, et cetera, and automotive channel versus direct, et cetera. We've heard from other companies that they're seeing some of the green shoots, and I know those are dangerous words these days, but nonetheless, in the industrial business, I just wondered what you're seeing on that side of things, both kind of direct or geographically, and then, of course, via the channel.
Kurt Sievers: Yeah. As a precursor to this, I'm a little bit humble when it comes to looking at NXP as a bellwether for the industrial sector. I mean, we are comparably small, so I'm a little bit careful in taking my commentary now as a strong direction for the whole industry. What we are seeing is that, actually, in Q1 from a performance perspective, actual performance, but also for the guidance of the second quarter, which is up mid-single-digit. It is more or less by the consumer IoT part than the core industrial part. The ratio is still about the same as we discussed earlier, Ross, which is the 60-40 between core industrial and consumer IoT. But directionally both in Q1, but also now into Q2, it is the consumer IoT part, which is strong on a relative basis. However, I do believe, Ross, that also has to do with company specific design wins. We just have a number of really strong design wins. And again, they are specifically in China, which are now playing out nicely in the first half of this year. So, I don't know we can take this as a proxy for the industry. It's probably pretty specific to NXP.
Operator: Our next question will be coming from Chris Caso of Wolfe Research.
Chris Caso : Yes. Thank you. Good morning. I wonder if you could expand a little bit on some of the comments you made on your China for China strategy and I guess how far that progresses. And I guess ultimately within China, how much of your China revenue do you expect to be able to supply domestically and under which time? And then, maybe you could speak a little bit to the U.S., obviously, because that's something we're waiting the regulations and how much of the U.S. you'd be able to satisfy from the U.S. fab?
Kurt Sievers: Yes. So, good morning, Chris. First of all, the China for China strategy has two legs. One is the manufacturing leg, which I will expand on in a second. The other one, I think structurally or strategically even more important is the road mapping and product generation, dedicated for Chinese customers with the consideration of them as lead customers, given that they are really setting the pace now in the automotive and industrial sector when it comes to innovation. And I might have talked last fall about the fact that I even changed the management team of NXP to the extent that I have a leader now directly reporting to me, who runs the China business to make sure we have full visibility on the highest level in the company on the specific product needs. So, the product road mapping is a very important strategic element. Now, back to your question on the manufacturing side. We have currently about -- by the way, everything I say now is wafer manufacturing. There is different considerations when you think about back end, test and assembly versus strong end wafer manufacturing. I speak now about wafer manufacturing where we have about 30% capability at the moment, to supply or not only capability, it's actually what we do to supply for our China for China business. So, from the revenues which we currently ship, China for China, 30% are actually sourced in China. And of course, we work hard to expand this. Now, don't assume that the rest is in the U.S. You know that we have 60% of our overall vases coming from boundaries, which are typically not in the U.S. So, we have a much higher number, which is non-U.S. sourced, which is then from Europe and other places in Asia serving China. So, it's a much higher number than the 30%, which is already in China. But again, we want to work this as high as possible as soon as possible to have maximum independence here, relative to possible tariffs, to that end. I would actually say, Chris, the tariffs, of course, are now adding uncertainty and complexity, but the China-for-China strategy, which I can speak about here, is not something we now suddenly did because of the tariffs. We've had that actually in place for probably more than two years, given the revenue opportunity which we see for our core markets, automotive and industrial, in China, where we just see that the industry in China is leading the tech now from a global perspective, which is why we've been leaning into this already for a longer time.
Chris Caso: As a follow-up question for Bill, I think you made a comment that you would get to your 30 -- I'm sorry, your 23% expenses, as a percentage revenue target in the second half of the year after accounting for the acquisitions. Could you go into a little more detail on that and what assumptions you're making to get to those numbers?
Bill Betz : Yeah, sure. So, on operating expenses, right, we're not guiding the second half. You can see in Q1 we were favorable against our guidance. So, that means we're ahead of the plan of the restructuring activities. And we're going to continue that into Q2 and Q3 because it's time phase. Think about, at the end of June 30th, we will have probably 1,250 extra employees joining us for a full quarter effect starting Q3 and Q4. And you're right in my prepared remarks. Basically, what we're doing is continue making space for those acquisitions so that we can absorb and hit our model at 23%. Obviously, we're not guiding the second half, but we have scenarios on what revenue we think we want to go do and different levers to go pull against that. But we feel pretty confident we'll land sometime in 2020, the second half of 2025 at the model.
Operator: And our next question will be coming from Francois Bouvignies of UBS.
Francois Bouvignies : And again, Kurt, thank you very much for your help. And you will be missed. Sad to see you leaving, but well-deserved, I have to say as well. The two questions I had is on, firstly, you said, Kurt that you don't see much pull-in so far and not much impact there in terms of all the behavior. Obviously, you managed very well during COVID the inventories in the channel. So my question is, if you were seeing some pull-in at some point, would you allow your customer to increase their inventories or would you control it the way you did during COVID? I mean, how do you want to play this dynamic here, given, I mean, your customers, maybe they would like to increase the buffer and inventories maybe above some level that you would like to see?
Kurt Sievers: Yeah, thanks, and good afternoon, Francois. And by the way, I'm still around for a full half year. So this is not a good time to work. On the pull-ins, so yes, I first of all reconfirm through Q1 and through quarter to date Q2, we have not seen pull-ins. I say that very explicitly. We checked it very carefully, customer-by-customer, because we wanted to be sure that this is clean of that. If it was to happen, I think the underlying policy, Francois, continues to be we don't want this. We don't like that. Now, there could be specific reasons and specific cases with specific customers, where they can explain us why it makes sense, and we might want to do it. But I would say, especially on the distribution side, which is more than 50% of NXP, I think I said in my prepared remarks, we want to stay flat to the 9 weeks inventory into the second quarter, where again, we wouldn't want to allow it. And I also said, and I don't know CJ or Ross asked earlier, we are still busy with some Tier 1 automotive customers to digest inventory. And for that same reason, we don't have a hell of a lot of appetite to consider pull-ins. So, I'd say with possible exceptions always in the range of the moment, we don't want that. We would not want to support.
Francois Bouvignies: Great. Thank you, Kurt. And maybe my follow-up would be for Bill on the gross margin side. I mean, your inventory days are relatively high when you look at the history. You said, you think it will be flat. And then, when I look at the gross margin, you are around 56%, low 56% in H1. I look at the consensus, it has more than 57% gross margin in the second half of the year. So, how should we think about the gross margin here? Because it seems tricky to get a big improvement of gross margin with inventories having to come down on your balance sheet, maybe not in Q2, but in Q3, Q4. So, can you help us our ratio as on the gross margin side trajectory in the second half of the year? Can it go up, despite inventories coming down on your balance sheet? And maybe you can remind us the mix effect.
Bill Betz: Sure, absolutely. Very fair question. So, let me just repeat. In Q1, we had a slight mix, driven by our product and channel mix. And if we hold everything equally and going into Q2, we're just saying, okay, right now our order book is pretty full. We actually see the mix and it says similar mix as Q1 and we're getting the fall through on the higher revenues over fixed cost. That's why we guided the 56.3%. Now, without providing guidance for the second half of 2025, the best way to think about our gross margin is a function of revenue levels before any of our company specific drivers to influence it. So, for example, at a $13 billion revenue annual number level, we will feel very confident at 58% plus or minus, $12 billion, 57%, $11 billion, 56% and again that's a plus or minus 50 basis points. And we demonstrate those levels in the past. Now, from an upside perspective, we obviously have these additional levers to drive gross margin much higher, and they include increasing of our internal utilization, again, that's 70%, and it's staying at 70% because of our inventory, as you said, is at the higher. The consolidation of our 200 millimeter factories, we will be talking more about that in the second half. We're increasing our industrial and IoT go-to-market through our channel. So, we want to focus on addressing that mass market. We also have and by the way, our company-specific accelerated growth drivers are tracking to our growth plans versus Investor Day. I know we're only one quarter in, but everything is good there. We have the normal operational efficiency of our projects to offset just these annual pricing, low single-digit that we occur, so those two offset each other. And a bit longer term, which we've shared all of last year, we will leverage our VSMC 300 millimeter joint venture with Vanguard, which is tracking slightly ahead of schedule. So we feel pretty good about that. So overall, stepping back with the revenue numbers I just gave you, we feel very confident to deliver our long-term gross margin range of 57% to 63%. It really is where revenue comes from and the influence at the starting point, and then you have these levers. On inventory, again, you're right, 169 days is probably the upper bound in my liking for sure related to it. Now you have to think, we managed Q4 going into Q1, we had to manage the absolute dollars because it was the variable orders with our suppliers and we kept utilizations internally. So going into Q2 and also Q3, again, 169 because we have a backlog that we see actually is okay so far for Q3, and so we have to make sure we take that into account to make sure we build the proper product. But as you all know, with the uncertainty around the macro effects related to global tariffs, and more importantly, the number of potential disruptions from a supply chain perspective that could occur and we're starting to read about, we believe holding a bit more inventory is important from the lessons learned from the past. But again, I agree with you, the 169 is the upper balance and we're going to probably adjust this once we learn a little bit more about second half and confidence of second half revenue.
Operator: One moment for our next question, which is coming from Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein Research.
Stacy Rasgon : Bill, first a question for you. So I know you said you weren't guiding the second half. That being said, the OpEx targets, I mean, you're running $710 million a quarter in OpEx, 23% of that would be like $3.1 billion at some point in the second half. You got close to $50 million a quarter in OpEx coming in Q3. So I mean, $750 a quarter would be like $3.3 billion at some point in the second half. I mean, are these the kinds of revenue targets into the second half that you have in mind when you give those OpEx targets? Like, how do we think about that in the context of everything else?
Bill Betz : Well, let me remind you about the Q2 OpEx number. There is a one-time payment from a reoccurring license that occurs each year. That's about 16 million to one of our peers. And I've had that in my prepared remarks. I also mentioned that we continue to restructure the company to make space for these new acquisitions, which I have not disclosed the size from an operating expense standpoint related to it. So we feel pretty confident under the different types of revenue scenarios that we can model because we have other levers to make sure. And remember what I said, where our whole message is we are redoubling our efforts on the areas that we can control. And as you know, Stacy, the two things that we like to control is our spend because that we can do as well as to some extent the inventory time based on what we're building and not building and taking and placing bets with those orders with the unknown macro environment. Hopefully, that helps provide additional context.
Stacy Rasgon : That is helpful. And I guess my follow-up, I guess I'm going to try it. So I know, again, you said you didn't want to give color on the backup, but I mean, any just even soft commentary on how you guys are seeing Q3 right now? Like, I mean, what's typical seasonality in Q3? Is there any reason to expect you could be above or below that typical seasonality? I'm sympathetic to the idea that nobody knows what the hell is going on at all right now, but any color you can give us at all, even a little bit farther out would be helpful if you're so inclined.
Kurt Sievers: Yes. Good morning, Steve. This is Kurt. Look, last year, we did this. And you know that we were wrong. We called the cycle which didn't happen. And one of the learnings from that was that we would not want to repeat this. Now, this year, the situation is even more complex because as I said in my prepared remarks, on the one hand, we do see now what has been always good early innings of the cycle recovery. I mean, that's very positive, what we see there. At the same time, we have this pretty material uncertainty of the indirect impacts from the tariff, which we just cannot figure out what they would possibly mean for the second half. Therefore, we wanted to draw here a clear line, not even for a soft cut for the second half. We just can't. It would be really irresponsible to do it, so we stick to quarter two.
Stacy Rasgon: I mean, how do you even tell the difference between, like, a cycle recovery or green shoots and pull forwards and short-term orders and things like that? Like, wouldn't they look the same?
Kurt Sievers: We can clearly see that because as I gave you a couple of elements. One of them was that the backlog of our distribution end customers, which we see by product, is starting to grow after a long, long period of absolutely no growth or even decline. And that is different customers, new customers, new products. That is totally different to a pull in. Absolutely not pull-in. I also talked about a nicely stabilized order pattern from our direct customers, which has been in decline for long, long, long periods and has now stabilized across the board, which is not a pull in because it's far too even, to be a pull-in. So, we think we can clearly differentiate between those because as I said earlier to our things going forward, we want to avoid, to entertain pull-ins and increase inventories again. So, Sandy, that's for us a pretty, it's a pretty potent point. So, therefore, no, let's stick to the second quarter and see how that plays out with the uncertainty, which is provided to us from the tariff landscape to our customers. Stacy, what we do is, we speak to our customers, and that's where that uncertainty comes from. I mean, it's not us inventing it, but we have no better source than speaking to our customers, big and small across the different, segments, and they have no idea what's what the second half should look like. So, how should we make it up?
Operator: Our next question will be coming from Vivek Arya of Bank of America Securities.
Vivek Arya : Thanks for taking my question. Kurt, I just wanted to go back to these, the green shoots that were discussed because when I look at your Q1 results, auto and industrial sales, industrial IoT sales were actually modestly below expectations. I think the upside came from mobile and the comm segment. And Q2, you're largely guiding to kind of seasonal trends. So, if there are green shoots, is it fair to say they have not yet shown up in this first half and they could show up in the second half? I'm just trying to get a sense for where are these green shoots showing up, if any?
Kurt Sievers: Well, Vivek, you don't know what we thought it was earlier because you prepped us already in Q1 to a soft dive for Q2, where I don't know, I think I said it's maybe flat or very, very slightly up. No, the -- but I think there was something very relevant in your question, which is in Q1, indeed, auto and industrial and IoT were a touch light against guidance, while the other two segments were a touch richer. That has a reason, and it is actually Japan and China. So it is the seasonal weakness of China automotive, which was a little bit stronger than what we had anticipated. Again, we know that that was to happen, so it was forecasted, but not to the full extent it came. And in Japan, I think I talked about this earlier, it is the price change, which is leading customers to finally, and mind you that for several years, we have either increased prices or kept them flat. Now, it was the first time that we offered a low single digit price decline for customers also in Japan. So they were eagerly waiting and held actually back to purchase until they could enjoy the quarter two prices. So it's a bit of a, it's kind of specific and for quarter two, we see things coming up. What you don't see, Vivek, is of course, what underneath is still at work from an inventory digestion perspective with the Tier 1 automotive customers, which is kind of fogging some of the nice uptake, which we are seeing. But again, you didn't call me, you didn't hear me calling the site Vivek. I said, we've seen our trends, which are or have been in the past. And I would say also now indicative of early innings of the cycle recovery. But it's certainly not at the stage that we would say with belts and business, everything is jumping up. That alone would not be given, simply given the uncertainty which our customers face from Paris.
Vivek Arya: And for my follow up, the last, I think, forecast that we saw from IHS or S&P was for light vehicle production to be down, I think kind of low single digit. So let's assume that that is the case, right, including all the effects of tariffs and whatnot. So if that is the industry backdrop, what does that tell us about what NXP's automotive business could do this year, given all your company specific growth drivers?
Kurt Sievers: Well, let me confirm Vivek that indeed S&P just published their latest forecast for the year, which says the SAAR is going to be down by almost 2% this year, which compares to a flat line last quarter. So it has degraded, which maybe or maybe not is a consequence of the tariff fears, could be. But the matter of the fact is indeed, it is now a 2% decline in the forecast versus the flat line before. As we said earlier, we are not guiding the year and we are also not guiding the year for automotive, Vivek. However, the much bigger role continues to play the content increases. All of the growth drivers, which we had laid out at the last Investor Day in November, think about SDVs, think about radar, think about electrification, are nicely at work. So we are on-track on those. And I think it is those content increases which should continue to make us very optimistic about automotive, not that much the SAAR.
Vivek Arya: So does that suggest, they can offset the SAAR decline or are we not willing to say that yet?
Kurt Sievers: Hey, Vivek, I'll take that. I really think we're going to hold off giving any real color on where the second half could be revenue-wise. And you also have to remember, our revenue does not synchronize with global production quarter-over-quarter. There's always a six month or so lag between when we recognize revenue and when a car comes out of the factory somewhere in the world has counted and so. But we really do want to respectfully not address revenue targets or potentials in the second half.
Vivek Arya: Understood. Thank you. Good luck.
Kurt Sievers: Tanya, this will probably be our last, analyst question, if you would.
Operator: And our last question will come from Mark Lipacis of Evercore ISI.
Mark Lipacis : Great. Thanks for taking my question. And Kurt, congrats on your retirement. Really appreciate all your great insights and help over the years and wish you luck. The question, Kurt, is for you. Every two to three years, there's like a new theory on inventory stocking that gets proposed. Before COVID, it was just in time and then during COVID, it became just in case and now it's just in time. And you know, I think our own checks are consistent with your own that some of the Tier 1s are well below normal for their inventory stocking on semis at least. And my question is about like what would you what would you expect on a restocking cycle? Are you of the view that something has foundationally changed like you and your semiconductor peers keep inventories well above normal and your lead times lower than where they had been historically? And then, downstream, your supply chain feels comfortable with the idea of just keeping things very low and then you don't really benefit from a restocking cycle? Or are you of the view that really nothing has changed and this is all driven by lead times, and when lead times stretch, everybody's just going to restock again?
Kurt Sievers: I fear Mark, I have a bit of a frustrating answer. It's more the latter than the first. I'd say more than because there are notable exceptions to this. I don't think that semiconductor companies in general will hold more inventory because it would be just the wrong inventory. That always creates a mix issue. What has got better in several cases is the communication and the alignment between customers and us on understanding the future, on understanding the future, on understanding where it could be bottlenecks. And of course, given the whole geopolitical turmoil, there is also a more sophisticated, diversified supply chain in place now across the world, which eventually, eventually has going forward. But fundamentally, Mark, I fear, as an industry in total, intellectually, we've all learned a lot. Practically not much of that is actually, happening as we speak. The working capital pressure, across the supply chain is just too high, to allow that to happen.
Bill Betz: With that, I guess, just to go to the last question, let me, Mark, have a follow-up.
Kurt Sievers: Sure.
Mark Lipacis : No. That that's all I had. It was simple as that. Thanks so much, Kurt. Appreciate it.
Kurt Sievers: Thanks, Mark. Thank you. Thanks very much, Mark. Let me go to make just a couple of closing comments. We have now a very interesting crosshair situation between what I would call a significant macro uncertainty offered by the tariffs with the current tariffs more the indirect impact of them rather than the direct, which is immaterial for us, standing against the clear early innings of cycle recovery. Mind you that, for example, automotive turns to a flat year-on-year already now in the second quarter. So, those two are competing for this, which are not easy to forecast into, into the rest of the year. With that, we continue to -- I hope, show pretty strong resilience through the truck cycle. And at the same time, offer excellent exposure to the second growth drivers, especially in the automotive and industrial sectors. So we -- when we zoom out from this, we see us nicely on track to [doubling] our EPS by 2030 plus as we had laid out in our Investor Day last year in November. Of course, a lot of turmoil short-term but seeing the cycle coming back now, of course, also shadow but an uncertainty in the macro from tariffs, but fundamentally seeing the cycle coming back, we consider as a pretty nice positive. Thanks for your attention today and see you soon. Thank you.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen that concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-02-04 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the NXP Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jeff Palmer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Jeff Palmer: Thank you, Daniel, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to NXP Semiconductor's Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. With me on the call today is Kurt Sievers, NXP's President and CEO; and Bill Betz, our CFO. The call today is being recorded and will be available for replay from our corporate website. Today's call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause NXP's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the macroeconomic impact on the specific end markets in which we operate, the sale of new and existing products and our expectations for financial results for the first quarter of 2025. NXP undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements. For a full disclosure for forward-looking statements, please refer to our press release. Additionally, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are driven primarily by discrete events that management does not consider to be directly related to NXP's underlying core operating performance. Pursuant to Regulation G, NXP has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our fourth quarter 2024 earnings press release, which will be furnished to the SEC on Form 8-K and is available on NXP's website in the Investor Relations section at nxp.com. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Kurt.
Kurt Sievers: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. We really appreciate you joining our call today. I will review both our quarter four and our full year 2024 performance, and then I will discuss our guidance for quarter one. Beginning with quarter four, our revenue was $11 million better than the midpoint of our guidance. The revenue trends in our end markets were slightly above in Automotive, in line in Mobile, slightly below in Industrial & IoT, while communication infrastructure and other missed our expectations. So taken together, NXP delivered quarter four revenue of $3.11 billion, a decrease of 9% year-on-year. The non-GAAP operating margin in quarter four was 34.2%, 140 basis points below the year-ago period and about 10 basis points above the midpoint of our guidance. Year-on-year performance was the result of the lower revenue and the related gross profit fall-through, partially offset by lower operating expenses. From a channel perspective, we kept distributing inventory flat at eight weeks, below our long-term target of 11 weeks. From a direct sales perspective, we supported Western Tier 1 automotive customers with their continued digestion of on-hand inventory in a cloudy auto demand environment. For the full calendar year 2024, revenue was $12.61 billion, a decrease of 5% year-on-year. Full year non-GAAP operating margin was 34.6%, a 50 basis point compression versus the year ago period due to lower revenue and the related gross profit fall-through, partially offset by lower operating expenses. While the second half of 2024 did not play out as we had originally expected, we rigorously focused on what is under our own control to minimize the impacts on our financial performance. And now let me turn to the specific full year 2024 trends in our focus end markets. In Automotive, full year revenue was $7.15 billion, down 4% year-on-year, primarily a reflection of declining automotive production in Europe and Japan exacerbated by inventory digestion at Western Tier 1 customers in an uncertain automotive demand environment. Against this backdrop, we experienced company-specific growth in our accelerated growth drivers, S32 for the software-defined vehicle, automotive connectivity, radar and electrification. For quarter four, automotive revenue was $1.79 billion, down 6% versus the year-ago period and near the high end of our guidance. Turning to Industry and IoT. Full year revenue was $2.27 billion, down 3% year-on-year, a reflection of ongoing weakness in end demand and tight control of distribution channel inventories. For quarter four, Industry and IoT revenue was $516 million, down 22% versus the year-ago period and slightly below our guidance. In Mobile, full year revenue was $1.49 billion, up 13% year-on-year, thanks to easy compares in the first half of 2023. For quarter four, mobile revenue was $396 million, down about 2% versus the year-ago period and in line with our guidance. In communication infrastructure and other, full year revenue was $1.69 billion, down 20% year-on-year. The year-on-year decline was due to lower sales across the entire portfolio. For quarter four, revenue was $409 million, down 10% year-on-year and below our guidance. Now, I will turn to our expectations for quarter one, 2025. We are guiding quarter one revenue to $2.825 billion, down 10% versus the first quarter of 2024 and down 9% sequentially. From a sequential perspective, this is consistent with our original outlook for quarter one to be seasonally down in the high single-digit range. At the midpoint, we expect the following trends in our business during quarter one. Automotive is expected to be down in the mid-single-digit percent range versus both quarter one 2024 and quarter four 2024. Industrial and IoT is expected to be down in the low double-digit percent range year-on-year and about flat versus quarter four 2024. Mobile is expected to be down in the high single-digit range year-on-year and down in the high-teens percent range versus quarter four 2024. And finally, communication infrastructure and other is expected to be down in the mid-20% range versus quarter one 2024 and down in the upper 20% range versus quarter four 2024. Zooming out, as we enter 2025, we continue to see weakness in Europe. The Americas appear to be bouncing off the bottom and China has implemented several incentive programs. All of this correlates with the reported manufacturing PMI being around 50 with China and the US slightly above and Europe and Japan below. Against this backdrop, we continue to have poor forward visibility, and we are experiencing relatively high turns business, reflective of our short orderly terms. On the customer front, we have completed the majority of our annual price negotiations for calendar year 2025, and we continue to be confident in low single-digit price erosion year-over-year, consistent with our prior commentary. When it comes to inventory in the market, our quarter one guidance contemplates decreasing inventory dollars in both the direct and the distribution channels reflecting under shipment against true end demand. We expect distribution channel inventory to be eight to nine weeks, below our long-term target of 11 weeks. Now, before turning to your questions, I would like to review two strategic acquisitions, which we announced over the last 90 days. Both are vital building blocks to accelerate and expand NXP's CoreRide vision for next-generation software-defined vehicle platforms. Our CoreRide platform comprises a complete suite of secure hardware and software solutions, including processes, connectivity, functional safety and power management as we had laid out in our Investor Day in November. So first, in mid-December, we announced our intention to acquire Aviva Links for $243 million. Aviva is a five-year-old Silicon Valley startup, whose founders have a proven track record in the multi-gigabit Ethernet market. The company is focused on multi-gigabit automotive connectivity technology based on the ASA-MLE standard, which is ideally suited for asymmetric point-to-point connectivity of ADAS sensors and IVI display applications. Asymmetry ASA links are cost and performance optimized for one-way data traffic typical for ADAS and IVI applications, whereas Ethernet is optimized for two-way data traffic going in both directions at the same speed. This addition is fully complementary with NXP's market-leading positions in automotive networking processors, gateways and broad in-vehicle networking solutions. Aviva is an innovation leader in open standards based asymmetrical ASA service with the first to market best-in-class 16-nanometer quad-port 16 gigabit per second uplink product. The company is pre-revenue and has received design awards from OEMs and Tier 1 customers aiming to replace proprietary solutions. We expect Aviva to enhance and complement our broad automotive networking business beginning in 2027. With this, we are capturing a growing application area we have not taken part in by our standards-based solution. This acquisition reinforces our company's specific automotive connectivity accelerated growth driver. And secondly, in early January, we announced our intention to acquire TT Tech Auto for $625 million, a division of TT Tech, a privately held software company based in Austria. TT Tech Auto has extensive knowledge and expertise in the automotive market, especially in the domain of vehicle safety and real-time integration. Its software product called MotionWise, is focused on safety and deterministic real-time performance, key attributes of the software-defined vehicle. MotionWise bridges the silicon hardware layer to the operating system layer, enabling deterministic and safe management of the application software layer. MotionWise is already deployed in over 4 million vehicles with a pipeline of awarded projects, which will enable another 7 million vehicles. The combination of NXP’s CoreRide and TT Tech Auto's MotionWise, will reduce our customers' integration efforts, enabling software reuse and delivering optimal system performance. The combined expertise of NXP and TT Tech Auto will allow to drive faster time to market and lower cost solution in direct collaboration with automotive OEMs. Taken together, these acquisitions enhance our long-term competitive position in the automotive end market. We expect the regulatory approvals should be complete by the end of quarter three '25. These transactions are consistent with our long-term strategic efforts and will begin to contribute revenue within a brief period after close. However, they will not have a material impact on the financial model we recently shared at our Investor Day in November. By 2028 and beyond, these assets will be accretive to our current financial model and will help bootstrap and accelerate our capabilities in specific functional areas. I am very excited about how they will help NXP to offer complete system-level solutions for tomorrow's automotive markets. We do look forward to welcoming the talented teams to NXP. And with that, I would like to pass the call over to you, Bill, for a review of our financial performance.
Bill Betz: Thank you, Kurt, and good morning to everyone on today's call. As Kurt has already covered the drivers of the revenue during Q4 and provided our revenue outlook for Q1, I will move to the financial highlights. Overall, our Q4 financial performance was good. Revenue and non-GAAP gross profit were both modestly above the midpoint of our guidance range, while operating expenses were in line with the midpoint of our guidance. Taken together, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.18 or $0.05 better than the midpoint of our guidance. Furthermore, we continue to tightly manage sales into the distribution channel with weeks of inventory in the channel flat sequentially at eight weeks. I will first provide full year highlights and then move to the Q4 results. Full year revenue for 2024 was $12.61 billion, down 5% year-on-year due to a weak macro in the Western markets, while China continued to be resilient. We generated $7.33 billion in non-GAAP gross profit and reported a non-GAAP gross margin of 58.1%, down 40 basis points year-on-year. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $2.96 billion or 23.5% of revenue, slightly above our long-term operating expense model as we continue to invest in our strategy, supporting long-term profitable growth. Total non-GAAP operating profit was $4.37 billion, down 6% year-on-year. This reflects a non-GAAP operating margin of 34.6%, down 50 basis points year-on-year and in line with our long-term financial model. Non-GAAP interest expense was $275 million. Taxes related to ongoing operations were $686 million or a 16.8% non-GAAP effective tax rate. Noncontrolling interest was $32 million and the results from equity account investees associated with our joint venture manufacturing partnerships was zero. Stock-based compensation, which is not included in our non-GAAP earnings, was $461 million. Turning to full year cash flow performance. We generated $2.78 billion in cash flow from operations and invested $693 million in net CapEx or about 5.5% of revenue. Taken together, this resulted in $2.09 billion of non-GAAP free cash flow or about 17% of revenue. During 2024, we repurchased 5.73 million shares for $1.37 billion and paid cash dividends of $1.04 billion or 37% of cash flow from operations. In total, we returned $2.41 billion to our owners, which was 115% of the total non-GAAP free cash flow generated during the year. Now, moving to the details of Q4. Total revenue was $3.11 billion, down 9% year-on-year, modestly above the midpoint of our guidance range. We generated $1.79 billion in non-GAAP gross profit and reported a non-GAAP gross margin of 57.5%, down 120 basis points year-on-year and in line with the midpoint of our guidance range. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $725 million or 23.3% of revenue, down $66 million year-on-year and in line with the midpoint of our guidance range. From a total operating profit perspective, non-GAAP operating profit was $1.06 billion, and non-GAAP operating margin was 34.2%, down 140 basis points year-on-year and above the midpoint of our guidance range. Non-GAAP interest expense was $74 million, while taxes for ongoing operations were $164 million, or a 16.5% non-GAAP effective tax rate. Noncontrolling interest was $10 million and results from equity account invest fees associated with our joint venture manufacturing partnerships was zero, although $2 million better than our expectations. Stock-based compensation, which is not included in our non-GAAP earnings, was $117 million. Now, I would like to turn to the changes in our cash and debt. Our total debt at the end of Q4 was $10.85 billion, up $672 million sequentially due to the attractively priced loan from the European Investment Bank. Our ending cash balance was $3.29 billion, up $144 million sequentially due to the cumulative effect of additional liquidity, capital returns, CapEx investments and cash generation during Q4. The resulting net debt was $7.56 billion, and we exited the quarter with a trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA of $5.06 billion. Our ratio of net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of Q4 was 1.5 times, and our 12-month adjusted EBITDA interest coverage was 21.3 times. During Q4, we paid $258 million in cash dividends and repurchased $455 million of our shares. After the end of the quarter and through January 31, we bought an additional $101 million of our shares under established 10b5-1 program. Turning to working capital metrics. Days of inventory was 151 days, an increase of two days sequentially, while we maintain distribution channel inventory at eight weeks. As we have highlighted throughout the previous year, given the uncertain demand environment, we continue to make the intentional choice to control the increase of channel inventory. Days receivables were 30 days, flat sequentially, and days payable were 65 days, an increase of five days versus the prior quarter due to improving our payment terms with suppliers. Taken together, our cash conversion cycle was 116 days, an improvement of three days versus the prior quarter. Cash flow from operations was $391 million, and net CapEx was $99 million or 3% of revenue, resulting in non-GAAP free cash flow of $292 million or 9% of revenue. During Q4, we paid a $275 million capacity access fee related to BSFC, which is included in our cash flow from operations. Additionally, we paid $50 million into our -- the ESMC equity accounted foundry joint venture under construction in Germany, which is included in our cash flow from investing. Turning now to our expectations for the first quarter. As Kurt mentioned, we anticipate Q1 revenue to be $2.825 billion, plus or minus about $100 million. At the midpoint, this is down about 10% year-on-year and down about 9% sequentially. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be about 56.3% plus or minus 50 basis points, driven by the return of our annual price concessions and lower revenue fall-through over our fixed costs. Operating expenses are expected to be about $700 million, plus or minus about $10 million. The sequential decline is driven by restructuring the business and lower variable compensation. Taken together, we see non-GAAP operating margin to be 31.5% at the midpoint. We estimate non-GAAP financial expense to be about $80 million. We expect the non-GAAP tax rate to be 17.5% of profit before tax. Noncontrolling interest will be about $5 million and results from equity accounted investees to be about $1 million. For Q1, we suggest for modeling purposes, you use an average share count of 256 million shares. We expect stock-based compensation, which is not included in our non-GAAP guidance to be $128 million. Taken together at the midpoint, this implies a non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.59. Turning to uses of cash. We expect capital expenditures to be around 5% of revenue, we also made a $125 million capacity access fee into the SMC, which was originally planned for Q4. Additionally, we will make a $32 million equity investment into ESMC and a $76 million equity investment into VSMC, our two equity accounted foundry joint ventures under construction. For full year 2025 modeling purposes, consistent with comments from our recent Investor Day, we expect operating expenses to stay with our long-term model of 23% for the year. We will see a step-up of operating expenses due to the annualized merits, the $15 million annual license fee, along with variable compensation movements pending actual performance. We suggest using a non-GAAP tax rate of 17.5%, plus or minus 50 basis points. For stock-based compensation, we suggest using of $475 million. For noncontrolling interest, we suggest modeling $30 million, plus or minus a few million. And for equity accounted investees, we suggest modeling $10 million loss, plus or minus a few million depending out on the build progress for both ESMC and VSMC joint venture from our front-end facilities. For capital expenditures, we expect to stay within the long-term model of 5% or less. In closing, I would like to highlight a few focus areas for NXP. First, as you can see, we have taken some restructuring charges in Q4 as we are creating space for our recent acquisitions to prevent dilution and to ensure we stay within our long-term operating expense model. Second, our internal front-end utilizations will remain in the low 70% range. Consistent with our hybrid manufacturing strategy, we are now also concretely planning the consolidation of our internal 200-millimeter factories. And lastly, as visibility remains very cloudy, we will rigorously focus on managing what is in our control to navigate a soft landing while executing our growth strategy. And of course, there is no change to our capital allocation strategy. With that, I would like to turn it back to the operator for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from CJ Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.
CJ Muse: Yeah. Good morning, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess high level, all eyes are on the rate of recovery off of a likely Q1 bottom for you guys as well as the industry. So, would be curious if you think we're set up for normal seasonal trends into Q2 and beyond? And if you could kind of parse through that, where you're seeing relative strength and perhaps where you see relative weakness or where you see concerns where perhaps trends won't be as strong as seasonal?
Kurt Sievers: Thanks, CJ, and good morning. Let me start with reiterating what I said in my prepared remarks, the visibility we have is really, really poor. Given the low order lead times, there is a lot of turns business and customers place their orders very late. So we have, in total, a pretty limited visibility. Now, coming more specifically back to your question, yeah. So Q1 with the 9% sequential decline is, I'd say, it's on the lower bound of seasonal as we had anticipated and kind of soft guided in the previous quarter. There in -- I would qualify this actually as kind of okay in automotive and industrial, kind of okay, meaning that the year-on-year decline in automotive is the same as we had it in quarter four. So that's like a mid-single-digit year-on-year decline. And in industrial IoT, we actually are flat from Q4 into Q1. Where it really comes down is in the comms infra segment where we have an accelerated pace of the earlier discussed end-of-life situation with some of the former digital networking or former Freescale digital networking products. That's the one which really falls short, in line with what we said over last year that this part of that segment is really becoming weak. Now, I heard your question. You were asking for quarter two. With the little visibility we have, we really can't call quarter two. Now, I understand you need something for the model CJ. If anything, probably a flat to slightly up is what I would use for modeling purposes. But that isn't really based on a hell lot of forward visibility, which we have at this stage. But I guess, flat to slightly up is the best proxy at this stage.
CJ Muse: Very helpful. And then maybe a question for you, Bill. Our gross margins, given where we are in the cycle, 56.3% is spectacular. Would love to hear kind of how you see a recovery playing out from utilization rates from mix, from bringing in higher-margin distribution? Would love to kind of how you see things evolve.
Bill Betz: CJ, absolutely. As you could see, the gross margins declined as we anticipated by about 120 basis points. And the attributes, again, we are now returning to our normal annual price negotiations. And as Kurt alluded to, down to low to mid single-digit range. So when you do the quick math, you can understand that effect. And then as we enter toward in Q4 guidance, we would lose some of the fall-through over our fixed costs, which actually happen. But on the bright side, which is more of a tailwind, we were able actually to partially offset some of those headwinds through the improved mix in Q1. And also, we are getting lower supplier and operating costs, which are tying throughout the year to offset that total pricing effect that occurred in the first quarter. So the cost adjustments come throughout the year. Overall, I would say at these revenue levels. And as I mentioned, we're running front-end internal utilizations in the low 70s, I feel pretty confident that we will remain at these gross margin levels, plus or minus the normal 50 basis points, driven by mix. I'd say once we return to revenue growth, we will then move back into our long-term gross margin range of 57% to 63%.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Thomas O'Malley with Barclays. Your line is open.
Thomas O’Malley: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to focus in on the regional trends. It sounds very similar, what you're kind of talking about, at least on the auto side with some inventory at the North American guys with potentially some better environments elsewhere. Could you just maybe talk about the inventory situation at the North American customers versus three months ago? Do you feel like that's coming to a bottom here with some inflection from this point forward or are you still kind of working that down? Any additional color there would be helpful.
Kurt Sievers: Yeah. Thanks, Tom. I hear two parts in your question. One is the regional one and the other one, the inventory. On the regional side, in quarter four, clearly, Asia, led by China was on the brighter side of things with Europe and the US being very weak, and that very weakness was certainly driven both by inventory digestion as you're hinting to and a weak end demand. That was pretty much as we had anticipated. So I'd say quarter four, there was nothing really changing through the quarter versus our anticipation. And going into quarter one, overall, I'd say we do see some early strength in Asia for industrial IoT. You saw that we sequentially guided that flat. Also for auto, Asia is robust. So, it's kind of the same situation like 90 days ago from a regional split perspective with a strong Asia and a relatively weak or especially weak Europe and maybe the US getting a little better. Now on the inventory side, so the answer, first of all, Thomas, yes, we continue to digest on-hand inventory at our direct Tier 1 customers. That process continues, and it is both for the US as well as for the European Tier 1 customers. How much it is and how long that still lasts? I can't really tell you. And I would also not put Q1 into comparison to Q4 in terms of its less or more. No, we have individual plans there with each single customer, and we got to see how that plays out. But that is clearly still weighing on our revenue performance, especially in automotive, keeping it at a sub end demand level. At the same time, and I -- for completeness, I have to say that also the discipline on the general inventory holds, you saw that we kept it flat at eight weeks in the fourth quarter. For Q1, I had in my prepared remarks, something like eight to nine weeks. It's a bit hard to say, to pin it down exactly about, say, eight to nine weeks. So, and in total, by the way, a reduction in dollars in the inventory. So the important piece is we continue to do this from inventories, both at distributors as well as direct customers go down from a dollar perspective. So at some point, that must come to an end because the rate of under-shipment against end demand in a flat SAAR environment, that must come to an end. I gave up to try and call when exactly. But if you do the math, it cannot take that long anymore.
Thomas O’Malley: Super helpful. And then just as a follow-up, I think you gave a lot of really good pieces there. So the inventory is low. You talked about low 70s range in terms of internal utilization. Like clearly, visibility going into this year is really difficult for you guys right now. But can you just maybe walk through for us on the line, when do you start to make decisions about internal utilization? Like, is it like two or three quarter out scenario where, hey, things are getting better, we're going to reduce a bit. It seems like things are at a healthy level right now from the utilization perspective. But when do you make that call? And maybe what levers do you look at when you think about potentially reducing that if demand isn't coming back?
Bill Betz: Yeah. Let me take this one. Obviously, we're focused on what we control. At the same time, our internal inventory from a dollar perspective is up quarter-over-quarter. We expect those dollars going into Q2 as Kurt alluded to, on flat to slightly up, from a dollar perspective is to stay flattish. So that's what we're balancing, the dollars and the utilization from an internal standpoint as well as we have to adjust our foundry and subcon orders with current revenue levels. So again, we're balancing all that. I would say if the second half comes up and we’re planned and ready for that, that's probably when that will take effect when we would increase our utilization. But again, we're going to be very cautious as Kurt alluded to, we kind of got this wrong last year, so we're just going to take it one quarter at a time.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Ross Seymore: Thanks for letting me ask the question. Kurt, the auto -- excuse me, the Industrial IoT segment being flat sequentially. You alluded a little bit to Asia acting a bit better, but I think that flatness is a welcome surprise to people. Can you dive a little bit deeper into what's going on there and keeping that business flat?
Kurt Sievers: Yeah, Ross. As I said, the relative strength, I don't want to use the strength yet, but the relative strength from a sequential perspective indeed comes from Asia. And within Asia, clearly, from China, and you know that we have a relatively high exposure in that segment to China. I think we are helped by our low channel inventory in that case because we don't have to reduce that further. So, any possible light at the end of the tunnel in terms of end demand directly comes to us because we don't have to work down inventory in the channel. That's how I would characterize it. But I -- Ross, I also don't want to go that far to talk about green shoots or anything. I mean it's kind of -- it looks a little better indeed in Asia, but too early to play the trend.
Ross Seymore: Thanks for that. And then I guess as my follow-up, switching over to the comms business and other. You've mentioned about kind of an accelerated end-of-life process. Is that now behind us? And so the business a little under $300 million, I guess, in the first quarter for your guide is now going to act along with whatever demand does? Or is there more room that, that has to be taken down?
Kurt Sievers: Yeah, let me try to parse this. So when exiting last year, calendar '24, think about the comms infra segment with roughly the following split. So 50% was in the secure card area, which includes also RFID, 20% in the radio power for the mobile base station networks and 30% in this digital networking business. So, that's about the size we talk about here and that end of [lighting] (ph) still continues, Ross. It goes into Q1, but I would expect it further continues beyond Q1.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Your line is open.
Vivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. Kurt, on the first one, maybe a little deeper into the Automotive segment. There's a lot of talk of tariffs, et cetera, this year. Have you seen any change yet in customer behavior, pull in, push out, mix of EV, et cetera? Just how are you reflecting this kind of evolving landscape in your thinking for 2025?
Kurt Sievers: Yeah. So first of all, to be clear, given all the uncertainty and the many moving parts, it is not reflected in anything we told you today. I just want to be very clear, there is so many unknowns that we could only get it wrong. So it's just not reflected, Vivek. Most of it from what we are hearing about today, there’ll be indirect impact on NXP. Let me give you the example of Canada and Mexico. That's not something where we would be impacted because we don't ship from Canada or Mexico into the US. So for us, that's not relevant. The China one clearly touches us eventually because we have some production in China. As you know, we have this back-end facility in Tianjin. And there is also some shipments from there to the US. We looked through this, Vivek, and it would be completely immaterial to us. So that's the only one where I can get my hands firmly around because we know what it is and that has absolutely immaterial impact on us. Why that is? We can discuss it another time and there’s a complex consideration behind it. So therefore, the straight answer is beyond that, nothing is contemplated in our -- in what we said today.
Vivek Arya: And maybe one for Bill, just kind of a hypothetical, if I sort of take what was said about Q2, and I completely understand visibility is limited. But if I assume some semblance of normal seasonality in the back half, I kind of get it conceptually sales down high single-digit or so this year. So I'm not asking you to endorse that. But let's say that was the situation what would be the right way to mathematically think about gross margins and OpEx this year? Thank you.
Bill Betz: Yeah. Similar to last quarter, the best metric, I think, for modeling purposes, without knowing all the different movements and visibility, I would just go back to whatever you put in your model for those type of revenues look at from a historical standpoint. That's all I can provide, to be honest with you, because as you know, there's many moving parts, but that's, I would say, a fair representation for modeling purposes.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Your line is open.
Stacy Rasgon: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to go back to gross margins. You said gross margins would probably stay here, give or take, until revenue started to grow. You suggested Q2 would be maybe flattish or up a bit. So I assume Q2 gross margins in that environment don't really go up very much. Hopefully, that revenue grows in the second half. Before, you had suggested that margins for the full year would land still within your range of 57% to 63%. Given you're going to be in the 56% is in the first half, do you think you can still get into the range for the full year? And if you do, is it like very close to the low end because I'm having a hard time getting it much more than that without a lot of growth in the second half.
Bill Betz: Yeah, Stacy, first off, related to the gross margins, you're right, for Q2, I said at similar levels, plus or minus the 50 basis points. We never guided the full year and say we would stay within the financial model for...
Stacy Rasgon: That’s what you said. At the Analyst Day, you said that.
Bill Betz: Correct. We have said that, and a lot will depend on the second half related to return of growth. So, as I mentioned earlier to another question, I said if the second half grows above the first half, we will then get back into model of the 57% to 63%, but a lot depends on the recovery of the second half.
Stacy Rasgon: You don't know if you'll be there for the full year now?
Bill Betz: I'm not guiding that at this point in time with the low visibility we have.
Stacy Rasgon: Okay. And I guess on that point of visibility, you said you have a lot of turns. What is your percentage of orders that are coming from turns right now? And, like, how does that differ across the different segments?
Bill Betz: We don't disclose that. All I can tell you is the trend has picked up over the last three quarters, and they're getting larger and larger.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Toshiya Hari: Hi, good morning. Thanks so much for taking the question. My first one is on the automotive business. Just from a business planning perspective, and again, I realize you've got a little visibility and a lot of moving parts here. But from a planning perspective, what kind of global SAAR or global unit production are you expecting for the year? And more importantly, Kurt, you talked about the secular drivers that you guys have been speaking to the 32 connectivity radar, et cetera, what rate of outperformance or content growth should we or can we expect in calendar '25 versus '24?
Kurt Sievers: Yeah. Hi, Toshiya. So yeah, the first part indeed is pretty simple. We just quote S&P here. We think about around about 89 million units in car production this year, which would be a very slight flat minus. So just a little bit down where it's probably important to understand that in that China is more flat plus versus Europe and the US flat minus. So that's the two directions within that. And as Vivek alluded to, I mean, let's see what the tariffs will do to all of this, we can’t say. But we model with a flat to slightly down car production for the year. The outperformance of the company-specific growth drivers. What I suggest to do, Toshiya, is you use the percentage growth rates, which we guided in our Analyst and Investor Day back in November, offset by what you see the overall business underperforming currently, which is the under-shipment which we have to do on inventory digestion. But the delta between what the core business does and what the accelerated growth drivers do, that does hold. There is no difference because they all have about the same inventory levels. So there is statistically looking at the total, it doesn't make sense to model any difference in inventory, which means they all suffer from the same offset. So, it's the same delta. That's probably the best you can assume. And they run well. I mean, let me say that they also -- all three of them did grow last year from an absolute perspective year-on-year while the total auto business last year was down. Those pieces, which are quite sizable, as you know, were up and we clearly see this continue in this year.
Toshiya Hari: That's helpful. Thank you. And then as my follow-up, you mentioned for the year, you're expecting blended pricing to be down in the low single-digits. I'm curious what your expectations are in terms of foundry costs or wafer costs in '25 versus '24? And then somewhat related to that, Bill, you talked about potentially consolidating 8-inch facilities. If you can expand on that and kind of speak to timing and magnitude in terms of potential gross margin tailwind in future years, that would be helpful. Thank you.
Kurt Sievers: Yeah. Let me take the first half of your question. So yes, I reconfirm the low single-digit price erosion, which we see this year, this calendar year, by the way, coming from a flat line last year. I'm not sure we said this before, but I can now confirm that last year, as we had anticipated, we were neutral on pricing. This year, low single-digit down. It's now with high confidence that we can say that. And the input cost you were asking for has also started to develop more favorably, which means it helps us offset from a gross profit perspective. The headwinds which we are seeing from that low single-digit price erosion. The only thing is it's a bit of a timing element and Bill spoke about this earlier because a large part of the pricing hits us already in while the cost erosion -- the input cost erosion is through the full year. So [we need through] (ph) the year to offset that. But that has become a more favorable environment, which helps us offset the ASP erosion. And, Bill, maybe you speak about the consolidation of that.
Bill Betz: Yes, absolutely. Obviously, this is something we shared during Investor Day. I just hinted that we're basically planning and almost complete. When this occurs, it will occur sometime in 2025. And there will be a natural tailwind associated with the utilization as we start bridging some of the build plan for the transfers of those products. That would probably be my guess more of an impact in the second half of the year when we decide to announce this. And again, at this point in time, I could just show you, yeah, that's roughly basically, I would say there is a tailwind when we do and start that process. But we haven't yet.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Caso with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Chris Caso: Yeah, thank you. Good morning. The first question is, again, on some of the digital networking products that are going end of life. I want to make sure that we're calibrated on this correctly. So, I think what you said is that was about 30% of the common infrastructure segment. Should we expect that a large part of that goes away over the next few quarters? I guess I'm trying to quantify how much of the business is affected by end of life and sort of the timing that you expect for that to finally work its way down.
Kurt Sievers: Yeah. So first of all, yes, I reconfirm you understood me correctly. It's about 30% exiting last year of the total revenue of the segment, which we discuss about here. And by the way, just as an aside, I mean, the RF power business in there is also pretty lumpy. It's not like everything else is golden, and that's the only concern. But that's the one we speak about. And yes, it will continue through the next couple of quarters to further decline given the end-of-life actions on several of these products. That doesn't mean it goes totally away but think about the continued decline through the next couple of quarters of that 30% piece. Now at the same time, the secure card business is okay. In there, we have RFID. You know that RFID is a growth business for NXP. So there are many moving pieces in this comms infra segment, which is why for the next three years, we guided it to be just flat. I just wanted to show today to call out that, that 30% portion really sees a quite material decline through this year.
Chris Caso: Understood. Follow-up question is on China. And obviously, it's very strong now given some of the share shifts that are happening in the industry. I guess, in the interest of no good deed goes unpunished. We do get a lot of questions about the sustainability of that strength and owing to the fact that there are a lot of OEMs in China trying to gain share. Could you talk about your view of the sustainability of what's happening in China now and the steps you're taking to make sure that the customers aren't building inventory, we're not over shipping to that region?
Kurt Sievers: Yeah. So that's a number of questions. Let me try and parse them. One is, indeed, last year, China as a region for NXP, did grow by 4% year-over-year. So if you take the China portion of the NXP revenue, calendar '24 over 23%, that was 4% up. And that made it a 36% portion of the total NXP revenue. So while the company was down 5%, China was actually up 4% last year. We have zero indication. I have said very clear, we have zero indication that there was any inventory build or pull-in or anything like this in there. We just see it really correlated and a good part of it is obviously automotive to the increased content and the relatively good production trends and global market share trends of Chinese OEMs. So there is no pull ahead or inventory build. It was just natural growth, which structurally, we think, will continue which clearly goes at the expense of the Western OEMs. I mean as I said earlier, the SAAR this year, the global car production is about flattish. So there is a share shift from the West to China building. And furthermore, test in China, the electric vehicle penetration is really fast paced. So through the second half of last year, it was 50%. So 50% of the cars sold last year -- second half of last year, were in some form, electric, hybrid or sfully electric in China. So, very high penetration already and continuing, which, of course, delivers us over-average content growth from a semiconductor perspective. We are dealing with that, I would say, aggressively to the extent that we want to be the right partner there to not have the risk of losing share. I just changed my organization. I have a business leader now for China who reports directly to me to make sure that we do what we've spoken about before, which is dedicated solutions for Chinese OEMs because -- if you think about software-defined vehicle and electrification, it is now that in many aspects, China is leading. So we leverage them as lead customers and turn more of our R&D attention to that side of the world to stay competitive. Secondly, we have our manufacturing strategy, China for China because a big requirement there is that we do local manufacturing, which we are delivering through our back-end facility, which I mentioned earlier in Tianjin and three elements of front-end manufacturing being TSMC and Lansing, SMIC and HHGrace as we announced in our Investor Day in November. So, Chris, I think this trend continues. We do everything to stay and be very competitive locally, really with substantial changes in how we operate because we think this continues to be a significant growth factor for NXP.
Operator: Thank you. And our final question comes from Joshua Buchalter with TD Cowen. Your line is open.
Joshua Buchalter: Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in and taking my questions. Very much appreciate that you gave us the rough outlook for the second quarter, given the low visibility environment. I guess as you sit here today, do you expect to still be under-shipping in that second quarter? Is there any way to quantify that amount? And I assume within that flat to up number, that still includes the channel staying in sort of the eight to nine week range? Thank you.
Kurt Sievers: Josh, this is a trial to further have us guide the second quarter, which we did not intend to do. Yes, it's just mathematics. If we are flat or slightly up, we still under-ship. We very clearly think we have a much higher natural demand in run rates than that. So if it is flat to slightly up, only then it continues to be under-shipment, which I would think is in holding discipline on the channel. Yes, the eight to nine weeks is it? And secondly, it is -- it would then be probably further digestion of on-hand inventory at especially automotive Tier 1 customers. Again, all of this is not a guide, Josh. But if you put it that way, if it is flat to slightly up, then that would be indeed the consequence.
Joshua Buchalter: Got it. Appreciate the color there. And I'll give the cycle a break for a moment. I wanted to ask about the TT Tech acquisition. You're moving into -- further into the software space and acquiring the middleware assets. Can you maybe speak to, I guess, one, how that changes your conversations with your OEM customers and the potential pull for your broader set of hardware solutions. And also, is there any element of -- with this acquisition in particular that where you're competing a little bit more so with your customers? Thank you.
Kurt Sievers: Yeah, Josh. Thanks for that really, I think, important question because that's a key strategic move which we announced there. I would say that very clearly, it does enable the conversation and engagement with automotive OEMs. So when you ask what does it do? It enables it. The software-defined vehicle definition and architecture creation is in the hands of the OEMs. No single Tier 1 can ever do that. It has to be top down for the whole vehicle. So it is owned by the OEMs. And in order to make NXP the leading partner for them to architect those new backbones of the car, we needed more software that became abundantly clear over the past couple of quarters. And this is where TT Tech Auto builds ideally in. So it makes -- it gives us the possibility to have that conversation and to codesign those STD architectures with OEMs. I wouldn't call it competition with our direct customers, but we are moving up the value stack. I mean that is a matter of fact, Josh. So in that sense, from what Jens Hinrichsen, my leader for the automotive business talked about in our Investor Day in November, TT Tech is a very important building block to make that vision a reality, which is co-architecting those platforms with OEMs.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn it back to Kurt Sievers for closing remarks.
Kurt Sievers: Yeah. Thanks operator. Yeah. Thanks for paying attention to today's call. We continue to be in a very cloudy environment where you saw our hesitation and cautiousness to call the bottom or to speak about the rest of the year. We take, however, a very rigorous focus on cost and gross margin management, which is under our control to continue consistently on that strategy of soft landing to be ready and best prepared for the upcycle when and if it comes. With that, I thank you for your attention. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-11-05 08:00:00) =====
Jeff Palmer: Hello everyone. This is Jeff Palmer from NXP. Thank you and welcome to NXP Semiconductors Third Quarter Earnings Call. With me on the call today is Kurt Sievers, NXP's President and CEO; and Bill Betz, our CFO. The call today is being recorded and will be available for replay from our corporate website. Today's call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause NXP's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the macroeconomic impact on the specific end markets in which we operate, the sale of new and existing products, and our expectations for the financial results for the fourth quarter of 2024. NXP undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements. For a full disclosure on forward-looking statements, please refer to our press release. Additionally, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures which are driven primarily by discrete events that management does not consider to be directly related to NXP's underlying core operating performance. Pursuant to Regulation G, NXP has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our third quarter 2024 earnings press release, which will be furnished to the SEC on Form 8-K and available on NXP's website in the Investor Relations section at nxp.com. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Kurt.
Kurt Sievers: Thank you, Jeff and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining our call this morning. Beginning with quarter three, NXP delivered quarterly revenue of $3.25 billion in line with our overall guidance of down 5% year-on-year and up 4% sequentially. While we experienced some strengths against our expectations in the communication infrastructure, mobile, and automotive end markets, we were confronted with increasing macro-related weakness in the industrial and IoT markets. At the total company level, sequential growth was led by China. Non-GAAP operating margin in quarter three was 35.5%, 50 basis points above the year-ago period and 40 basis points above the midpoint of our guidance. Year-on-year operating profit performance was due to a combination of lower revenue and gross-profit, partially offset by favorable operating expenses. Now let me turn to the specific trends in our focus end markets. In automotive, revenue was 1.83 billion down 3% versus the year-ago period and in line with our guidance range. The inventory digestion at our main Tier 1 customers continues to occur with further pressure coming from slowing European and North American car OEM end demand. At the same time, we experienced healthy growth in the China and Asia-Pacific automotive end markets. Turning to Industrial & IoT, revenue was $563 million, down 7% versus the year-ago period and below our guidance range. During the quarter, we experienced weaker than expected trends globally. In Mobile, revenue was $407 million, up 8% versus the year-ago period and at the high end of our guidance range, in what is normally a seasonally strong period. In Communication, infrastructure, and other, revenue was $451 million, down 19% year-on-year and above the high end of our guidance as several RFID programs ramped stronger than originally anticipated. From a Channel perspective, distribution inventory was 1.9 months up from the 1.7 months in quarter two, following our attempts to stage dedicated mass market product in the channel. While, at the same time, sell through to distribution service customers in the European and American markets was somewhat slower. Now, let me turn to our expectations for quarter four 2024. We are guiding quarter four revenue to 3.1 billion, down about 9% versus the fourth quarter of 2023, and down about 5% sequentially. Relative to our earlier expectations, we are taking a more conservative stance for quarter four, hence, we will also aim to hold channel inventory approximately flat sequentially at 1.9 months or about eight weeks. This is because we began to see increasing weakness in the Industrial and IoT market already during quarter three, as well as an unexpected contraction in manufacturing PMI below 50 across all regions except China. Furthermore, we find ourselves exposed to a broad slowdown of European and North American automotive OEM outlooks for 2024, only partially compensated by the aforementioned strength in China automotive. This leads to more stringent inventory reductions at our Tier 1 customers below the natural end demand. So at the midpoint, we anticipate the following trends in our business during quarter four. Automotive is anticipated to be down in the high single-digit percent range versus quarter three, 2023. Excuse me, versus quarter four 2023 and down in the mid-single-digit percent range versus quarter three 2024. Industrial and IoT is expected to be down by 20% versus quarter four 2023, and down in the mid-single-digit percent range sequentially. Mobile is expected to be down in the low single-digit percent range both versus quarter four of 2023 and sequentially. And finally, communication, infrastructure, and other is expected to be down in the mid-single-digit percent range both versus quarter four 2023 and sequentially. In summary, our guidance for the fourth quarter reflects broader macro weakness in Europe and North America, only partially compensated by strength in China. The cyclical rebound, which we had anticipated for the second half of 2024 has not materialized. The soft and uncertain demand environment appears to be causing the Tier 1 customers to take a very cautious stance on their inventory positions. These trends are consistent with the multiple profit warnings issued by major Western automotive OEMs as well as the contracting global manufacturing PMI trends, which are weighing on demand in the Industrial and IoT market. The net impact to NXP are lower-than-expected, order trends from our direct customers and distribution partners. Notwithstanding this more challenging short-term demand environment, we are very confident we have deployed a long-term winning strategy focusing our investments to succeed in the fastest-growing secular end markets of automotive and industrial IoT. In the short term, we will maniacally focus on managing what is in our control while making the right decisions for the long-term health of the business. This will enable NXP to drive resilient profitability and earnings even in an uncertain demand environment. And now I would like to pass the call to Bill for a review of our financial performance. Bill?
Bill Betz: Thank you, Kurt and good morning to everyone on today's call. As Kurt has already covered the drivers of the revenue during Q3 and provided our revenue outlook for Q4, I will move to the financial highlights. Overall, our Q3 financial performance was good. Revenue was in line, non-GAAP gross margin was near the low end of our guidance more than offset by favorable operating expenses resulting in better operating profit. Turning to Q3 specifics, total revenue was $3.25 billion, down 5% year-on-year. We generated $1.89 billion in non-GAAP gross profit and reported a non-GAAP gross margin of 58.2%, down 30 basis points year-on-year and 30 basis points below the midpoint of our guidance range due to product mix. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $738 million or 22.7% of revenue, down $65 million year-on-year, although this was $22 million below the midpoint of our guidance due to lower variable compensation, project spend, and payroll. From a total operating profit perspective, non-GAAP operating profit was $1.15 billion; and non-GAAP operating margin was 35.5%, up 50 basis points year-on-year and 40 basis points above the midpoint of our guidance. Non-GAAP interest expenses was $70 million, with taxes for ongoing operations of $182 million or a 16.8% non-GAAP effective tax rate. Non-controlling interest was $11 million and stock-based compensation, which is not included in our non-GAAP earnings, was $115 million. Taken together, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.45, slightly ahead of our midpoint guidance of $3.42. Now I would like to turn to the changes in our cash and debt. Our total debt at the end of Q3 was $10.18 billion with our cash balance of $3.15 billion, down $111 million sequentially due to the cumulative effect of capital returns, internal CAPEX, investments in previously announced equity accounted foundry joint ventures, and cash generation during the quarter. The resulting net debt was $7.03 billion, and we exited the quarter with a trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA of $5.24 billion. Our ratio of net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of Q3 was at 1.3 times and our 12-month adjusted EBITDA interest coverage ratio was 22.9 times. During Q3, we paid $259 million in cash dividends and repurchased $305 million of our shares. Taken together, we returned $564 million to our shareholders, representing 95% of non-GAAP free cash flow. In addition, on August 29th, the NXP Board of Directors authorized an increase of our existing capacity to purchase an additional $2 billion of buybacks with a total balance of $2.64 billion at the end of Q3. Furthermore, since the end of Q3 and through Friday, November 1st, we repurchased an additional $117 million of our shares under an established 10b5-1 program. Turning to working capital metrics, days of inventory was 149 days, an increase of one day sequentially, while distribution channel inventory was 1.9 months or approximately eight weeks. Days receivable were 30 days, up three days sequentially; and days payable were 60 days, a decrease of four days versus the prior quarter. Taken together, our cash conversion cycle was 119 days, an increase of eight days versus the prior quarter. Cash flow from operations was $779 million and net CAPEX was $186 million or 6% of revenue, resulting in non-GAAP free cash flow of $593 million or 18% of revenue. Turning to our expectations for the fourth quarter, as Kurt mentioned, we anticipate Q4 revenue to be $3.1 billion plus or minus about $100 million. At the midpoint, this is down 9% year-on-year and down 5% sequentially. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be about 57.5%, plus or minus 50 basis points. Furthermore, our guidance assumes flat channel inventory at about eight weeks exiting Q4, this reflects our continued discipline of proactively managing our distribution channel, especially during uncertain demand environments. Operating expenses are expected to be $725 million, plus or minus $10 million. Taken together, we see non-GAAP operating margin to be 34.1% at the midpoint. We estimate non-GAAP financial expenses to be $77 million with the non-GAAP tax rate to be 16.8% of profit before tax at the midpoint, non-controlling interest and other will be $9 million. Our guidance assumes a $2 million loss from our equity accounted boundary joint ventures, we suggest for modeling purposes, you use an average share count of 257 million shares. Taken together at the midpoint, this implies a non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.13. We expect stock-based compensation, which is not included in our non-GAAP guidance to be $118 million. Turning to uses of cash. We expect capital expenditures to be around 5% of revenue. We also will make a $400 million capacity access fee and a $120 million equity investment into BSMC as well as a $52 million equity investment into ESMC, which are our two equity accounted foundry joint ventures, which are under construction. In closing, I would like to highlight three items. First, we will continue to return all excess cash to our owners through buybacks and dividends. We expect our Q4 capital returns to be above $700 million. Second, despite the macro headwinds, NXP will continue to navigate and operate within its long-term financial model. And lastly, we look forward to you joining our 2024 Investor Day on Thursday, November 7th at 8:30 A.M., where we will provide an update to our long-term strategic plan and financial models. I'd like to now turn it back to the operator for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Ross Seymore: Hi guys, thanks for taking my questions. Kurt, seems like a lot of things changed during the course of the quarter. You're not alone in highlighting weakness, and I don't think it's NXP specific. But can you just talk a little bit about the specific customer behavior changes you saw because up until now you seem to have set things up pretty conservatively throughout the year. So the guide down seems to be a little more of a surprise for you guys than the peers just given the setup appeared to be a little more favorable heading into the quarter and guide?
Kurt Sievers: Yes, thanks and good morning Ross. Indeed, we were taken by some surprise, I would say, in the -- say, in the August time frame during quarter three by a broadening weakness in the Industrial and IoT market pretty much across the board, which led to a much more cautious stance on their side, Ross, relative to also their inventory positions. And the same is now broadening when you ask for the guidance for Q4, it's clearly broadening into the automotive segment. There I would exclude China from these discussions. I think you've heard similar from our peers. China actually appears to be quite strong. Our growth was led by China in quarter three and the sequential growth. And also in quarter four, China actually will grow from a sequential perspective over quarter three across automotive and Industrial and IoT. But that weakness and that customer behavior you were asking for is really specifically strong now in the fourth quarter in the Western Automotive and Industrial segments. Their customers, and you saw all the profit warnings from the car OEMs, for example, where now the Tier 1s are aiming to further reduce their inventory. So our trends to under ship against natural end demand is becoming even tougher, Ross. That's how I would characterize the customer behavior. It almost felt like everybody from them kept up their forecast and then suddenly, August, September, they started to drop. And that is now ripping through to the Tier 1s, which are becoming even more cautious on what they want to hold from NXP in terms of inventory. You know that we have talked about this extended inventory digestion before, but that has now extended because of the end market weakness.
Ross Seymore: Thanks for that color. And I guess, looking forward, Bill switching to the gross margin side. I know that you talked about for the quarter, so just -- can you talk a little bit about utilization that's leading to the roughly 0.5 point to 1 point decline in gross margin? And how do we think about the levers for gross margin going forward at the risk of kind of front running which you're going to talk about on Thursday, what are the plus and minuses to that in a weaker environment where inventory seems to be a little bit more persistently elevated?
Bill Betz: Yes. Thank you, Ross. And quickly on our Q3, our gross margin was missed, and you can probably see that very clearly through our segment reporting, where industrial IoT revenues, where 80% of that is serviced through the distribution and carry accretive margins for us. And we also had a bit stronger mobile revenues, which are slightly dilutive to corporate margin. And so that's why we missed 30 basis points in Q3. We obviously see that trend. Curt talked about the segments where clearly, Industrial and IoT will be stepping down again. So that becomes a mix headwind going into Q4. In addition, obviously, declining by $150 million a year also we had some fall through over our fixed costs. Related to inventory, you saw from a day’s perspective, we're kind of holding ourselves but clearly, when you see our Q report, you're going to see increased finished goods. And basically, those finished goods we were going to put in the channel, but the sell-through wasn't there, so we held them on our balance sheet. And so it will probably take us a quarter to get back to where we want to be from an inventory perspective. Now more longer-term on the gross margins, again clearly, we're running our utilization in the low 70s. We expect to continue around them in the low 70s, probably at least for the first half of 2025. So that will flip and become a tailwind when we decide and see sequential improvements in our revenue sometime in 2025 related to it. Clearly, we have mix that's a tailwind that will come in our way into the future as we continue to ramp our new products. More importantly, we're going to talk about during Analyst Day, our real strategic structural changes that we plan to make more longer term, which obviously I said many times, that 58% is not our final destination. And please hold tight for a couple more days, and I'm going to walk you through that gross margin journey over the next three years and plus some as well related to it. But we feel pretty good. Obviously, we have to make sure we burn off some finished goods here and going into Q4 and in Q1 and rebalance the inventory a bit. But remember, we're holding about three weeks on to our balance sheet, which is margin accretive when we do ship it into the channel. We're holding that quite tightly at about eight weeks. We believe eight weeks is probably one of the lowest compared to all our peers. And once the environment normalizes, we will bring that back up to 11 weeks. It's just a matter of when that will be when the macro improves.
Ross Seymore: Thank you.
Kurt Sievers: Thanks Ross.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Caso of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.
Christopher Caso: Yes, thank you. Good morning. I guess the first question is with regard to the channel inventory. And I know that you wanted to increase that somewhat. I guess it is right to interpret that the increase in channel inventory was just a function of the end markets being larger than you thought. And I guess, in the context of your customers taking the inventory down so low, how does that affect your view of where you want your own inventory to be as you go into next year on both a channel basis or on an internal basis?
Kurt Sievers: So Chris, let me take the channel question and the internal inventory question will be answered by Bill in a minute. So on the channel, yes, I think you got it exactly right. We wanted to increase by a digit from 1.7 to 1.8, which we did. And by the way, let me remind you why we want to do this, we want to be sure that critical product for competitiveness in the channel is probably staged on the shelves. Since most of our competitors have higher positions there, we want to be sure we don't fall behind in terms of competitiveness. And yes, we inched another digit higher, which was then a function of the late weakness in the quarter, which I just talked about, which reduced the sell-through more than we had anticipated. That's why we indeed inched a little bit higher than we had anticipated in the plan. And Bill, maybe you'll speak about the internal inventory targets.
Bill Betz: Absolutely. Clearly, the macro environment is weaker now than 90 days ago, as Kurt explained. So I expect our inventory levels internally to remain elevated for the next couple of quarters until we obviously grow revenues again from a sequential standpoint. But again, at the same time, we are proactively reducing our foundry purchases which are more variable in nature for us and this will probably have an impact in the first quarter of 2025. Q4 obviously is limited because we placed these orders already in Q3. And again, as I talk to Ross, we're holding about three weeks of finished goods of inventory on our balance sheet. So we'll proactively manage that. And then as we replenish the channel, we will get that benefit relief with inventory coming down internally. Again, we think it's important to hold it very tightly and low at eight weeks and sometime in 2025, we'll bring this back to the 11 weeks when the macro improves. And again, I have to say majority of our inventory is long-lived supporting our auto industrial markets and had very, very low obsolescence.
Christopher Caso: Thank you. I guess as a follow-up, I'll ask a question, which I know is very difficult to answer, but you're going to get it. So I'll be the one to ask it, which is do you think that we're pretty close to the bottom now and recognize how difficult that it is given the moving targets and such. But as an example, sort of normal seasonality is down to the first quarter. I don't know if we should think about that differently given what's happened in the second half of this year. And I guess, with what your customers are planning to do with inventory, does that get -- and bring it so low, does that give you some confidence that we're kind of approaching revenue bottom levels here?
Kurt Sievers: Yes, let me try and go at it. This is a number of complex questions. So first of all, clearly, the forward-looking, there is a lot of uncertainty around this. I mean, with all the unexpected downticks from a macro perspective in automotive and industrial, which we've seen over the past say 10 weeks, I want to be really careful in making strong statements for the longer future into next year. However, what we can offer is we do believe that probably quarter one will follow a pretty normal seasonal pattern for NXP, which is a high single-digit sequential down from quarter four into quarter one. We see no reason why we should be different to normal seasonality here into quarter one. I don't want to go that far, Chris, to call the trough because I just don't know what the macro is going to do with all the uncertainty around us. I don't think we can do this yet. I do agree with you that with our strong discipline on the channel inventory, and I had it in my prepared remarks, we keep it now flat again into quarter four. So where we start to stage a bit into the third quarter, we hold here. So we keep it flat into the fourth quarter, which keeps us at a very low level of eight weeks only. And also, indeed, with the direct customers at some point, inventory is just burned. So yes, at some point, of course, that sets us up for a good growth. I just cannot call and don't want to call when that moment is. But I would say NXP from an inventory in the customer space perspective is actually pretty well positioned.
Christopher Caso: Got it, totally fair. Thank you.
Kurt Sievers: Thanks Chris.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya of Bank of America Securities. Your line is now open.
Vivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. Kurt, what's NXP's relative exposure in the China-based car versus a European premium cars, so if let's say, your China customers continue to take share, how does that content play out for NXP? And then this China trend, yes, you have mentioned it and the peers have mentioned it. How much of that is kind of pre-buying before the elections and does that kind of keep the industry exposed to in-sourcing risks on a longer-term basis?
Kurt Sievers: Yes. So hi Vivek, first on our exposure to content per vehicle in China versus premium Western. There are damn high-end cars in the mid-term in China, which have a similar set of features. So I would probably say that on the higher end cars in China, we have a very similar exposure from a content per vehicle perspective as we have in the Western world. And as we have discussed a couple of times before, since they are spinning new platforms faster, I dare to say that probably the growth of that content exposure is growing faster than in the rest of the world because they just get faster to the next innovation steps. They develop a new platform in two to three years, which gives us the opportunity to tap faster into a higher content opportunity. So over time, that is actually strengthening. Now from anything we can see, I don't think -- and that's the second half of your question, I don't think that they are staging inventory or something because of election or other external events. It is actually the success of the Chinese industry. I mean, if you look at the global star. In the meantime, for the world it has tipped down to a forecast of minus 2% this year. So global star is going to decline by 2% this year at the same time, China is going to grow by 2%. So you see the differential that China is actually doing better, which puts it at least to our estimate in a fair light relative to how our revenue develops better in China than in the other regions. The same holds true for this whole discussion about XEV, so electric vehicle penetration. In China, it keeps going strong. We just got the other week that data point that in September this year, 46% that was the penetration of EVs in China. So almost 50% of the vehicles in China was then already electric. So the SAR overall does well in China and the EV penetration is doing better than in the rest of the world. And that's for me, a fair reason why I do believe that the China growth, which we are experiencing is sustainable. It's really their competitiveness locally and globally against the Western players. It's almost like what is lost in the west is won in China.
Vivek Arya: Right. And for my follow-up, I think you mentioned that Q1, you expect to be seasonal, if I heard correctly, which is down high single digits. But if I were to just take the average of just your automotive business over the last seven years, including the COVID that is more down like 1%, 2% or so on an average. I understand seasonality could mean different things at different times. But what explains this large difference between what we have seen with NXP over the last six or seven years in Q1, especially in your automotive business versus what I think you are kind of alluding to for Q1 2025? Thank you.
Jeff Palmer: Vivek, I'll take that. It's Jeff here. I don't think we're going to provide a guidance by segment into Q1. As Kurt said on a previous question, we do expect total company to be seasonally down into Q1. And I think that's probably about as far ahead of our skews as we're going to get today.
Vivek Arya: Okay, thank you.
Jeff Palmer: We will take the next question operator.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Muse of Cantor. Your line is now open.
Christopher Muse: Yeah, good morning and good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping you could give a little more color on the industrial slowdown that you're seeing. You talked about China strong, and I'm assuming that's a little more IoT. So we would love to hear kind of what -- whether North America, Europe, kind of any changes in terms of geo and where you're seeing weakness, whether it's broad, isolated to say factory automation, I would love to hear your thoughts?
Kurt Sievers: Yes, hi CJ. Indeed, let me reconfirm the weakness in Q3, but also now specifically going to Q4 is predominantly across the board from Europe and the U.S. in industrial and IoT. So across also most sub segments. But mind you that we are not that big in Europe and the U.S. in Industrial and IoT. So we are actually a relatively small player there. I -- if you want to get a little bit of color, I would say, especially factory automation appears to be particularly weak there in the West, in Europe and the U.S. The strength in China is more in the consumer IoT part, that 40% portion of our industrial IoT segment than in the core industrial. It's not that core industrial is particularly weak in China, but if you want to have color between the two in Q4 in China, then the stronger one is the consumer IoT, which I guess is also a bit of a seasonal strength into the fourth quarter.
Christopher Muse: Thank you so much. And I guess as my follow-up, given kind of how you will manage the cycle to date, there's a perception that you're gearing into the next up cycle, maybe less than peers. So I was hoping you could speak to kind of where you think you are overall in terms of your sell-in versus sell-through end demand and if there's any kind of color around end markets to kind of give confidence that when things do recover, that you do have that gearing cyclically?
Kurt Sievers: Yes, CJ I'm happy you're asking because I fail to understand the logic why we would come back less strong than others because we have fared somewhat better so far. And I fail to understand that because the only one reason why we are declining less this year, for example, with our guidance, you will see that NXP is like 5% down this year versus most of our direct peers more double-digit down. The reason for that is that we hit the brakes earlier. It's not that we took anything away from the future. The only thing is we didn't do it in the first place. So we did a little less and a little softer in 2022 and 2023, which helped us to not have to hit the brakes so hard in 2024. But that puts us at the same starting point into any recovery. So that is our firm position here. And I think it all comes back down to what we discussed a little earlier in this call which is the actual inventory position, which we have in the channel and Bill said it, 1.9 months or about 8 weeks currently, which is still quite a bit away from the longer-term target of 11 weeks or 2.5 months, so that we still have like, I think, $300 million or so under the belt to be shipped in, which we don't do in the current environment. Again, we stay cautious. We could do, but we don't do it because we want to do it when it makes sense, when the recovery happens. And on the direct customer inventory, I can, of course only assume, CJ but I don't see a reason why we would be any worse or any better than typical peers. I mean that's the treatment you get from the customers. We can control that, but I don't think we should be any different to our peers. So therefore, no, I don't think there is a reason to believe we have less of a recovery ahead of us. We actually feel good about the soft landing strategy, which in fact only brought us down by 5% this year, thanks to cautious behavior the year before.
Christopher Muse: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein Research. Your line is now open.
Stacy Rasgon: Hi guys, thanks for taking my questions. My first one just around the auto, like 90 days ago, you were sort of suggesting to us that auto would be stronger into the end of the year because of company-specific wins in radar and other things that were going to be ramping. So part of the incremental, because I'm a little confused, did that stuff just not ramp or did it ramp less than you thought or is it ramping later than you thought or what is it because it certainly doesn't seem to be enough to offset the other of the broader weakness that we're seeing, like what's going on with that?
Kurt Sievers: Yes, Stacy, absolutely. I can confirm we did say that half two would grow over half one, driven by two factors. One was the anticipated recovery and the other one was company-specific growth. We went very deeply into this and tried to find what happened and what didn't happen. The company-specific growth Stacy is happening. I mean it's a little softer because if they build a little less cars, then of course, you ramp also a little bit less. But the fundamental mechanisms of RADAR and S32 ramps are happening, we are actually growing quite nicely in the second half over the first half. But it is wiped away by the recovery not happening and on the contrary, of macro weakness, which is actually superseding all of that. So underneath the company-specific drivers are intact. We will show a bit more detail on Thursday in our Investor Day in Boston. But it's not strong enough to overcome the macro weakness, Stacy.
Stacy Rasgon: Got it. That's helpful. For my follow-up, I wanted to ask about gross margin. So I understand why they're coming down in Q4, I think. Now in Q1, you just suggested that revenues are probably down high single digits sequentially. It doesn't sound to me like mix is any better. Is it -- should I be thinking that the 57.5% just given those dynamics in the near term is likely not the trough, like how should we be thinking about gross margins in Q1 just given the further revenue shortfall that we're seeing and any other drivers that are leading into the beginning of the year?
Bill Betz: Yes Stacy, this is Bill. First, we're not going to guide to Q1. But for modeling purposes, I would suggest when incorporating what Kurt said about the seasonal adjustments to revenues, probably best to use a gross margin similar to those revenue levels at the past in the absence of the guide. Again, we just don't know it's not fully order booked yet. So mix will play a role, of course, but I'm just not that smart enough. But for modeling, I would just use something along those lines during the last three years of those revenues.
Stacy Rasgon: So where was that, I'd open up my model, like where were gross margins last time revenues were?
Kurt Sievers: I mean Stacy, you can probably find me on our website.
Stacy Rasgon: Alright, I will dig it up myself. But thank you guys.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Francois Bouvignies of UBS. Your line is now open.
Francois-Xavier Bouvignies: Thank you very much. My first question was on the pricing as we know we are at the end of the year where we understand you have some negotiation, especially for your auto customers. And from what you understand, of course, given the challenging environment, the pricing is -- it's like an intense conversation, I should say, from many peers that I talked about this. So I was wondering for NXP how should we think about the pricing strategy, how you think the pricing is going to play out, given this pressure maybe more than usual, especially into next year, that would be very helpful. And I have a follow up after if that's okay?
Kurt Sievers: Yes. Thanks, Francois, absolutely. Let me confirm indeed two data points here. The one is, and we talked about this through this year, we can now say with a lot of confidence that for this year, pricing will have been neutral. So we will end the year with a flat pricing over the previous calendar year 2023. And from anything we can see today relative to next year's pricing across the entire company, so that's all the segments, all the channels together, it will probably be a low single-digit ASP erosion, which is very typical, I would say. And that's also what we have anticipated. So after this whole swing, after COVID, and the supply crisis where prices were up, they went into flat this year. And we assume that for next year, but also the years after, it is reasonable to assume we are back to a low single-digit ASP erosion annually, which is very much in line, by the way, with what we have experienced in the years before the supply crisis and before COVID. And I know you hear different data points from different people, Francois, but mind you that we have a pretty differentiated portfolio. So a lot of our product is very far away from a catalog or commodity products, which gives us also in a period like now a relatively strong standing when it comes to pricing.
Francois-Xavier Bouvignies: That's very clear, thank you Kurt. And maybe a follow-up. It's a bit kind of a medium term, but still it impacts the short term, given these challenges on the cycle, you have this China uncertainty with local players probably going after pricing. Even if you have a sticky and strong differentiation, as you described, Kurt, it's fair to assume maybe that the pricing environment and the oversupply that will take a bit longer to feel how NXP tends to play in that role. I mean, the trade-off between market share and gross margin, for example, would you consider like to exit some product as soon as you see something that doesn't play your way or cost saving program as well, given the very long down cycle, is it something that you consider as well potentially just strategy?
Kurt Sievers: Absolutely. I mean, one side of this equation you all will learn more on Thursday this week when we will provide the new financial model with our new gross margin forecast, which obviously is a function or a consequence of that. But let me give you some color on the pricing. So we will not try and build on price, Francois. Generally, I would say, the way how Bill and I and the management team, how we are running the company is if we have to compete on price only, then we are in the wrong product category. So there is always a gray zone in between. Of course, we have to stay -- try and stay competitive. But if it really comes to a point that the only way, the only leverage we have to win would be price, then we would eventually exit that. And you have examples. I mean we did this with powertrain microcontrollers in automotive, for example. There are over a number of years after we had acquired Freescale, we have actually exited some of these sub-segments and they have been heavily picked up by some of our peers. So yes, we are doing that or the banking cup business years ago. There was a similar thing where in the end, we don't try to compete on price. Now there is, of course, more to it, Francois because it is also our cost competitiveness. We work maniacally on bringing our own cost down. And the more recent moves with the BSMC joint venture, for example, in Singapore and a few other moves we have are actually helping us to come at the same time to a competitive cost base. So I mean, price is also a function of the cost which we can achieve and also there, we work very hard. But still, ultimately, no, we are not the company which would sacrifice gross margin for short-term market share. That's not the philosophy how we run the company.
Francois-Xavier Bouvignies: That’s what I thought. Thank you Kurt.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Buchalter of TD Cowen. Your line is now open.
Joshua Buchalter: Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. I'm sorry for harping on gross margin, but it's the one that’s in my inbox the most last night and this morning. I guess if we zoom out, I mean, your gross margins have been remarkably stable for like 10, 11 quarters and now are starting to see some leverage with revenue. Like can you, I guess, maybe walk through why now and it sounds like it's all maybe fixed cost coverage and utilization rates, and there's nothing going on with pricing, but the mix by end market isn't really changing anything within mix of products that we should be aware of or any other factors beyond, again, fixed cost coverage and purchase agreements that are really driving the sequential decline in gross margins in both the fourth quarter and I guess, what you're implying for the March quarter, which is another leg down? Thank you.
Bill Betz: Sure. Hey, Josh. Well thanks. Yes, I mean it's really just a function of the revenue levels over a fixed cost structure. Obviously, mix plays a role -- played a role in Q3 a bit and playing another role of some sort of it along with the lower revenues into Q4. And really, the step down going into Q1, it will be the total revenue level, to be honest with you. There's not really anything else fundamentally different. It's just that, okay, now you have to rebalance the inventory a bit and so maybe you don't build as much goods and you have to adjust foundry and so forth. So I know I will walk the team through the gross margin journey this upcoming Thursday. And again, I would say we've been quite resilient here compared to many of our peers because of that fluctuation of the revenues clearly have an impact to the gross margins and how they service their customers or stage inventory. So we feel pretty good of where we are. And again, it will be mostly a function of revenue over the near term. And then once we see the macro improve, we are very excited about some of the levers that Kurt just talked about more longer term to actually bring the gross margin above our high end of our current model today.
Joshua Buchalter: Got it, thank you. I appreciate the color there. For a follow-up, Kurt, I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks, there's a lot of volatility and changes going on at OEMs, in particular in the West. I was wondering if you can maybe speak to your confidence and ignoring the inventory changes, have there been changes in the assumptions on content at those customers and in particular, I think the 5-nanometer 32 MPE was supposed to ramp in sort of the 2026 time frame, is that still on progress and I guess, how are you seeing engagements for your content on the software-defined vehicle side? Thank you.
Kurt Sievers: Yes. Thanks, Josh. No change. We are actually very confident here and my leader for the auto business, Jens will speak in much greater detail on Thursday about the traction of the STV. But you will also see in the numbers that our STV S32 growth accelerated segment has outperformed our targets in spite of all the turmoil over the past three years. So we will show the numbers on Thursday. So that has great traction today. And we anticipate we'll continue to have great traction, and that’s absolutely, of course, includes the S32N, which is the 5 nanometer vehicle computer and a lot of other products. What does happen, however, is we do see a continued non-competitiveness of the Western OEMs versus Chinese OEMs. So I dare to say that from anything we can judge here, the pendulum swings more in favor of the Chinese car companies. That doesn't mean that the content per vehicle in Europe or the U.S. comes down but maybe the number of cars that they are building is coming down. So that's not a content question, it's more a unit production question, which is going probably in favor of China, which means next to our efforts to win with STV concepts across the board we want to particularly be sure that we keep winning also in China because that is where probably the bigger opportunity is going forward.
Joshua Buchalter: Thank you. See you Thursday.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Toshiya Hari: Hi, good morning. Thank you so much for taking the questions. I have two quick ones on automotive. Just wanted to clarify, Kurt, the incremental weakness you're seeing in auto, is that at this point purely due to weakening end demand or are your Tier 1s bringing down their inventory levels as we speak as well, I think last quarter, you gave a range of something like 2 to 12 weeks in terms of how they're managing their inventory, have you seen any changes to how they think about optimal inventory levels?
Kurt Sievers: It is unfortunately indeed both, Toshiya. So they bring down the expected unit numbers, which they will produce. And I said earlier that the SAR for this year is now at minus 2%. In Europe, by the way, at minus 5% year-over-year. But because of that, the 2 to 12 weeks, Toshiya also become a lower number, that's the whole issue. So with the OEMs telling the Tier 1s that they need less parts, they forecast also a lower inventory target. So we get a double whammy. We suffered directly from the lower production numbers but we also suffer from the overlaid lower inventory in absolute dollar terms, which is a function of that. So I would say the 2 to 12 weeks still stands but against the lower revenue number. And that's why -- and there is also an emotional element like towards year-end when they have a poor outlook. They, of course, have no interest whatsoever to end the year on the too high inventory. So they rather go lower than higher. So yes, it is both. The one is overlaid the other, which, of course, on the other side of all of this is the starting point for a better recovery. But again, I don't want to go to the point when that recovery is but in the end, it means once it grows, it grows even stronger. That's what we have the last three cycles out of that same situation.
Toshiya Hari: Yes, that makes a lot of sense. Thank you. And then as my follow-up, you've seen a mix shift in favor of hybrids at the expense of EVs, maybe not at the expense of EVs, but EV adoption has kind of stalled over the past several quarters. I think the industry consensus view is that over the long run, EVs do grow pretty materially. But as you talk to your partners and customers into 2025 and maybe early part of 2026, do you have a view on how hybrids perform or EVs perform relative to one another and more importantly, what are the implications from a content perspective for you guys at NXP? Thank you.
Kurt Sievers: Yes, so we don't have that much of a differential between hybrids and EVs because as you know, we don't have power discretes, which are much more sensitive to the difference between hybrids and full EVs. Our main thrust in the electrification space is the battery management systems and they don't differ that much from a dollar content perspective between the two. So therefore we don't have a sharp eye on the specific mix change between hybrid and full EV. At the same time, I just want to slightly maybe adjust what you said, the overall XEV, it has slowed absolutely, but it is still going to be a 14% growth this year. So in units, XEVs worldwide this year will grow by 14% over the year before, while the total SAR is declining by 2%. So I mean, that is still a very, very strong growth and it will be 37% of the total vehicle production this year. So 37% of all vehicles produced on the planet this year are actually XEVs. So it is moderated from a pace perspective relative to what it was forecasted to be but it is still growing very sharply, and that continues to help us. And yes, the other half of your question, yes, we do continue that over the longer term, we do continue to believe it will grow. We think something like a 75% global XEV penetration by 2030. That's kind of the data point which we have ahead of us.
Toshiya Hari: Appreciate that, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of William Stein of Truist Security. Your line is now open.
William Stein: Great. I'm just going to ask one, if I can. The weaker-than-expected results in Industrial and IoT and yet the strength in China, I'm a little bit confused because I always recall this segment to be very China and very China distribution focused. So maybe you can correct my understanding, is it -- am I correct, but what's outside of China is very, very weak or is my recollection of the mix of this in terms of geo and channel maybe stale? Thank you.
Kurt Sievers: It has a majority in China, that is very true. So you don't miscall it. The U.S. and Europe is very weak. And what we did say is that about 80% of the whole Industrial and IoT business is going through the distribution channel. So maybe you mix this with the China exposure. Not all of that 80% is in China, but 80% of the total segment is going through the channel. And since we keep up our channel discipline and don't over ship there, we basically are really fully exposed to the end demand because we are down to our eight weeks, and we keep it flat there. So therefore, the strength in China cannot overcompensate the weakness in Europe and the U.S. Yet China as a whole, as I said before, will grow into Q4 in both the industrial and the auto segment. But the rest is just falling so much that it can’t hold up.
William Stein: Thank you.
Jeff Palmer: Hey Marvin, we'll take one last question here today, please.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our last question comes from the line of Chris Danely of Citi. Your line is now open.
Christopher Danely: Hey gang, thanks for squeezing me in. Just two quick ones. So guys, can you just give us a sense of how much of your auto business is China? And then I'm sure you were at the Paris Auto Show as well, it seemed like there were dozens of China sort of EV companies and start-ups. If China gains a bunch of share in the EV market, what's the impact to NXP, is it good, is it bad, is it indifferent, how would that be?
Kurt Sievers: So Chris, we don't break down the geo by segment. But since auto is like 56% or 58% of NXP and we -- and you find in the Q, the total breakdown by geo of NXP, where China is between 35% and I think now even 37% with the strength in China. I mean, just assume that auto is probably not that far from the corporate average. And that means, indeed, Chris, yes with China getting stronger, and I can only echo what you say there is a whole entry later and great lineup of EVs coming out of China which at some point will find their way worldwide. That is to the extent we can see it today, a good thing for NXP because they are faster, they get faster innovation out, which means our newer products are coming into production much quicker than with Western OEMs. And if we keep up the pace, and we put everything in motion to do that, this continues to be a positive for NXP.
Christopher Danely: Great. Thanks, Kurt. I got to figure out a way to get that into my note on Enchilada. Chinese Enchilada VVs. And then just real quick, a follow-up for Bill. So Bill, your inventory days are basically in the $145 million to $150 million range for this year. Longer term, what's the goal there, are we going to keep it at $150 million while this weakness passes and then where are we looking at like longer term there?
Bill Betz: Yes, sure. Over the next couple of quarters, I think we'll be at this level until we decide to replenish the channel. And so that's about three weeks' worth. So that would naturally come down and pull down our internal inventory when we decide to go replenish. More longer-term, we will be updating this on Thursday on what we think is the required inventory target to service our customer needs. So please be patient with me and wait two more days and you'll get the whole complete model of everything of both the P&L and our working capital and CAPEX and so forth. So just please be patient with me there.
Christopher Danely: Will do, thanks guys.
Jeff Palmer: Thanks Chris.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn it back to Kurt Sievers, President and CEO, for closing remarks.
Kurt Sievers: Yes. Thanks, operator. Yes, we had to report today that we were taken by some surprise in the third quarter of an enhanced weakness in the automotive and industrial and U.S. and European markets, which is totally beyond our control. So what we do, we clearly maniacally try to control and will control what is in our power. And I hope the guide and the early signs which we show for next year, give you a feel for that. That does not take away anything from staying course on our soft landing strategy which should set us up very well for the recovery whenever it happens. We are not in a position to make a judgment on that. But when it happens, we should be set up very well with the low inventory in the channel and the low inventory at our direct customers. Now at the same time, I hope to see many of you in our Investor and Analyst Day this week, Thursday in Boston where we will speak about our long-term strategy and give you the long-awaited update on our long-term financial model. Can't wait to see you all. Thank you very much for your attention this morning. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-07-23 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the NXP 2Q '24 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation there'll be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this call may be recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Jeff Palmer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Jeff Palmer: Thank you, Michelle, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to NXP Semiconductors Second Quarter Earnings Call. With me on the call today is Kurt Sievers, NXP's President and CEO; and Bill Betz, our CFO. The call today is being recorded and will be available for replay from our corporate website. Today's call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause NXP's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the macroeconomic impact on the specific end markets in which we operate, the sale of new and existing products, and our expectations for the financial results for the third quarter of 2024. NXP undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements. For a full disclosure on forward-looking statements, please refer to our press release. Additionally, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures which are driven primarily by discrete events that management does not consider to be directly related to NXP's underlying core operating performance. Pursuant to Regulation G, NXP has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our second quarter 2024 earnings press release, which will be furnished to the SEC on Form 8-K and available on NXP's website in the Investor Relations section. Before we start the call today, I have one housekeeping item related to the 2024 Investor Day, which will be held at the Four Seasons in Boston on November 7th. The pre-registration website will be open on the NXP Investor Relations website beginning on August 7th. Space will be limited, we request that you register in advance and we hope to see you all in November in Boston. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Kurt.
Kurt Sievers: Thanks very much, Jeff, and good morning everyone. We appreciate you all joining our call today. Let me begin with quarter two. Revenue trends in all our focus end markets were in line with the midpoint of our guidance range. NXP delivered quarter two revenue of $3.127 billion, down 5% year-on-year and flat sequentially. The non-GAAP operating margin in quarter two was 34.3%, 70 basis points below the year-ago period and 30 basis points above the midpoint of our guidance. Year-on-year performance was a result of lower revenue in the automotive and communications infrastructure markets combined with consistent gross profit generation. From a channel perspective, distribution inventory was 1.7 months consistent with our guidance and just slightly up from the 1.6 months in quarter one. With that, we continue to operate well below our long-term target of 2.5 months of inventory in the channel. Now let me turn to the specific trends in our focus end markets. In automotive, revenue was $1.73 billion, down 7% versus the year-ago period and in line with our guidance. We have worked with our direct Tier 1 customers to ensure a continued orderly process of inventory digestion. In industrial and IoT, revenue was $616 million, up 7% versus the year-ago period and in line with our guidance. Our performance compared favorably versus the year-ago period, driven by demand in China and Asia Pacific, while the trends in the European and North American markets remained soft. In mobile, revenue was $345 million, up 21% versus the year-ago period and in line with our guidance. And finally, in communication infrastructure and other, revenue was $438 million, down 23% year-on-year and in line with our guidance. Now I will turn to our expectations for the third quarter 2024. We are guiding Q3 revenue to $3.25 billion, down 5% versus the third quarter of 2023 and up 4% sequentially. In the automotive end market, our revenue troughed in the second quarter and we will resume sequential growth in quarter three. This will be led by company-specific drivers and by now we are also moving much closer to shipping to end demand at several customers. At the same time, the inventory digestion process at select direct Tier 1 auto customers will extend into the second half, stretching beyond our initially expected levels and with a surprisingly wide variation of their desired steady-state inventory levels. Taken together, while resuming sequential growth in the second half of 2024, we continue to ship below automotive end demand in the somewhat softening automotive macro. In the industrial IoT end market, we see steady improvement in the consumer IoT demand in China. This is offset by persistent weakness in the core industrial demand in Europe and the Americas. In the mobile end markets, we anticipate normal seasonality from a lean inventory position. And finally, within communications infrastructure and other, we expect our company specific growth in secure RFID tagging to be more than offset by the previously discussed weakness in the remaining parts of that reportable end market. So at the midpoint, we anticipate the following trends in our business during the third quarter. Automotive is anticipated to be down in the low single digit percent range versus quarter three '23 and up in the mid-single digit percent range versus quarter two 2024. Industrial IoT is expected to be up in the low single digit percent range both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. Mobile is expected to be up in the mid-single digit percent range versus quarter three '23 and up in the mid-teens percent range versus quarter two '24. Finally, communication infrastructure and other is expected to be down in the mid 20 percent range year-on-year and down in the mid-single digit percent range versus quarter two '24. In summary, NXP trough in the first half of this year and now we expect to resume sequential growth through the second half. Therefore, during quarter three, we will continue to stage inventory just a touch higher in the channel in order to support our competitiveness and in order to prepare for the anticipated second half growth and beyond. With that, our quarter 3 guidance assumes approximately 1.8 months of distribution channel inventory. However, we will not grow channel inventory back to anywhere near our long-term target of 2.5 months within this calendar year. As a result, we will continue to stage inventory in a very controlled and targeted manner in the channel. Taken together, the second half will grow over the first half with the potential outcome for 2024 to be a modest annual revenue decline in the low single digit range. This is toward the low end of our earlier expectations because of the more persistent and deep inventory digestion at our auto Tier 1 customers and due to the continued weakness in our core industrial markets in Europe and the Americas. Before turning the call over to Bill, I would like to highlight what I believe is a truly strategic long-term investment for our hybrid manufacturing strategy. On June 5, 2024, we disclosed the formation of a 60-40 manufacturing joint venture between Vanguard International Semiconductor and NXP. The strategic rationale for the investment is to enable NXP to execute its long-term growth objectives with access to competitive cost, supply control, and geographic resilience. This move complements our participation in the TSMC-led joint venture in Europe, which we announced in August 2023. The new joint venture, VisionPower Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or VSMC, will build a 300 millimeter fab in Singapore, which is a global hub for third-party foundries with excellent access to a robust and highly skilled workforce for mature node manufacturing. Singapore is also where NXP and TSMC have successfully operated SSMC, a 200 millimeter joint venture, for over 25 years. Phase 1 of the VSMC joint venture fab will support 130 nanometers to 40 nanometer mixed signal power management and analog products, targeting the automotive, industrial, consumer, and mobile end markets. When fully operational in 2029, the fab will produce 55,000 wafers per month, and there is a Phase 2 option to expand the fab, providing an additional 45,000 wafers per month, including 28 nanometer process flows. A key factor for the long-term success of the joint venture is that TSMC will license the foundational process flows, as well as NXP contributing proprietary mixed signal process flows. We are very confident to partner with Vanguard, an independent trailing-edge foundry located in Taiwan. Vanguard's largest shareholder is TSMC, which owns approximately 30% of Vanguard and which will help to assure the long-term success of the joint venture. From a financial perspective, NXP will make a total investment of $2.8 billion between 2024 and 2028, with the peak investment period being in 2025. This investment enables NXP to address about $4 billion of incremental annual revenue, for which the capacity has not been available to us before. Furthermore, this joint venture opens the door to a strategic roadmap to eventually consolidate our 200 millimeter internal factories over time into a very cost competitive footprint. And now, I would like to pass the call over to you, Bill, for a review of our financial performance.
Bill Betz: Thank you, Kurt, and good morning to everyone on today's call. As Kurt has already covered the drivers of the revenue during Q2 and provided our revenue outlook for Q3, I will move to the financial highlights. Overall, the Q2 financial performance was good. Revenue, non-GAAP gross margin, operating expenses, and distribution channel inventory all came in line with our guidance. Turning to Q2 specifics, total revenue was $3.127 billion, down 5% year-on-year. We generated $1.83 billion in non-GAAP gross profit and reported a non-GAAP gross margin of 58.6%, up 20 basis points year-on-year, and 10 basis points above the midpoint of our guidance range. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $760 million, or 24.3% of the revenue, down $11 million year-on-year. This was $5 million below the midpoint of our guidance due to lower than anticipated hiring. From a total operating profit perspective, non-GAAP operating profit was $1.07 billion, and non-GAAP operating margin was 34.3%, down 70 basis points year-on-year, and up 30 basis points above the midpoint of our guidance. Non-GAAP interest expense was $67 million, with taxes for ongoing operations of $169 million, or a 16.8% non-GAAP effective tax rate. Non-controlling interest was $6 million, and stock-based compensation, which is not included in our non-GAAP earnings, was $114 million. Taken together, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.20, consistent with our guidance. Now I would like to turn to the changes in our cash and debt. Our total debt at the end of Q2 was $10.18 billion, with our cash balance of $3.26 billion, down $49 million sequentially, due to the cumulative effect of capital returns, CapEx investments, and cash generation during Q2. The resulting net debt was $6.92 billion, and we exited the quarter with a trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA of $5.3 billion. Our ratio of net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of Q2 was 1.3 times, and our 12-month adjusted EBITDA interest coverage ratio was 23.1 times. During Q2, we paid $260 million in cash dividends and repurchased 310 million of our shares. Taken together, we returned $570 million to shareholders, representing 99% of non-GAAP free cash flow. After the end of Q2, and through Friday, July 19th, we repurchased an additional $69 million of our shares under an established 10b5-1 program. Turning to working capital metrics, days of inventory was 148 days, an increase of four days sequentially, while distribution channel inventory was 1.7 months, or just over seven weeks. The combination of balance sheet inventory and channel inventory was about 200 days of inventory. Days receivable were 27 days, up one day sequentially, and days payable were 64 days, a decrease of one day versus the prior quarter. Taken together, our cash conversion cycle was 111 days, an increase of six days versus the prior quarter. Cash flow from operations was $761 million, and net CapEx was $184 million, or 6% of revenue, resulting in non-GAAP free cash flow of $577 million, or about 18% of revenue. Turning to our expectations for the third quarter, as Kurt mentioned, we anticipate Q3 revenue to be $3.25 billion, plus or minus about $100 million. At the midpoint, this is down 5% year-on-year and up 4% sequentially. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be about 58.5%, plus or minus 50 basis points. As Kurt noted in his prepared remarks, we will continue to stage inventory in the channel to support growth in future periods. Our guidance assumes approximately 1.8 months of distribution channel inventory exiting Q3. Operating expenses are expected to be $760 million, plus or minus $10 million. Taken together, we see non-GAAP operating margin to be 35.1% at the midpoint. We estimate non-GAAP financial expense to be $67 million, with the non-gap tax rate to be 16.8% of profit before tax. Non-controlling interest and other will be about $9 million. For Q3, we suggest for modeling purposes, you use an average share count of 258.5 million shares. We expect stock-based compensation, which is not included in our non-GAAP guidance, to be $116 million. For capital expenditures, we expect to be around 6%. Taken together, at the midpoint, this implies a non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.42. Before going to my closing remarks, I will provide additional details of the VSMC joint venture, as discussed by Kurt earlier. The total cost of the joint venture will be $7.8 billion. The NXP investment into the venture is $2.8 billion, made up of $1.6 billion commitment for a 40% equity stake in the joint venture, and an additional $1.2 billion investment for long-term capacity access. Vanguard will invest $3.1 billion, made up of $2.4 billion for a 60% equity stake, and an additional $700 million for long-term capacity access. The remainder of the funding will be provided by other sources in the form of subsidies and loan guarantees in Singapore. This joint venture will not consolidate into NXP's financial statements, but the profits and losses will be reflected under the equity accounting investees in our non-GAAP income statement. The investment will be funded from cash flow from ongoing operations, with no need to raise additional debt. Additionally, the joint venture will provide approximately 200 basis points of gross margin expansion to our total corporate gross margin when fully operational in 2029. The gross profit benefit is derived from the incremental revenue, the benefits of the increase to 300 millimeter wafer size, and the avoidance of typical margin stack-in when buying material in the commercial foundry market. So in closing, looking through the remainder of 2024, I would like to highlight three areas of focus. First, with the VSMC and ESMC investments, there is no change to our capital allocation policy. We have returned $2.4 billion, or 81% of the free cash flow generated over the last 12-months. Furthermore, we will continue to be active in the market repurchasing NXP shares. Second, we will continue to be disciplined to manage what is in our control and stay within our long-term financial model. Specifically, we expect our gross margin will continue to perform at or above the high end of the long-term model. And then lastly, we feel confident to resume sequential growth through the second half while we continue to stage inventory in the channel in a targeted and controlled manner. I would like to now turn it back to the operator for your questions.
Q - Vivek Arya : Thanks for taking my question. For this calendar year, Kurt, you're suggesting total sales down low single-digit, which as Bill also mentioned, I think that suggests Q4 up mid-to-high single-digit sequentially. Normally, your Q4s are kind of flat or down. So I'm curious, what is giving NXP the confidence that you can have sequential growth in Q4? Are there certain end markets you think will do better than seasonality, or is this all kind of channel inventory refill? I'm just trying to understand the dynamics as you see it for Q4 right now.
Kurt Sievers: Yes, thanks and good morning, Vivek. Certainly, it's not the channel refill. I tried to be very specific in my prepared remarks that we continue to be very thoughtful and cautious with channel refill. We've worked very hard over a long period of time to keep the channel lean. So we want to really tune this to the growth in the coming quarters in a careful manner. So no, the channel is going to go nowhere near our longer-term target of 2.5 months. So that stays for next year. We will go to 1.8 months in the third quarter, and then maybe a little bit further up in the fourth quarter. So no, that's not it. What is much more behind that continued resumption of growth now in the second half, which then includes quarter four, is a re-acceleration of automotive. You see that actually in the third quarter, I mean, we turned the corner from a quarter two performance in automotive, which was a mid-single-digit decline to now a mid-single-digit growth sequentially in automotive and we definitely want to continue, which has two legs, one is company-specific drivers, which is led by radar, but also a couple of other new platforms which are ramping. But also less and less need for digestion of over-inventory at our Tier 1 automotive customers. That will be getting less, while at the same time, I also have to say in this call, it takes longer than we thought. So it reaches now into the third quarter. We were hopeful it would end a little earlier, so that it's protracted longer, which is one of the reasons why actually the second half growth is a little less than we had assumed earlier. Still, it does grow. So automotive is the source of that. Secondly, the RFID secure tagging, which I mentioned earlier, is a company-specific growth, which is going to be with us both in the third as well as in the fourth quarter. And we are also optimistic that industrial IoT will keep growing from our lean inventory position in the channel.
Vivek Arya: All right, thank you, Kurt. And just one more on automotive. Post-COVID, a lot of OEMs and Tier 1s built up a lot of inventory to avoid the problems they ran into as they were recovering. Do you think that process is now behind us? Do you think they will hold to those levels? Do you think they will start to go back to the prior trends? The reason I ask the question is that just as you're kind of signaling somewhat of a turn in automotive, auto production is not that great. And there is just a lot of concern that maybe inventory levels are still too high, which is why it's kind of pleasantly surprising to hear you be somewhat more positive on the automotive recovery. So maybe just give us a sense of where we are in the supply-demand dynamic for automotive in the second half of this year versus what you thought it would be three months ago?
Kurt Sievers: Yes, so yes, first of all, indeed, the latest S&P forecast for SAAR for the calendar year '24 dropped a little to a 2% decline. So we were more in the flattish kind of area and now they forecast a 2% decline. So yes, the auto macro has deteriorated a little from the views which we had 90 days ago. I do believe the bigger factor is actually that indeed the inventory digestion adds the Tier 1 automotive customers, which is the direct customers of NXP, so that is the 60% of our automotive business, which goes through direct. That takes longer, which indeed is a function of two things. One is they are further down adjusting in some cases their inventory targets and it is all over the place. So for our customers, inventory targets range between two and 12 weeks. So we have automotive Tier 1 customers who go for a 12-week target and others who are as far down as a two-week target. We have our views on this and I guess we will discuss a bit more in that call here because going so low clearly will lead to a pretty sharp need to refill later. I mean, that led to the whole supply crisis in the first place a couple of years ago. But they are adjusting these targets on the go and that is also what keeps us to be very transparent. It keeps us growing a little bit less into quarter three than we would have thought 90 days ago because that keeps going a bit longer. Where exactly it's going to land is hard to say, Vivek. So it's hard to say what the target average of those inventory end numbers is from the Tier 1s because it's also going to change probably how they think about their future. If they get higher call-offs from the OEMs, they will start to want to increase their inventories again pretty quickly. But again, I can tell you today their targets are between two and 12 weeks and we still have a little bit of work to do in the third quarter to get there. But you see it is already much less than before, which is indeed why our automotive growth has now snapped back into positive sequential and into what is only a low single digit annual decline, which was a high single digit annual decline in the past quarter. So you see the tide is already changing, but we are not through.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from C.J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.
C.J. Muse: Yes, good morning. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question, just to follow-up on the auto side. Can you kind of drill down by end market between radar, VMS, advanced analog, and really kind of, I guess, help us understand where you think inventory is clear and maybe where there still remain excesses. And then as we look into 2025, how are you thinking about acceleration by these different segments?
Kurt Sievers: Yes, C.J. So relative to how is the inventory at the Tier 1s between those different product segments, it is completely customer specific, C.J. There is no overriding pattern because it really depended on what they thought they had to order through all of this NCNR [ph] time during the last two years. So we don't have a pattern there, C.J. There is no answer to that question because it is absolutely different customer by customer. We also have Tier 1 customers where we are done with inventory digestion, which is actually driving the growth into the third quarter, where none of the product categories has any more surplus inventory. So it’s a completely uneven picture. And secondly, mind you, that their targets are not the same. I think I said to Vivek earlier, targets range between two and 12 weeks. So the one would declare 12 weeks as being on target and no over inventory. The other with three weeks says, I still have a week too much because my target is two. So therefore, I can't answer that question because it's just all over the place. However, in general, our accelerated growth drivers, think about the electrification, BMS chips, think about S32, core right processing, think about radar. They tend to grow now anyway because they all have ramping platforms in the second half, which are overpowering, I would say the inventory digestion, which is why we call that out as company specific drivers, which is above and ahead of the inventory digestion in any case in the second half. And of course, that's going to continue next year, C.J. But then the base is also going to be fine because by then the -- say all the rest of the business, which might still see some inventory digestion will be clear too.
C.J. Muse: Very helpful. And I guess just a quick follow-up, given kind of the change in your revenue outlook for the year, but still looking for strong growth into Q4 and 2025, how are you thinking about managing utilization rates?
Bill Betz: Yes. Hey, C.J. This is Bill. So right now on utilizations on our internal factories, we plan to run them for the rest of the year in the low 70s. We don't expect to bring them up or fully utilize them until 2025. As you can see, we have a bit higher inventory on our balance sheet. And again, we probably have holding about 25 days in theory that belongs into the channel, so we'll navigate through that. Another 10 days of strategic inventory and the remainder of 10 days of in-orders that come in within a quarter that we want to serve the upside. So we think inventory gets back in balance sometime in 2025 at this current picture.
C.J. Muse: Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Ross Seymore : Hi, guys. Thanks for me asking the question. I want to pivot over to the industrial and IoT segment. Kurt, do you think that is a demand issue on the core industrial side or is it similar to the inventory burn dynamic that we've talked so much about on the automotive side? And really what I'm getting at is, is that going to start growing more meaningfully on a sequential basis due to the core industrial just when you start shipping closer to demand? Or is this, especially in the U.S. and Europe, truly a demand issue?
Kurt Sievers: Yes, thanks. Good morning, Ross. It is indeed, in our view, a demand issue in the U.S. and Europe. So the U.S. and Europe is where we have more of the core industrial business and there we clearly see it is a macro-driven demand issue and at least in our case, not really that much a function of over-inventory. And yes, where we do see growth into the third and fourth quarter is actually more from China and that is more led from the consumer IoT part of the business. So that 40%, which is more IoT, what we call IoT that is actually doing pretty well, which by the way is a matter of fact for China overall. So when I think about the geographies and how they've done in the past quarter and the second quarter, then actually China is the one which is growing both year-on-year as well as, or which has grown both year-on-year as well as sequentially. And that also plays into industrial where then the consumer IoT is the piece which is pulling it. So answer is, in short, it is a demand issue very much from the Americas and Europe in core industrial.
Ross Seymore: Thanks for that. I guess as my follow-up then switching gears over to one for Bill, I know you guys are changing your capital allocation, but you talked about the VSMC CapEx peaking next year. I believe you have a slug of debt due again next year. Any sort of change to the CapEx we should think about and or just the thoughts on kind of how free cash flow might develop given those two dynamics as we try to judge what you may or may not do on dividends and share repurchase, et cetera?
Bill Betz: Yes. Hey, Ross. Relate to our capital allocation again, as I stated, there's no change. We're going to be continually active buying back the stock, continue making sure our dividend is at 25% of our cash flow from operations as right now I think we're around 28% on a trailing standpoint. We're going to continue to do some small M&A tuck-ins that we've been doing over the last several quarters. Related to the timing of the cash for both ESMC and VSMC, they are at different times and they will show up in our cash flow statement in different areas. So think about the equity investments for both those ventures will show up in our equity investment accounting on our cash flow statement. And again, those are spread out for VSMC specifically. Think about five years where the first three years represent about 75% of the $2.8 billion that we talked about and the remainder over the two years. As you know, we also have an investment of a 10% equity position in ESMC. Again, similar but different timing in equity. And then there's a portion of, we break that out, of that $2.8 billion that I talked about, the $1.6 billion is equity. The $1.2 billion will come out of working capital operations. It's more of a guarantee of supply where we have to actually get more supply up front so that we can service our customers and be able to deliver incremental revenue. Because at this point in time, we just don't have that capacity available based on all the design wins we have that are going to ramp at that time frame. So that's the strategic nature of this venture related to it. Now on CapEx specifically, we're going to stay at the low end of our model at 6%. I don't see us going above that any time soon. And again, we will probably update the CapEx as a percentage of revenue during our November 7th Investor Day.
Ross Seymore: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Francois Bouvignies with UBS. Your line is open.
Francois Bouvignies : Hi, thank you very much. So I have two quick questions. The first one is maybe for Kurt. I mean, you mentioned the company specific in auto in the second half of the year as one of the drivers for improvement. Could you be a bit more specific, give more details on what platform and what products especially you are launching any drivers that is driving that. You mentioned radar, but I was wondering if you could be a bit more specific. Also in the context that we see that OEMs are talking about launches in the second half but the demand is still unclear for this. So I just wanted to dig on these company specific drivers on the platforms? And then I have a follow-up, if I can.
Kurt Sievers: Yes, sure, Francois. So the growth in automotive in the second half is really having two legs. The company specific, which I will reply to, but I have to highlight it is also just moving closer to shipping to end demand. Not all the way there, but moving closer because of inventory digestion being more behind us than in front of us. Now on the company specific side, I mean, let me call out indeed radar. We have ramps with at least two Tier 1 automotive companies which are operating absolutely globally. So they are serving OEM platforms across the globe. So we are pretty well hatched here relative to end demand -- from end demand perspective. And those are design wins, Francois, which we made probably three years ago or so, which are now finally coming into production. Everything is being prepared. And yes, of course, I mean, with a SAAR of minus 2%, there is always something which is a little less and something which is a little more. But since it is widespread, both geographically and across different OEMs, we are actually absolutely optimistic that those numbers will come in the way we want them to come in. So there hasn't been also any change over the past couple of quarters in the view of preparing that. And again, it is about radar, front phasing and side radar platforms for global OEMs. Maybe Francois, if you need to get a bit more color, you know that when we talk about radar, it is typically a complete chipset. So we talk about the front-end transceiver, the microprocessor and in several cases, not always it even includes Ethernet connectivity and power management.
Francois Bouvignies: I appreciate the color. Thank you, Kurt. And maybe the follow-up is on the maybe more for Bill on the pricing dynamic. I'm probably a bit too picky here, but your guidance is 10 bps lower on the gross margin side versus Q2. I feel ashamed to ask, but despite higher revenues. So I just wanted to check the dynamic on the gross margin and maybe if you could talk about the pricing dynamic in the market would be helpful. Thank you.
Bill Betz: Sure. Let me first say about pricing. Pricing this year is flattish. Again, no increases, no decreases, so that's not causing the movement in the gross margin. Again, in Q2 we kind of did slightly better by 10 basis points and that was driven by favorable product mix. As we transition into Q3 we do see the favorability like you point out on the higher revenues over our fixed cost. But this is being offset by slightly unfavorable product mix that we plan to ship. So therefore at the moment, those two are kind of offsetting each other. And just to remind everyone, we ship over 10,000 different part numbers a quarter on average. And to be honest with you, to manage the mix exactly right is quite difficult and that's why we put the plus or minus 50 basis points on our gross margin. Now on the positive side, we have multiple tailwinds to help improve our gross margins further. Both I would say more in the medium and long term. We talked about earlier about the internal utilizations. Again, we're going to keep them in the low 70s for the rest of the year because of balancing our inventory. But we expect in 2025 that becomes a tailwind for us as we bring that up. As clearly as revenue improves we get that fall through over the fixed costs as we demonstrated in Q3, but unfortunately the mix is slightly going the other way. Timing of the replenishing our distribution channel, it carries higher average, higher margins. And so you heard Kurt talk about we're not going back to 2.5 this year, so expect that more in 2025. Internally, ongoing productivity, cost reductions of course we're doing. We continue to have this big, big drive on really focusing on additional long tail customers with our distribution partners, which over time should benefit. As we always talk, the continued ramping of our new products which carry a higher margin. And then more longer, longer term as I had in my prepared remarks, we expect to improve our 2029 margins by over 200 basis points of whatever the actual 2028 gross margins are driven by our strategic investments in this newly VSMC joint venture. Again, we're going to talk more about this on our financial model on November 7th and you all know I've hinted many times that 58% is not our final destination.
Francois Bouvignies: Great, thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Your line is open.
Stacy Rasgon : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. For my first one, on your auto commentary. I got to admit, I'm a little confused. So the auto market seems to be worsening versus your prior expectations but the inventory draining is mostly done. You got some company-specific drivers. Like are your auto expectations better for yourself or worse than they were three months ago? Like is it like you thought you were going to grow high single digits for the year and now it's going to grow mid-single digits? If you could just frame for us how your overall auto expectations for yourselves have changed over the next -- over the last 90 days, that would be super helpful for me.
Kurt Sievers: Yes, hi Stacy. I would say our auto expectations for the second half are in some in line with what we had before. So I would say similar to what we would have said 90 days ago, but with 2 moving components underneath. The inventory digestion to be done is actually worse. So we have lower headwind than we had anticipated some time ago. At the same time, some of our company-specific stuff is actually going better. Those two things are completely unrelated, Stacy. It just happens to play out for us that, that part of the company is actually more in line with what we had seen before. But again, I want to be very transparent. The inventory digestion in automotive is a longer drag on us than I would have thought and I would have talked about 90 days ago, given all the changes on the inventory targets they have, which I explained in earlier questions.
Stacy Rasgon: Thank you. That's helpful. For my follow-up, I was just curious. I know the channel inventory is not ripping higher, but it is ticking higher. Where is that inventory getting built? Is it all industrial? Is it industrial and auto? And it did sound like I think I heard maybe it was Bill say the 2.5 target would be for 2025. So are you still planning to go back to 2.5 months as we get into next year?
Kurt Sievers: Yes, Stacy. So several points here. Yes, our long-term target remains to be 2.5. Absolutely. I mean we -- and that's not just because it used to be our target, but we went through the whole analysis, what makes sense, what is strategically meaningful. And it happens to be that indeed the outcome, given our product and segment mix, is that 2.5 remains the long-term target. What I did say in my prepared remarks is also indeed we don't see a case where we go back to the 2.5 at the end of this calendar year. I would almost say by far not. And we just say that because we don't want to put smoke and mirrors on this. What is this annual outlook? Is it all driven by channel refill? No, no, no, it is not. And here, Stacy, I would also say that is a change probably versus 90 days ago. 90 days ago, I thought we might want to be a bit more aggressive in refilling the channel, which given the poor macro environment in the Americas and Europe, we feel is probably not appropriate. So that is not lost revenue. So when we have now a little lower outlook than we had before, it is just that we do a little less into the channel than what we would have planned earlier. For reasons which have to do with the macro and we just want to continue to operate the company in a very responsible way. Now finally, you asked where does it go into the channel, where we take it up. It's really a cross-segment, Stacy. It is about high runner products. The way we think about this is there are certain products which are really hot in the channel. And we have to make sure that we have sufficient of those products on the shelves of our distributors such that they push them instead of competitive products from our peers. And there we are a little behind and are busy to push those products in. And they are, I would say, neither geography nor segment specific. They really go across the board. It's more product specific.
Stacy Rasgon: Got it. That's helpful. Thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Thomas O'Malley with Barclays. Your line is open.
Thomas O'Malley: Hey, Kurt and Bill. Thanks for letting me ask a question. My first one is on the comp side. So I think on the last earnings call you talked about the RFID business representing roughly about 50% of the mix. In your comments, it kind of sounds like RFID is still doing well, but pretty much all other areas of the business are more than offsetting. If you look at the growth profile of that business going forward, I mean, is RFID kind of 60 plus percent of that business now? And how should we think about that business into the back half of the year? Obviously, September, you're saying comp down kind of mid-single digits, but is there continued RFID growth with other stuff falling off faster? Just could you give us the profile how that business should trend going forward?
Kurt Sievers: Yes. Hey, Tom, I'm sorry. And we might have been confusing here. To be very specific, RFID is not 50% of that segment. What is 50% of the segments by the end of last year, what was then 50% is what we call secure cards, which includes payment cards, transport cards, and RFID and security. So the RFID is a part of that 50%, Tom. And for the rest, everything you said is right. The RFID keeps growing. It keeps growing into Q3. It will keep growing sequentially into Q4, but it is less than 50% of the total, which is why it is easily offset by the rest. And the rest is then -- and again here the numbers from the end of last year, the Legacy Digital Networking business is about 30 -- or was about 30% by the end of last year. And this is where we said we selectively start to end of life products after kind of eight years collecting good cash from that part. And it is the pretty lumpy radio power business, RF power business for the mobile base stations, which at the end of last year was 20%. And that is hanging in there. I would say it's kind of up and down every other quarter, but in the end, more on the downward slope. So basically think about this whole comps infra segment end of last year, 50% secure cards, including RFID, 30% legacy digital networking, 20% RF power. And the only structurally growing part in there is actually the RFID.
Thomas O'Malley: Super helpful. And then if I think about that trajectory, what you normally see with mobile in the fourth quarter and kind of your commentary about being kind of at the low end of your initial targets are kind of low single digits total revenue down year-over-year. I guess the last two pieces are just the industrial and IOT and auto into the fourth quarter. You kind of mentioned hey, auto was down high single digits year-over-year. Now it's down low single digits year-over-year. Is your expectation for December to kind of get to that year-over-year growth? Or are you expecting most of that sequential growth into the fourth quarter to get you to that low single digits year-over-year to come from industrial and IOT? Thank you.
Kurt Sievers: Hey Thomas, look you are really pushing it a step too far now. We tried to give a lot of color for the second half with the guidance of the third quarter. I really can't give you all the breakout on how each segment is going to do in the fourth quarter. And honestly speaking Tom, we also don't know that. I mean there are things which are constantly moving around, especially relative to these two things. One is the inventory targets of our Tier 1 automotive customers. The other one is the macro for industrial in Europe and the U.S., which could or could not get better a little earlier or a little later. So honestly speaking, I don't know. We just say here the outcome of all of this, if you put it all together, is going to be this low single digit decline for the whole company over the complete year. But the trend and that piece I will tell you, the trend in automotive is a positive one. I mean we left the trough in automotive behind us. I want to be dead clear. Quarter two was the trough in automotive, which I think was a 9% peak to trough for automotive. And it is now coming up. How fast is something we have to see because it's really a function of the inventory digestion.
Thomas O'Malley: Thank you, Kurt.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Jeffries. Your line is open.
Blayne Curtis : Hey, thanks guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. I have actually two questions on auto processors. So Kurt, I wanted to ask you, one of your European competitors has been talking about share gains. I know it's kind of fair while you're correcting and talk about share. But I wonder if you just talk about, particularly in China, your share position with auto processors. I know you've talked about qualifying a Chinese fab as well. Can you maybe talk about the timing there and the decision to do that?
Kurt Sievers: Yes, hi Blayne. So first of all, I just want to be sure everybody knows we are the number one in auto processors worldwide. Whatever you hear from peers is typically related to parts of that, which is the microcontroller part or the application processor part, et cetera. If you put it all together, you'll find enough third-party evidence that NXP is the number one and keeps being the number one. And that holds also for China. So I think in China, we have a fairly strong position in processors. We actually push the performance very much up. So our attempt and our strategy in China is to lead customers to higher performance because we know that is where we have the most differentiation. We all know that Chinese local competition is coming in in the non-auto world on the low-end microcontrollers. I think it's just a function of time that they will try to do this also in automotive. So all of our strategy here is to push for the higher performance processors, not microcontrollers, but microprocessors, which for us is the 16 nanometer devices and going forward even lower. And here, I think we have a unique and strong position, Blayne. So I feel actually we are in a good place. Now when it comes to manufacturing, absolutely right. In our China for China strategy, which is a big requirement in the meantime from our Chinese customers, our first tactical step is provide local manufacturing capability. And that includes the microcontrollers and microprocessors. For microprocessors, it is quite straightforward because we manufacture them in 16 FinFET from a big Taiwanese foundry. I think we published this earlier. It is TSMC. And TSMC has a fully operational factory in Nanjing in China, which is doing 16 nanometers. So it's a copy exact factory of what they have in Taiwan. So we are just transferring it from Taiwan into China. So it's a fairly straightforward process to allow local manufacturing for microprocessors of NXP in China.
Blayne Curtis: Thanks, Kurt. And if I just follow-up on what you just said there, the 16 nanometer domain zonal was something you outlined in, I think, 2021 Analyst Day. Could you just maybe talk about, I know you're going to talk about it more in your upcoming Analyst Day, but in terms of these are very long-dated design cycles. But when should we think about revenue from these products? I mean, I don't know if you can size it today or kind of give us a sense of how material that could be as you're looking at next year.
Kurt Sievers: Yes, well, the 16 nanometer ones are in full production plane. So they absolutely contribute to one of the three accelerated growth drivers, which we highlighted in our '21 to '24 growth. So I think we guided 9% to 14% for automotive. And there were three high growth drivers. One of them is the S32 platform, which is the performance processing for automotive. And the big part of that is indeed 16 nanometer processors. And what I can say now ahead of the November 7th Analyst Day is that for that piece we will be ahead of target. So we laid out growth targets and the automotive processing will be actually above the target which we had laid out in November '21.
Blayne Curtis: Thanks, Kurt.
Operator: Thank you. We have time for one last question. And that question comes from Chris Danely with Citi. Your line is open.
Chris Danely : Hey, thanks, Gang, for squeezing me in. A lot of helpful color on the automotive end market. Are you seeing any trends by geography in the automotive end market or any geographies better or worse than the others? Any particular strengths or weaknesses?
Kurt Sievers: Yes. Hi, Chris. Yes, I clearly say that China is in a better position than the other geographies in automotive these days, which I think is also a function of the continued success of electric vehicles in China. If you look at all the numbers, then electric vehicles, both hybrid and battery electric, continue to grow significantly. I think S&P just published something like 21% unit growth in xEVs in China in '24 over '23, which is a staggering growth. And that reflects also back into our business. So yes, I would call out China.
Chris Danely: Thanks. And then just a quick follow-up on your own inventory days. It continues to creep higher at 150 days. Given there's some sales growth coming in the second half, do you think your inventory days will go down? And are we looking at some sort of new range? Are you comfortable with 150? Where's the end goal? Where do you expect that to trend?
Bill Betz: Sure, Chris. Let me take that. Based on the latest second half guidance for the revenues that Kurt talked about, we do expect internal inventory days to start coming down in Q4. As Q3 will probably be similar levels of Q2. And the reason for this, it takes a bit longer is where the inventory is staged. When you look at our Q filings, we reduced for WIP and moved products into finished goods as we service about 85% internally. So we add more value to that product through our back ends. Then this finished goods will help support the Q3 sequential growth. And we expect a similar profile entering into Q4 to ensure we service our customers around that. So again, I think this is probably near our peak levels. And hopefully we expect Q4 to start coming down and then get this back in order in 2025.
Chris Danely: Great. Thanks, Bill.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes our question and answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Kurt Sievers for closing remarks.
Kurt Sievers: Thanks, operator. Look, we really see that we have now probably the trough clearly behind us. Navigated the cycle successfully with what we call consistent gross margin performance through all of this down cycle period. The company is resuming growth, most importantly both in automotive as well as in industrial IoT. In automotive, turning from a mid-single-digit decline to a mid-single-digit growth now sequentially. In industrial IoT, we stay in the positive growth regime both year-on-year as well as sequentially. However, we also have detractors. So the digestion of direct automotive customer inventory takes longer than we had anticipated. And given that we also stay a little bit more muted in terms of how much channel refill, how fast we will do. Those factors play them into our guide for the year being more of a low single-digit decline annually over last year, which is toward the lower end of what our earlier expectations were. But the growth hasn't gone away, it just shifts out, if you will, into next year, which makes us actually quite optimistic and we will continue to be super vigilant in operating the company in a very responsible way. Thank you very much for the call this morning.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.
Bill Betz: Thank you.
Operator: You're welcome.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-04-30 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to NXP's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Jeff Palmer, Senior VP of Investor Relations. You may begin. 
Jeff Palmer: Thank you, Towanda, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to NXP Semiconductor's first quarter earnings call. With me on the call today is Kurt Sievers, NXP's President and CEO; and Bill Betz, our CFO. The call today is being recorded and will be available for replay from our corporate website.  
 Today's call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause NXP's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the macroeconomic impact on the specific end markets in which we operate, the sale of new and existing products and our expectations for our financial results for the second quarter of 2024. NXP undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements. For a full disclosure on forward-looking statements, please refer to our press release.  
 Additionally, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures which are driven primarily by discrete events that management is not considered to be directly related to NXP's underlying core operating performance. Pursuant to Regulation G, NXP has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our first quarter 2024  earnings press release, which will be furnished to the SEC on Form 8-K and available on SP's website in the Investor Relations section.  
 Now I'd like to turn the call over to Kurt. 
Kurt Sievers: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining the call this morning. Beginning with quarter 1, revenue trends in all our focused end markets were in line with the midpoint of our guidance. NXP delivered quarter 1 revenue of $3.13 billion, essentially flat year-on-year. Non-GAAP operating margin in quarter 1 was 34.5%, 30 basis points below the year ago period and 60 basis points above the midpoint of our guidance. 
 Year-on-year performance was a result of consistent gross profit generation, offset by slightly higher operating expenses as we continue to invest in our future business. From a channel perspective, we held distribution inventory at a tight 1.6 months level, consistent with our guidance and well below our long-term target of 2.5 months of inventory EBITDA. Now let me turn to the specific trends in our focus end markets.  
 In Automotive, revenue was $1.80 billion, down 1% versus the year ago period and in line with our guidance. We continue to manage an orderly process of inventory digestion with our major direct Automotive Tier 1 customers. In Industrial & IoT, revenue was $574 million, up 14% versus the year ago period and in line with our guidance. Our performance compares favorably versus the year ago period when the business had dropped. Since 1Q '23, we have seen a steady sequential improvement in the Industrial & IoT demand trends, so not yet back to the long-term levels, which we would expect. In Mobile, revenue was $349 million, up 34% versus the year ago period, where again, the business had troughed already back in 1Q '23.  
 And lastly, in Communication Infrastructure & Other, revenue was $399 million, down 25% year-on-year and in line with our guidance. And now let me turn to our expectations for the second quarter 2024. We are guiding quarter 2 revenue to $3.125 billion, down 5% versus the second quarter of 2023 and flat sequentially. In the Automotive end market, revenue trends during the first half of 2024 reflect a continued inventory digestion process at our direct Tier 1 Automotive customers compounded by a soft Automotive macro environment. In the Industrial & IoT end markets, we had already trust in 1Q '23. We see improving demand in China, in part thanks to our lean channel position as well as thanks to incrementally healthier end demand. This is expected to be partially offset by soft end demand in Europe and the Americas.  
 In the Mobile end market, we continue to witness the expected modest cyclical recovery. And finally, within the Communication Infrastructure & Other end markets, our resumption of sequential growth is primarily driven by secure RFID tagging. Taken together at the midpoint, we anticipate the following trends in our business during the second quarter. Automotive is expected to be down in the high single-digit percent range versus quarter 2 '23 and down in the mid-single-digit percent range versus quarter 1, '24. Industrial & IoT is expected to be up in the high single-digit percent range for both year-on-year and versus quarter 1 '24. Mobile is expected to be up in the low 20% range year-on-year and about flat versus Q1 '24.  
 And finally, Communication Infrastructure & Other is expected to be down in the mid-20% range year-on-year and up in the high single-digit percent range versus quarter 1, '24. So in summary, we are beginning to see incrementally improving demand signals for the second half of '24 across all end markets. Hence, during quarter 2, we will begin to state slightly higher inventory in the channel to support our competitiveness for the anticipated second half growth. Therefore, our guidance assumes approximately 1.7 months of distribution channel inventory exiting quarter 2. And if demand momentum continues, we will stage additional channel inventory during the second half, however, in a very controlled and targeted manner.  
 So it is unlikely that we grow channel inventory back to our long-term target of 2.5 months within this calendar year. And taken all together, the potential outcome for 2024 should be in the range of a modest annual revenue growth or decline, just consistent with our views from a quarter ago. Overall, we continue to manage what is in our control, enabling NXP to drive solid profitability and earnings in a challenging demand environment. Our first quarter results, our guidance for the second quarter and our early views into the second half of the year underpin a cautious optimism that NXP is successfully navigating through this industry-wide cyclical downturn.  
 And now before turning the call over to Bill, and while we are very focused on managing the soft landing through the cycle, I would like to take a minute to highlight a couple of important innovation announcements, which we made during the first quarter. This includes our S32 core right platform for next-generation software-defined vehicles. It represents the industry's first platform to combine high-performance Automotive processing, vehicle networking and system power management, along with integrated software to address the complexity, the scalability and the cost efficiency required for the software-defined vehicle. And as part of that announcement, we also introduced our 5-nanometer S32M processor, a milestone in the expansion of our S32 processing summary.  
 Additionally, we introduced industry's first 28-nanometer RFCMOS single-chip Automotive radar, which enables next-generation Automotive ADAS systems. This new product further expands our market-leading franchise and it enables next-generation highly performing coherent radar systems in a very cost-effective manner. Lastly, NXP and Honeywell, who is a leader in building automation systems signed a memorandum of understanding. This collaboration aims to help make them operate more intelligently by integrating NXP's neural network enabled industrial grade applications processes into Honeywell's building management systems. That agreement is another great example of how NXP will participate and potentially lead in the revolution of AI processing at the edge in industrial applications.  
 And now I would like to pass the call over to you, Bill for a review of our financial performance. Bill? 
Bill Betz: Thank you, Kurt, and good morning to everyone on today's call. As Kurt has already covered the drivers of the revenue during Q1, and provided our revenue outlook for Q2. I will move to the highlights. Overall, the Q1 financial performance was good. Revenue was in line with the midpoint of our guidance range, with non-GAAP gross margin slightly above the midpoint of our guidance, while inventory in the distribution channel continues to remain below our long-term target.  
 Turning to Q1 results. Total revenue was $3.13 billion, flat year-on-year, in line with the midpoint of our guidance range. We generated $1.82 billion in non-GAAP gross profit and reported a non-GAAP gross margin of 58.2%, flat year-on-year, though 20 basis points above the midpoint of our guidance range. The incremental margin was due to an increase in the estimated useful lives of our internal front-end manufacturing equipment from 5 to 10 years. This was about 30 basis points favorable to the results, which was not in our guidance. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $736 million, or 23.5% of revenue, up $8 million year-on-year and down $55 million from Q4. This was $19 million below the midpoint of our guidance range, primarily due to a combination of reduced variable compensation and proactive expense controls.
 From a total operating profit perspective, non-GAAP operating profit was $1.08 billion, and non-GAAP operating margin was 34.5%, down 30 basis points year-on-year and 60 basis points above the midpoint of our guidance range. Non-GAAP interest expense was $64 million, with taxes for ongoing operations of $171 million or a 16.8% non-GAAP effective tax rate. Noncontrolling interest was $5 million and stock-based compensation, which is not included in our non-GAAP earnings, was $115 million.  
 Now I would like to turn to the changes in our cash and debt. Our total debt at the end of Q1 was $10.18 billion, down $997 million as we repaid the 4.875% bonds that was due on March 1, 2024. Our ending cash balance, including short-term deposits was $3.31 billion, down $963 million sequentially due to the cumulative effect of debt repayment, capital returns, CapEx investments and cash generation during Q1. The result -- the resulting net debt was $6.9 billion, and we exited the quarter with a trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA of $5.4 billion. Our ratio of net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of Q1 was 1.3x, and our 12-month adjusted EBITDA interest coverage ratio was 22.8x.  
 During Q1, we paid $261 million in cash dividends, and we repurchased $303 million of our shares. Subsequent to the end of Q1, and through Friday, April 26, we repurchased an additional $97 million of shares under an established 10b5-1 program.  
 Turning to working capital metrics. Days of inventory was 144 days, an increase of 12 days sequentially while distribution channel inventory was 1.6 months or about 7 weeks. As we have highlighted throughout the previous year, given the uncertain demand environment, we continue to make the intentional choice to limit inventory in the channel while keeping inventory on our balance sheet to enable greater flexibility to redirect product as needed. Days receivables were 26 days, up 2 days sequentially and days payable were 65 days, a decrease of 7 days versus the prior quarter. Taken together, our cash conversion cycle was 105 days, an increase of 21 days versus the prior quarter. Cash flow from operations was $851 million, and net CapEx was $224 million or approximately 7% of revenue, resulting in non-GAAP free cash flow of $627 million or about 20% of revenue.  
 Turning now to our expectations for the second quarter. As Kurt mentioned, we anticipate Q2 revenue to be $3.125 billion, plus or minus about $100 million. At the midpoint, this is down 5% year-on-year and flat sequentially. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be about 58.5%, plus or minus 50 basis points, which includes approximately 60 basis points associated with the change of our useful life estimates for our internal front-end manufacturing equipment. As Kurt noted in his prepared remarks, we will begin to stage slightly higher inventory in the channel to support our competitiveness for the anticipated second half growth. Therefore, our guidance assumes approximately 1.7 months of distribution channel inventory exiting Q2.  
 Operating expenses are expected to be about $765 million, plus or minus about $10 million. The sequential increase is primarily driven by our annual merit increases and the $15 million license fee paid to Impinj as part of our legal settlement. Taken together, we see non-GAAP operating margin to be 34% at the midpoint. We estimate non-GAAP financial expense to be $63 million, with a non-GAAP tax rate to be 16.8% of profit before tax. Noncontrolling interest and other will be about $5 million. For Q2, we suggest for modeling purposes, you use an average share count of 258.5 million shares. We expect stock-based compensation, which is not included in our non-GAAP guidance to be $115 million. For capital expenditures, we expect to be around 6%. Taken together at the midpoint, this implies a non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.20.  
 In closing, looking through the remainder of 2024, I'd like to highlight a few focus areas for NXP. First, from a performance standpoint, we will continue to navigate a soft landing through a challenging and cyclical demand environment with a cautious optimism for a second half improvement in our business. Second, we will continue to be disciplined to manage what is in our control and stay within our long-term financial model. Specifically, we expect our gross margin will continue to perform at or above the high end of the long-term model while maintaining internal fab utilization levels in the low 70s for the remainder of the year. 
 Third, there is no change to our capital allocation policy, where we have returned $2.4 billion over the last 12 months. Furthermore, we will continue to be active in the market repurchasing NXP shares. And lastly, we are excited to host an Investor Day on November 7 in Boston. The specific details will be available soon on the NXP Investor Relations homepage. We look forward to you joining us. 
 I'd like to now turn it back to the operator for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. 
Vivek Arya: For the first one, Kurt, I think you gave a very clear explanation of kind of the cautious optimism around Automotive in the second half of the year. My question is kind of a more medium- to longer-term question. In the past, you gave a 9% to 14% growth target for your Automotive business. And since then, a lot of things have changed, right, with the slowdown in EVs and inflation and all those other things. What is the right way to think about NXP's long-term Automotive growth prospect? What's -- is it a simple formula that connects production growth to your sales growth targets? 
Kurt Sievers: Yes. So first of all, let me augment what you said, the cautious optimism, which I expressed for the second half is not limited to Automotive. It is important to note that, that cautious optimism for second half growth over first half is actually across the company. It's very broad-based. It's across distribution and direct and it is across all of our segments. 
 Now coming back to your original question, longer-term Automotive growth. Yes, we had a guide of 9% to 14% from '21 to '24. Now we are in '24.  It's actually good to see that Automotive is probably the one segment which is going to hit the target this year of the 9% to 14% and we will, as Bill said at the end of his prepared remarks, we will host an Investor Day in November where we will come out with the new growth targets for the next 3 years for all of our segments, including Automotive. 
 Now -- so I will not be able to give you a number today for the next 3 years for Automotive, but directionally, Vivek, the -- I would say, the algorithm isn't that much different from the history because we see the content drivers very much in place. And you know that we are, as NXP very well benefiting both from ADAS as well as from the electrification trends and mainly on the mid- to longer-term basis from a trend to software-defined vehicles where our industry-leading franchise in processing is certainly going to win. So that continues, which means in the end, the SAAR as an underlying mechanism probably becomes less relevant. And I would also tell you that we think pricing will be certainly to start with sustainable from where we come from. You know that we have the NXP increased prices over the past 3 years. We said it will be neutral this year. And as I said earlier, for the coming years, maybe we go back to a very small, low single-digit ASP erosion per year. 
 I mean, that is to be discussed in the coming years. But nothing out of the normal, I would say, and especially not pricing coming back to where it was pre-COVID. I mean that's really important for that algorithm. So please bear with us, Vivek, for the November Investor Day and we come with exact numbers. But I just wanted to signal to you, you should not expect massive changes here. 
Vivek Arya: Got it. And then, Kurt, kind of a more near-term or sort of just calendar '24 question on your Automotive business. So last year, your Auto sales grew about 9%, about in line with Auto production, right? So despite better pricing, i.e., you somewhat undershipped. What is the assumption for the entirety of calendar '24 because your Auto sales seem to be declining sequentially in Q2. So is the assumption that they pick back up and they do better than production in the back up? Just what is kind of the puts and takes for how you're thinking about Automotive for the entire year? 
Kurt Sievers: Yes. Look, indeed, you had it quite right for last year. The 9% growth of Automotive revenues was actually in a very strong SAAR year. I think the SAAR last year was something in the order of almost 10% growth year-on-year, so spectacularly high. And indeed, NXP did increase price from a corporate total company perspective by 8%. So yes, we totally undershipped already last year, which is -- which was part of the soft lending strategy, which we are pursuing. So we think we have already started to correct the Automotive revenue and the inventory situation in the direct customers since mid of last year and in the distribution channel already way back because we number went above 1.6. Now when you think about this year, Vivek, it is indeed -- the macro is a little different. The latest S&P numbers would suggest a 0% SAAR for this year and a bit of a moderation in the EV penetration. 
 I say that very carefully, Vivek because I think the headlines we all see about EV slowdown are more dramatic than what it really is. S&P is still talking about 20-plus percent unit growth of xEV, so hybrids and full EVs for this year, which is still a very strong growth. What really drives our revenue number, however, this year is the inventory digestion with the direct customers. Clearly, in Q1, and now with the guide, which we just gave for the second quarter, we are digesting inventory with our direct Automotive Tier 1 customers. If this is exactly done by the end of Q2 or if it takes a little bit into Q3, very hard to say. However, we have any indication that the second half in Automotive this year is going to grow solidly above the first half of this year. And that is actually driven both by company-specific enablers. So we have RADAR platforms, which are strongly ramping in the second half. 
 But of course, it is also driven then by the normalization of that inventory digestion which means we would move in the second half from under shipping end demand to meeting end demand again. I will not give you the full year growth number, Vivek. We don't guide the full year by segment. Actually, we only guide the next quarter. But when I said the whole company is modestly up or down for the full year and Automotive is more than 50% of the company, then you can guess that Automotive is probably not that far from the same number. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. 
Ross Seymore: Kurt, I want to get into a little bit of the increased comfort that apparently you're feeling with the desire to start refilling the channel. I know you did a little bit of it in the first quarter, but the second quarter, it seems like your optimism has increased a little bit sequentially, even despite the Automotive side being guided down. And I know you went through each of the segments specifically. But if you step back at a higher level, what's giving you the confidence? What's improved to give you the confidence to fill the channel? 
Kurt Sievers: Yes. So first of all, Q1, honestly, the 1.6, and you are right, we came from 1.5 in Q4. It's just been hovering around 1.5 and 1.6. It's very hard to keep this strictly to one number. So I'd say Q1 wasn't really intentional. It's just -- if you look back over the past, I don't know, 12 quarters, we've always been jumping up and down between 1.5 and 1.6. Quarter 2, yes. This is intentional. So we want to try to get it to 1.7 for the exit of quarter 2. And indeed, it is based on growing still cautious optimism for the second half. Now what is giving us that optimism.
 It is really a mix between cyclical considerations and very company-specific considerations. I think in the question of Vivek, a minute ago, I mentioned in Automotive, we have company-specific platforms, which are ramping in the second half where we sit almost every day with our customers and discuss the organization of that ramp. So we just know that's going to happen. Secondly, and Bill mentioned that in his prepared remarks, we have the settlement with Impinj for the RFID tagging business and the fact that the 2 market-leading franchises or companies in that market space, NXP and Impinj have settled here was a positive catalyst, I would say, to the market development for RFID tagging. 
 So we see a positive development there, which is then also playing into the second half over first half in our Communication Infrastructure & Other businesses. And then thirdly, and that's more on the cyclical side, we clearly see that the Automotive Tier 1 inventories will normalize. So then we just go back to shipping to run rates. So there's nothing spectacular happening. The demand is there already today but we are still digesting inventory. And in the second half, so we don't expect that there is more car production or more EVs or anything. It is simply that we ship to end demand. But the same holds even more true for Industrial & IoT, where we come from an extremely lean travel position, that Industrial & IoT business is largely exposed to China. You might also have seen that the PMI in China is actually developing quite nicely. 
 So we do see both in the core Industrial as well as in this Consumer IoT business, which is in that segment, we see sequential improvement, and that is the main reason actually that we are staging the channel because we absolutely want to be sure we have a competitive position on the shelves of our distribution partners entering into the third and fourth quarter. 
Ross Seymore: I guess since you mentioned the Impinj side, Bill, you're doing a great job on the OpEx. You came in below your guide in the first quarter. The second quarter, you included, you said a $15 million payment for that. Can you just give us an idea of, one, is that Impinj payments a onetime deal, and so it goes away after this quarter? And then more importantly, what are your thoughts on the OpEx side of things? If the optimism on the revenue side is increasing, should we expect the OpEx to increase with variable comp or any of those sorts of drivers? 
Bill Betz: Sure. Let me break those 2 apart. So the agreement that we have with Impinj is the annual cross license, which will impact us on a go-forward basis, about $15 million in the second quarter and it rose slightly, but that could stop any time in the future once we have the work around complete. And again, I don't know exactly the exact timing, but that's something that we're pursuing internally. Related to our OpEx, clearly, you can see we're somewhat out of model in Q2, but that's really driven by our annual merit increases. So we have a combination of both those impacts occurring in Q2, the $15 million plus the annual merit increases. But what's offsetting some of that impact is also our proactiveness on our expense controls and you saw that in Q1 as well and some lower variable compensation. 
 So as we think about the second half, and I think this is where you're going, is where are we headed with OpEx. And what we're going to try to do is make sure we get back into that model, as you know, around that 23% as we think about the second half. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. 
Christopher Muse: I guess first question on gross margins. If I take into account the change in the depreciation on equipment, you're essentially pro forma guiding gross margins flat. And I guess -- I would have thought maybe you would have had a little bit of a [ kit ] from the channel refill as you take it one more month. And so I guess if you can kind of comment what might be an offset there. 
 And then considering your vision for utilization rates to stay kind of where they are through the remainder of the year, how should we be thinking about the trajectory for gross margins into the second half? 
Bill Betz: Yes. You're right. So obviously, if you adjust for the accounting, basically, we're kind of flattish guiding to flat and again, it's within our plus or minus 50 basis points, I'm not really that good for $3 million or 10 basis points. But again, there's all sorts of puts and takes in that, and part of the reason for the useful life, I would say, accounting change. As you know, every year, we have to go look at this from accounting and related to this specific topic, there was a number of factors considered, which includes the NXP product life cycle, age of tools and the market analysis. And this is something that we just how to go do, and we did it. 
 We think it's the right thing to do, and we're calling it out, so it's very clear. And to be honest with you, we expect now to run at or above our long-term model, versus our previous commentary where we said near or at the gross margin. And what levers we have, some of the tailwinds, as we mentioned before in our previous calls, C.J. is clearly, our utilizations are running below the 70%. So that eventually will go back up and becomes a tailwind. We talked about higher revenues fall through over that 30% fixed cost. Again, that should help. We discussed about replenishing the distribution channel, that's where you were applying with your question, just that one, you should get something. 
 But you're right, over time, when we bring that back up to target, that should be a lever for us. to carry the higher margin. We're also -- we talked about expanding customer reach within the mass market. That just takes time. And now internally, the team is focused on productivity improvements, cost reductions, and over the longer time horizon, we explained this many, many times, it's really our new product introductions layering on top of our business. So continue to move that. So we have an Analyst Day or Investor Day coming up on November 7. We'll break that out in more details and update that model. But hopefully, you guys can see that even through the downturn, we're managing margins quite well and 58% or 58.5% with the accounting adjustment, that's not our end destination. 
Christopher Muse: Excellent. And then a question for Kurt. As you look back to the COVID period and kind of the initiation of NCNR programs, it sounds like that has really been at the most senior levels with you and focused on volume, not price. I'm curious, just as you look forward, how did that kind of help nurture your customer relationships? And what potential benefits might you see ahead as we progress into a world where NCNRs are no longer part of the business? 
Kurt Sievers: Yes. A couple of considerations here, C.J. The one is just to remind everybody our NCNR programs have ended with the calendar year '23. So since January 1, there is nothing anymore under any NCNR program. However, I would very strongly say, and I pointed out because I know that some industry peers had very different opinion on this. The way how we had our program was actually good. I would do it again. It did help because, in our particular case, it did put us closer together and we learned much earlier about over inventory build because there was an agreement underneath, which forced the customer to the table to tell us that things would be running too high if we don't jointly try to correct and that is the reason why we undershipped already all of last year in Automotive. And I think I started to speak about this in the Q1 earnings call already last year that there was first signs of building inventory with Tier 1 Automotive customers. 
 Again, that would not -- we wouldn't have seen that. We wouldn't have learned about it without NCNR. Now from a more strategic perspective, C.J., I think this is all about how does this industry learn from the supply crisis to not run into the trap again to try and apply just-in-time concepts with semiconductor products, which have a 3 to 4 months manufacturing cycle time. And I would say I have mixed emotions about this, C.J. On the one hand, I'd say the Automotive OEM customers and some of the Industrial OEM customers are very thoughtful, and we have entered into long-term agreements into programs where we know how to deal with inventory in order -- in a very specific way about those products, which are most critical. So I'd say there is good learning in place, and that's clearly a step forward beyond NCNRs. 
 With some of our direct customers, however, we clearly see that now under the pressure of working capital requirements, they tend to become very tactical when it comes to reducing inventories again. From my perspective, too far down. So I would go that far that we see inventory targets of some of our direct customers, not all but some, which I believe are starting to pose a risk when I think about the next uptick. And what I mean with the risk is that we get again into supply trouble because the short reaction time, which would be required then to ship again much more suddenly it's going to be very hard and that is compounded by the fact that, that supply chain is a very deep one. So it's not just one partner which we ship to and then it goes to the car company, but it's typically 2 or 3 or 4 stages, and they all reduce inventory. 
 And at some point, they all will want to increase inventory again. And that is what drives the cycle. So I'd say on the OEM side, good learnings in the post NCNR time, C.J. with the direct customers, it is a more mixed picture, unfortunately. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Danely with Citi. 
Christopher Danely: Kurt, just, I guess, a longer-term question on the Automotive end market. What are your thoughts on the relative growth rates of hybrids versus EVs? And then also, it seems like BYD has been a little bit better than Tesla this year. Do you expect those 2 trends to continue? And then what are the impacts, if any, to NXP? Or does it not matter? 
Kurt Sievers: These are interesting questions, Chris, which we also think about very hard. Let me try and dissect it. The one is -- and I think I said this in my prepared remarks earlier, the xEV, so if you combine hybrids and battery electric vehicles, continues to grow pretty well. And -- but that is carried by China. And the reason why many media headlines suggest it is not going well is that Europe and the U.S. are actually quite small in xEVs. To be more specific, if you take the total xEVs worldwide, only 12% of those are in the U.S. and 24% are in Europe while China holds 44% and BYD indeed is a big part of that. And that China 44%, Chris, is growing this year according to S&P by 27% in volume. 
 So what I tried to say was that is the xEV in total, certainly keeps growing nicely. Now if you go into the split between BEV and hybrid, so fully electric and hybrid electric, then I'd say it isn't that difficult. The battery electric vehicles are still only 15%, but they grow by 25%. Hybrids are 24% but grow with 17%. So the one has a smaller base and grows faster. The other one has a bigger base and growth a bit slower. I think on the long run, Chris, and that's more from a technical perspective, BEVs will win the race. I think this hybrid thing is an intermediate period. I do believe on the long run, it will all tilt to BEVs. Once battery and electronics technology gives a tough range. 
 I mean, then the whole concept of a hybrid is actually not meaningful anymore. Now for NXP, it doesn't matter that much as it does to some of our peers because only very little of our product portfolio has a strict exposure to BEV only. It is actually only the high-voltage battery management solutions. Everything else also plays in hybrid. So that's very different to people who have silicon carbide, for example, which only goes into one and not in the other. So therefore, Chris, I don't know exactly how that plays also over the short term. But it's also not relevant very much to our revenue. On the long term, I'm sure it is going to tail back all to be EVs again. Tesla against BYD, I don't want to call it, Chris. I would just say that Chinese and there is much more than BYD are extremely competitive and aggressive. I'm very glad that we have a great exposure to them because I do believe that a large part of the global electric growth will continue to come from China. Now how Tesla plays with that or in that, I don't know. But certainly, China is going to be the majority in the end, and that's -- again, that's BYD plus. 
Christopher Danely: Great. And then just a quick follow-up for Bill. Bill, you said your utilization rates are going to remain kind of flattish in the second half of the year. What would be the catalyst to take them higher? Would it be some sort of inventory days level or even better demand outlook or some combo of both? Can you share what would be a catalyst for higher utilization rates? 
Bill Betz: You're correct. It's the combo of both. As you can imagine, right now, we're at the high end of our model when we look what's in the channel, what do we have on hand. So -- and then we're trying to balance that, stage it appropriately for that second half growth. So it's balancing at quarter-for-quarter, but we want to make sure we continue to do the right thing here and keep inventory in check. And some of that inventory of the 144 days is coming from the fact related to the revenue drop-off from Q4 and so revenue cost is probably impacting that drop by about 14 days. And then we actually decreased their inventory dollars in the quarter by about 2 days or $32 million. 
 So we're trying to balance all of this, all the moving pieces. And I expect that we're going to focus on getting inventory maybe a little bit tighter in the second half, but if growth is higher than our current expectations, clearly, we'll be able to run our factories that increase the utilization there. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo Securities. 
Gary Mobley: Kurt, you seem to be implying that the second half revenue is about 12% higher than the first half or in dollar terms, about $750 million higher. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I would imagine the majority of that delta is inventory restock direct in through distribution. But maybe you can give us a sense of the magnitude of the impact from improving end demand or seasonality there? 
Kurt Sievers: Yes. First of all, no, that's not what I said. What I said is that the second quarter is guided at $3.125 billion, so you can calculate the first half revenue. And then I said that the full year is somewhere between modestly down to modestly up. And very importantly, I want to stress that, that growth in the second half over the first half is not just coming from the channel. 
 We clearly see -- and we have the data points from order patterns, et cetera, that also the direct business is going to grow in the second half over the first half. And I gave 2 examples, I think with Ross earlier. One is Automotive platforms, which are ramping, that is totally independent of the cycle and there is no product on the inventory because it's a new product, which just comes in at the customer. 
 And it is RFID tagging, which is also with direct customers in parts there -- it has nothing to do with the cycle, but it is the, say, the relief of the industry after the settlement between NXP and Impinj for that market. Very importantly, I also want to say that it is highly unlikely, Gary, that in order to do this, we would go to 2.5 months of channel inventory. So what I said is in quarter 2, we take it to 1.7. So that's one digit up. We are at 1.6, and we want to exit Q2 at 1.7. And if then the demand continues to go the way we preview this, will slightly increase further in Q3 and Q4. I must admit I cannot see a scenario that we would get to 2.4 or 2.5 with that. So the modestly up or down for the full year, does not depend on taking the channels to 2.5 months. So I'm sorry if that was not clear earlier, so I'm glad you did ask, Gary, but that's really not the background to it. 
Gary Mobley: Okay. Just a quick follow-up for Bill. You did a good job of highlighting the increased depreciation schedule for 5 years to 10 years on internal front-end equipment. What does that do for the long-term capital intensity for the overall company? 
Bill Betz: No change. Our current view is our CapEx is to spend 6% to 8%. Again, this is really accounting change that we just dealt with it and moved on. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. 
Stacy Rasgon: For the first one, I also wanted to sort of revisit the second half ramp. So it does seem clear if the full year is flat, plus or minus, you're up decent double digits half over half. Does that start in Q3? Like is Q3 above seasonal to get us there? Like how would you -- I guess, sitting where we are right now, how would you sort of characterize likely Q3 seasonality versus what you've seen historically? 
Kurt Sievers: Stacy, we really can't go there. I mean I'm already leaning out of the window here with giving kind of a directional full year guidance, which we thought is useful given the dramatic cycle we are all going through. But now calling it into Q3 and Q4 separately, I'm sorry, we don't provide that. So it is for the full year. And honestly, it's also hard to say, Stacy, because you know that inventory digestion is not an actual sheet. I mean this is a number of customers. Each of them has their own dynamic, has moving targets. So things could be settled earlier could be set a little later and calling that exact by the quarter end is virtually impossible. 
Stacy Rasgon: Okay. So I mean -- so maybe to take that point and maybe step out a little more. So on Autos, last year, you've already sort of indicated that you undershipped last year, you had strong pricing and you didn't -- you actually underperformed the market last year. So if you actually started under shipping last year, why are you still in an inventory correction now? Like so this is like 6 quarters. 
Kurt Sievers: Because we wanted to spread this out, Stacy, that was the whole idea. I think last quarter, we discussed about our understanding of that so-called soft landing strategy for NXP. Our whole target was to actually have not a sharp peak to trough in Automotive because there would be a bad impact on our factories and Bill would come back with heavy underloading and negative margin impact. So the idea was to spread this over a longer period of time, which is why we started early but didn't want to overdo it in any given quarter. So say we started in Q3 last year for the direct side of Automotive. And obviously, it goes at least until the end of the second quarter of this year. So that would be a full year of correction on the direct side, maybe a little bit spreading into the third quarter. 
 Mind you that at the same time, our distribution Automotive business, which is 40% of the total Automotive revenue has always been at [ 1.6 ] only. So on that side of the house, we haven't had to correct at all. So that's the way how you should think about it, which explains also some of the confusion I'm reading in a lot of reports about the peak to trough behavior of NXP versus others. In Pumps Infra, in Industrial and Mobile, we have a 30% peak to trough more or less. It's just that our trough was already a year ago because of our channel discipline. But it's the same peak to trough as everybody else. It's just in Automotive, it's probably more in the 9% to 10% and because I believe we troughed in Automotive this quarter 2 right now. 
 But again, that is intentional, as I just explained. 
Stacy Rasgon: Got it. So is it demand getting worse now? Or is it just your inventory behavior taking a harder line on inventories because it does feel like the general trajectory is getting worse over the last quarter and Q4, Q1, Q2. 
Kurt Sievers: No, it's really the inventory. We don't see -- I mean, you have to take the offset from the SAAR, Stacy. I said earlier that last year, of course, there was a SAAR growth of 10%, this year, it is flat. That is a -- if you compare like-for-like, then that makes this year, of course, a less positive environment from a macro perspective. But everything else, which is the company specific positions we have, which is the content increase, which is offered by the industry per se, and the pricing, which is also flat for us this year is totally in place. So no, it's just inventory. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Buchalter with TD Cowen. 
Joshua Buchalter: Congrats on results. For my first one, I think there's a perception out there that there's a line draw to draw between software-defined vehicles and EVs and then it's much more difficult to do in SPV architecture on an ICE engine. Maybe you could spend a minute or 2 talking about what you're seeing from your customers? I mean, is there a big correlation between that digital architecture change versus electric vehicles because they're rearchitecting and what are you seeing on ICE engines for a software-defined vehicle? 
Kurt Sievers: Yes. I would say no. Fundamentally, the concept of a software-defined vehicle, which is actually moving a lot of performance parameters from hardware to software and creating much more flexibility is completely independent of what kind of powertrain it has. Now the matter of the fact is, however, that all OEMs, I know, are extremely busy with developing electric powertrain-based new vehicles. And for most of them, it is actually the core of their activity going forward. 
 And that is, of course, the reason why when they think then about STB implementations, it falls together with electric drivetrains, but that is not because there would be a technical reason. I actually know that several STB implementations where we are a leading partner for OEMs, this comprehend both ICE and electric drivetrains. 
 So it is the same STB content which splits then on a much lower level into an implementation for a combustion engine car or in an implementation for a battery electric vehicle car. But fundamentally, there is no difference. 
Joshua Buchalter: Appreciate the color there. And maybe for Bill. As you just paid down the $1 million note in March, I think you don't have anything to do for over a year now and only $500 million next year. In the passing of NXP has been more aggressive utilizing the balance sheet. And I think your past target was 2x levered. Can you maybe talk about how you're thinking about utilizing the balance sheet and the capital returns here? 
Bill Betz: Yes, sure. So again, Josh, no change to our capital allocation strategy. If I just look back over the last 3 years, we returned $8.4 billion or 107% of our free cash flow last trailing 12 months, it's below 100% because we retire that debt that you just mentioned. And so that's about 82%. And in the past quarter, we did 90%. So I think we did take the opportunity to deleverage the company. We looked at our gross leverage metric, and it was at 2.1x, now that 1.9. Clearly, with the credit rating agencies and [ sweet stocks ] below 1.5. If we look at -- we're going to continue actively buying back our shares. We think it's a great use of our cash. We have approximately $1.1 billion left on a board authorization plan of buybacks this year.
 We continue to pay a healthy level of dividend. So if you look at that as a percentage of cash flow from operations over the last 12 months is about 28%. And as we talked about in the past that we treated someone as fixed, we'll continue to execute and invest in the business. That's the #1 priority, right? We're going to stay within our financial model, invest in the business, continue a lot of small tuck-ins of our M&A that we've been actively involved in. So overall, I think we're committed to continue returning excess free cash flow back to you all. 
Jeff Palmer: Towanda, we'll take one more question here today. 
Operator: Our final question comes from the line of Chris Caso with Wolfe Research. 
Christopher Caso: I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about the China for China manufacturing strategy that you've spoken to in the past. I mean I guess in one point, how that protects the business in China? And then secondly, what margin implication that may have if you change that manufacturing strategy going forward? 
Kurt Sievers: Yes. Chris, that's indeed a very -- that's a very important point. There is a clear ongoing and I'd say, increasing requirements from our Chinese customers in Automotive and beyond to go for localized manufacturing. We are pursuing this quite forcefully. We have chosen the Nanjing factory of TSMC, which happens to host the 16 FinFET, 16-nanometer technology, which is the core of our microprocessors for Automotive. We are working with SMIC, which we have done historically outside of Automotive and continue to do so outside of Automotive. And we just ended up choosing a third foundry partner, which I'm not going to name here, but a third foundry partner for the analog mixed signal space in order to produce our products in China for China. 
 That is helpful in 2 ways, Chris. The one is indeed that we can follow that requirement of local manufacturing. And I believe NXP is in a comparably good position here because several of our peers have their own factories. And for them, that move to China is really not easy. Secondly, cost. You just mentioned it, there is certainly a competitive market in China. And if we want to successfully play against local Chinese competitors, which certainly over time will continue to try and come up, it is good when we can use the same cost base, which they use, which is local foundries in China. So in an ideal case, Chris, and again, let's see how it plays out. You will not see any impact on the margin from doing this. but it keeps us competitive. I mean the whole point is that we can play against them successfully because we can leverage the same cost competitiveness, which they have in the local manufacturing environment. I look at Jeff here. Do you have a follow-up? 
Christopher Caso: Yes, I do. And if I could follow up also with China from a competitive standpoint regarding what they could actually produce. And you've addressed it from a manufacturing standpoint and putting you on an equal cost base with them. What do you think about the capabilities of some of these local players? Obviously, there's an imperative in time to try to bring as much content locally as possible. Do you see the competitive threat rising in terms of the capabilities of some of the local players that could be a factor going forward? 
Kurt Sievers: Look, Chris, in principle, and that's an overriding statement, we are always paranoid about competition because I've learned in my career in this industry, you better be paranoid at all times because it keeps you hot to run successfully against competition. actually, in that particular case, we see 2 areas where China is very, very busy from a local competition perspective. One is power discretes, especially for Automotive and that ranges all the way from IGBTs MOSFETs to silicon carbide. We just observed that for us, it doesn't matter since you know that this is not part of our portfolio. But that's something where it appears they actually make quite good progress.
 Secondly, lower end microcontrollers. There is a number of companies and they together have a couple of hundred million of dollar business already. That's outside of Automotive. We think with the fast move and requirements for higher processing performance and a lot more software in Automotive. This is a long way for them. Again, we are paranoid, but I think it's just another set of competitors, which we are facing like in other places in the world. So we are not fearful of this anytime soon. In the analog space, I could imagine, again, we haven't really seen much, but I could also imagine that they get into the lower end catalog analog at some point. I mean if I was China, I would try and do this. 
 So overall, clearly a trend, so I completely agree with you that this is something which they want to do. We don't see it really moving in our space at this time. And certainly, with the localization of our manufacturing, we kind of want to counter that, at least from a competitive cost base and from a compliance perspective. 
 Good. With that, we are a little bit over time. I want to conclude the call with summarizing and just making the remark again. 
 This is a tough cycle. We have, over many quarters, operated a soft landing strategy in order to keep the P&L earnings and profitability in reasonable shape. With some cautious optimism, we are seeing now that the second half is turning around. It's hard to say what the slope of that is going to be. But given our low inventory position going into this, we are cautiously optimistic that we can land the year in this plus/minus 0 kind of fashion which we discussed during the call. In the meantime, we keep every possible control on anything we can do about gross margin and OpEx as well as CapEx. 
 With that, I would like to conclude the call and thank all of you. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-02-06 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the NXP 4Q '23 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Jeff Palmer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.
Jeff Palmer: Thank you, Michelle, and good morning everyone. Welcome to the NXP Semiconductors Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. With me on the call today is Kurt Sievers, NXP's President and CEO, and Bill Betz, our CFO. The call today is being recorded and will be available for replay from our corporate website. Today's call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause NXP's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the macro impact on the specific end-markets in which we operate, the sale of new and existing products, and our expectations for financial results for the first quarter of 2024. Please be reminded that NXP undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements. For a full disclosure on forward-looking statements, please refer to our press release. Additionally, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are driven primarily by discrete events that management does not consider to be directly related to NXP's underlying core operating performance. Pursuant to Regulation G, NXP has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our fourth quarter 2023 earnings press release, which will be furnished to the SEC on Form 8-K and available on NXP's website in the Investor Relations section. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Kurt.
Kurt Sievers: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. We really appreciate you joining our call this morning. I will review both our quarter four and our full year 2023 performance, and then discuss our guidance for quarter one. Beginning with quarter four, our revenue was $22 million better than the midpoint of our guidance with the trends in the Mobile market performing better than our expectations, with Automotive and, Industrial and IoT performance in-line with our guidance, and Communication Infrastructure slightly below our expectations. Taken together, NXP delivered quarter four revenue of $3.42 billion, an increase of 3% year-on-year. Non-GAAP operating margin in quarter four was 35.6%. 90 basis points below the year-ago period and about 20 basis points above the midpoint of our guidance. The year-on-year performance was a result of solid gross profit growth, offset by higher operating expenses as we continue to invest in new product development. From a channel perspective, we maintained distribution inventory at a tight 1.5-months level, well below our long-term target of 2.5 months. In addition, we continue to partner with our direct customers on the normalization of their on-hand inventory. For the full year, revenue was $13.28 billion, an increase of about 1% year-on-year. Passing the revenue growth, we increased our pricing by approximately 8% in 2023, offsetting our higher input cost to maintain our gross profit percentage. And at the same time, our unit volumes were down by approximately 7% through 2023. We believe this underpins our view that we have intentionally under-shipped fundamental end demand in order to limit inventory build in the channel and at our direct customers. Full year non-GAAP operating margin was 35.1%, a 120 basis-point compression versus the year-ago period as a result of the improved gross profit performance, offset by increased operating expenses primarily in products and system innovation investments. Now, let me turn to the specific full-year 2023 trends in our focused end markets. In Automotive, full-year revenue was $7.48 billion, up 9% year-on-year, which is a reflection of higher pricing, strong company-specific growth drivers, offset by lower shipment volumes. For quarter four, Automotive revenue was $1.89 billion, up 5% versus the year-ago period and in line with our guidance. Turning to Industrial and IoT. Full year revenue was $2.35 billion, down 13% year-on-year, a reflection of our tight channel management in a cyclically weak end market offsetting price increases. We saw the trough for the Industrial and IoT business back in quarter one 2023. For quarter four, Industrial and IoT Revenue was $662 million, up 9% versus the year-ago period and in line with our guidance. In Mobile, full-year revenue was $1.33 billion, down 17% year-on-year because of weak trends and inventory digestion in the handset marketplace. For quarter four, Mobile revenue was $406 million, flat versus the year-ago period and better than our guidance. Finally, in Communication Infrastructure and Other, full-year revenue was $2.11 billion, up 5% year-on-year. The year-on-year growth was due to a combination of increased sales of secured card and tracking solutions, higher pricing, and last-time buys of select legacy network processor solutions. And that was offset by declines of RF Power products for the cellular base station markets. For quarter four, revenue was $455 million, down 8% year-on-year and below our guidance. Now, like every year, I would like to provide the annual progress update on our six accelerated growth drivers, which we highlighted during our Analyst Day in November 2021. Starting with Automotive, the accelerated growth drivers are radar, electrification and our S32 processor family for the software-defined vehicle. Looking at our performance in 2023, both the S32 processor family and our electrification solutions are tracking ahead of plan. Revenue from radar is tracking below plan as we took strong actions to limit shipments to customers who are [digesting] (ph) inventory. Taken together, the Automotive's accelerated growth drivers in aggregate are tracking above plan. The underlying core Auto business grew in line with our longer-term expectations. Within Industrial and IoT, we are trading below our expected growth range. We believe the underperformance is a reflection of significant cyclical end-market weakness and of our disciplined approach to managing the distribution channel. So remember, we served approximately 80% of the Industrial and IoT end-markets through our distribution channel to efficiently address the needs of tens of thousands of small customers, the majority of whom are in the Asia-Pacific and the Greater China region. Within Mobile, we are below our expected revenue growth range for the ultra-wideband accelerated growth driver due to the well-documented weakness in the Android handset market. However, ultra-wideband traction in the Automotive market, which is the first well-defined use-case for ultra-wideband is progressing very well. 18 out of 20 Automotive platforms have been awarded to NXP and another 15 platforms are evaluating NXP solutions as we speak. And at this point in time, the ultra-wideband revenue stream is being driven by about seven automotive platforms and the few premier handset OEMs. Finally, for RF power amplifiers within Communications Infrastructure, we are below our expected revenue growth range. The challenge we faced was a combination of weaker base station deployments globally in 2023 and the faster-than-expected OEM transition to gallium nitride from LDMOS technology. However, the underlying core portion of Communications Infrastructure performed very well in 2023 as a result of serving pent-up demand for various secure cards and tracking solutions including RFID for intelligent labels. Taken together, we are ahead of plan for the Communications Infrastructure segment. Now, let me turn to our expectations for quarter one 2024. We are guiding quarter one revenue to $3.125 billion, about flat versus the first quarter of 2023. From a sequential perspective, this represents a deceleration of about 9% at the midpoint, versus the prior quarter, which is consistent with our original outlook for quarter one to be down in the mids to high single-digit range. Our tempered outlook for quarter one reflects typical seasonality compounded by our continued desire to enable the normalization of on-hand inventories at our direct customers. And we will continue to hold channel inventory in a tight range. Regarding pricing, we see improving input costs trend versus previous years, which allow us to assume flat pricing for 2024. So at the midpoint, we anticipate the following trends in our business during quarter one. Automotive is expected to be down in the low-single-digit percent range versus quarter one, 2023, and down in the mid-single-digit percent range versus quarter four 2023. Industrial and IoT is expected to be up in the mid-teens percent range year-on-year and down in the low-double-digit percent range versus quarter four 2023. Mobile is expected to be up in the low 30% range year-on-year and down in the mid-teens percent range versus quarter four 2023. Finally, Communications Infrastructure and Other is expected to be down in the mid-20% range year-on-year and down in the low double-digit percent range versus quarter four 2023. In review, during 2023, thanks to our company's specific end-market exposure, we experienced the variations of the semiconductor cycle at distinctly different points of time for the various parts of our portfolio. On the one hand, full-year revenue performance in our more consumer-oriented segments of Industrial and IoT, and Mobile was underwhelming. However, following our tight channel management, these businesses troughed already back in quarter one 2023 after experiencing a traumatic post-COVID reset. Ever since, we have seen a gradual improvement, and we do think these growth trends should continue throughout 2024. On the other hand, within Automotive and core Industrial, we experienced solid trends in the early part of 2023. But have entered the multi-quarter inventory correction phase with our direct customers starting in the second quarter of 2023. This should continue through the first half of 2024. In the second half of 2024, we expect also in the Automotive and core Industrial segments to shift to end demand and resume growth. Regarding our Communications Infrastructure and Other business, we expect 2024 revenue to decline over 2023, consistent with our prior view we shared on the Q3 earnings call. So as we look ahead to 2024, we do think the macro has deteriorated from our view 90 days ago. We now expect the first half of 2024 will decline versus the first half of 2023 due to longer than anticipated inventory digestion at our direct automotive customers. However, we expect our company revenue in the second half of 2024 will grow over the first half of 2024, as we believe we will be shipping again to end demand by then. Overall, we have and will continue to manage everything in our control to navigate a soft landing for our business. As such, we have kept a very tight handle on our distribution channel and we are supporting our direct customers to facilitate inventory digestion as appropriate. This enables us to take advantage of the cyclical improvement as soon as it materializes per segment. And based on everything I've said, the potential outcome for 2024 should be in the range of a modest annual revenue growth or decline. So now, I would like to pass the call to you Bill for a review of our financial performance.
Bill Betz: Thank you, Kurt, and good morning to everyone on today's call. As Kurt has already covered the drivers of the revenue during Q4 and provided our revenue outlook for Q1, I will move to the financial highlights. Overall, our Q4 financial performance was good. Revenue was slightly above the midpoint of our guidance range. And non-GAAP gross profit was above the midpoint of our guidance range, driven by a higher mix from sales into distribution channel even as months of supply in the channel remained flat at 1.5 months for about six weeks. I will first provide full-year highlights and then move to the Q4 results. Full year revenue for 2023 was $13.28 billion or up 1% year-on-year. We generated $7.76 billion in non-GAAP gross profit and reported a non-GAAP gross margin of 58.5%, up 60 basis points year-on-year. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $3.09 billion or 23.3% of revenue, slightly above our long-term financial model as we continue to invest in our strategy, supporting long-term profitable growth. Total non-GAAP operating profit was $4.66 billion, down 3% year-on-year. This reflects a non-GAAP operating margin of 35.1%, down 120 basis points year-on-year and in line with our current long-term financial model. Non-GAAP interest expense was $283 million. Taxes related to ongoing operations were $693 million or a 15.8% non-GAAP effective tax rate. Non-controlling interests were $25 million and stock-based compensation, which is not included in our non-GAAP earnings, was $411 million. Turning to full-year cash-flow performance. We generated $3.51 billion in cash flow from operations and invested $826 million in net CapEx or 6% of revenue. Taken together, this resulted in $2.69 billion of non-GAAP free cash flow or 20% of revenue. During 2023, we repurchased 5.46 million shares for $1.05 billion and paid cash dividends of $1.01 billion or 29% of cash flow from operations. In total, we returned $2.06 billion to our owners, which was 77% of the total non-GAAP free cash flow generated during the year. Now, moving to the details of Q4. Total revenue was $3.42 billion, up 3% year-on-year, modestly above the midpoint of our guidance range. We generated $2.01 billion in non-GAAP gross profit and reported a non-GAAP gross margin of 58.7%, up 70 basis points year-on-year and 20 basis points above the midpoint of our guidance range, driven primarily by mix. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $791 million or 23.1% of revenue, up $78 million year-on-year, though down $12 million from Q3 and within our guidance range. From a total operating profit perspective, non-GAAP operating profit was $1.22 billion and non-GAAP operating margin was 35.6%, down 90 basis points year-on-year, above the midpoint of our guidance range. Non-GAAP interest expense was $69 million with taxes for ongoing operations were $178 million or a 15.5% non-GAAP effective tax rate. Non-controlling interest was $6 million and stock-based compensation, which is not included in our non-GAAP earnings, was $107 million. Now, I would like to turn to the changes in our cash and debt. Our total debt at the end of Q4 was $11.17 billion, essentially flat sequentially. Our ending cash balance including short-term deposits was $4.27 billion, up $229 million sequentially due to the cumulative effect of capital returns, CapEx investments, and cash generation during Q4. The resulting net debt was $6.9 billion and we exited the quarter with a trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA of $5.41 billion. Our ratio of net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of Q4 was 1.3 times and our 12-month adjusted EBITDA interest coverage ratio was 21.6 times. During Q4, we paid $261 million in cash dividends and we repurchased $434 million of our shares. Turning to working capital metrics. Days of inventory was 132 days, a decrease of two days sequentially, while we maintained distribution channel inventory at 1.5 months or about six weeks. As we have highlighted throughout the previous year, given the uncertain demand environment, we continue to make the intentional choice to limit inventory in the channel, while keeping inventory on our balance sheet to enable greater flexibility to redirect product as needed. Days receivable were 24 days, down one day sequentially and days payable were 72 days, an increase of 12 days versus the prior quarter due to increased external material sourcing. Taken together, our cash conversion cycle was 84 days and an improvement of 15 days versus the prior quarter. Cash flow from operations was $1.14 billion and net CapEx was $175 million, resulting in non-GAAP free cash flow of $962 million or 28% of revenue. Turning now to our expectations for the first quarter. As Kurt mentioned, we anticipate Q1 revenue to be $3.125 billion, plus or minus about $100 million. At the midpoint, this is flat year-on-year and down 19% sequentially. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be about 58% plus or minus 50 basis points, driven primarily related to lower distribution sales as we maintain our months of sales in the channel at 1.6 or below. Operating expenses are expected to be about $755 million, plus or minus about $10 million. Taken together, we see non-GAAP operating margin to be 33.9% at the midpoint. We estimate non-GAAP financial expense to be about $66 million. We anticipate the non-GAAP tax rate to be 16.9% of profit before tax. Non-controlling interest and other will be about $3 million. For Q1, we suggest for modeling purposes, you use an average share count of 259 million shares. We expect stock-based compensation, which is not included in our non-GAAP guidance to be $127 million higher-than-normal, driven by our restructuring activities taken in Q4 as we continue to refine the portfolio. For capital expenditures, we expect to be around 7%. Taken together, at the midpoint this implies a non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.17. For full-year 2024 modeling purposes, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be around the high end of our long-term model of plus or minus the normal 50 basis points. We expect operating expenses to stay within our long-term model and fluctuate by quarter driven by annualized merits occurring in the second quarter and variable compensation movements pending actual performance. We suggest for non-GAAP tax rate, use a range between 16.4% to 17.4%. For stock-based compensation, we suggest to use $480 million where Q1 is the peak for the year. For non-controlling interests, we suggest to use $25 million. For capital expenditures, we expect to stay within the long-term model of 6% to 8% of sales. In closing, looking ahead into 2024, I'd like to highlight a few focus areas for NXP. First, from a performance standpoint, we will continue to navigate a soft landing, through a challenging and cyclical demand environment. Therefore, we will continue to be disciplined to manage what is in our control and stay within our long-term financial model. Second, operationally, the Q1 guidance assumes internal factory utilization will continue to be in the low to mid-70s range, a level we expect to hold until internal inventory normalizes. Lastly, we will retire, the $1 billion 2024 debt tranche when it comes due on March 1st with cash on hand. Finally, there is no change to our capital allocation strategy, where we will continue to return all excess free cash flow back to our owners. In addition, since the beginning of Q1 2024, we repurchased $116 million worth of shares under our existing [10b-51] (ph) program. Overall, we will remain active repurchasing our shares. I'd like to now turn it back to the operator for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Ross Seymore: Hey guys, thanks for letting me ask a question. First on the inventory management in general, Kurt, it sounded a lot like you've done a great job on the channel side, but the OEM side has gotten a little bit into the excess category. Can you just talk about, I guess on the channel side, do you have any plans for that $500 million coming into the plan in 2024, if that's still the number? And on the OEM side, when do you think that normalizes throughout the year?
Kurt Sievers: Yeah. Hey, thanks, Ross. Good morning. Indeed, I think the color you put on this is what I would concur with. On the channel side, we feel safe and very much under control relative to the inventory. Let me put it that way, for quarter one, we have absolutely no intention to go beyond the 1.6 range. It will hover between 1.5 and 1.6. I think we had 1.5 the past two quarters. So consider for Q1 maybe a 1.6, but that's not an increase, it's more the precision we can hold that. So no intention to increase general inventory really in the first quarter. For the rest of the year, Ross, it isn't much different to how we've put this the past couple of quarters. We will only start to replenish when we see sufficient momentum in the market to justify that. So that means there is neither a guarantee that by the end of the year we hit the 2.5 inventory, which is our long-term target, nor will we do any fast or hectic steps here. So we will possibly start, because I do assume, when we come back to this later in the call, we do expect that there is some market recovery in the second half of the year, so that makes it more likely that we will start to replenish the channel by then. But again, it's really something which is a function of the market environment. The size of it is indeed the $500 million which we have discussed before, but again, that is not necessarily a part of our considerations for the annual revenue movement. Now, the inventory or the excess inventory at direct customers, indeed, I think we started to try and correct that one back in the second quarter of last year. I think that was the first time I also talked on the earnings call that we did see a few automotive Tier 1 customers where the majority of that is sitting with having excess inventory. And the fact that we knew by then already, Ross, is thanks to our NCNR system. We -- and we discussed about these NCNR orders, which by the way in our case are different to the constructs which some of our peers have been using. Ours were annual. Annual means tied to the calendar year. So to be very explicit, we currently have no more NCNR orders. So all of that was running out at the end of the calendar year 2023. But those NCNR orders, in hindsight, were very good because they let customers call us up and say, we see a problem, we see building inventory. And since that second quarter of last year, we've been busy to try and normalize this in a reasonable cadence, which is also good for our financials. And coming back to your question, yes, we think we will still be busy with that through the middle of this year, mainly, and I would say almost exclusively in automotive. So that is something which we only have in automotive. By the middle of this year, that should be behind us. And then we should move from under-shipping end demand with direct customers in automotive to shipping to end demand again in the second half.
Ross Seymore: Thanks for that color. And I guess as my second question, focusing on the auto side, it was helpful to hear about the six growth drivers overall. But in automotive, the radar below plan, EV above, and S32 above. Can you just talk about what your expectations are for those growth drivers in fiscal ‘24?
Kurt Sievers: Well, in principle, I would say if there was no excess inventory and we would be in a normal world, Ross, we stick to our 9% to 14% long-term growth, which includes then the set performance of those growth drivers, which we specified back in the Analyst Day in November ‘21. So they are just moving around a little, and that's why we transparently gave the color for this past year, pending on the speed of inventory control. And I think you might have noticed that I did say that radar was actually not performing to target. The reason here is really that radar has a relatively concentrated customer base. It's almost -- it's just direct customers where the inventory control was much easier to exercise because it's a very specified product range with a very non-fragmented customer base where it was easier to get a handle on the inventory control. So I dare to say inventory control in radar is already completely behind us, which will make ‘24 obviously a much better year. But on the longer term, on the three-year horizon, Ross, just assume they all come to the targets which we specified back in November ‘21.
Ross Seymore: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Vivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. Kurt, last quarter you were good enough to kind of give us a little bit of color one quarter ahead and I was hoping you could share your thoughts on how you see Q2 just generically shaping up, flat up down sequentially. And then when I take your commentary about the full year, I think you mentioned sort of flattish growth overall, that still suggests, kind of double-digit growth in the back half. So I realize visibility is limited and so forth, but any other market color that you can share that gives you the confidence about that sort of double digit growth in the backup would be very useful?
Kurt Sievers: So good morning, Vivek. Yeah, apparently I was a good man last time relative to the next [quarter] (ph). I think you just reiterated the pieces which we gave you, but I'm happy to give you a bit more color around those. So we really see the different parts of our revenue being dependent on the cycle they are exposed to. So all the consumer-oriented businesses, and that's the IoT part of Industrial and IoT and Mobile, we think we left the trough way behind us in the first quarter of last year, and other than some seasonal fluctuations, they will continue to grow throughout the calendar year 2024, which has to do that a large part of that is anyway supplied through the channel, so we are not suffering from excess inventory digestion. So we are pretty positive that that part of the company will grow. At the same time, I reiterate what I said last time, the Comms Infra & Other business will decline from a year-on-year perspective. So ‘24 revenue for Comms Infra & Other will be down versus the calendar year ‘23. I think we discussed at length the bits and pieces in there why that is. And then you come to the [blog] (ph) of Automotive and core Industrial where indeed there is something between first half and second half which has to do with the inventory digestion at the direct customers in automotive which I just discussed with the question of Ross a minute ago, where we do believe the turning point is somewhere around the middle of the year, where that over-inventory which is still sitting there is being digested. If you put all of these pieces together, Vivek, then obviously, half two is going to be bigger than half one. Obviously, half one of this year, of 2024, is going to be down against the half one of last year. And that puts it somewhere in this flat plus/minus range for the full year, indeed. So the confidence really comes from the view which we have on the inventory digestion on the Automotive and core Industrial side. At the end, at this very same time, the continued gradual improvement in the consumer-oriented businesses where given our tight channel management, we have no excess inventory. This is really where it comes from.
Vivek Arya: All right. Thank you, Kurt. And for my follow-up, your industrial trends are in -- Industrial & IoT trends are in big contrast to your peers. So I get what you did, right? You were early to spot it. You were undergrowing in the first half of last year and now you're doing much better now. But how long can you maintain such a contrast with your peers, right, who are seeing these kind of 20%, 30%, 40% declines in their Industrial & IoT business? Is it not apples-to-apples comparison? When do you think that there is somewhat of a convergence between what your peers are reporting in terms of their industrial correction versus the strength that NXP is seeing right now?
Kurt Sievers: Look, Vivek, I, of course, don't know and cannot judge what exactly they do. But conceptually, the contrast will be alive as long as they need to digest their over-inventory in the channel. That's very simple. We don't have that because we never build it. We actually back in the second quarter of 2022, mind you second quarter of 2022, that's almost two years ago, we started to control the channel and keep it at the 1.6 and 1.5 months level. We -- even with that, we troughed them in the first quarter of '23. So we even went down from this. And since then, we kept it very steady. In the meantime, some of our peers kept shipping hard and they just need to correct this. And that contract will disappear at the moment that over-shipment they have done there is actually behind them. I mean, maybe another number, Vivek, which puts this in perspective, and we gave you that transparency very intentionally. Last year, NXP as a company, did grow 1% in revenue. I also told you that our pricing last year was up by 8%. So that gives you a feel that we had a pretty significant volume decline last year from a supply perspective. So plus 1% revenue, plus 8% price gives you a 7% volume decline, which is clearly under-shipping, we think against end demand, but certainly against peers. I mean if you just take the same numbers from peers, then many of them who are now having a bit more of a hard time, they just shipped harder through the first -- at least the first three quarters of last year. So under the curve in the end, it's going to be the same thing. It's a matter of when did you ship and when do you need to reduce shipments. So that's my answer. I don't think other than that, there is a fundamental difference, Vivek. So I don't want to claim we have a much better industrial business. I think we just had a more disciplined handle on it earlier.
Vivek Arya: Thank you, Kurt.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Your line is open.
Kurt Sievers: Stacy, are you there?
Operator: Stacy, your line is open.
Kurt Sievers: Operator, why don't we go to the next caller, and we'll circle around with Stacy?
Stacy Rasgon: Hello?
Kurt Sievers: I can hear you, Stacy. Good morning.
Stacy Rasgon: Yeah, that was -- I don't know what was going on there. Thanks for taking my questions. I had a question on the IoT trend. So it obviously bottomed in Q1 last year. I was wondering if you could parse out the recovery trends between the Consumer piece and the core Industrial. So we all know Consumer is getting a little better. Has the increase off the trough from a year ago been all Consumer or has the general purpose IoT started to recover as well? Like what are those trends across those two pieces?
Kurt Sievers: Yeah. Thanks, Stacy. That's a fair question because, indeed, the two are trending differently. I'd say the IoT piece, which, by the way, is about 40% of that segment, has indeed gradually improved since the trough in the quarter one of last calendar year. Gradual means it's getting better and better and better, but it's still below the levels it had before the peak. So it's way not there where it used to be while it is gradually improving. In our case, and I think we revealed that before, a very good portion of that is in China. So think about it as a largely distribution and largely China-oriented IoT business. But yes, so the trend starting from the bottom of Q1 last year, gradually improving and that's what we continue -- what we see to continue through the rest of this calendar year. The core Industrial part indeed has taken a somewhat different shape. Think about it more like Automotive, which is now suffering a bit more from over-inventory, not much, and end market weakness. So I would say core Industrial relatively speaking, is a somewhat less good shape still, which has just face shifted to the IoT portion. So think about core Industrial a bit more similar to what we see in Automotive.
Stacy Rasgon: Got it. Thank you. My follow-up, I wanted to ask about lead times. Have they normalized to pre-COVID levels? And is that part of what's enabling you to keep pricing flat? Do you have just like better control of pricing because you have a better controlled lead times? You've got a lot of competitors that are talking about pricing starting to come down now.
Kurt Sievers: So first part of the question, Stacy, absolute yes, lead times are just normal. I mean, forget about supply constraints, we have normal lead times back to the pre-COVID times, which helps a lot also relative to visibility because all of the double ordering and all of the need for NCNRs and all of these things, just consider them behind us more back to normal from that perspective. There is no real correlation of that to pricing, Stacy. The pricing, which I quoted to be about flat for this year, from our end is mainly a function of the input cost. We've been living in that world of sharply rising input costs over the past three years. And now it looks more normal. So any view and handle which we have on the input cost for this year is around zero, I would say. And that's also why we put that forward as the pricing for '24 and we found acceptance and buy-in for that with our customers, Stacy, that's not -- it's not really correlated with lead times. I understand your question if we had more of a commodity portfolio. Since we don't have that, that correlation doesn't really exist.
Stacy Rasgon: Got it. That’s helpful. Thank you guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.
Gary Mobley: Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. Kurt, you called out some better-than-expected revenue on the Mobile side, and you appear to be poised for some pretty significant year-over-year growth in Mobile in the first half of fiscal year '24. Is that a function of the Android market being last bad? Is it largely a function of maybe some traction in ultra-wideband or is it a function of content gains at your largest Mobile customer?
Kurt Sievers: So, Gary, in full transparency, most of all, it's a function of the weak compares of last year. I just have to pull it out. I mean if you look at our Q1 of last year, it was horrendously low as a function of everything I explained in the last 10 minutes. So very, very clearly, mainly a function of weak compares. However, you mentioned at least one other thing, which is certainly the case. We clearly see that the Android inventory digestion is completely behind us. I would almost claim already in Q4, it was largely behind us. So in Android, we are shipping to end demand and you could also be somewhat hopeful about the Android market development going forward. So that is certainly a case. And our premium handset customer is also in, I would say, in a decent shape relative to volume development. But that's it. So again, it is very much a function of us trying to get as quickly as possible to true end demand and not suffering from excess inventory. I mean, that's a good example of where that also helps you then on the other side of the equation to quickly come back into growth.
Gary Mobley: Thank you for that, Kurt. And Bill, you seem to be calling out 58% gross margin for fiscal year '24, which is down only 50 basis points from the prior year. And that's quite commendable considering what's going on in the industry and whatnot. And it seems like you have a lot of gross margin headwinds from utilization to mix headwinds and whatnot. Maybe if you can give us some additional color in terms of the offsets to those headwinds and what's allowing for this gross margin resiliency?
Bill Betz: Sure. Let me just use Q4 as an example in Q1 and then talk about some more of those levers, both tailwinds and headwinds. So in Q4, we did slightly better, as you know, 20 basis points. And really, that was driven by that distribution mix. It represented 61% of our sales, up from 57% in Q3. Now in Q1, we're guiding down 70 basis points, primarily driven again by this lower distribution mix and lower -- slightly lower fall-through on the sales. And because what we're doing there is we're seasonally adjusting distribution sales. So that will be down, but still probably better than a year ago from a mix standpoint. If you remember, distribution sales was about 49% in Q1, and I think we'll be a bit better than that, which is then offsetting the underutilization. If you recall, Q1 from a year ago, we were running in the low 80s and now we're running in the low 70s. So you got some moving parts from a year-over-year compare, but from a quarter-over-quarter compare, it's really driven by the mix. Now talking about tailwinds and headwinds, you're right. Clearly, if we go below our current utilization levels of the low 70s, that becomes a headwind for us. We know that. We're managing it to this level. And you can see for the last three quarters, we've been running our internal factories, which represent 40% of our internal source wafers. Another, obviously, headwind is obviously you have lower revenues, you have lower fall-through over your fixed cost structure. If we do see lower pricing, again, we're -- so far, we see that we're able to keep this stable and flat from a year-over-year comparison standpoint. But again, if we do have lower pricing, it's our job to offset that with lower cost and productivity gains. Again, obviously, this is more longer term, the delay of any new product introductions could cause an impact from this quarter or that quarter based on timing. But the tailwinds we have, again, is higher revenues, if you think about over the 30% fixed cost structure we have, so that falls through. If we replenish our channel back to normal levels, again, Kurt talked about that $500 million. It's a richer mix. And when we decide to do that, that becomes a tailwind. And then utilization, if we improve our 70% utilization internally, going back to more something in the mid-80s, that's a tailwind. Another one is and something that we talked about is we plan to expand our distribution reach and mass market customers. We don't think we're doing as good as a job like some of our peers. So that's something that we're going to focus on and do better at and reach more customers. And clearly, we're going to continue to execute on our productivity gains. And most importantly, longer term is to ramp up our new product introductions, which are accretive to the corporate gross margins today. So all in all, I think it's how you manage the tailwinds and the headwinds quarter in and quarter out, and we're going to do our best to maintain near the high end of the model as what I said at these types of revenue levels.
Gary Mobley: Helpful. Thanks, Bill.
Bill Betz: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Francois Bouvignies with UBS. Your line is open.
Francois Bouvignies: Thank you very much. I have two, maybe a follow-up to the previous question. The first one is on Automotive. I mean you mentioned that you are basically managing the channel and under-shipping at the moment with a more clear picture in the second half of the year, if I have to summarize. Can you quantify maybe how much do you under-ship the demand maybe in the last two quarters? Because when I look at your Auto revenues, it was up 1% year-over-year. The production was -- of cars was obviously much higher. I was wondering if you had any intelligence of how much you are under-shipping the Automotive right now, which basically would go into your way of a soft down cycle? But I was wondering if you have any quantification on that would be very helpful.
Kurt Sievers: Yeah. Hi, Francois. No exact quantification, but I guess a few pointers. It isn't useful in my view, to look at one individual quarter. But I think now since the full calendar year '23 is behind us, you can look at the full year where I think our Auto business did grow by 9%. I also said that the company has increased pricing by 8%. So let's just assume for a minute that in Auto, we did also increase price in that order of magnitude, which basically puts you almost on a zero supply increase line last year in Automotive. So say zero growth in Automotive last year in supply and units. And that goes against what I would call super bullish Automotive fuel last year with, I think, in the end, the 9% SAAR increase to 90 million units, a rocking increase in electric cars. I think the xEV cars last year, we're growing by 45% year-over-year. So I mean all the good arguments, which we've discussed so often for a lot of content increase on top of the 9% SAAR. And we shipped zero. I mean that gives you a feel why we have a very strong view that we already significantly under-shipped through all of last year. But at the same time, I mean, it's obvious we have over-shipped in the time before. It's just that I believe we started very early with taking a handle on that and controlling that over-shipment and throttling it back. I think through all of last year, we have under-shipped in the distribution side of Automotive, which is 40% of the revenue. And I'd say we've take -- we started to take more stringent action in the second quarter of last year to also control the over shipments in the direct side. But that's the one which is not completely done yet. So it's very hard to qualify that Francois because you don't know what size of inventory individual Tier 1 customers want to keep on the long run. And it's also not a -- it's not a steady target. I mean we discussed with them very often. And these targets in terms of how many weeks of semiconductor inventory they want to keep. First of all, they are ranging widely between different Tier 1s. I could quote a range here between two weeks and 18 weeks. It's really all over the place. And it also changes over time. As soon as they see reason to believe that their business is going to grow again, which means the OEM call offs they are getting, then they want to grow their inventory again. So that's why it's a bit of a moving target. But I think for us, the synthesis is that we believe by the middle of calendar year '24, we have that behind us.
Francois Bouvignies: That's great answer. Thank you. And the second follow-up is on the pricing. I mean you said flattish pricing in '24 and obviously, it seems to be like better than peers, and I understand the commodity part and also the input cost. If we look at the input cost, the electricity is coming down, I mean, obviously, from the peak you have the silicon wafers coming down. You have the mature nodes at the foundry level that is coming under pressure for many, many Tier 2, Tier 3 foundries. I was just wondering if the input cost is the main tracker of your pricing, how should we think about 2025 or through the year as we see input cost is also coming under pressure, if you see what I mean?
Kurt Sievers: Look, a couple of things, Francois. First of all, I'm glad we get well through '24. I can't get my head around '25, that's a little early, to be honest. Now at the same time, I think you put good pieces together relative to input costs, the one which you didn't put up is the fact that the Tier 1 foundries are still a bit tight lipped when it is to cost decreases. And the biggest part of our input is Tier 1 foundries, not Tier 2 and Tier 3 foundries because we need these Tier 1 foundries for our Automotive and Core Industrial business. And there, unfortunately, the trends are not quite as ambitious as you mentioned them. Over time, Francois, I do believe, say, mid to longer term, that the industry will return to low single-digit ASP erosion year-over-year. That is what we had in the pre-COVID period in the application-specific business like ours. And I think it is reasonable to assume that, that is also going to happen in the mid to longer-term future. However, this year is a transition year because the input is not yet the input cost and the inflationary environment is just not yet at that level as it used to be in the past. And very important, and I know it's probably very clear, but I just want to reiterate that very clearly. This does not mean falling back to the levels which we had pre-COVID. What I'm saying is, from the levels which we have achieved now, we possibly have that in the mid to longer-term future, this very low single-digit ASP erosion per year, but we absolutely see no scenario that falls back to the levels of pre-COVID.
Gary Mobley: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Danely with Citi. Your line is open.
Chris Danely: Hey, thanks guys. Just in terms of the things getting a little bit tougher over the last months, Kurt, is there any way to tell how much of this is, I guess, worsening demand versus a little more inventory than we thought? Any which way or the other on either side of that?
Kurt Sievers: Hey, good morning, Chris. Yeah, clearly, first of all, I confirm what you say. It got worse over the last 90 days or at least our view on what we are exposed to got worse. I would say the end demand in Auto has weakened. I mean the latest S&P data is now almost a percentage point down year-on-year in terms of SAAR, so that's a little less than it was before. The xEV penetration is a little slowing. Again, it is still up, but it is a little slowing. So these are just gradual movements to the less positive side than what it was 90 days ago. But I think what is probably the somewhat bigger part in here is that we just got a better handle now, what is the remaining size of the excess inventory with our Tier 1 Automotive customers, which we are working down through the first half. So I cannot pass in percentage, which one of the two is contributing how much. But I'd say it is in that, say, combination of Automotive, core Industrial over-inventory and at the same time a weakening macro.
Chris Danely: Great. And for my follow-up, I think -- so Bill talked about disty being 49% of sales in Q1 of last year and then 61% of sales in Q4. Did I hear that right? Or is that wrong?
Bill Betz: That's correct, Chris.
Chris Danely: So -- yeah, okay. So my question is, your sales grew about, I guess, 10% from Q1 to Q4. And so that would mean your sales into disty grew a lot more than that. Why would that happen if the environment, like overall, at least outside [US] (ph) was a little more difficult?
Bill Betz: Basically it is matching to the sell-through.
Kurt Sievers: Chris, I think the background here is mainly that the exposure to distribution is larger in our Industrial and IoT business. And that is the one where we have seen the trough already in the first quarter of last year. So that gradual improvement throughout the quarters I discussed earlier, that shows up more on the distribution side because those are the segments which had that improvement. Where, in Automotive, distribution is only 40%, as I described, we have now the direct customer excess inventory digestion and distribution is a smaller part. So I think it is just a reflection of our exposure to the different end market segments.
Chris Danely: Got it. Thanks for all the color guys.
Bill Betz: Thanks, Chris.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joshua Buchalter with TD Cowen. Your line is open.
Joshua Buchalter: Hey, guys. Good morning or good afternoon depending on where you are sitting. Thanks for squeezing me in. In Autos, you've heard from a few in the supply chain, that there's a bit of a push pull going on between OEMs and Tier 1s, where the OEMs want the Tier 1s to keep carrying more inventory, Tier 1s are trying to manage their working capital and carry less. I'd be curious, are you seeing that going on? Is that some -- the Tier 1s wanting to lower their levels. Is that playing into what's going on with some of the digestion you're seeing now? Thank you.
Kurt Sievers: Joshua, absolutely. That's a horrendous fight and that's why I said earlier, it is really hard to call the final exact landing place for the size of inventory for Tier 1 because it is a matter of their negotiation with the -- with their OEM customers. The midterm trend is that every piece of new business they are winning, OEMs are now often enforcing for the new business to hold a certain amount of inventory for specific semiconductor components. So that becomes very explicit, but it's only for new business. So think about it as something which will be layering in over the next couple of years as those new design wins are materializing. That's the way how the OEMs want to get a firm handle on the size of inventory at Tier 1s. At the moment, it's still Wild West because none of this is really contractually anchored because it's old contracts, which didn't have these articulations, which is why it is indeed all over the place, and that makes it also a bit harder to be precise.
Jeff Palmer: I think -- you have one more, Josh?
Joshua Buchalter: Yeah, that's okay. I would just, maybe, Bill -- I was going to ask about the policy of repurchases. I know you mentioned it's still return 100% of free cash flow but have been running a little bit below that in the last several quarters. Should we expect after you pay down the debt in March that repurchases pick up? Or is it something more tied to the business environment? Thank you.
Bill Betz: Yeah. I mean, again, our capital allocation, as I stated, hasn't changed. If I just look over the last three years, we returned $8.8 billion or 113% over those three years. And you're right, the trailing 12 months, 77%, current quarter was 72%. And again, we are -- we set aside some cash, as you all know, that we're going to retire some of our debt and deleverage the company here, and we think that's a good use of our cash and we're going to continue being flexible on our balance sheet and doing all of the above, dividends, buybacks, debt as well as small M&A, no changes and we are going to continue to do what we do.
Joshua Buchalter: Thank you.
Jeff Palmer: Thanks, Josh.
Operator: Thank you.
Kurt Sievers: Yeah, I guess that gets us to the end of the call. So, thanks everybody for joining the call this morning. Clearly continues to be a tough environment where NXP takes any control possible, and I dare to say we have started to take that control, especially relative to inventory builds externally and inventory management internally. We started to take that control in a very disciplined manner early, in the mid of 2022 for the distribution site, and starting in the second quarter of last year on the direct customer side, which we believe allows us to continue to drive a safe landing and soft landing in this tough environment. Mid and longer term, we continue to be fully focused on the Automotive and Industrial markets to innovate and drive profitable growth. Thank you all.
Operator: Thank you for your participation. This does conclude the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-11-07 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the NXP Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker Jeff Palmer, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Jeff Palmer: Thank you, Shannon, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the NXP Semiconductors third quarter earnings call. With me on the call today is Kurt Sievers, NXP's President and CEO; and Bill Betz, our CFO. The call today is being recorded and will be available for replay from our corporate website. Today's call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause NXP's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the macroeconomic impact on specific end markets in which we operate, the sale of new and existing products, and our expectations for financial results for the fourth quarter of 2023. Please be reminded that NXP undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements. For a full disclosure on forward-looking statements, please refer to our press release. Additionally, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are driven primarily by discrete events that management does not consider to be directly related to NXP's underlying core operating performance. Pursuant to Regulation G, NXP has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our third quarter 2023 earnings press release, which will be furnished to the SEC on Form 8-K and available on NXP's website in the Investor Relations section at nxp.com. Now I would like to turn the call over to Kurt.
Kurt Sievers: Thank you very much, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining our call today. I will start with a review of our quarter three results, discuss our guidance for quarter four and provide our early views of 2024. Now let me begin with quarter three. NXP delivered quarterly revenue of $3.43 billion, $34 million above the midpoint of guidance and essentially flat year-on-year. Revenue trends in our Mobile, Industrial & IoT and Automotive end markets all performed in line or better than anticipated, while our communication Infrastructure & Other end market were slightly below our expectations. Our distribution channel inventory during the third quarter declined slightly to a 1.5 months level well below our long-term targets of 2.5 months. Non-GAAP operating margin in quarter three was 35%, 30 basis points below the midpoint of our guidance. This is primarily due to an unforecasted potential legal liability of approximately $14 million which is reflected in SG&A. Non-GAAP operating margin was down 190 basis points versus the year-ago periods, primarily as a result of higher R&D investments and the noted potential legal expense. Now let me turn to the specific trends in our focused end markets. In Automotive, quarter three revenue was $1.89 billion up 5% versus the year-ago periods and in line with the midpoint of our guidance. In Industrial & IoT, quarter three revenue was $607 million, down 15% versus the year-ago periods. So above the midpoint of our guidance. In Mobile, quarter three revenue was $377 million down 8% versus the year-ago periods and above the high end of our guidance. In Communication Infrastructure & Other, quarter three revenue was $559 million, up 8% year-on-year, so slightly below the midpoint of our guidance. During the third quarter from a geographic perspective, we experienced incremental improvement across most regions, with China solidly improving quarter-over-quarter. So our shift to rates to China are still down versus the year-ago period. From a channel perspective, sequential growth was led by improved sell-through in our distribution business. At the same time, our direct business sequentially declined, a reflection of NXP actively managing inventory digestion at our direct customers. Overall, our distribution business represented 57% of sales, up from 51% in the second quarter. And now I will turn to our expectations for quarter four 2023. We are guiding quarter four revenue to $3.4 billion. This is about 3% versus the year-ago period up and represents a sequential decline of approximately 1% at the midpoint. We anticipate the following trends in our business. Automotive is expected to be up in the mid-single digit percent range versus quarter four 2022 and flattish sequentially. Industrial & IoT is expected to be up in the high single-digits on a percentage basis versus both quarter four 2022 and quarter three 2023. Mobile is expected to be down in the mid-single-digit percent range versus quarter four 2022 and up in the low-single-digit range on a sequential basis and finally, Communication Infrastructure & Other is expected to be down mid-single-digits on a percentage basis versus quarter four 2022 and down in the upper teens percent sequentially. Our guidance for quarter four contemplates ending the fourth quarter at a 1.6 months of distribution channel inventory. Zooming out, the combination of our third quarter results and the midpoint of our fourth quarter guidance indicates the full year 2023 revenue will be flattish versus 2022 in a challenging and cyclical market environment. When we now turn to our early views on 2024, we continue to see an operating environment with a number of cross currents. Clearly, the macro environment remains weak, including subdued demand in China, geopolitical challenges and elevated inflation, which is constraining demand. At the company level, lead times have normalized, and we anticipate a more neutral pricing environment going forward. And already since early this year, we have actively engaged with our large direct customers to drive a reduction in on-hand inventory where needed, rather than just blindly enforcing NCNR commitments. Furthermore, we have demonstrated over several quarters proactive management of our distribution channel resulting in a very lean channel inventory position of 1.5 months at the end of quarter three versus our long-term target of 2.5 months. Through all of these proactive actions, we believe we will enter 2024 with a comparatively balanced customer inventory position with some remaining pockets of inventory digestion yet to occur. Hence, we will also begin to replenish the channel sometime in 2024. In terms of NXP's focused end markets for 2024, we are assuming global order production to be up 1% as anticipated by S&P. We assume the mixed shift towards semiconductor content-rich hybrid and battery electric vehicle continues and reaches about 40% of all cars produced in '24, up from 33% in 2023. This is very supportive of the NXP-specific [indiscernible] content drivers such as radar systems, electrification solutions and high performance processes for software-defined vehicles. Turning to Core Industrial. We see the trends, including especially content growth to be pretty similar to Automotive. In our Consumer IoT and Mobile business, after over a year of weak demand, we see an incrementally improving environment. Finally, we do believe the weak demand in Communication Infrastructure & Other likely continues as we have satiated pent-up demand in our secure cards business, anticipate a weak environment in mobile base station buildouts and expect end-of-life in some of our network edge products. When putting it all together, netting the positives against the known headwinds, we continue to navigate a soft landing for the business and anticipate a return to year-on-year revenue growth throughout 2024. For the first quarter, we expect seasonality to return more to the typical pre-COVID seasonal patterns in a range of down mid to upper single digits sequentially. And now I would like to pass the call to you, Bill, for a review of our financial performance.
Bill Betz: Well, thank you, Kurt, and good morning to everyone on today's call. As Kurt has already covered the drivers of the revenue during Q3 and provided the revenue outlook for Q4, I will move to the financial highlights. Overall, our Q3 financial performance was good. Revenue and non-GAAP gross profit were modestly above the midpoint of guidance with solid gross profit fall through. Now, moving to the details of Q3. Total revenue was $3.4 billion, $34 million above the midpoint of the guidance and essentially flat year-on-year. We generated $2.01 billion in non-GAAP gross profit and reported a non-GAAP gross margin of 58.5% up 50 basis points year-on-year and 10 basis points above the midpoint of the guidance range driven by the fall-through on higher revenues. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $803 million or 23.4% of revenue, up $73 million year-on-year and up $32 million from Q2. When compared to the midpoint of guidance, this is a miss of $18 million, where $14 million is due to a potential unforecasted legal liability and the remainder from higher variable compensation. From a total operating profit perspective, non-GAAP operating profit was $1.2 billion and non-GAAP operating margin was 35%. This was down 190 basis points year-on-year and slightly below the midpoint of the guidance range due to the previously noted potential legal liability which created a 40 basis points headwind to non-GAAP operating margin. Non-GAAP interest expense was $65 million with non-GAAP income tax provision of 168 million reflecting a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 14.8% which is favorable versus our guidance range of 16% to 17%. Non-controlling interest was $5 million and stock-based compensation, which is not included in the non-GAAP earnings was $103 million. Taken together, this resulted in a non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.70, $0.10 above the midpoint of the guidance. Now turning to the changes in our cash and debt. Total debt at the end of Q3 was $11.17 billion flat sequentially. The ending cash position was $4.04 billion, up $179 million sequentially due to the cumulative effect of capital returns, improved working capital metrics, flat CapEx investments and positive cash generation during Q3. The resulting net debt was $7.13 billion and we exited the quarter with a trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA of $5.38 billion. The ratio of net debt to trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA at the end of Q3 was 1.3 times and the 12 month adjusted EBITDA interest coverage ratio was 19.9 times. During Q3, we repurchased $306 million of our shares and paid $262 million in cash dividends. Taken together, we returned $568 million to our owners in the quarter, which represented 72% of non-GAAP free cash flow and 81% on a trailing 12 month period. Furthermore, subsequent to the end of Q3, we continue to execute our share repurchase program, buying an incremental $124 million or approximately 658,000 shares through Friday, November 3rd. Now turning to working capital metrics. Days of inventory was 134 days, a decrease of three days sequentially and distribution channel inventory was 1.5 months or approximately 45 days, down about four days from the second quarter. When combined, this represents approximately 179 days or a seven-day decline from the prior quarter. We continue to be laser-focused on tightly controlling our channel inventory levels while leveraging our balance sheet strength to hold product in die form for quick turnaround as demand materializes. Days receivable were 25 days down, four days sequentially, and days payable were 60 days, a sequential decrease of three days. Taken together, the cash conversion cycle was 99 days, an improvement of four days versus the prior quarter. Cash flow from operations was $988 million and net CapEx was $200 million or approximately 6% of revenue, slightly better than our guidance of 7%, resulting in non-GAAP free cash flow of $788 million or 23% of Q3 revenue, which is up from 17% in the prior quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, this represents a 20% non-GAAP free cash flow margin. Overall, we continue to be focused on driving non-GAAP free cash flow margin to greater than 25%, a level we have demonstrated in the past and a level we believe we can achieve in the future. Turning now to our expectations for the fourth quarter. As Kurt mentioned, we anticipate Q4 revenue to be $3.4 billion plus or minus $100 million. At the midpoint of our revenue outlook, this is up about 3% year-on-year and down about 1% versus Q3. Furthermore, given our manufacturing cycle times, the current demand environment and our lean channel inventory, our guidance contemplates improving the channel inventory to 1.6 month level for Q4. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be flat sequentially at 58.5%, plus or minus 50 basis points, as we continue to balance mix and internal utilizations. However, we do see slightly higher input costs from our suppliers. As a result, we remain focused on mitigating these higher input costs through a combination of productivity and passing higher input costs along to our customers. Operating expenses are expected to be $785 million, plus or minus about $10 million. Taken together, non-GAAP operating margin will be 35.4% at the midpoint. We expect non-GAAP financial expense to be $69 million and the non-GAAP tax will be $180 million, or an effective non-GAAP tax rate of 15.9% of profit before tax. Non-controlling interest will be $6 million. For Q4, we suggest for modeling purposes, you use an average share count of 260 million shares and capital expenditures of 6% of revenue. We expect stock-based compensation, which is not included in our non-GAAP guidance to be $106 million taken together at the midpoint, implies a non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.65. Now for 2024 non-GAAP modeling, we propose you to assume the following. We expect to increase channel inventory sometime in 2024 to support anticipated growth, ensure proper customer stock levels, and to support our long-tail customers. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to remain at the high end of our long-term model, plus or minus the normal 50 basis points. Non-GAAP operating expenses, we plan to manage the business at or below the 23% of sales. For capital expenditures, we expect to stay within the long-term model of 6% to 8% of sales. For stock-based compensation, which is not included in our non-GAAP results, we suggest using approximately $450 million. And for non-GAAP taxes, we expect a 17% rate versus the prior view of 18%. So, in closing, I would like to highlight what we shared last cycle. First, from a performance standpoint, as we navigate a soft landing through a challenging and cyclical demand environment, we will continue to be disciplined to manage what is in our control and stay within our long-term financial model. Second, operationally, the Q4 guidance assumes internal factory utilization will be in the low to mid 70s range, a level we expect to hold until internal inventory normalizes. And lastly, we plan to hold more cash on the balance sheet to enable greater flexibility. We also plan to retire the 1 billion March 2024 debt tranche when it comes due with our cash on hand, which will result in an improved gross debt leverage ratio below the current 2.1 times level today. Finally, we will remain active repurchasing our shares. I would like to now turn it back over to the operator for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Ross Seymore: Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Congrats on navigating the choppy times. Kurt, for my first question, I just wanted to talk about the linearity of demand. It was very helpful that you gave the fourth quarter and so much details on the first quarter in 2024. But in general, it seems like you're refilling the channel a little bit in your outer quarter guide and the channel was a big driver sequentially in the third quarter. So how are we to think about the channel directionally from here? Appreciating, of course, that it's already at the end of the range. What are the puts and takes in your decisions to seemingly slowly refill that?
Kurt Sievers: Hey, thanks, Ross. Let me indeed first of all say that these fluctuations between 1.5 and 1.6 are partially beyond our control, to be honest. I mean, you know, it just ticked down a little in the third quarter. We think we are anyway sitting at the absolute minimum where it should be, so we felt it is appropriate to move it back to the 1.6 level. What I think is more important in the bigger context of that channel management is that over 1.5 years now, I would say, we have kept it intentionally very, very lean, always around this 1.5 or 1.6 level in the dropping environment so in an environment where demand was weak and rather dropping. Going forward, as I said in my prepared remarks, we think the environment is more stable or up again, which is why we did say that at some point through next year, we will also start to refill the channel again. The speed of that and the magnitude will really depend on the environment. We will not go higher than the 2.4 or 2.5 level, which is our long-term target and which has been our long-term target in the past. If there was a sharp rebound in China and we set the same last quarter, then of course, we would probably go back relatively quickly. But in a more stable environment, as we anticipate into next year, we will start to refill next year, Ross. Because we think that is important to make sure we hold competitiveness in the channel for our long-tail customers. So there will be a moment where it will be just important in a stable environment to have enough product on the shelf to remain competitive.
Ross Seymore: Thanks for that color. I guess as my follow up one for Bill on the gross margin side, you guys have done a great job keeping it at the high end of the range despite all the puts and takes on the end markets and the weakness overall. What are the puts and takes for next year? And you said that you'd stay at the high end of the range plus or minus fill through that period, also impressive. Is that just the structural new base for the company? How are you able to keep it at the 58% range versus the 55% to 58% that you had given at your last analyst meeting?
Bill Betz: Sure. So let me address the current -- the last couple of quarters. As mentioned, our internal utilizations are running, call it, low-to-mid 70s, and that headwind is being offset by our distribution mix. It's richer in margin, and that represented about 57% of our composition of revenue this quarter, which is up from 51%. So they're sort of offsetting each other in the short term and we see the same to occur in Q4. Now, if we look ahead, what are some of the levers that perhaps can drive gross margin higher over the long-term, and I think we've talked about these in the past, but again, higher revenues over our fixed cost structure is one, obviously, we're going to have continued productivity gains, clearly, you know, eventually we're going to [Technical Difficulty] demand from our internal factory standpoint. So think about higher utilizations. Kurt talked about, next year we're seeing neutral pricing. And then, you know, really, I think a focus more longer term is expanding our long-tail customers in the mass market. And then eventually what we've always talked about with where our R&D investments go is that ramp of our new product introduction. So some of those are the levels -- levers that we have that get us comfortable on continuing to bring gross margin above our current high end of our model. Again, 58% is not the end goal. It's not our final destination. We're going to continue to work on this from a company initiative.
Ross Seymore: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Your line is now open.
Vivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. Kurt, you mentioned you expect to grow through '24, but how do we square that with just, you know, 1% or so auto production growth that is lower than the mid-single-digit auto production growth that we saw in '23 when your overall sales were flat? So I guess the question is what content lift did you see in '23 and what are your assumptions for automotive content growth in '24?
Kurt Sievers: Hey, thanks. Good morning, Vivek. Yeah, it's clearly that the revenue is driven and the demand is driven by content increase much more so than SAAR. At the same time, you are, of course, right, the latest SAAR update for this year, which I saw is actually almost 8% up over 2022, which is a, by the way, every quarter that was taken up further. So kind [Technical Difficulty] this year. And yes, indeed, also the forecast which we used from S&P for next year I think is just 1% up. So it's almost flat next year. Now, if you take NXP Automotive revenue, Vivek, if you take our Q4 guides, then this year's annual revenue growth of NXP will be like 9% or so. So 9% Automotive NXP in '23 over '22. With that number, I believe we are under-shipping demand and we are actually intentionally under-shipping demand because, as we've always said, we did not want to create this wave of inventory ahead of us, which will lead to a cliff to drop down from. That's why since early in the year we have tried to make sure to not enforce NCNRs to an extent that it would not build excess inventory. And as we discussed with Ross just a minute ago, we kept the channel very lean. And mind you, also in Automotive 40% of our revenue goes through the channel. So the channel is a pretty significant part also of the Automotive business. So what I mean to say here, Vivek, is that we think we are through this inventory digestion at some point next year, which means the revenue growth in our Automotive business will return more to levels which are reflecting the true end demand. I can't tell you when exactly that's going to be next year, but maybe it's safe to assume that through the first half. We are still a little bit working ourselves through this inventory digestion, but in the second half, we should be clean from that. Including then the replenishment of the channel and that's why I make that statement of growing year-on-year throughout the year, every quarter. By the way, that statement was relative to the whole company. It -- we discussed it now for Automotive. But in principle that whole pattern which I just explained is also true for entire NXP. And that's why we continue to be confident that we are properly managing that so-called soft landing. Since we have just anticipated this inventory issue relatively early, have proactively managed it, which means we do not run into this cliff and then resume into year-on-year growth as early as quarter one of next year.
Vivek Arya: Thank you, Kurt. For my follow-up, just on '24, thanks for giving us the high-level views. So Q1, you know, you mentioned normal seasonal. What is normal seasonal for your Automotive business sequentially in Q1? And if I kind of just expand that question overall to '24, in your presentation, you kept your '21 to '24 model, right? That suggests that even at the low end of that 8% to 12% CAGR. Your '24 sales should be in the neighborhood of 14 billion or so. Is that, you know, useful assumption as we think about overall '24? So just Q1 Autos and overall '24 sales. Thank you.
Kurt Sievers: Yeah. Look, Vivek, I think we really went quite far in this call, given the turmoil around us and some of the uncertainty created by some of our peer companies. We went quite far here in order to give quite some color on next year. We really don't want to go down the path of providing that color by segment -- by revenue segment by quarter. That would be just one shock too far. So stay with me with what I said of a more seasonal pattern for Q1, for the whole company, which was a mid to upper single-digit sequential decline, which is, by the way, what we've always had pre-COVID. So there's nothing really strange about this. In a normal pricing environment, with normalized lead times, everything pretty much back to normal. The other half of your question was about the commitment which we had given in, I think, in November '21 in our investor day about the three-year growth, which indeed was an 8% to 12% corridor. And, yes, Vivek, we stand behind that corridor. We do stand behind hitting that corridor of 8% to 12%, like all the rest of the model by the way. I mean, Bill just talked about the gross margin being more at the high end of the model. On the revenue, we will also be in that corridor of 8% to 12%, there we will be in that corridor. Really depends on a couple of macroeconomic factors, including especially more of a return of China and the timing thereof, which is very hard to judge. So we can't -- we just can't go there. But that should not get us either way out of this -- out of that corridor. We should hit it.
Vivek Arya: Thank you, Kurt.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of William Stein with Truist Securities. Your line is now open.
William Stein: Great. Thank you so much for taking my questions. First, Kurt, I think it was in your comments, I'm not sure if it was restricted to your outlook of EVs specifically, but maybe more this electrified drivetrain sort of hybrids, maybe is what you were talking about. But it still seemed like a big jump to me next year. And, you know, would we consider the overall EV market, there's one North American OEM that's been growing very quickly, and there's one Chinese or maybe many, but one really big Chinese OEM that's been doing very well. But among the sort of traditional multinational OEMs, their EV sales have been really weak. And I wonder if your outlook for next year embeds a view that the multinationals are going to do better in this category, or if the companies that have had success only get bigger. And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.
Kurt Sievers: Thanks, Will. That -- I see where you are going and let me try to be as clear as possible. First, yes, I did talk about what the category is called xEVs. That is a combination of the hybrid electric and the fully battery electric vehicles. It's a category used by S&P. So it's not our invention, but it's basically every car which has either only an electric drivetrain or also an electric drivetrain next to a combustion engine drivetrain. That's what matters for us because that is the stuff which calls for more semiconductors. And yes, we do believe it continues to grow quite sharply. So this year the latest forecast is, and since we are in November, I guess it's quite accurate, 33% of the total car production, which is in the order of, I think, 89 million units this year. 33% of that 89 million cars produced this year are xEV and that number is forecast to grow to 41%, which is a 29% year-on-year growth. So if you go in absolute terms, then there will be 29% more of these xEVs next year than this year. Now, where does it come from? Look, well, I think it is a little misleading to look at this from a US perspective. The US car producers are actually, from a global perspective, relatively small. Europe is a little better, but where really the main volume is driven, that is China. And on top of that, China is the one which is also driving the dynamic now in the electric vehicle space. So I think if you just take some of the commentary and some of the adjustments in investment programs which were published of US companies, then that is not representative of what's -- what is going to happen on a global level. But long story short, yes, we do believe this xEV category is moving to a solid 41% of the global SAAR next year, which is obviously very supportive to our semiconductor content growth. By the way, beyond pure electrification systems, as we discussed earlier, those cars tend to be higher featured in electronics above everything. So also ADAS systems like our radar and the whole SDV, Software Defined Vehicle introduction happens faster with these cars, which is why it is so supportive to our revenue. We believe in that. We do not see a massive slowing in the electric vehicle penetration.
William Stein: It's really helpful. Thank you. And you sort of led me into the follow up which is ultra-wideband. I think you were, you know, early to see this among other trends, but I'm hoping you can update us as to how you're seeing uptake in that product, both in automotive and handsets. Thanks so much.
Kurt Sievers: On the handset side, nothing really new. We are still waiting for a bit more dynamic in the Android space, which has nothing to do with ultra-wideband, which is more a mobile-wide industry situation where you might have seen in our guide for mobile for the first -- fourth quarter, excuse me. We are again sequentially up a little in mobile, which is also driven by Android. So given our very lean inventory also in Android space, we think if there is now a bit more dynamic in the Android space, we're going to benefit from it and with that, ultra-wideband, because it's going to go proportional, then up. In the Auto space, we feel very good. So we are ahead of what we wanted to achieve in ultra-wideband. So we have, I think, something like seven platforms in production. So there is seven car platforms which are in production with our ultra-wideband automotive product. To my knowledge, something like 18 to 20 new platforms are awarded or 18 of 20 are awarded to NXP. So there is two small platforms which have not gone to NXP out of 20. Actually, we rejected them because they were under the security standards which we want to ship and would have been margin-dilutive. So that means, overall the momentum in ultra-wideband automotive is very, very good.
William Stein: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Your line is now open.
Stacy Rasgon: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to go back to the channel inventory. Is the amount that you have to ship still $500 million? And would you still grow year-over-year in 2024 if you didn't decide to fill up the channel next year?
Kurt Sievers: So the answer is yes and yes, Stacy. That delta between -- well, now it's actually even a little bit bigger because to be perfectly precise, the $500 million, I think, came from 1.6 months going to 2.4. Since now we are at 1.5, it's probably even a little more than the $500 million, but it's immaterial. So the answer here is yes. That is. Secondly, no, we do not need the $500 million to grow next year, because that whole channel replenishment next year is something we will do some time to some amount. So that cannot be the basis of a guide for next year.
Stacy Rasgon: Got it. Thank you. For my follow-up, I just wanted to ask about some of the geographical macro trends that you mentioned. I found them a little confusing. It sounded like you thought China was getting better, but then you said next year, like, where you land in, you know, in the guidance for the full year depends on China and getting better. We're not hearing from any of your competitors that, like, China or anything else is getting better. I'm just -- can you give us a little more color on what you're seeing by geography and maybe, like, what is -- what do you think the sources of the discrepancy? Why do you guys see things improving in an overall market where you still sound like fairly cautious and your competitors certainly all sound fairly cautious.
Kurt Sievers: Okay. So let me peel the onions, Stacy. First of all, maybe rely on a company level. The reason why we do comparably better if you look at the quarter, to our peers is, again, a soft lending navigation, which we have entered into already early this year and when you think about the channel already middle of last year. We have certainly shipped less over that period, Stacy. And you find that if you compare our growth rates, say, a three-year CAGR over the last three years versus some competitors, especially in auto, and you see that even more sharply, if you look at this year's order growth, as I said earlier, which I think is 9%, we have undergrown competitors. And that undergrowth is still be that we ship less on inventory than we believe some of the peers have done. That, of course, also explains that going forward, we don't see this sharp decline. It's just a softer management through this cycle. Now we do it very, very intentionally because we believe this is very beneficial to our gross margin trajectory, which is not going to suffer that part from under loading factories too hard. So that's actually where the direction has been coming from. Now on the geographic side, Stacy, you have to ask this because I do know that what we just guided, especially in Industrial IoT, and that is largely relative to China is very different to what you heard from a lot of peers. So I just want to repeat, we have both sequentially and year-on-year, we just guided quarter four up by a high single-digit percentage which is in sharp contrast to what several of our competitors have said. We simply think this is because we saw and had our trough in Industrial IT already in quarter one of this calendar year. If you look at the numbers, we had a sharp drop there. We have made absolutely sure we would not increase inventories from there. So we are very close to the pile of the demand. Since then, since Q1, we have been readily going up. And that was long messaging, which might have been a bit confusing around China. What I meant to say is we keep moving up incrementally quarter-to-quarter-to-quarter, while it's still down from a year-on-year perspective. So we are still waiting, and we don't put this in any of our numbers on the big rebound in China. So that's not there. But incrementally, sequentially, it keeps improving. It has improved the past couple of quarters, and it does improve again now in Q1 into quarter four. So that was the commentary on China. So it's cautiously positive. But again, it is simply because we had our trough there already in quarter one, and it was a tough trough. I mean you just do the math. It was really deep. We just did it much earlier than many others.
Stacy Rasgon: Got it. That's clear. Thank you guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Gary Mobley: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Clearly, China is a market -- the China automotive market is a market where you can be quite vertically integrated from a chip supply chain perspective. The market is large enough in terms of volumes, and there seems to be some ability to invest in that area by domestic China competitors. So my question for you is, how are you planning to retain your business with China automotive brands when you probably long term see increasing competition from the domestic players?
Kurt Sievers: Yes, Gary. First of all, it's our business. It has been our business and will continue to be our business to be competitive. So I come back to your specific point, but I mean in itself, it's nothing new. Our whole game, our whole priority in life is to be competitive wherever we play. So in China, indeed, so far, the competitors, which we do see in the automotive space, which you focus on, have been largely our Western competitors plus relates from Japan. So we have hardly seen any local competition. So that's absolutely right. Now over the past, I'd say, couple of quarters, local competition in China came more up in low-end micro controllers. However, not in automotive. We haven't seen that entering into automotive at all. We also don't play that much in the low-end microcontroller space. So I mean, we've been seeing it, but it's not been a big event for us at all. Secondly, we do see a significant focus of local Chinese up-and-coming semiconductor companies on silicon carbide. I mean I just spent 1.5 weeks in China, and it was obvious that there was massive investment and a massive focus both in factory engineering and device engineering on silicon carbide in China. The good news, if you will, is that this doesn't really matter for us because that's one of the businesses we do not do. But I think it takes some of the focus away from the things we do. My personal take would be that probably going forward, we will see a start of more competition in the simpler analogic signal world in China, which would then probably also touch automotive. I don't say, Gary, we have it, yes, it's not like we are losing or being under pressure there today. But my take would be probably that's the one segment where local Chinese semiconductor competitors will also focus on going forward. But again, I mean we've seen this in Korea. We've seen this in Japan in the past. So it's not the first time that we are confronted with local competitors. Yes, we stay paralleled about it, and we'll make sure that we have made an long-term strategies, which are on top of that.
Gary Mobley: Thanks for that detail, Kurt. If I follow up, I wanted to ask about your purchase commitments. They've been running just below $4 billion for the past year, which is consistent with your flattish revenue, but it seems counterintuitive to the maybe the market dynamics that we're in where seemingly, you'd have to put less of a commitment with your foundry partners. So maybe if you can just speak to the trends that you expect in your purchase commitments given the industry dynamics through '24?
Kurt Sievers: Well, those are multiyear commitments. So I guess you referred to, I think in the Q, we have something like a $3.9 billion commitment sitting, which is a multiyear commitment -- which is badly required and badly needed to support our growth over the next five-plus years, which is what this is referring to. So nothing unusual, nothing to worry about. It's just needed for those third-party foundry wafers, which continue to be very tight from a supply perspective and where we are glad we have these commitments to support actually the customer growth. This whole supply situation. Lead times have normalized. That does not mean, however, that we are in every place completely out of the woods. So there is still a couple of technology nodes where we are actually short, which are also leading to quite a few complications. And there is quite a few others, and that's actually quite a few where we are just fine, but where we have very stringent discussions with our customers that they need to make sure they give us mid- to long-term forecast because once the business comes back out of this inventory digestion cycle, we really have to make sure we don't enter into a similar period like we did in the second half of 2020, which is not -- that's not far away from a supplier capability versus demand perspective. So that's why those long-term agreements, which we have there are really needed in the mix of our future revenue growth.
Gary Mobley: Thanks again.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Buchalter with TD Cowen. Your line is now open.
Joshua Buchalter: Hey, guys thanks for taking the question and good morning. So I wanted to ask about the Auto outlook for next year. If we sort of lay out the puts and takes, production growth will be lower, pricing neutral, it sounds like but you mentioned that 2023, there was some element of digestion. I mean as we stack up the content growth and sort of flat to up production and flat pricing, is there a reason, how should we think about 2024 Auto growth for your business compared to 2023? Is there a reason it should be less than '23? Thank you.
Kurt Sievers: Hey, Josh, good trial. As I have to say to, I think, Vivek earlier, I will not guide now on the segment level 2024 but I can give you at least some of the dynamics at work here. Yes, the SAAR -- the underlying SAAR growth next year is going to be less than it was this year. I think the mix of the penetration to xEV vehicles is better, as we discussed earlier, so going to the 40-plus percent level. So that's supported relative to this year. So it drives further content from where we are. I agree with your statement about more neutral pricing. I think that's a fair assumption across the Board. And having said all of that, the only remaining piece next to our company-specific growth drivers, which are well in place. The only remaining piece is the cycle of inventory digestion and going back to normal end demand, which is kicking through to our revenue. Currently, I can only repeat it, we are undershipping demands. And again, we do this intentionally. We've done it for a few quarters already. It's going to be another couple of quarters, but maybe it's fair to assume by middle of next year that is behind us and then the revenue growth rates in automotive and everything else will go back much closer to what the real end demand is. Think about it this way. But so it is really misleading to just look at annual revenue growth in Automotive against SAAR because there is so many other things that work, especially this inventory cycle.
Joshua Buchalter: Understood. I can at least try. I guess I could ask it another way. You guys used to give a metric about I think it was 70% of your Auto business was tied to SAAR and the balance sort of to more content growth drivers. Maybe you can help quantify that mix or maybe give some directional drivers of things like radar, BMS, the S32 platform as you think for [indiscernible]. Thank you.
Kurt Sievers: That's not our model, Josh. That might be a model you made, but we haven't really said that. So what we do say and what fits also to your earlier question, is that we do see a continued strong content increase, which is independent of SAAR. And I think that is something which is probably in the 5% to 8% bracket. And that keeps going. Again, there is no reason that would be slowing next year. But again, it is overlaid by the inventory cycle.
Joshua Buchalter: Got it. Thank you.
Kurt Sievers: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Toshiya Hari: Hi. Good morning. Thank you so much for taking the question. Kurt, I wanted to ask about the pricing environment in '24 you mentioned that you expect a relatively neutral environment. When we spoke at our conference a couple of months ago, I think at the time, you sort of hinted that expectation back then was for '24 pricing to be up a little bit more than what you saw in '21, but a little bit less than '22. So I guess there's been a slight change in how you think about pricing A) is that correct? And B) if so, is this more demand-driven? Or are you seeing lower input costs that's enabling you to keep pricing a little more flattish into '24?
Kurt Sievers: Yes, Toshiya. It's indeed, it's slightly better. It depends on which perspective you want to take on this relative to the input cost. So what we are seeing now is a slight increase in input costs across everything. So it's really -- I mean, there is pieces which are going up, unfortunately, quite a bit. Others are starting to come down. So but in the mix, we have a slight increase, on top of that, we put our productivity efforts, and that is what we need to pass on to our customers in terms of -- well then you land in a pretty neutral area. And that indeed is a touch better than what we discussed when we recently met in your conference. And yes, it is just important to see this indeed in the context of what you mentioned over the past couple of years because in my view, in '21, we increased, I think, by 2% for the whole company in '22 by 14%. This year, we're going to tell you in the Q4 earnings, what it will be, but indeed, it's again a solid number. And that comes then down next year to a more neutral but I actually made the comment in my prepared remarks because I wanted to make sure there is no confusion about this possibly going back because we've had the question very often from analysts and investors. If not this whole pricing would be reverting back down all the way to the pre-COVID levels, it is not. I just want to be very clear. It's just neutral this coming year, which is fine from our perspective.
Toshiya Hari: Great. That's very helpful. And then as my follow-up, you're guiding your comps and other business down, I guess, upper teens on a sequential basis in Q4. Is that primarily the base station business and the weakness in that market sort of catching up to you guys? Or is there something more to it? And is it fair to say that Q4 is the bottom for that market? Or could things stay relatively weak into the first half of next year? Thank you.
Kurt Sievers: Yes. So into Q4, it is both. It is the weak base station demand, which you are also quoting. So it's -- I mean, all the hopes this year have been on India and as you hear left and right, it's just going as strong as people and as we had expected. But there is a second component in that weaker revenue for us in Q4 and that is the decline of the pent-up demand in secure cards. I think we spoke about this a couple of times through the year that by favouring Mobile demand in '21 and '22, we have brutally undershipped the secure car business and the solid part of the pent-up demand, we actually satisfied through this year, and that starts now to go away. And so that's plus the weak Mobile base station environment explains the downtime into the fourth quarter. How it all plays out next year? I mean, just to go back to my prepared remarks, clearly, that whole segment next year is not necessarily set up for a huge victory lab. Some of these trends, especially in the base station market will likely continue into next year. So staying relatively speaking weak.
Kurt Sievers: So I'm looking at time now. I think we are nearing the end of the call. And I would like to summarize there. Bill and I really think the main theme of this quarter is especially that since there has been so much say, different messaging from our peers, we really think that the fundamental content growth drivers in our key businesses being Automotive and the Industrial IoT space are in place, but all of this has been massively overlaid by to what extent people have proactively or not proactively managed the inventory cycle. We have tried to do this as productively as we could most notably for all of you in the reported general inventory numbers, which for six quarters now. We have kept very lean. And also earlier this year, we started to try and do a similar thing on our direct customers by not enforcing NCNR, by being reasonable by finding alternative commercial solutions putting us actually in a situation where we think we have -- due to this somewhat undershipped the demand more than our competitors which leads us now going forward in a situation which is much less pronounced relative to the dip and much more realizing the intended and envisaged soft landing, which we wanted to have. That is the main point here. Other than that business really going back to a more normal pricing environment lead times being normalized, all reasons to believe that this growth quarter from a quarter year-over-year perspective throughout all of next year, resuming growth. You see this in Q4 already. We have year-on-year growth and that should continue throughout all of next year. With that, I thank you all for the attention today. Thank you very much. Bye-bye.
Jeff Palmer: Thank you all. We'll call it here.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-07-25 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the NXP’s Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jeff Palmer. Please go ahead, sir.
Jeff Palmer: Thank you, Norma and good morning everyone. Welcome to NXP Semiconductor’s second quarter earnings call. With me on the call today is Kurt Sievers, NXP’s President and CEO; and Bill Betz, our CFO. The call today is being recorded and will be available for replay from our corporate website. Today’s call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause NXP’s results to differ materially from management’s current expectations. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the macroeconomic impact on specific end markets in which we operate, the sale of new and existing products and our expectations for financial results for the third quarter of 2023. Please be reminded that NXP undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements. For a full disclosure on forward-looking statements, please refer to our press release. Additionally, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are driven primarily by discrete events that management does not consider to be directly related to NXP’s underlying core operating performance. Pursuant to Regulation G, NXP has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our second quarter 2023 earnings press release, which will be furnished to the SEC on Form 8-K and is available on NXP’s website in the Investor Relations section at nxp.com. I would now like to turn the call over to Kurt.
Kurt Sievers: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. We really appreciate you joining our call today. I will start with a review of our quarter two results and then discuss our guidance for quarter three. Now let me begin with quarter two. Our revenue came in at the high-end of our guidance or about $100 million better than the midpoint with the trends in all end market segments performing better than our expectations. Taken together, NXP delivered quarter two revenue of $3.3 billion, essentially flat year-on-year, while we continue to maintain our distribution channel inventory strictly at a 1.6-month level, which remains to be well below our long-term target of 2.5 months. Non-GAAP operating margin in quarter two was 35%, 50 basis points above the midpoint of our guidance, so 100 basis points below the year ago period. The year-on-year performance was a result of stronger gross margin, offset by higher R&D investments in support of our mid- and long-term growth targets. Now let me turn to the specific trends in our focus end markets. In Automotive, quarter two revenue was $1.87 billion, up 9% versus the year ago period and near the high-end of our guidance. In Industrial and IoT, quarter two revenue was $578 million, down 19% versus the year ago period and near the high end of our guidance. In Mobile, quarter two revenue was $284 million, down 27% versus the year ago period and above the high-end of our guidance. In Communication, Infrastructure and Other, quarter two revenue was $571 million, up 15% year-on-year and at the high-end of our guidance. During the second quarter, we had experienced incremental improvement across all regions with China also gradually improving quarter-over-quarter. Year-on-year growth was led by our Direct business. While our Distribution business continues to grow sequentially from the trough in Q1, though still down on a year-on-year basis. Now let me turn to our expectations for quarter three 2023. We are guiding quarter three revenue to $3.4 billion. This is down about 1% versus the year ago period and represents sequential growth of about 3% at the midpoint. We do anticipate the following trends in our business. Automotive is expected to be up in the mid-single-digit percent range versus quarter 3, ‘22 and up in the low single-digit range sequentially. Industrial and IoT is expected to be down in the mid-teens percent range versus quarter three ‘22 and up in the low-single-digit percent range sequentially. Mobile is expected to be down in the mid-teens percentage range versus quarter three ‘22 and to be up in the mid-20% range on a sequential basis. And finally, Communication, Infrastructure and Other is expected to be up about 10% versus quarter three ‘22 and flattish sequentially. Our guidance for the third quarter contemplates that we maintain the 1.6 month distribution channel inventory level and very consistent to our approach in prior quarters, we will manage sell-in to the channel tightly, so we may start to increase general inventory as and when we see consistent strength in channel sell-through for future periods. We are well positioned with on-hand inventory to satiate a possible rebound in demand as it emerges. Furthermore, we continue to experience higher input costs. Hence, we stick to our consistent pricing policy, which is to pass along the input cost increases to our customers, while not having our gross margin. From a more strategic standpoint, we focus on enhancing how we work with our suppliers and customers in order to enable long-term supply and demand assurance programs especially in the automotive and core industrial businesses. Now as we progress through 2023, we are gaining confidence that we will be able to return to predictable year-over-year growth of the business. Demand in the Automotive and Core Industrial businesses continues to be solid with only a few pockets of supply shortages persisting through year-end. Within the Mobile segment, we are seeing the expected strong seasonal trends in the premium portion of the market in quarter three. And our consumer IoT business appears to be accelerating from the in Q1. However, it does not show signs of a sharp rebound as of yet. And finally, in our Communications, Infrastructure segment, we see soft and lumpy demand in the cellular base station markets, offset by strength in our secured card and businesses. So taken together our first-half results and our guidance for quarter three give us confidence that we are successfully navigating through the cyclical downturn in our consumer exports businesses, while we do see continued strength in our Automotive, Core Industrial and Communications Infrastructure businesses. We believe quarter one was the trough in our business. And we anticipate the second-half of 2023 will be greater than the first-half of this year and also the second-half of 2023 will grow over the second-half of 2022. And this outlook does not contemplate a strong rebound in the consumer IoT business or the Android handset market nor does it assume the retail of the distribution channel to our long-term target of 2.5 months. So overall, we will continue to be very, very disciplined, manage what is in our control and stay within our long-term financial model. And before I turn the call over to Bill, I'd like to take a moment and thank our automotive processor team for achieving a very significant milestone for the enablement of the software-defined At the end of June, NXP out the industry's first fully automotive specified safe and secure 5-nanometer computer. This is a 4 billion transistor multi-core NPU based on an innovative chip architecture that allows the up-integration of new functions and consolidation of existing functions. The vehicle of the future will utilize new software-defined platforms to allow easy upgrades and new features to be added through the vehicle lifetime. Software-defined vehicles get more performance, more reliable, more functional with time instead of degrading as is the case today. In order to achieve this capability, auto OEMs require both flexibility in their compute architecture as well as the opportunity to tap into a broad ecosystem of application developers. At the top of the compute hierarchy in the car is the vehicle computer that runs the vehicle score services and orchestrates functionality across domains deployed into new and processes. With our S32 platform, NXP is the only semiconductor company which offers a complete portfolio to address a wide range of processing requirements across the entire compute hierarchy of the software-defined vehicle. The challenge the auto OEMs are facing with this transformation is the enablement of both software reuse and software scalability. And NXP's S32 platform addresses that challenge by enabling software reuse both horizontally across domains as well as vertically from low-end controllers, all the way up to the high-performance vehicle computer. Over the last several years, we have engaged with and enabled multiple automotive OEMs in their journey towards the software-defined vehicle. We have continued to receive significant OEM awards, including the new 5-nanometer vehicle computer, which will help accelerate our automotive growth very well beyond 2024. We are and I am really excited to be on this truly transformational journey with the automotive industry. And now I would like to pause -- to pass the call over to you, Bill, for a review of our financial performance.
Bill Betz: Well, thank you, Kurt, and good morning to everyone on today's call. As Kurt has already covered the drivers of the revenue during Q2 and provided the revenue outlook for Q3, I will move to the financial highlights. Overall, our Q2 financial performance was very good. Revenue was at the high-end of the guidance range and both non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP operating profit were above the midpoint of the guidance. Now moving to the details of Q2, total revenue was $3.3 billion essentially flat year-on-year while $99 million above the midpoint of the guidance range. We generated $1.93 billion and non-GAAP gross profit and reported a non-GAAP gross margin of 58%, up 60 basis points year-on-year and 20 basis points above the midpoint of the guidance range. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $771 million or 23.4% of the revenue, which is up $47 million year-on-year and up $43 million from Q1. This was at the high-end of the guidance range due to our planned annual merit expenses and higher variable compensation. From a total operating profit perspective, non-GAAP operating profit was $1.16 billion and non-GAAP operating margin was 35%. This was down 100 basis points year-on-year though above the midpoint of the guidance range, which is a reflection of solid fall through on the combination of higher revenue, better gross profit offset by slightly higher operating expenses. Non-GAAP interest expense was $73 million with non-GAAP income tax provision of $108 million, consistent with better profitability reflecting a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 16.6%. Non-controlling interest was $6 million and stock-based compensation, which is not included in the non-GAAP earnings was $102 million. Taken together, this resulted in a non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.43 near the high-end of the guidance range. Turning to the changes in our cash and debt. Total debt at the end of Q1 was $11.17 billion flat sequentially. The ending cash position was $3.86 billion, down $67 million sequentially Q2 is the cumulative effect of capital returns, offset by lower CapEx investments, working capital needs, and cash generation during Q2. The resulting net debt was $7.31 billion and we exited the quarter with a trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA of $5.44 billion. The ratio of net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of Q2 was 1.3 times, and the 12-month adjusted EBITDA interest coverage ratio was 18.2 times. During Q2, we repurchased $302 million of our shares and paid $264 million in cash dividends. Taken together, we returned $566 million to the owners in the quarter, which represented 102% of non-GAAP free cash flow generated -- during the quarter and 80% on a trailing 12-month period. Furthermore, subsequent to the end of Q2, we continue to execute our share repurchase program, buying an incremental $69 million of our shares through Friday, July 21. Now turning to working capital metrics, days of inventory was 137 days, an increase of two days sequentially and distribution channel inventory was 1.6 months or approximately 49 days. When combined, this represents approximately 186 days. Furthermore, we continue to be laser focused on tightly controlling our channel inventory levels, while leveraging our balance sheet strength to hold product and die form for quick turnaround as demand materializes. We will only ship products into distribution that has a high likelihood of selling through in the current quarter or is being presage if needed for specific customer deliveries in the next quarter and along with any change in market conditions. Days receivable were 29 days, down two days sequentially, days payable were 63 days, a sequential decrease of five days due to timing of material receipts. Taken together, the cash conversion cycle was 103 days, an increase of five days versus the prior quarter. Cash flow from operations was $756 million and net CapEx was $200 million or 6% of revenue, resulting in non-GAAP free cash flow of $556 million or 17% of Q2 revenue. On a trailing 12-month basis, this represents a 20% free cash flow margin. We continue to be focused on driving non-GAAP free cash flow margin to greater than 25%, a level we have demonstrated in the past and a level we believe we can achieve in the future. Turning now to our expectations for the third quarter. As Kurt mentioned, we anticipate Q3 revenue to be $3.4 billion, plus or minus $100 million. At the midpoint of our revenue outlook, this is down about 1% year-on-year and about up 3% versus Q2. Furthermore, given our manufacturing cycle times and the current demand environment, our guidance contemplates maintaining channel inventory at 10.6 month level, though again, we may move this upward pending improved market conditions and customer requests. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be flat sequentially at 58.4% plus or minus 50 basis points as we continue to balance our mix and internal utilizations. However, we do see and expect higher input costs from our suppliers to continue. As a result, we remain focused on mitigating these higher input costs through a combination of productivity, and higher prices to our customers. Operating expenses are expected to be $785 million plus or minus about $10 million, taken together non-GAAP operating margin will be 35.3% at the midpoint. We expect non-GAAP financial expense to be $67 million and non-GAAP tax rate to be 16.6% of profit before tax. Non-controlling interest will be $4 million and for Q3, we suggest for modeling purposes you use an average share count of 261.3 shares and capital expenditures of 7% of revenue. Taken together at the midpoint, this implies a non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.60. In closing, I would like to highlight the key themes for this earnings cycle. First, from a performance standpoint, we will continue to be disciplined to manage what is in our control and stay within our long-term financial model. Second, operationally the Q3 guidance assumes internal factory utilization in the low to mid-70s range similar to this past quarter and a level we expect to hold until internal inventory normalizes. Lastly, we continue to hold more cash on the balance sheet to enable greater flexibility. Options include reinvestment in the business, continued share repurchases, growth of the dividend and reduced debt levels. Similar to last quarter, we continue to remain active repurchasing our shares. I would like to now turn it back to the operator for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Gary Mobley: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and let me be the first to extend my congratulations on good execution. You guys have been consistent in your communication about keeping distribution inventory low until you see better sell out of the distribution channel. But per your 10-Q filing, your inventory sales were, up 13.5% sequentially ended June quarter and I have to presume that sell out of the distribution channel is up a commensurate amount. So what precisely are you looking at to define better sell? How the distribution channel does trigger taking up that inventory by $500 million.
Kurt Sievers: Yes. Hi, good morning. Thanks, Gary also for the feedback. Yes, we have indeed and that's a good thing, increased our distribution performance in the second quarter, which is also why I said in my prepared remarks that we saw the trough in our consumer exposed businesses, which are the main users of that distribution channel already back in Q1. So we went up into Q2. However, at the same time, we do not see a real rebound in China, so I think that the main trigger point for us would be upper rebound in China, which in our case would both be relevant to the Android handset business, as well as to the consumer exposed IoT business. That hasn't really happened to the extent that we would consider it consistent and persistence enough in order to move up with distribution inventory. And that's why we try to confirm indeed that all the numbers we just gave you for the guidance contemplate a strict 1.6 again, still we may move higher, but then we would also deliver more revenue accordingly in case we see that rebound in China coming. Today, it's not visible.
Gary Mobley: Thank you. That's helpful color. Kurt, I appreciate you dropping some breadcrumbs as to how we should think about the second-half of the year and based on those breadcrumbs, we have to infer that your fourth quarter will be flat sequentially. Is that a proper read or is there a possibility it may be even some sequential growth in the fourth quarter?
Kurt Sievers: Gary, I mean, I'll let you draw your conclusions about the fourth quarter, which we don't guide here. But clearly, what I did repeat, and I think I said this last earnings already that the second-half is going to be larger than the first-half. Now we are adding indeed that the second-half is also going to grow over the second-half of last year. We don't want to tell it closer than this at this point. It's just hard in the current environment to do so. But I think the key point here is that it is really based on two separate legs, which are very important to contemplate. One, is consistent strength in the automotive core industrial and comms infra business pulling just continue to pull ahead. While at the same time, we left this trough in the consumer exposed businesses in Q1 behind us, which then also helps indeed in the second-half to resume the growth, which I was describing. Now for the fourth quarter specifically, let's see when we get there how that goes.
Gary Mobley: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the next question will come from the line of Joshua Buchalter with TD Cowen. Your line is now open.
Joshua Buchalter: Hi, good morning. And congratulations on the results, and then thanks for taking my question. Last quarter, you called out pockets of inventory at Tier 1s in the auto business from some golden screw issues. I mean, clearly, your results don't seem to indicate that this wasn't an issue at all. But could you provide an update on that situation? Did this resolve intra quarter or still sort of lingering and hanging out there, but you're managing through it? I'd be curious to hear how you're seeing things now? Thank you.
Kurt Sievers: Yes, good morning, Joshua. Indeed, it was last earnings that we mentioned that there were about two. Actually as we said European auto Tier 1s, which seem to have some over inventory. In the meantime, this is all contemplated in the guidance you just heard. It is still a, I would say, an unstable situation, because in the meantime lead times have largely normalized. So we are back to a much more normal order pattern, which is good after 2.5 years of turmoil from supply challenges. At the same time, OEMs are asking very much more strict inventory targets from the Tier 1s, but that hasn't settled in all cases. So what we are -- say, seeing here is that in several cases, there is a bit of a 10 situation between the OEMs, the auto OEMs and the automotive Tier 1s, and how much inventory they should actually hold. And that mixed with those golden screw leftovers is indeed leading to a somewhat uneven situation, which in the end and that I mean, I've seen this two, three times before in those cycles. It is now the normalization of what we've had the -- over the past 2.5 years with not much more normal lead times. And in that sense, I think everything is contemplated. I'd say the situation has normalized relative to what I did say last time.
Joshua Buchalter: Thank you for all the color there. And then for my follow-up, I wanted to ask about a comment made towards the end of the prepared remarks. It sounds like you're going to hold utilizations in this 70% range until you get back inventory on books to their target range. Just want to confirm that target range is at 95-days from the Analyst Day. And so does that imply sort of sell through greater than sell in in the back half of the year? And you're confident you can keep margins at this level as utilization rates stay in the 70s? Thank you.
Bill Betz: Yes. Joshua, this is Bill. Couple of questions in there mixed around. So first, let me talk about utilization. Do we expect those to be very similar in our Q3 in the mid to low-70s? And again, what we've guided is our improved mix a bit higher revenues offsetting those utilizations very nicely of everything we can see. On inventory, we expect inventory to go down from a day standpoint internally assuming the channel stays at the 1.6, right? So we're not counting on those 25-days to deplete our internal inventory. That'll be at a later date when we feel confident in the market. So remember, so we're holding about 25-days of extra inventory internally on our balance sheet and prepared for that. I think overall longer term, I would say we're more comfortable holding about a 105-days, I would call it a bit more normal than a 95-day target we said about a year and a half ago. We've learned a lot over the last couple of years and it's just good to have a little bit more inventory, so you can really churn those any orders inside the quarter under lead times and be able to upside revenue. And clearly, we've demonstrated that the past two quarters by upsiding our revenue, having the material in our die bank and being able to fast turn them through our back-end and deliver. So the team is doing a great job here.
Joshua Buchalter: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question will come from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open, sir.
Ross Seymore: Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Kurt, first one for you, I just want to dig a little deeper into the automotive side, people have been waiting for another shoe to drop in that space for a couple of years' time. And you guys have been, kind of, flat to up solidly on a sequential basis and much better than that on a year-over-year basis for nearly four quarters now including your guide. So I just wanted to go into the covers is -- are you still limited by supply? If I put content together with some unit growth, you don't seem to be doing anything better than SAAR right now. So just if you could go into where supply and demand are relative to one another on thinking, any of those sorts of details would be great?
Kurt Sievers: Yes. Thanks, Ross. Good morning, happy to -- I'm happy to do so, but let me maybe just respond to the initial part of the question on the shoe to drop in automotive. I think the shoe just fits, I -- we just don't see it dropping, because things are largely normalized by now, which means indeed we only have a few actually stubborn pockets of supply constraints left. But in the biggest scheme of things, I mean, they are nasty for customers, but from a revenue perspective or from an order size perspective, those are actually quite small. So this whole idea of a totally overstated backlog or huge inventory build, I mean, that's behind us. We've been working through this over the last three quarters. The automotive industry situation, in my view, is actually surprisingly good, I'd say surprisingly, because when you remember back to the SAAR forecast at the beginning of the year, they were more in the 3% range. I think last quarter, we talked about 4%. We keep quoting S&P and now they say 5%. And that's also the numbers which are being recorded from the different regions. So SAAR itself is on a solid path for this year. Yes, it still only returns then for the full-year with 87 million units to a number which is still lower than the 2019 peak volume. The more important part of it, obviously, is the top -- how many electric vehicles and hybrid vehicles are amongst that? And also they're very consistent. Any forecast we have says that about a third of the global status here is going to be either hybrid or fully electric vehicles, which is a 31% year-on-year growth in absolute terms of those type of reasons, which from a content increase perspective is, of course, a fantastic opportunity for the semiconductor business. So also here, nothing to worry about. Now the whole turmoil, I would say, which clearly we have been witnessing is in the supply chain. There was this complete supply crisis over a very extended period of time, which would totally drain supply chain, which has now normalized. And then with the golden screw that normalization has been a bit uneven in cases, but I think that's all coming to a point that things are more normal. Now when you say growing just around SAAR, well, we look at our trailing 12-months growth, which I think sits at 12% currently with the guidance for Q3, which is pretty fine. I mean, this is exactly where it needs to be. And if you look back over the last 10-years, there has never been one quarter, which is showing the mathematical formula of SAAR plus content increase. I mean, that just never happens. It always moves around per quarter. So I'd say with more normal lead times now, things are in the right place.
Ross Seymore: Thank you for all that color Kurt. I guess for my follow-up, one on the gross margin side for Bill. You guys have done a great job. You're at the high-end of your long-term target for your last analyst meeting and you've done that while mix is moving around and utilization is low to the extent we focus on the mix side of that equation, when you talk about mix being a tailwind, is that between your segments that you're referring to and if it is. If those segments start to normalize at some point, your industrial IoT business grew very fast in this last quarter, you're guiding for the next quarter, the mobile business to come back, does mix become less of a tailwind? And if so, how do you handle that? And how does it show itself on gross margins?
Bill Betz: Sure. Thank you, Ross. And let me try to share additional color for our gross margin performance for Q2, the guidance we just provided talk about the next several quarters of what we can see after Q3 and even more longer term, so beyond the next year. And again for Q2, the guidance, we did slightly better, because of that product mix. Now if you look at our distribution. Distribution represented about 51% of our sales and this is up nicely from 48%. And again, distribution long tail has higher margin, lower volume type of customers and richer mix. And again, still not where it used to be more in the mid-50s. So this, kind of, is offsetting us very nicely as we really work our internal inventory down and adjust our foundry purchase orders, it just takes time to do that. And so we feel good at the right balance, these two offsetting each other. Q3 guidance more of the same. And again, as I mentioned earlier in another question, a response to a question is, I think, and we are planning for inventory days to go below the current levels as we get that back into control and improve our free cash flow. Now beyond Q3 and next several quarters, we expect I'd say remain at the high-end of the gross margin model of 58%, plus or minus the 50 basis points. And again, mix I believe is more of a tailwind, not as a headwind, because the distribution we're really focusing on that long tail and we expect that to really kick-in as we continue to go forward. Now much longer term, so think about beyond next year. I would say our ambitions are to see gross margins to expand further, driven by higher revenues. You have to remember this falls through on a 30% fixed cost structure that we have talked about. We should see productivity gains, especially when returning our utilization rates to more optimal levels, so more back to that 85%. We -- I would say we plan to focus on growing that long-term customers, which again are those lower volume, but higher margin business. And lastly, you've heard us talk about this. How our new product introductions become accretive over the long-term as they ramp up? It just takes time. So overall, we feel quite good to increase gross margins over the longer term above the current levels. Obviously, the next couple of quarters, we think, will be in this zip code of what we just shared.
Ross Seymore: Thanks, Bill.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Your line is now open.
Stacy Rasgon: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First one, I had some more questions on the disti sales. I'm a little bit confused, so the disti sales weren't up, but the months didn't change that means the sell-out was equal to the increase in sell-in, but that's not a recovery. I guess can you explain that? And what are you assuming the disti sales doing Q3 in sell-in and sell-out in order to keep that -- the month of inventory flat in Q3?
Bill Betz: So, Stacy, let me take that one. So selling was up, sell-through was up that's the only way you can balance that 1.6.
Stacy Rasgon: Right.
Bill Betz: So that's what the math is. In Q3, we expect, again, our distribution sales as a percentage of how we service our customers to be up again.
Stacy Rasgon: Okay. So how is that not a recovery though? I mean you didn't think that, that was a recovery. So this is like a few quarters now where it looks at the sell-through is going up.
Bill Betz: We've talked about a normal steady recovery, but no sharp rebounds that many are anticipating specifically out of China.
Stacy Rasgon: Got it. Okay and thank you. For my second question, I want to follow-up on just -- it was an offhand comment you just made in front of one of the other questions. You talked about controlling your internal inventories and adjusting your foundry purchase orders. What did that last statement mean, you're reducing your foundry purchase orders in order to help bring your internal inventories down?
Bill Betz: No. It's -- again, as you can imagine, six months ago, we had foundry purchase orders, we have internal utilizations that we're in, I don't know, in the '90s, right? So naturally, as we adjust our inventory levels to real demand we adjust both those levers. I mean that's just normal business.
Stacy Rasgon: Got it. I guess, I'm confused at like your utilizations are in the 70s and your gross margins are at the peak. And I mean before your gross margin got anywhere closer, your utilizations were probably in the 90s. Is that just overall higher revenues or is it -- I mean, because disti sales are lower, I guess, how are you actually getting the margins to where they are [Multiple Speakers] utilizations are?
Bill Betz: Sure. I think there's a combination of tailwinds offsetting those -- that internal utilization. First off, the internal utilization in our factory footprint is much lower than it was three or four or even six years ago during different cycles. We're talking about 30% fixed cost structure, much lower than the past as we source 60% externally. The mix of our products, the quality of our portfolio have improved. And, so you can see as we work through the cycle, distribution was quite low, and I continue repeat on this distribution represents the long tail, which carries a richer mix, because it's low volume, compared to more of your direct customers, which tend to be higher volumes and a bit lower margin. There's really no difference between segment mix. We really looked at product mix, because all the segments are very close to the corporate average. That's what we drive. So we feel very comfortable where we are with these utilization rates to focus on our free cash flow and bring in slight little of that back in balance. Again, we're holding 25 days of that distribution inventory and then maybe we'll get another five or 10 days internally to get that back into balance, and we feel very comfortable to support the growth of our long-term business. But I would say we have quite a number of tailwinds and headwinds that can offset each other.
Stacy Rasgon: Got it. That’s helpful. Thank you, guys.
Bill Betz: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question will come from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Your line is now open.
Vivek Arya: Thank you for taking my question. Kurt, how is NXP's content different in a hybrid or full EV versus a traditional ICE jar? And I ask that because when I look at your automotive business, so you mentioned it's up about 12%, 13% in the first-half, but it is slowing down towards, kind of, the mid-single-digit range in Q3. So, when we compare that against a SAAR production level that is quite decent, then we also add in some of the pricing tailwinds and some of the content tailwinds, wouldn't that suggest your automotive sales should be growing faster at this point? So just curious, how does that hybrid versus ICE mix play into how you look at your automotive sales growth?
Kurt Sievers: Yes. Thanks, Vivek. So, the content or our exposure to electric and hybrid vehicles is extremely accretive to us. And that is products, which are specific to the electric drive train like battery management and gate drivers for inverter control, et cetera. But it is also a lot of other products, which are pulled into electric vehicles, because they tend to be much richer when it comes to electronic features in the ADAS and body and comfort world, so highly accretive to NXP. Now what you try to do it that just doesn't work, you can never take a single quarter and compare the SAAR, which you see, to our revenue. The products which are now getting into cars, we probably shipped two quarters ago, maybe in some cases, longer. It's a very deep supply chain, which has been the whole reason for the drama over the last 2.5 years. So, it doesn't work that way. It's not like mobile, where we ship and then it sits in the smartphone four weeks later. That's not the rhythm and the cadence in automotive. So, some of this on a more, say, normalized basis over several quarters certainly has to do that finally, the supply chain is now stabilizing, which is a good thing. So, we are very happy with how it's moving, because it looks like the drama comes behind us, while at the same time, we are now in a position -- and that's very different to pre-crisis days, we are in a position now to have much longer-term demand and supply assurance programs in place with our customers, which means we have a much longer forward visibility on our revenue stream and on our required products.
Vivek Arya: Got it. And then, Kurt, on -- as the supply environment in automotive normalizes, how are the discussions with your customers changing as you look over the next three, four quarters? Are they less willing to accept higher prices? Are they less willing to take on and hold inventory than they did in the past? Like how is this environment going to transition as we go from a very supply-constrained environment to something that is more towards a normal environment?
Kurt Sievers: Right. I have to repeat what I said last call, because that really hasn't changed from that perspective. Our pricing follows the increased input costs and unfortunately, we continue to have increased input costs through this year. So NXP pricing, including Automotive, will be up this year. For next year, we see the same signs again of increasing input costs. A few other elements in our input costs seem to look a little bit better for next year. So, it's hard for me to say what exactly the mix of our manufacturing and input cost is going to be next year. If it is up again and unfortunately, there are signs it could be up again then we will follow the same policy we have so far. And you know it will be accepted, Vivek, because our product, especially in automotive, where I think your question is going to, is unique. It is, in most cases, anyway not replaceable on the short-term. So, there is no -- this whole idea of it is a commodity product and if the price doesn't sit where it should say somebody else gets the socket, that doesn't work in that industry. It's actually much more the opposite through what we've done over the last two, three years we have a much bigger number of very long-term agreements with our customers on demand assurance, which is to our benefit, but we also signed up for supply assurance to their benefit, which is a pretty symmetric model. But that model avoids actually any short-term fluctuations which you are probably questioning here.
Vivek Arya: Okay. Thank you, Kurt, very helpful.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Francois Bouvignies with UBS. Your line is now open.
Francois Bouvignies: Hi, thank you very much. I have two quick questions. The first one is on the automotive. And Kurt, I think you have been very clear on the solid outlook for Automotive. I just wanted to check on the all the behavior that you have in Automotive in a way that you don't see anything on the P&L side, but I assume you have a significant backlog still to normalize? And what we are seeing in the auto OEM side is like the orders is coming down rather sharply also on the EV side of things, probably some macro impact there. But I just wanted to check with you if you see any impacts on the order behavior, although it doesn't impact your P&L, because of your backlog yet. Is there anything happening on these orders that you see coming through?
Kurt Sievers: Hi, Francois. Thanks for the question. I actually I like the question, because it helps me to clarify something. We never worked on the backlog. We never have that concept of looking at a big backlog, which is like pent-up demand and then working it down. We did these NCNR agreements, which we continue to do with our customers in order to have a long-term perspective on what the true demand is. Nothing about backlog, it's really about true demand and how we can best serve that over an extended period of time. So therefore, no, there is no negative or positive impact from working dollar backlog that has normalized already. So we -- it's not that we currently benefit from a backlog, which has worked down, which would be larger than the true demand. We don't have that. That's behind us. We -- maybe we had a bit of this in the first quarter, but that's behind us. I would rather say I'm not -- I cannot completely see what you said about the negative macro impact on automotive. So clearly, I agree with you on the one hand that, of course, the macro is very uncertain, and there is a lot of concerns about consumer behavior. At the same time, if you look at the fact then as I said earlier, the SAAR for this year is consistently every quarter upgraded. So it's now at a 5% growth forecast for this year, that's not NXP it's third-party research companies. The electrification penetration is consistent with what people said before and I just checked this data yesterday, the dealer inventories are now below the long-term average in China. So they are lower than what they used to be. In the U.S., they are lower than what they used to be. Only in Europe, dealer inventories apparently have, kind of, normalized now. So while I totally agree with you that the macro is certainly more the great place to be currently. But the auto comes consumption per se is actually not in the bad shape. Maybe some OEMs were much more ambitious in the first place, that may be, but if you look at the numbers, which are actually happening month-on-month and quarter-on-quarter, it's not degrading.
Francois Bouvignies: Very clear. Thank you, Kurt for your answer. My quick follow-up would be on the pricing. Obviously, it's concern for investors, I mean, at least a big focus. And we are seeing some, sort of, pocket of pricing pressure from local Chinese for vast range of product. So I was wondering, you talked about the input cost increasing and that's putting the pricing up for your business. How do you see the behavior of some local Chinese or some discount that we see? It seems to be on the low-end side of the spectrum, but just want wondering if you see anything on your side? And maybe it would be great to have a quantification of how much of your business you would consider as low end versus high end, maybe would be very helpful?
Kurt Sievers: Yes. I mean there was already a quarter ago that some of our peers apparently spooked the market a bit with this -- with what you say. I mean we -- I can only report here what we are witnessing. The only one place where we see more extended pricing pressure is low-end micro controllers in China, which is something, which we have almost abundant already a while ago. I mean we are still witnessing it because it's, of course, we speak to our distribution partners there and the end customers. But that's not a place where NXP ever really wanted to be, because the main philosophy of our business is to be differentiated by product, by the product value and its performance and its specification. So wherever we would be in something you call low end or a commoditized replaceable product, it's actually not a place where NXP is normally operating. Now that doesn't mean it's zero, Francois, because things over time might commoditize. So we are always having some of this. I cannot quantify it, but it's actually quite small because the whole philosophy of NXP is to not compete on price.
Francois Bouvignies: Thank you. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question will come from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
C.J. Muse: Yes, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, Kurt, I was hoping you could spend a little time discussing the trends that you're seeing in China, whether there's any green shoots at all, whether it's NIO and BYD or Android or other? Would love to hear your thoughts?
Kurt Sievers: Yes. Thanks, C.J., I'm hesitating a little, because I wish I could say we see the rebound, which maybe everybody was hoping for. And bottom line is what -- I will give you a few more details, but we don't see a rebound. And that's also not contemplated in any of our numbers or remarks. Now in our specific case, I would maybe highlight two things. We have a strong feeling that at least in the Android space, the over inventory, which we might have had with our customers is worked down. So it looks like that our exposure to Android phones is now such that if there is a demand increase from the consumer side, we will immediately have it also in our numbers. No more inventory sitting there, which -- and that could be company specific. So I can only say that for NXP. At the same time, we don't see a massive pickup in Android. But I'm sure our peers which have much more exposure to the China handset market will provide more clarity in this during the next calls in the next couple of days. The other side is, indeed, in Automotive, we are nicely exposed to those electric car companies, which, in my view, will be the winners in China and maybe to an extent globally. I don't know to what extent they will be able to do this globally, but certainly in China, companies like BYD potentially going forward also NIO will grow share. And our exposure to them is very nice because they have a tendency to pick up newer products much faster than the Western car companies. So on average, we have a much newer part of our portfolio in those companies, which sits at higher ASPs, which is why we benefit from their success to a much higher rate than we would with competitors from the West, given the portfolio exposure we have. So that's a good thing. And they seem to be on a good road. So I dare to say that China electric automotive is in a good place. It's developing nicely. Finally, the much more hard-to-grasp consumer IoT world, which we are serving in China, we had nice sequential increase from Q1 into Q2. And when you look at our guidance into quarter three, which in Industrial IoT is again some sequential increase, that also comes from China consumer IoT. So it is gradually increasing. However, I wouldn't call it a rebound, and that goes back to the whole discussion we had earlier about when do we start to refill the channel? The signals we have currently are not strong enough to justify that. So it's still a very mixed picture, C.J.
C.J. Muse: Very helpful. As my follow-up, and I don't know if it's for Kurt or Bill, but Tier 2 foundry pricing has definitely weakened over the last few months. And just curious, are you seeing that potentially spread to the Tier 1s? And is that loosening up wafer pricing for you at all in any of your markets? Thank you.
Kurt Sievers: Yes. So I would confirm that Tier 2s have shown that behavior, absolutely. The trouble is it doesn't help us much, because most of our Tier 1 and Core Industrial and Automotive customers don't want product from these sources. So for a larger majority of our input costs that hasn't helped. Will it spread to the Tier 1 foundries? You go ask them, C.J. I don't know. I would be really stimulating here, which I can't. We don't have signs of that yet.
C.J. Muse: Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you.
Jeff Palmer: Hey Norma, we'll take one last question here today. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our final question will come from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Blayne Curtis: Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. Maybe I'll just start by following on C.J.'s question, because you mentioned higher input costs. So I think it sounds like you're not getting breaks in the foundries, but I'm curious if you could just quantify where you're seeing the most pressure from rising input costs, external versus internal? And when does that start to layer in?
Kurt Sievers: Blayne, that's not new. So we've had for probably two years in a row, a quite significant input cost increases. Of course, those are our own costs, but input costs from foundries, which for us is clearly the Tier 1 foundries, which are well-known companies. And there were even -- I think it was even public to what extent they have raised their price on us, as well as in our competitors. So that is the whole reason why we had continuously had to increase our price to our customers in order to offset that and protect our gross margin performance. When that's going to change Blayne again, I don't know, but it's a matter of fact that the Tier 2 foundries, they have already reduced prices in some cases, quite considerably, but it hasn't spread so far to any of the Tier 1s, and we also haven't -- we haven't really had indications that they would change.
Blayne Curtis: Great. And then I just want to ask you, Kurt, on lead times. You said a couple of times more normal ranges. I think if I remember right, last quarter, you still had a one-third that were greater than 52-weeks. So maybe just a little more color on what that more normal is, what your normal range is and all your products, for the most part, back into that normal range by that comment?
Kurt Sievers: Yes, most of the products are. The trouble is, and that's why I didn't give a number here -- well, not trouble is actually, it's a positive thing. A good part of our business sits under these MT&R contracts, where, by definition, we are all out for the year. So all of those products for those customers where we have these agreements, the lead time is 52-weeks by definition because the orders have been already placed for the full-year. But if you theoretically took this away and said it was -- that wasn't existing, then I'd say the largest part of NXP products have normal lead times. We have a very few remaining notes, one or two internally and one or two from third-party foundries where we are still in a severe shortage, which are very nasty because you know that each product which is missing to a customer is a big problem. But from a size perspective, if you measure it in dollars against our total revenue, this is very minimal in the meantime. And through the end of the year, it should have gone away completely.
Blayne Curtis: Thank you.
Kurt Sievers: All right. Then operator, I think I have to close the call here, and I want to thank you all for being on the call. In summary, our take is that we see clearly now that we left the trough of the consumer exposed businesses behind us in Q1, see good incremental growth from there sequentially, while Automotive, Homes Infra and Core Industrial continue to be very solid and that together lets us resume much more predictable growth going forward. And at the same time, we are confident to stick to our resilient margin pattern at the high end of our long-term guidance. With that, I want to thank you all and speak to you next. Thank you. Bye-bye.
Bill Betz: Thank you very much.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-05-02 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the NXP First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jeff Palmer. Please go ahead.
Jeff Palmer: Thank you, Latania, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to NXP Semiconductor's First Quarter Earnings Call. With me on the call today is Kurt Sievers, NXP's President and CEO; and Bill Betz, our CFO. The call today is being recorded and will be available for replay from our corporate website. Today's call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause NXP's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. These risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to statements regarding the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, the macroeconomic impact on specific end markets in which we operate, the sale of new and existing products and our expectations for the financial results for the second quarter of 2023. Please be reminded that NXP undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements. For a full disclosure of forward-looking statements, please refer to our press release. Additionally, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are driven primarily by discrete events that management does not consider to be directly related to NXP's underlying core operating performance. Pursuant to Regulation G, NXP has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our first quarter 2023 earnings press release, which will be furnished to the SEC on Form 8-K and available on NXP's website in the Investor Relations section at nxp.com. I would now like to turn the call over to Kurt.
Kurt Sievers: Thanks very much, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining our call today. I will start with a review of our quarter 1 results and then discuss our guidance for the second quarter. So let me begin with quarter 1. Our revenue was $121 million better than the midpoint of our guidance, with the trends in all the end market segments performing better than our expectations. Taken together, NXP delivered quarter 1 revenue of $3.12 billion, essentially flat year-on-year, while we continued to maintain our distribution channel inventory at a 1.6 months level, which is well below our long-term target. Non-GAAP operating margin in Q1 was 34.8%, 50 basis points above the midpoint of our guidance, so 90 basis points below the year-ago period. Year-on-year performance was a result of flattish revenue combined with better gross margin offset by higher operating expenses. Now let me turn to the specific trends in our focus end markets. In Automotive, quarter 1 revenue was $1.83 billion, up 17% versus the year ago period and above the midpoint of our guidance. In Industrial & IoT, quarter 1 revenue was $504 million, down 26% versus the year-ago period and near the high end of our guidance. In Mobile, quarter 1 revenue was $260 million, down 35% versus the year ago period and near the high end of our guidance. And finally, Communication Infrastructure and Other, quarter 1 revenue was $529 million, up 7% year-on-year and above the midpoint of our guidance. During that first quarter, after a slow start, we have seen modest incremental improvement in our China-exposed businesses, which are primarily served through the distribution channel. And this was particularly true for our Industrial & IoT and Mobile businesses. At the same time, we saw solid demand in our North American and European businesses across all market segments. Now I will turn to our expectations for the second quarter of 2023. We are guiding Q2 revenue to $3.2 billion. While this is down about 3% versus the year-ago period, it represents a sequential resumption of growth to about 3% at the midpoint. At the midpoint, we anticipate the following trends in our business. Automotive is expected to be up in the high single-digit percent range versus quarter 2 2022 and up in the low single-digit range versus quarter 1 2023. Industrial & IoT is expected to be down in the mid-20% range year-on-year and up in the high single-digit percent range versus quarter 1 2023. Mobile is expected to be down in the low 30% range year-on-year and to be flat on a sequential basis. And finally, Communication Infrastructure and Other is expected to be up about 10% year-on-year and up in the mid-single-digit range sequentially. In summary, as we progress through 2023, we do see a continued solid demand environment in our automotive, core industrial and communications infrastructure businesses, while our consumer, IoT and mobile businesses are stabilizing. We believe the severe shortages which we have experienced over the last 2 years should subside as we progress towards the end of this year, with now only about 1/3 of our portfolio with lead times greater than 52 weeks. This is down substantially from prior periods. However, we continue to still be supply constrained in several specific technology nodes, primarily for the automotive and core industrial segments. In addition, we are experiencing higher input costs. Hence, we continue to execute our consistent pricing policy, which is to pass along the cost increases to our customers while not padding our gross margin. Within Automotive, we see a combination of positive tailwinds continuing throughout the year. This includes the ongoing secular adoption of xEV drivetrains and ADAS as well as NXP-specific content and price increases. Third-party research firms anticipate a modest increase year-on-year of global car production, while at the same time we believe there are pockets of elevated inventory held at some select Tier 1 auto suppliers due to the golden screw issues which have plagued the extended auto supply chain. In Industrial & IoT, we expect relative strength in the core industrial submarkets as our products enable critical infrastructure and companies to be more efficient. However, while the consumer IoT business is stabilizing, a more significant growth will be dependent on a cyclical rebound, especially in China. In the Mobile segment, we continue to navigate through a sub-seasonal trough in the first half of this year. However, we do anticipate normal premium model releases in the second half to help resume growth. And lastly, in Communications, Infrastructure and Other, we are further improving our supply capability against growing secular demand, specifically in our RFID tagging solutions, and against pent-up demand for secure card solutions. On the other hand, our RF power business remains lumpy, and growth this year is limited to 5G build-outs in India. Our guidance for the second quarter contemplates that we maintain the 1.6 months channel inventory level. And yet, we may start increasing this level if and when we see consistent strength in channel sell-through into the second half of this year. And overall, we are very well positioned with on-hand inventory to satiate a possible rebound in demand as it emerges. In summary, the combination of our first quarter results, the guidance for the second quarter and our early views into the second half of the year leads us to believe that total revenue for the second half of the year will be greater than the first half. Despite our cautious optimism, we do acknowledge the ongoing uncertainty in the demand environment. Therefore, we will continue to be very disciplined and manage what is in our control and stay within our long-term financial model. And with that, I would like to pass the call over to you, Bill, for a review of our financial performance.
Bill Betz: Thank you, Kurt, and good morning to everyone on today's call. As Kurt has already covered the drivers of the revenue during Q1 and provided our revenue outlook for Q2, I will move to the financial highlights. Overall, our Q1 financial performance was very good. Revenue was above the high end of our guidance range, and both non-GAAP gross and operating profits were above the midpoint of the guidance. Now moving to the details of Q1. Total revenue was $3.12 billion, essentially flat year-on-year, while $121 million above the midpoint of the guidance range. We generated [Technical Difficulty].
Operator: [Operator Instructions] This is your operator and you are live.
Kurt Sievers: Great. Bill, why don't you continue? Sorry about that, folks.
Bill Betz: So let me start now moving to the details of Q1. Total revenue was $3.12 billion, essentially flat year-on-year, while $121 million above the midpoint of the guidance range. We generated $1.82 billion in non-GAAP gross profit and reported a non-GAAP gross margin of 58.2%, up 60 basis points year-on-year and 20 basis points above the midpoint of the guidance range. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $728 million or 23.3% of revenue, up $40 million year-on-year and up $15 million from Q4, modestly above the high end of the guidance range, driven by variable compensation and slightly higher R&D investments. From a total operating profit perspective, non-GAAP operating profit was $1.09 billion and non-GAAP operating margin was 34.8%, down 90 basis points year-on-year, though above the midpoint of the guidance range, reflecting solid fall-through on the increased revenue level versus the guide. Non-GAAP interest expense was $76 million, with non-GAAP income tax provision of $167 million, consistent with the high end of the guidance due to better profitability, reflecting a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 16.6%. Noncontrolling interest was $8 million and stock-based compensation, which is not included in the non-GAAP earnings, was $99 million. Taken together, this resulted in a non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.19, which is near the high end of our guidance range. Turning to the changes in our cash and debt. Total debt at the end of Q1 was $11.17 billion, flat sequentially. The ending cash position was $3.93 billion, up $85 million sequentially due to the cumulative effect of higher working capital, CapEx investments, capital returns and cash generation during Q1. The resulting net debt was $7.24 billion and we exited the quarter with a trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA of $5.46 billion. The ratio of net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of Q1 was 1.3x and the 12-month adjusted EBITDA interest coverage was 16.4x. During Q1, we paid $219 million in cash dividends, which represented 35% of cash flow from operations. Due to the uncertain macro environment and the recent liquidity issues in the regional banking sector, we paused our share repurchases during Q1. However, we plan to resume buybacks in Q2 and our capital allocation strategy has not changed. We plan to return 100% of excess free cash flow back to the owners of the company. Turning to working capital metrics. Days of inventory was 135 days, an increase of 19 days sequentially, and distribution channel inventory was 1.6 months or 49 days. When combined, this represents approximately 184 days. As mentioned during the last earnings call, our inventory strategy is to manage both on hand and channel inventory together to better serve our customers and prevent excess finished goods inventory on our balance sheet and/or in the distribution channel. Our goal is to only ship products into the distribution channel that have a high likelihood of selling through in the current quarter or of being pre-staged if needed for customer delivery in the next quarter. From an internal standpoint, we are comfortable supporting approximately 140 days of inventory on the balance sheet, so long as we hold the channel at 1.6 months or 49 days. As the channel inventory returns to the long-term target of 2.5 months or 75 days, we would correspondingly lower our balance sheet inventory. In Q1, the inventory flexibility on the balance sheet enabled us to deliver an extra $120 million of revenue by leveraging the die bank inventory on hand. Moving on to days receivables. It was 31 days, up 5 days sequentially. Days payable were 68 days, a sequential decrease of 9 days due to the timing of material receipts. Please note, beginning in Q1, we reclassified certain payables amounts to other current liabilities to better reflect true payable trends. Taken together, the cash conversion cycle was 98 days, an increase of 33 days versus the prior quarter as we leveraged the balance sheet to avoid overshipping into the channel. Cash flow from operations was $632 million and net CapEx was $251 million, resulting in non-GAAP free cash flow of $381 million or 12% of revenue. The reduction in free cash flow quarter-on-quarter is primarily due to increased working capital needs as previously noted. Our long-term target has not changed and we are focused on driving non-GAAP free cash flow margin to greater than 25%, a level we demonstrated in the second half of 2022. Turning now to our expectations for the second quarter. As Kurt mentioned, we anticipate Q2 revenue to be $3.2 billion, plus or minus $100 million. Furthermore, given our manufacturing cycle times and the current demand environment, our guidance contemplates maintaining channel inventory at a 1.6-month level, though we may move this upward pending improved market conditions. At the midpoint of our revenue outlook, this is down [ 3% ] year-on-year and up 3% versus Q1. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be flat sequentially at 58.2%, plus or minus 50 basis points. Operating expenses are expected to be $760 million, plus or minus about $10 million, reflecting annual merit increases. Taken together, non-GAAP operating margin will be 34.5% at the midpoint. We expect non-GAAP financial expense to be $69 million and the non-GAAP tax rate to be 16.5% of profit before tax. Noncontrolling interest will be $7 million. For Q2, we suggest for modeling purposes you use an average share count of 261.2 million shares and a CapEx rate of 8% of revenue. Taken together at the midpoint, this implies a non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.28. In closing, I would like to highlight the key themes for this earnings cycle. First, we will continue to manage our inventory as a combination of internal and channel inventory. This enables us to better serve our customers' requirements, prevent excess inventory buildup in the channel and supports our outlook for the second half revenue of 2023 to be greater than the first half. Second, the Q2 guidance contemplates internal factory utilization to be in the mid-70s range, which is modestly down from the low 80s in Q1. We believe operating our factories at a more reasonable utilization level enables better flexibility and improved throughput. Despite the lower utilization level, we anticipate our gross margin to remain at the high end of our long-term model for the remainder of 2023, driven by improved product mix. Thirdly, we are holding more cash on the balance sheet to enable greater flexibility. This includes options around the timing and magnitude of share repurchases, cash dividends or the ability to retire debt early, as well as any small tuck-in acquisitions, all of which can be funded with cash on hand. Finally, we will continue to be very disciplined to manage what is in our control and stay within our long-term financial model. I would like to now turn it back to the operator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from C.J. Muse of Evercore.
Christopher Muse: I guess first question, I was hoping you could speak to perhaps pricing tailwinds in 2023. You told us in January that you saw a 14% increase for the overall business. And obviously, you're not going to update each quarter, I get that. But just curious, embedded in your outlook for a stronger second half versus first half, how are you thinking about the impact of higher pricing as it relates to your higher input costs? And is that something that is broad-based across all segments, or is that something that we should be thinking about to just specific segments?
Kurt Sievers: Thanks, C.J. So no, we don't see headwinds from pricing throughout this year. I would actually indeed say it's probably on the other side of that, since we continue to experience growing input cost, and we stay absolutely rock solid with our pricing policy, which has been and continues to be to pass on all of the increased input cost in order to keep our gross margin percentage protected. So from that perspective, there will continue to be price increases this year. So no headwinds here. It's actually a tailwind. And yes, we will only detail out how big that tailwind is going to be by early next year, so just like we did this year and the year before. Now when you think across the segments -- I think that was the second half of your question, how does it go into the different segments, I would say directionally, this is pretty simple and straightforward. It is a function of supply and demand, and the -- say, the supply shortages, as I think I mentioned in my prepared remarks, are most persistent in automotive and core industrial. So those are then also the 2 segments where the pricing sees the biggest tailwind continued into this year or throughout this year. In general, it's also important to note, C.J., that a large part of our business is actually anchored on annual price negotiations, which is anyway an annual price for the whole year where we don't touch that through the year. So in short, no headwind from pricing. What is contemplated in what we said about the second half being larger than the first half in terms of revenue in this year is based also on continued price increases.
Christopher Muse: Very helpful. As my quick follow-up, your OEM sales grew to 51% of total sales versus 45% a year ago. Is that simply a function of kind of mix shift to auto/industrial, or is this a permanent shift that we should be thinking about for NXP?
Kurt Sievers: No, that was actually a function of the weakness of China in Q1. As we spoke on the last call, we had the significant weakness to start within the quarter 1 in China. China is largely distribution for us and a large part of our China business is then again with the industrial IoT and also automotive business. And this is why the distribution part of the business came out so much weaker relatively speaking through the first quarter. So no, this is not going to be a permanent thing, but it has been a direct impact and consequence of this Q1 weakness in China.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question will come from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore: I wanted to just talk about the Auto segment. Kurt, you just mentioned about still some shortages there. It's great to see significant upside in everything other than Auto. Can you just talk about a little bit of what you're seeing on the demand side in Auto? Is it really just supply limited? Is that the reason that it was a great quarter, but didn't upside as much as the others? Just some puts and takes on end demand versus supply, please?
Kurt Sievers: Yes. Thanks, Ross. Well, I actually felt Q1 in Auto was a great quarter. I think we did 17% year-on-year growth, which is above the high end of our long-term revenue growth guidance. Indeed, the upside in Q1 in Auto was all gated by supply capability. That's indeed a matter of fact. Going forward, the remaining shortages which we see across the company are largely in automotive, a little bit also in core industrial, but the more material part of the shortages indeed continues to be in automotive, such that through the year, I would say the growth is really sitting on the drivers which we have discussed before. It is continued content increases, which follows the xEV penetration and ADAS penetration. I'm pretty damn sure that NXP continues to gain share in automotive. It is pricing as I talked to C.J. earlier, which is in automotive quite vivid. And going forward, I hope that the supply/demand situation, Ross, will normalize through the second half of this year, including automotive.
Ross Seymore: That's a perfect segue to my second question and that's on the utilization rate and the inventory. I was a little surprised that the inventory kind of did what you guys expected it to despite revenues beating so nicely. And then you're talking about taking utilization down while you're simultaneously sounding significantly more optimistic about the demand conditions, your ability to grow half over half, et cetera. Can you help us reconcile how the utilization/inventory versus conservatism versus more optimism on demand balance out?
Bill Betz: Sure, Ross. Let me take that. So our utilizations, as mentioned, are running now in the mid-70s versus, again, last quarter, low 80s, and then they were in the 90s in Q4 and high 90s. And we think the sweet spot is around probably 80% to 85%. We're a bit below that at the moment as we're trying to make sure we have rebuilt several of our buffer areas where we get inventory or produce inventory internally. So we have that all in strategic die bank form and ready to take on any new orders within the quarter and service them in that period. Related to our inventory, let me just help bridge that a bit. Again, we're holding about -- we're comfortable holding about 140 days. We're at 135 today. And if you think about it, we have 25 days we're holding where we could actually put it into the channel if we decide to do so, but we're not. We're being very cautious here. We're only looking at when product sells through and when the market improves. So again, that's about 25 days off of that 135 or off that 140 days. Then we have another 10 days, I would say, internally, which we call our strategic inventory as we continue to align our internal factories. The CapEx that we're spending today is around 8%, and 75% of that CapEx is linked to our internal factories as we get them really focused on our IP proprietary technology. And finally, to be honest with you, we like to hold another 10 days to be able to service the customer upside orders within the quarter, and we feel comfortable with that versus the 95-day target that we set out during Analyst Day. So I think the way to think about inventory, our internal inventory, we'll probably work it down throughout 2023. By running our front-end internal utilizations in the mid-70s, we'll continue to adjust some of our foundry purchase orders and obviously servicing the higher revenue, and Kurt commented that the second half of 2023 will be larger than the first half.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question will come from Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein Research.
Stacy Rasgon: I also wanted to ask about Auto. So I know you're talking about shortages still, but you also mentioned pockets of inventory out in the channel. I think this is the first time I've actually heard you directly mention auto build-outs in the channel. Could you give us a little more color on that? What kind of products -- how much of your revenue was in those categories? And are you seeing any pause in those areas given where those inventory levels are?
Kurt Sievers: Stacy, no, the way you phrased it now sounds much, much larger than what I tried to describe. What we do see is a very few select Tier 1s -- it's not about OEMs, it's about the Tier 1 suppliers. It's pockets of inventory on those products which were suffering as a surplus from the golden screw problem. You remember that over the past 2 years we consistently had those situations where 1 part was missing, other parts were available. And then those parts were piling up a bit more before they got flushed through when the missing part came on. And from that period, there seem to be a few pockets, but it's not structural that I could say it's certain products or a certain amount. But there seem to be a few products at a few select Tier 1s which see somewhat elevated inventory. Now at the same time, there is now more and more of a discussion in the industry about the target size of inventory which the Tier 1 should hold. And from what I'm witnessing is that the automotive OEMs, so the car companies, are actually quite diligent in asking for elevated inventory levels to the Tier 1s anyway going forward. So now we have to figure out to what extent actually maybe these elevated pockets which I talked about are actually used to just satisfy what is being needed going forward anyway in terms of somewhat elevated inventory levels for safety reasons -- for supply chain safety reasons in the industry. So it's a little bit, Stacy, a very few customers. So nothing dramatic. I mean I just mentioned this because we talk about the SAAR growing by, I think, close to 4% this year, and I just wanted to put it in balance because there might be a tiny little bit of a headwind from those inventory levels. But all of that, just to be very clear, will not hinder the automotive business this year to grow and actually to grow substantially year-on-year.
Stacy Rasgon: Got it. That's helpful. For my follow-up, I wanted to ask about China. So it does sound like you worked through the China disti issues that you had mentioned on last quarter's calls. Would you characterize this as a China recovery? Are you actually seeing recovery, or is it maybe a little too early to jump that far? Is it more just like little green shoots? Or like what exactly are you seeing in China relative to what you were seeing last quarter?
Kurt Sievers: Yes. Yes, Stacy. I think it's too early to make such a statement. We've seen a modest, gradual improvement throughout the first quarter from a very slow start, I mean, through Chinese New Year and these elevated infection levels in the first few weeks. It just came modestly up. I would clearly not say, and none of our forecast and guidance comments we are making today would be based on that, I would clearly not see a sharp rebound. We don't see this. And again, our numbers are also not based on that. But by the way, Stacy, just also connecting this to your first question, mind you that our automotive business is also 40% in distribution. So when I talk about these pockets of inventory, they are in the 60% of the automotive business which goes through direct. But another large chunk is actually the 40% through distribution and that is controlled through what Bill explained earlier through our disciplined channel management at 1.6 months. I mean just to put it in perspective.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Vivek Arya, Bank of America Securities.
Vivek Arya: My first one, Kurt, is about half-over-half growth because you mentioned it in your remarks. So if I exclude 2020, second-half sales for NXP have grown at least around 5% to 6% half-on-half. Is that the kind of expectation we should have about second half? And what do you think is driving that? Is it just seasonality? Is it China coming back? Is it pricing increasing half-on-half? Just if you could help us set the models in the right place on a conceptual basis about what kind of expectation. And more importantly, what is driving that growth in the second half?
Kurt Sievers: So Vivek, I need to disappoint you a little. I will not size it here. You know that we only guide the next quarter. Yet, I want to give you a few -- maybe a few anchor points. Clearly, the seasonality in Mobile, with the premium models ramping in the second half, will support that growth of half 2 over half 1. I mean that's one element. The other element I would mention here is indeed increasing supply capability, and it is clearly in auto and core industrial as we discussed earlier. But it is also in Comms Infra. Within the Comms Infra segments, we have this RFID tagging and secure card business, which continues to benefit this year massively from finally supply becoming available. We had actually de-prioritized the business through the past 2 years. And now we can finally serve that secular demand in RFID and quite a bit of pent-up demand in the secure cards business. So that together with the Mobile seasonality will drive the half 2 over half 1 growth.
Vivek Arya: Got it. And then just one more on automotive and then just the state of play. When we look at the end market, right, we see a premium U.S. EV maker cutting prices, we hear of sluggish demand in China. So how should we reconcile all those end market data points, Kurt, that are a lot more cautious and conservative because of macro factors versus the strength that you and your peers are reporting when it comes to automotive semiconductor demand?
Kurt Sievers: Well, it really goes back to content increase in the first place. And the latest data I have about xEVs, which is one of the two main drivers for a content increase, is that the number of xEVs in absolute terms globally this year will grow like 34% over last year and it will then hit the 34% portion of the total SAAR. So 34% or just a bit more than 1/3 of the total SAAR this year will be hybrid or fully electric. I mean this is a massive move. And by the way, yes, there are shifts. Clearly, there is a wave of success of local Chinese OEMs. You might have seen that some of the Western companies are losing ground with electric vehicle sales in China against local companies. Now we are perfectly hedged. So we are just as exposed to the Chinese OEMs as we are to the Western ones. So content increase is the main move. There is still also a forecast for an overall SAAR growth. I think the latest number I had seen from S&P was, I think, 85 million or 86 million, so somewhere in that neighborhood, which is a growth of about 4% over last year. So even the underlying SAAR, if you take it all together, xEVs and combustion-engine cars, is also growing. And that's actually the reason why this business keeps going, Vivek. So I don't find it that surprising.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question will come from Matt Ramsay of TD Cowen.
Matthew Ramsay: Kurt, I wanted to revisit quickly the question of pricing. And you were very clear on your comments, particularly in the auto business, to what pricing will do for -- or you expect it to do for the remainder of the year. But I think though -- the question I get a lot is, eventually, when we get a point when lead times stabilize, input costs stabilize and maybe come down a little bit, how are you thinking about long-term pricing in your auto business? Are we going back to the normal price-downs from a much, much higher base and a lot of these input cost increases you view as permanent? There's a little bit of an angst in the system, I think, that what goes up must come down. And I just wondered if you could address some of that, please.
Kurt Sievers: Yes. So on the pricing, especially in Auto, or I would actually extend this question to all those areas where we've had the most significant shortages, it is important to understand where the price increases came from in the first place. They came from a structural, significant CapEx investment in order to cater for new capacity in mature nodes. So most of that is in the 16 to 180-nanometer area. And a lot of CapEx has been spent but continues to be spent also through the next few years, and the depreciation of that additional capacity which became necessary, as we all painfully witnessed over the last years, the depreciation of that is going to sit on all of these products across the industry. So my estimate here is that, yes, pricing will, of course, plateau at some point. And then maybe when supply and demand will have normalized, we will go back to what we had before this situation, which was a small, single-digit ASP erosion year-over-year. But that is not falling back to the old price levels. It is from the new level, which we have achieved in over 3 years of sequential price increases.
Matthew Ramsay: Very clear. Bill, for my follow-up, I wanted to ask about inventory levels. I've kind of made the observation that oftentimes your channel inventory being below the long-term target, and then the on-books inventory may be increasing. Those get discussed kind of in isolation. And I wonder if you could talk a little bit about it holistically, just that, roughly speaking, the inventory days of full NXP inventory are roughly flat, just more on books than in channel, and gives you a bit more flexibility. And I guess the long-term question is, what's the real incentive to go back to the old mix? Why not just keep the ratios relatively close to where they are today given the flexibility it gives you?
Bill Betz: Yes. The whole idea of managing the channel is really through understanding real demand in the market. And at the end of the day, what you want to do is put inventory on the shelf that's going to fast turn versus if you put inventory on the shelf, it stays there, then eventually has to get discounted, it uses real good real estate and so forth. So what we want to do is making sure we are only shipping product into the channel that is fast turning, is the way to think about it. And you're right, the way you think about it is the same way we do. We combine both and basically hold the same amount of inventory combined, and we're just trying this new strategy -- actually, we changed the strategy from lessons we've learned in the past, because at the end of the day it's all about real demand.
Kurt Sievers: And let me add, Bill. I think we will enter this now possibly relatively soon, as we emphasized in our prepared remarks, as soon as we see a more consistent uptick in the sell-through trends in the channel, we will increase from the 1.6 months levels. And mind you, we speak about the $500 million delta when we would go from 1.6 to 2.4 or 2.5 months. And again, we are having the intention to fill back to that level, but again, in line with industry demand coming back. But those $500 million, we basically have that and we will get it into the channel as soon as the demand is coming. In the end, that will be required to make sure we can gain market share through distribution the moment the industry ticks up.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question will come from Gary Mobley of Wells Fargo.
Gary Mobley: I presume that your backlog continues to trend down, but I was hoping that you can give us an update on where you stand today with weeks of backlog, the durability of that backlog and whether or not you're still sold out in automotive based on your available supply - sold out through the remainder of the year, I should add.
Kurt Sievers: Gary. So no, we never talked about the size of the backlog because I really try to be sure you all understand that we consider that backlog number misleading and that it's been misleading since the beginning of the supply chain situation because, sure, we, and I guess everybody else, has had double and triple orders in there. So I felt it never made sense to speak about the backlog -- the size of that backlog as a metric to get a feel for future growth. So that's why, no, we will not speak about the backlog. What however comes back to what I think you're asking for is in Automotive, the NCNR orders. So yes, the largest part of our automotive business has been and continues to be covered by NCNR orders for this year. The size of that NCNR order backlog has not changed at all. We also cannot ship more. I mean, it is what it is. And there is always mix changes from left to right and stuff, but the size of it is the same it has been before, and we just execute it down.
Gary Mobley: And a follow-up, I want to ask about changing behavior following a 3-year period of supply chain shortages in the automotive end market. And so under the idea that the automotive OEMs have learned a lesson and will work more collaboratively with chip companies like yourself, perhaps the big get bigger. And perhaps you can expand further your market share lead by collaborating more closely with these Automotive OEMs. Is there a way to quantify or qualify the impact to that and whether or not that has any validity?
Kurt Sievers: I think you have a really good point here. Very clearly, the rate of collaboration and also the depth and intensity of collaboration from logistics all the way to innovation and new design wins has significantly jumped up between us and the auto OEMs. That indeed also leads to direct deals, which we are cutting with these companies on a very long-term basis, where the principle is often that we give supply assurance against a very long-term demand assurance from the OEMs. And yes, I believe there is a bit of a winner-takes-it-all game here because if I put myself into the shoes of the OEMs, they cannot play with 6 or 8 different semiconductor companies. They will focus down on a few select leaders, and you can be sure NXP is one of them.
Operator: And our next question will come from Blayne Curtis of Barclays.
Blayne Curtis: Bill, I wanted to just double click on the gross margins. It's actually kind of quite impressive that your utilization is down that much and it's flat. So maybe just walk us through the pieces again. Obviously, mix per segment, I wasn't sure if auto is accretive to that mix. I think Mobile going down probably helps. But I also kind of wanted to understand your external loadings that you kind of mentioned that you might selectively bring that down. If you can comment on that as well.
Bill Betz: Sure. Let me -- the major drivers is first, again, we expect favorable product mix. What we see, obviously, and what we're building to is favorable, and we see that in our forecasts. Then it's clearly being driven by the customer orders we are serving. And then we talked about this new product introduction. We're starting to see some of that. But again, longer term, that will kick in a couple of years out to continue that richer mix for the company. Now second, you have to remember our fixed variable cost structure, which is approximately 30% fixed and 70% variable, and this has significantly improved versus the last down cycle and over the last decade. And then finally, we are realigning our internal factories. And you have to remember, we service about 40% of our wafers, which 2/3 of our internal factories support Auto and Industrial IT proprietary technologies, versus the past, we would build bulk CMOS and so forth, which would disturb the utilizations of our factories. So think about the equipment that we're putting in, very sticky, very specific to our core IT technologies that service basically auto and industrial, the 2 fastest growth markets over the next decade that we're going to serve.
Blayne Curtis: Got you. And then I wanted to ask you on the Comms segment. I think Kurt mentioned RFID being the big driver for the year. But is that the same driver for the strength you're seeing in March and June off the bottom?
Kurt Sievers: Yes. It is RFID and secure cards which are really leading here from a growth perspective. That doesn't mean that the other stuff is not growing, but say the incremental additional growth really comes from supply into RFID and secure cards. But again, the difference between the two is that in RFID, it's really secular growth, which we've been working towards for many, many years and now a lot of these projects are unfolding, whereas in the secure cards, it's somewhat more pent-up demand, which will [ saturate ] at some point. But the lion's share is RFID.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question will come from William Stein of Truist.
William Stein: Congrats on the very good results and good outlook. The results came better than you expected, and I want to make sure I understand, I think at the beginning of the call, you said that the primary driver was an improvement in China. Is that correct? And I'm trying to reconcile this with the idea that distribution was down as a percent of sales, because I thought most of what goes on in China for you guys is through the channel. Is it just the expectations in the channel and in China were so low you still came in low, but that's what improved through the quarter? Am I getting that right?
Kurt Sievers: Yes. So I'd say one part of it is China, where indeed it was less bad than feared in Mobile and Industrial & IoT. That's, I think, pretty much what you said. We took a cautious stance here because we had a really slow start in the beginning of the quarter. And then gradually, it improved a bit more than what we were fearing it would. However, the other side is more supply, which came into Auto and Comms Infra. So Comms Infra, as I just explained to Blayne. And then also in Auto on a more broad-based, that also helped the outperformance. At the same time, it's really important to see here that this $121 million more revenue we did, did not move the channel MOS up an inch. So that was really true good revenue, all the $121 million. But yes, a part of it in China was a, say, a better performance than we were fearing how China's demand would develop.
William Stein: I'd like to follow up with giving you an opportunity to talk about some of the growth drivers that I don't think have been as prominent in this call as in the past. Any highlights in terms of adoption of some of these new technologies? In Autos, you've talked about high-def radar, domain and zonal controllers, and you've talked about ultra-wideband in a couple of different end markets. Maybe highlight some of the more significant content drivers in the near term and longer term.
Kurt Sievers: I think in radar, and I think it's also in our press release, we are very proud we launched now the industry's first 28-nanometer based 1-chip radar for Automotive, which is moving in production now, which is great progress. I think the -- this one market research company which covers automotive radar, Yole, clearly presented us now as the #1 in automotive radar in -- for last year. So the numbers are out. So now this whole thing is who is leading in Automotive radar is clear now, it's documented, we are #1. Then today we had a very nice press release together with NIO, which is one of the smart electric car startups between California and China, which is using our 4D imaging radar, which is the high end of radar, which is a 300-millimeter -- sorry, 300-meter distance measurement including object classification. And Bill, I remember you and I are speaking about this years ago as a dream in innovation. Now the thing is out and it sits in these NIO cars. Then moving to electrification, I think earlier in the call, I mentioned the growing strength of China OEMs when it comes to electric cars. That is very good for our battery management business because we have a strong bias to winning designs in China. So that's fast-turning business, fast-turning means for automotive standards they go pretty quickly from design into production, helps a lot our BMS/electrification business. Last but not least, you -- I think you mentioned ultra-wideband. Ultra-wideband is a mixed picture though. The Android adoption continues in the ecosystem to be slower than we had anticipated. So that's a little -- I think we said this on the last call already, it's a little later. That doesn't mean it doesn't happen, but it's a little later, while the automotive side of ultra-wideband is actually picking up the pace now enormously. So we see very, very nice growth on the ultra-wideband side in cars, where we also haven't seen a single competitor yet. So it's really an NXP-only story.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question will come from Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs.
Toshiya Hari: I wanted to follow up on China. Kurt, you talked about a modest recovery in the region. I was hoping you could speak to linearity in the quarter from a either bookings or revenue recognition perspective? And then, I guess, more importantly, when you guys talk about the second half recovery in your overall business, the second half being higher than the first half, does that contemplate an increase in channel inventory from 1.6 months to something above 2? Or do you have visibility in half-over-half growth without any increase in channel inventory?
Kurt Sievers: Yes, Toshi. So on the first half of your question, we will not provide any within segment -- within quarter details. So it has gradually improved through the quarter. I mean, let's leave it here. The second half of your question is really, really important. The answer is no. Our Q2 guide of $3.2 billion does not need or comprehend any increase of our internal inventory. So to be very specific, it sits again on 1.6 months of channel inventory. However, we will take the liberty to increase the channel inventory if and when we see a trend that the sell-through goes strong into the third quarter in order to prepare for that uptick. But then we will also make more than $3.2 billion revenue. So the $3.2 billion which are in the guidance are connected with 1.6 months. We might still go higher, but then we will also print the higher revenue.
Toshiya Hari: Understood. And then as my follow-up, I just wanted to clarify on lead times. You mentioned that in Q1, I think roughly 1/3 of your product had lead times of 52 weeks or longer. Where do you expect that number to be exiting the year? And I was hoping you could speak to average lead times for your portfolio as well, what your target is, I guess, coming out of this pandemic?
Kurt Sievers: Yes. This is a -- it's a tricky question because the lead times are a function of the amount of NCNR orders we have. I spoke earlier about the fact that our Automotive business, which is the lead example for this, is largely covered by NCNR orders. And that simply means that whole product portfolio for these customers, if they now ask for an additional order, of course they get only a confirmation for next year because it's already ordered out. So I mean, the way you've got to think about this is if all of our business was covered by NCNR orders, all of our business would have 52 weeks lead time. Now we don't have that. It's only a part of it. But that's why as long as we stick to the concept of annual -- they are based on calendar years -- annual NCNR orders, we will have a sizable part of our portfolio sitting on 52-plus weeks lead time. It's just a consequence of the NCNR orders. So that's why, to answer your question, it depends if again for calendar 2024 we will enter into the concept of NCNR orders. If we do that, and by the way, I expect that we will do that, we will have still a sizable part of the portfolio with lead times above 52 weeks, too. Now operator, I think we've got to terminate the call here. We are at the top of the hour. So I just want to thank you all for your attention through today's call. I trust you felt that we are at a pivotal point in navigating through this cycle, where we see that we are successfully navigating the consumer-oriented weakness in our business and seeing a change in slope of that business, while the Core Industrial, Automotive and also large parts of Comm. Infra. continue to be resilient and strong. And then if we put all of these pieces together, that leads us then to what we said today, which is the second half of this year revenue being above the first half, and now also a guidance into the second quarter where each of our 4 segments is actually sequentially growing. And with that, I want to thank you all for your attention. Thank you.
Jeff Palmer: Thank you, everyone, and this will conclude our call for today. Thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, you may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-01-31 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello. Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the NXP Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the prepared remarks', we will conduct the question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jeff Palmer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Jeff Palmer: Thank you, Michelle, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to NXP's fourth quarter and full year 2022 Earnings Call. With me on the call today is Kurt Sievers, NXP's President and CEO; and Bill Betz, our CFO. The call today is being recorded and will be available for replay from our corporate website. Today's call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause NXP's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, the macroeconomic impact on the specific end markets in which we operate, the sale of new and existing products and our expectations for the financial results for the first quarter of 2023. Please be reminded that NXP undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements. For a full disclosure on forward-looking statements, please refer to our press release. Additionally, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are driven primarily by discrete events that management does not consider to be directly related to NXP's underlying core operating performance. Pursuant to Regulation G, NXP has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our fourth quarter 2022 earnings press release, which will be furnished to the SEC on Form 8-K and available from NXP's website in the Investor Relations section at nxp.com. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Kurt.
Kurt Sievers: Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. We really appreciate you joining our call this morning. I will review both our quarter four and our full year 2022 performance, and then I will discuss our guidance for quarter one. Beginning with quarter four, our revenue was $12 million better than the midpoint of our guidance with the trends in the mobile and industrial and IoT markets performing better than our expectations, while Automotive was in line and Communication Infrastructure below our expectations. Taken together, NXP delivered quarter four revenue of $3.31 billion, an increase of 9% year-on-year while maintaining channel inventory at a 1.6 months level, well below our long-term target. Non-GAAP operating margin in quarter four was a strong 36.5%, 160 basis points better than the year ago period and about 50 basis points above the midpoint of our guidance. Year-on-year outperformance was a result of good fall through on the higher revenue, better gross margin due to higher factory utilization and disciplined expense management. Now let me turn to the full year performance. Revenue was a record $13.21 billion, an increase of 19% year-on-year. When passing the revenue growth, approximately 14% was due to higher pricing - and was due to a combination of volume and mix. And here, as a reminder, we have executed a consistent pricing policy to pass along the inflationary increases of our input costs while not patting our gross margin. Throughout 2022, we consistently found ourselves in a situation where robust demand across automotive and core industrial markets, outstripped available supply even as production levels, both internally and from our supplier partners improved through the year. And now we do see a continuation of input cost inflation in 2023, however, not at the same pace and level we experienced in 2022. The full year non-GAAP operating margin was solid 36.3%, a 340 basis point improvement versus the year ago period as a result of higher revenue, improved factory loadings and positive operating leverage. Now let me move to the specific trends in our focus end markets. First, Automotive. Full year revenue was $6.88 billion, up 25% year-on-year, a reflection of higher pricing, our strong company-specific product drivers and accelerated content increases, thanks to the secular growth in sales of xEV vehicles and prioritization by OEMs of premium class vehicles in a limited supply environment. For the fourth quarter, Automotive revenue was $1.81 billion, up 17% versus the year ago period and in line with our guidance. Now moving to Industrial and IoT. Full year revenue was $2.71 billion, up 13% year-on-year, primarily due to higher pricing and the strong competitive positioning of our solution offering comprising industrial processes and about [ph] cash connectivity and security. For the fourth quarter, Industrial and IoT revenue was $605 billion, down 8% versus the year ago period, so better than our guidance. Mobile. Full year revenue was $1.61 billion, up 14% year-on-year, primarily due to higher pricing and continued traction of our secure mobile wallet. For quarter four, Mobile revenue was $408 million, up 9% versus the year ago period and better than our guidance. Lastly, Communication Infrastructure and Other. Full year revenue was $2 billion, up 15% year-on-year. The year-on-year growth was due to higher pricing and a combination of sales growth of network processors, RFID tech solutions, secured transit and access products and RF power products for the cellular base station markets. For quarter four, Communication Infrastructure and Other revenue was $494 million, up 8% year-on-year and below our guidance. Now as discussed earlier, I also would like to provide you a progress update on our accelerated growth drivers. At our Analyst Day in November '21, we highlighted our expectation to grow total company revenue to approximately $15 billion in 2024, coming from $11 billion in 2021 within a compound annual growth range of 8% to 12% over that period. Embedded within this outlook, we highlighted six company-specific revenue drivers across all our served end markets, which we anticipated to grow in aggregates to about $6 billion in '24 from a $3 billion level in '21, representing about a 25% 3 year compound annual growth range. Additionally, we shared with you that our high relative market share for business would grow to $9 billion in '24 from $8 billion in '21, reflecting about a 5% 3 year compound annual growth range. Overall, we are confident to achieve the anticipated growth rates for both our accelerated growth drivers as well as our high relative market share core business. Moving to the segments. Within Automotive, the accelerated growth drivers are 77 gigahertz radar, electrification and the S32 domain and solar processes, all of which are tracking ahead of plan. According to market research company, Yole, NXP is confirmed as the clear number one revenue market leader in automotive radar solutions, as well as individually in radar RF transceivers and radar processes. Furthermore, we just announced the industry's first 28-nanometer RF CMOS radar one-chip IC family for the next-generation ADAS and autonomous driving systems. Turning to our efforts in electrification. Our sales, including battery management solutions, inverter control and other xEV control processes has doubled year-on-year and achieved record custom design wins. Finally, within Automotive, the customer enthusiasm for this S32 domain and sonar processor family, enabling the software-defined vehicle, are far in excess of our expectations. This includes the awards by a major automotive OEM, which selected the S32 family of automotive processes and microcontrollers to be used across its fleet of future vehicles beginning mid-decade. Moving to Industrial and IoT. We are in line with our expected growth range of about 25% 3 year CAGR for our accelerated growth drivers. Both our crossover and i.MX application processor families grew nearly 50% year-on-year in 2022. However, we did see a deceleration in revenue in the consumer IoT portion of the end markets during the second half of 2022. Finally, we announced our new MCX microcontroller portfolio that is scalable, optimized foundation for energy-efficient industrial and IoT edge applications, addressing the heavy real-time workloads for the next wave of innovation. In addition, we recently announced our new analog front-end family for high-precision data acquisition and condition monitoring systems for factory automation. Moving to Mobile. We are below our expected revenue growth range for the accelerated growth driver of ultra-wideband due to the well-documented weakness in the Android handset market, which is the focused mobile market for our ultra-wideband solutions. However, for ultra-widebands, the ecosystem build-out and design win activity and traction in both Mobile and Auto are going well. And we believe as the Android market rebounds, awarded design wins will result in the expected revenue growth for ultra-widebands. Lastly, within Communications and Infrastructure, we are in line with our expected revenue growth range for RF power amplifiers. The industry transition to gallium nitride from LDMOS technology has occurred faster than expected. The revenue for our gallium nitride-based solutions has doubled year-on-year and demand continues to outstrip our increasing supply capability. In review, 2022 was a very good year for NXP, with strong execution resulting in record revenue, solid profit growth and a healthy free cash flow generation. Additionally, we experienced unprecedented year-on-year design win traction across the entire portfolio. Now let me turn to our expectations for quarter one, 2023. We are guiding quarter one revenue to $3 billion, down about 4% versus the first quarter of '22. From a sequential perspective, this represents a deceleration of about 9% at the midpoint versus the prior quarter. At the midpoint, we anticipate the following trends in our business. Automotive is expected to be up in the mid-teens percent range versus quarter one '22 and flat versus quarter four '22. Industrial and IoT is expected to be down in the low 30% range year-on-year and down in the low 20% range versus quarter four '22. Mobile is expected to be down about in the mid-40% range, both on a year-on-year and sequential basis. Finally, Communication Infrastructure and Other is expected to be about flat, both on a year-on-year and sequentially. In summary, as we head into 2023, our Automotive and Core Industrial businesses remain supply constraints in select areas. Within Automotive, the increase of global production levels and the secular adoption of xEV are tailwinds to continued content increases. In Industrial and IoT, we expect relative strength in the core industrial submarkets as our products enable critical infrastructure and companies to be more efficient. However, the Consumer IoT and the Mobile segment will continue to be dependent on a cyclical rebound. And lastly, in Communications Infrastructure, we expect our supply capability to improve against pent-up demand, specifically in our RFID packing solutions, secure access products and e-government identification. Within the 5G base station markets, growth in '23 will be dependent on the build-out, especially in India. At the same time, we do believe from an external macro perspective, the general demand environment is offering much higher levels of uncertainty than last year. And in the very short term, we are expecting a dip in China due to the spike in infection rates following the policy shift relating to COVID. Additionally, we expect continued cyclical weakness in demand for consumer-oriented products and a potential correction of customer inventory. In this more uncertain demand environment, we will focus on prudently managing what is in our control. And especially while we have plenty of orders, we will continue to very vigilantly manage general inventory to a 1.6 months level, which is about a month’s below our long-term target, equaling approximately $500 million of revenue. We intend to maintain that 1.6 months channel inventory in the first quarter, while we are well positioned with our on-hand inventory to increase channel inventory, if and when demand in China evolves. So far, quarter-to-date, our distribution sales through in China is off to a slow start as is incorporated in our guidance. Over the midterm, we are cautiously optimistic given customer engagement levels, design win momentum in our strategic focus areas and a potential rebound in China. And now I would like to pass the call to you, Bill, for a review of our financial performance.
Bill Betz: Thank you, Kurt, and good morning to everyone on today's call. As Kurt has already covered the drivers of revenue during Q4 and provided our revenue outlook for Q1, I will move to the financial highlights. Overall, our Q4 financial performance was very good. Revenue was slightly above the midpoint of our guidance range and both non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP operating profit were above the midpoint of our guidance. I will first provide full year highlights and then move to the Q4 results. Full year revenue for 2022 was $13.21 billion, up 19% year-on-year. We generated $7.64 billion in non-GAAP gross profit and reported a non-GAAP gross margin of 57.9%, up 180 basis points year-on-year as a result of higher internal factory utilization and fall-through on higher revenue, which is at the high end of our long-term financial model. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $2.86 billion or 21.6% of revenue, below our long-term financial model. Total non-GAAP operating profit was $4.79 billion, up 32% year-on-year. This reflects a non-GAAP operating margin of 36.3%, up 340 basis points year-on-year and above our long-term financial model. Non-GAAP interest expense was $386 million. Cash taxes for ongoing operations were $558 million, non-controlling interest of $46 million and stock-based compensation, which is not included in our non-GAAP earnings, was $364 million. Full year cash flow highlights include $3.9 billion in cash flow from operations and $1.06 billion in net CapEx investments or 8% of revenue, resulting in $2.83 billion of non-GAAP free cash flow, up 23% year-on-year or a healthy 21% of revenue. During 2022, we repurchased 8.33 million shares for $1.43 billion and paid cash dividends of $815 million or 21% of cash flow from operations. In total, we returned $2.2 billion to our owners, which was 79% of the total non-GAAP free cash flow generated during the year. Now moving to the details of Q4. Total revenue was $3.31 billion, up 9% year-on-year, in line with the midpoint of our guidance range. We generated $1.92 billion in non-GAAP gross profit and reported a non-GAAP gross margin of 58%, up 70 basis points year-on-year and consistent with the midpoint of our guidance range. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $713 million or 21.5% of revenue, which is up $32 million year-on-year and down $17 million from Q3, slightly favorable to the midpoint of our guidance. From a total operating profit perspective, non-GAAP operating profit was $1.21 billion, and non-GAAP operating margin was 36.5%, up 160 basis points year-on-year, above the midpoint of our guidance range, reflecting solid fall-through in operating leverage on the increased revenue level. Non-GAAP interest expense was $95 million, with cash taxes for ongoing operations of $126 million and non-controlling interest was $12 million. Stock-based compensation, which is not included in our non-GAAP earnings was $97 million. Now I would like to turn to the changes in our cash and debt. Our total debt at the end of Q4 was $11.17 billion, essentially flat sequentially. Our ending cash position was $3.85 billion, up $86 million sequentially due to the cumulative effect of capital returns, CapEx investments and cash generation during Q4. The resulting net debt was $7.32 billion, and we exited the quarter with a trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA of $5.47 billion. Our ratio of net debt to trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA at the end of Q4 was 1.3 times, and our 12 month adjusted EBITDA interest coverage was 14.9 times. Cash flow generation of the business continues to be healthy and our balance sheet continues to be very strong. During Q4, we paid $221 million in cash dividends and repurchased $475 million of our shares. Additionally, the NXP Board of Directors has approved a 20% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, bringing the quarterly cash dividend to approximately $1 per share. These actions are all aligned with our capital allocation strategy. Turning to working capital metrics. Days of inventory was 116 days, an increase of 17 days sequentially and distribution channel inventory was 1.6 months. As we mentioned on our last quarter's call, given the uncertain demand environment, we made the intentional choice to limit the months of inventory in the channel, while keeping inventory on our balance sheet to enable greater flexibility to redirect product as needed. Furthermore, given our manufacturing cycle times, combined with the uncertain demand environment in the first half of 2023, we will continue with this approach in Q1, and we expect DIO to increase in the quarter. Days receivable were 26 days, down one day sequentially and days payable were 105 days, an increase of 9 days versus the prior quarter due to the timing of material. Taken together, our cash conversion cycle was 37 days, an increase of 7 days versus the prior quarter. Cash flow from operations was $1.08 billion and net CapEx was $233 million, resulting in non-GAAP free cash flow of $843 million or approximately 25% of our revenue. Turning now to our expectations for the first quarter. As Kurt mentioned, we anticipate Q1 revenue to be $3 billion, plus or minus about $100 million. At the midpoint, this is down 4% year-on-year and down 9% sequentially. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be about 58% plus or minus 50 basis points, driven by favorable mix, offset by the lower revenue. Operating expenses are expected to be about $710 million, plus or minus about $10 million. Taken together, we see non-GAAP operating margin to be 34.3% at the midpoint. We estimate non-GAAP financial expense to be about $77 million. We anticipate the non-GAAP tax rate to be 16.5% of profit before tax. Non-controlling interest and other will be about $10 million. For Q1, we suggest for modeling purposes you use an average share count of 261.4 million shares. Taken together, at the midpoint, this implies a non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.01. For full year 2023 modeling purposes, we suggest for a non-GAAP tax rate you use a range between 16% to 17%. This is lower than our previously anticipated effective cash tax rate of 18% and is based on current tax legislation. For stock-based compensation, we suggest you use $410 million, no change from the model. For non-controlling interest, we suggest you use $30 million to $40 million lower than 2022 and for capital expenditures, we expect to invest approximately 8% of our revenue. In closing, looking ahead into 2023, I'd like to highlight a few focus areas for NXP. First, we plan to execute and drive our six company-specific accelerated growth drivers. Second, we will manage our internal and channel inventory thoughtfully based on market conditions. Thirdly, we will continue to be disciplined with our operating expenses, while protecting our long-term R&D investments. Taken together, we plan to operate within our long-term financial model ranges in what is a dynamic macro environment. I'd like to now turn it back to the operator for questions. Thank you.
Q - Christopher Caso: Yes, thank you. Good morning. I guess to start, Kurt, perhaps you could speak to your comments on managing the channel inventory. And of course, one of the concerns investors naturally have is the worry that customers order more than they need given the constraints at the present over the last year and then potentially you overship that. Can you speak to how you're ensuring that what you're shipping to customers now is actually going to real demand rather than inventory? And I guess that's particularly as some of the foundry capacity loosens up, gives you a little - a little more access to wafer supply?
Kurt Sievers: Yeah. Thanks, Chris, and thanks for taking the first question. Yes, the very, very vigilant management of the channel inventory is a very deliberate choice Bill and I took. And we do this while we have more than enough orders at hand to actually ship, say, another $500 million in the quarter into the channel and still hitting our target of 2.4 or 2.5 months of inventory. But we take the choice because we specifically now in China see a weakness. Actually, we think the weakness in China, which for us is almost entirely distribution. We see that connected to the change of corporate policy, which they took in early or first half of December and the spike of infection rates following that. And we just want to be responsible through this period of weakness in China, but watching the situation very carefully. So as soon as we would see signs of consistent rebound in China, we have both the orders, but also the product at hand to actually fill back the channel. So it's kind of our choice, which we took here, and I have to say this is across all segments. So that weakness, which we see in China, is not really segment specific, it is distribution specific across the board related to this policy change and infection spike in China. Maybe important to highlight that at the very same time, we are seeing across the board very strong trends in our direct customers. So it's - we have a very diverging - last quarter, we spoke about the dichotomy, very diverging picture now that from a segment perspective, Auto and Core Industrial remain strong. But now we have an additional effect here that we see this short-term weakness in China, which we try to be prudent about with the choice of the channel inventory stable.
Christopher Caso: Got it. Thank you. As a follow-up, if I could pivot to Auto. And question is what's a reasonable expectation for Auto revenue for the year, if not quantitatively, at least qualitatively? And it was flat last quarter, you're managing to be flat again. Is it - should it stay flat from here? Are you trying to get additional capacity in the process nodes needed for Auto. So that quarterly revenue would at one point rise and catch up on that backlog?
Kurt Sievers: Yes. Let me give you some color on Q4, Q1 and then directionally for the year. Indeed, Q4 was flat from a quarter-on-quarter perspective, by the way, nicely up year-on-year really because of supply constraints. I mean we just did - we couldn't ship more because we didn't have more products in Q4. In Q1, it's a bit more of a mixed bag. We are getting more products. But at the same time, we - Automotive in China distribution falls under what I said earlier. So we have a bit of a decline when you think about Automotive distribution in China, while the rest is actually going up at the same time. In the mix, it turns out to be then flat quarter-on-quarter and again, nicely up from a year-on-year perspective. Maybe more importantly, for the full year, yes, we are optimistic, Chris. We see, according to IHS, a far increased to about 85 million, so I think 82 million cars last year, going to 85 million this coming year, which is 3.5 or so percent increase and more importantly, definitely a continued increase of xEV, electric vehicle penetration. Again, according to IHS, I think going to 35% of the total car production having hybrid or fully electric drivetrains, which is significant and continues to be a significant boost from a content perspective for us. At the same time, we are gradually as through the last quarters, getting access to more supply. I dare to say from today's perspective that probably through the end of the calendar year '23, I hope we have most of the shortages behind us. I mean that will never be totally complete, but I think we are getting closer to a better balance towards the end of the year. And finally, pricing continues to play a role. I think I talked about the pricing specifics for last year in my prepared remarks. Now when you think about this year, input cost continues to go up, especially in those areas which continue to be tight from a supply perspective. So there is also, specifically in Automotive, continued pricing tailwind to be expected.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Vivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. Kurt, when I look at the two areas facing the most headwind, Consumer IoT and Mobile, and I think they could be below 20% of sales as you get into Q1. Should we assume that is sort of the cycle look when I look at Mobile, I think it's back to like Q1 '19 level? So do you think Q1 kind of marks the cycle low for these two most problematic areas? Or do you see them slipping further in Q2?
Kurt Sievers: Honestly, Vivek, we don't know. I would go over my skis to make a firm statement here. But indeed, Mobile, of course, has a couple of specifics which are driving it really low. There is a seasonal element to this, obviously. Secondly, we do have in Mobile executed our NCNR orders last year, which gives us a headwind from an inventory perspective, if you will. We firmly executed these NCNR orders because these are custom-specific products where we have no chance otherwise to move them around and give them to other customers. And then finally, there is the well-known and documented Android weakness, which continues to be. I'd say the following, as you see, we are very disciplined with customer inventory and mind you that our Mobile business, to the largest extent, is going through the channel. So if and when end demand picks up, rebounds, which I think it will, at some point, we should indeed very quickly see it. Is that exactly for the second quarter? I don't know, but we are very close to the post given the way how we treat this. I mean I'm glad you are asking, Vivek, because this whole thing around our almost brutal discipline on the 1.6 channel inventory moves us very close to as soon as there is pickup in end demand, we will also see it in our numbers.
Vivek Arya: Got it. And then on gross margin, I think, Bill, you mentioned something about mix that is helping you keep gross margins at the high end of your target range of 58%. So conceptually, let's say, if your Q1 is the bottom-in sales and sales are flat to up from here. Then do you think gross margins can stay at 58%? Or do you think there is something in mix or utilization in the following quarters that can change gross margins below this level? Or it's 58% kind of now the new baseline of gross margins for NXP?
Bill Betz: Vivek, thank you for your question. Let me talk about Q4 and the Q1 guide and also looking ahead. First, as you know, we did slightly better than our guidance and I mentioned it was improved by product mix for Q4. Again, as we look into Q1, despite those lower revenues, we see this positive product mix offsetting lower fall-through on the revenue. Also, we have lowered our internal front-end utilization rates. In Q3, we were running in the high 90s. In Q4, we're about 90%. And again, remember, this is all linked to that non-auto industrial type of products because of market softness we're seeing. For Q1, we do expect to lower our front-end utilization again to about 85%, which is where we still remain constrained in our internal auto IP processing technologies and so forth. And again, I'd say, looking ahead, we expect to stay within our long-term gross margin forecast of 55% million to 58% as our cost structure today is more variable in nature than the past. Also, our factories, if you think about it, become more efficient when they run at normal utilizations and we have a disciplined inventory approach with their channels. So we're going to stay with that range. We're not revising it, but we feel very good about our gross margin performance.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Ross Seymore: Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Kurt, I want to go back to your core Automotive and, I guess, Core Industrial business, not the consumer IoT side. I believe you said the demand was largely holding in well there, except for some of the channel dynamics in China. I guess overall, is that true? Is the core industrial especially holding in? And how do you delineate between the channel weakening and isolating that to a variable other than demand? Obviously, you can see this is coming out of China, and we know the COVID policy. But to the extent it's weakening, people aren't really going to care if the source is coming from this is having too much inventory or OEM slowly demand. Either way, it's kind of slowing even though the latter could by some sort of a temporary aspect. So any sort of color you could give on your core demand would be helpful?
Kurt Sievers: Yes. Thanks, Ross. It is actually easier to speak to this in Automotive because we have a much larger portion of direct customers where we can also triangulate with the demand from the OEMs, from the end customers. And we have these discussions actually with all three parties on the table. So we cannot be misled by inventory builds or anything from the Tier 1s because we really cleaned this out now all the way to the OEMs. And I think what I said to Chris earlier about the optimism on the Auto business through the year is the answer to your question. So there is a short-term disturbance in China, but that's really more about the distributors than anything else when it comes to Automotive. In Core Industrial, Ross, it is indeed harder [ph] to be that specific because the majority of our business goes through the channel. So it is much harder to say from the perspective of what do we know from end customers really, which is also why into Q1, I'd say also Core Industrial probably drops sequentially. But again, it is very hard to decompose this from the China situation. So it could just be because of this particular China situation since we have such a high exposure in Industrial - also in Core Industrial to China. I can, however, tell you that the direct accounts in the Core Industrial business, but they are a minor portion of our business. They are holding up quite well. So for that reason, you could say there is some data points, which would tell us that also Core Industrial is robust. But I have - it's less certain given the channel exposure, which we have in that segment. Now from a content increase perspective from - if you think more from a macro perspective, what these applications are doing in critical infrastructure in driving efficiency of industrial customers, I think there is any reason to believe that we should also for Core Industrial continue to be optimistic for the year. Finally, what I said about pricing earlier, pricing for Automotive holds true also for Core Industrial. Similar technologies, similar continued pressure on supply, which is very different, obviously, to the Consumer and Mobile businesses.
Ross Seymore: Thanks for the color. And I guess one kind of on utilization, inventory and gross margin all tied into one for Bill. It's impressive to see that your utilization is dropping and your gross margin is still staying at 58%. I guess, in the DIOs, is there a limit to which you would go on the upside there? I know your long-term target is 95%. I also know that you've been very clear as to why you're going above that right now. But is there a limit to how high you would go on days of inventory internally before you'd really have to ratchet the growth - the utilization down? And if so, how does that fold into what the gross margin that would be the outcome in that scenario?
Bill Betz: Thanks, Ross. Yes, you are correct in a way that when we look at inventory, we look at both the internal and the channel together. So as you can imagine, right, the channel inventory today at 1.6 months, basically, we can move that up by about another 25 days if we wanted to, to our target of 2.5 months of sale. Clearly, with the softness in several of the areas, we are monitoring this. We're keeping it strategically on our channel. And as Kurt mentioned, as conditions do approve, we will release some of that and want to go sell-through one-to-one. Now the good news is the inventory we have on hand is all long lived and has very low obsolescence risk. At the same time, I'd say, unfortunately, we're still constrained in several selective nodes. Remember, we buy about 60% externally. We do about 40% internally. That 40% really - more than two thirds of that internal capacity is linked to Auto and Industrial. So that's going to keep us at nice levels of utilization for the rest of the year. So again, we're going to be more flexible, yet disciplined to support our customer service levels and the potential for future growth. But to give you an example, right, if we have the orders, as Kurt mentioned, and we shipped that $500 million and went to 2.5 months of sales, assuming none of it sells through, this would basically have an effect on our revenue and our COGS and basically say NXP's internal inventory would have been below 90 days. So you have to look at them combined. We're doing this very proactively and intentionally to prevent inventory buildup. So I think from an internal DIO, if we kept the channel at 1.6, I'm comfortable holding probably another 15 to 20 days on top of the level that you see today.
Operator: Our next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Your line is open.
C.J. Muse: Yeah, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I guess a follow-up question on gross margins. You started the call talking about expectations for higher ASPs given higher input costs. It sounds like you're very optimistic around accelerated growth areas that should benefit mix. You've cut back utilization, and it sounds like that should trend higher over time, and that's focused more on proprietary mixed signal, which I assume, again, is better mix. And then you guided CapEx essentially flat to down year-on-year, which means depreciation shouldn't be moving higher. So the question is this, I guess, are there any kind of headwinds to gross margins that we should be thinking about in '23?
Bill Betz: I mean the only thing I would say that could cause gross margin to go below the long-term model that 55% to 58% is probably a prolonged global recession, that affects all of us, right? But if we're having the - what we're seeing right now, we think we'll - we will and plan to stay within that 55% to 58%, C.J.
C.J. Muse: Thank you. And I guess as my follow-up, on the Comps Infrastructure and Other line, can you give a little more color on what led to the weakness in December? And how we should be thinking about the different moving parts for that business for all of '23? Thanks so much.
Kurt Sievers: Yeah, C.J. I'm happy to do that. Q4 was purely supply. We were a bit ahead of our, say, skis with the guidance because we know that more supply is coming up, and that's also why Q1 is now going much better. And that - there were some operational issues and we didn't get it going in Q4. So Q4 fail against guidance had nothing to do with demand, that was purely about a supply base. Now going forward, it is indeed such that I would say we are cautious when it comes to the radio power part of the business because the one area where we see build-outs in network infrastructure this year then it's India. So it's all about to what extent at what pace is this going to happen through the year. What is for sure is that it is much more and much faster leaning to gallium nitride versus LDMOS, which is favoring us and we just have to do a good job in increasing our supply capability to actually run up here. The one other piece within this Comm Infra and Other segments, which will matter this year, is actually the RFID tagging, secure and access cards and government identity products. There is a significant amount of pent-up demand C.J., which we could not serve the last 2 years which was our choice. I mean it is a technology which we have to use for other segments and other products. That is a classic demand, which doesn't disappear because it is about infrastructures, it is about government IDs, which people need around the world. So the demand is still there. Now we are actually moving the supply capability from other areas where the demand has softened into this and we are starting to serve it. So from a sub-segment dynamic perspective, C.J., think about this part being the one which is actually going to generate growth this year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Joseph Moore: Great. Thank you. I think you've talked about being for your Auto business having backlog coverage for the year. With the disruption in China, kind of would you still say that's the case? And as a follow-up, how are you guys thinking about NCNRs on your backlog this year? How flexible are you going to be if, for example, the China situation causes people to want to reschedule deliveries?
Kurt Sievers: Yes. So Joe, first of all, the supply capability through the year. Clearly, the number of escalations has moderated. We still have a number of nastily short technologies. And I would call out 180 nanometers, 9055 gallium nitride and the high-voltage analog mixed signal, which is proprietary to NXP. This is, of course, in size less than it used to be, but it still leads to significant customer escalations and shortages, which we think will go through the year, but hopefully moderating towards the end of the year. If we translate this back into supply capability, I think we said on the last call, we would be able to serve about 85% of kind of risk-adjusted backlog for the year. I'd say for this year, for '23, this is now more like 90% to 95%. So you see it's better. It's not yet on target. We are not yet in a position that we have visibility to serve everything we want, but we are coming closer. Now you might be confused with the high DIO and still me saying that we can't serve Automotive. The matter of the fact is that if you would pass it the DIO in two segments. And I mean, I will not give you numbers, but the auto part of it so the product which is specific to the lease in Automotive is actually well below target. So it's just very variable between the segments, and it's not fungible, as you know. Now that leads me to the second part of your questions around NCNRs. I gave you one example earlier where we have very strictly executed NCNRs and that was the Mobile last year, which indeed is a bit of a headwind now getting into this year because product was not fungible. I mean it's customized in software, so there was no way to let customers of the hook. Going through this year, there is not a one-fits-all answer, Joe. So I'd say we are flexible if the product is fungible. I mean we do not force one customer to absolutely take it if we can at the same moment, sell the same product to somebody else. I mean, that wouldn't make sense. We are very strict if it would go against any take-or-pay liabilities, which we have to our suppliers. I mean there is no way we would let our customers off the hook. Then it depends on overriding commercial agreements, which we have with customers, in some cases, which might be of forcing functions. And then - and that's especially in Automotive, which is a large part of our NCNR backlog. We are working with ODMs. So if a Tier 1 comes to me and says, I want to discuss about the NCNR level, I say, okay, then we discussed together with your end customer. And we want to understand if that is in the best interest also for the end customer which puts quite a bit of pressure on the system and actually enforces some of the NCNR through that channel. So you will see - I cannot say the 100% always in force. We would not do this where you would see that we create a problem for ourselves later. I mean that's the same philosophy, which we are applying with the channel inventory. Why would we? I mean that wouldn't be smart. But in many cases, we still do, given the dynamics I just mentioned.
Joseph Moore: Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from William Stein with Truist. Your line is open.
William Stein: Great. Thanks so much. The last couple of questions in particular are very helpful in understanding the sort of shape of demand. I'm hoping maybe we can talk a little bit about longer-term competitive dynamics, in particular, in the Automotive end market, you seem to be doing well in these growth areas. But Kurt, I'm hoping you can talk more about your position with the emerging Chinese OEMs, which especially in EVs have started to deliver some very strong growth. Can you compare your competitive position with those OEMs relative to how you've done historically with the bigger global ones? Thank you.
Kurt Sievers: While - Bill, while I cannot speak on a customer-specific level, obviously, I dare to say when I look at the win rates and then the shipment rates, we are very well balanced when it comes to EVs, both geographically but also between, say, big OEMs and start-ups. And that has been an attention point for me right from the start because actually, many years back already I always thought that China might become a leading force in electrification, given that they didn't have the legacy to change their companies from combustion engines to electric drivetrains. I mean there is significant advantage. And so for many years already, we tried to stay very close to start-up companies, which, by the way, is not just in China, but that's often between China and California. I mean there is a lot of combined companies there. So, no, I would not say that we have a, if you will, negative buyers only to the big guys and would not participate in the growth provided by start-ups, which largely are in China. It has also to do with our product portfolio, Bill. I mean, we are so broad and so leading in automotive, how would we only work with one part of the market. It's almost impossible. So no, that's not the case. I'm optimistic here.
William Stein: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Matt Ramsay with Cowen. Your line is open.
Matt Ramsay: Thank you very much guys for squeezing me in. Kurt, in your prepared script, you referenced the model from the Analyst Day sort of the $15 billion in revenue in 2024, and sort of reiterated the targets for sort of the core business and the new growth areas. But as we start on a sort of $12 billion run rate, and I know a couple of the segments are really down in the first quarter. But just on an annualized basis, I think we need to get to 6%, 7% growth or something like that for this year and next to hit that target. So maybe you could just give us a little more color on the specific drivers, not just in the next quarter or two, given the volatility, but over the next, like, 24, 36 months of how you see getting there from where we're starting? Thanks.
Kurt Sievers: Yes, Matt. So indeed, I mean, the Q1, given China and everything we discussed in the last 25 minutes is indeed a bit of a - probably a bit of an outlier. I think the growth rates, which contribute to the 8% to 12% for the company, being led by Automotive and Industrial IoT, that is still how we look at the growth for the next 3 years. So we do believe that if you look across NXP, the content increases and our strong position in Automotive will let automotive growth above corporate average. I think we said 9% to 14% relative to the 8% to 12% for the total. Since this is half of the company, Matt you will understand that, that has a significant dynamic for us. And in Automotive, it's also fair to say, and I gave you some details for last year that pricing is a positive further contributing element which maybe was not always fully comprehended in the initial forecast. And in a similar way, I would speak to Core Industrial, mind you, that is 60% of the Industrial IoT segment. There, indeed, and that's maybe where your question was going to the more cyclical businesses being the consumer IoT as part of industrial IoT segment, as well as Mobile, there it will all depend on timing. I mean we really have to see what the timing of a rebound is going to be. Where at the same time, if you look at history of these segments, they are very fast moving. I mean you can very quickly have significant changes through the quarters, especially when China makes a move. But again, strategically, I think the growth algorithm guiding us to the 8 to 12 for the company is pretty much intact. There possibly automotive has a bit more momentum even than we would have anticipated in the first place
Matt Ramsay: Got it. Thanks, Kurt. Just a quick follow-up for Bill. You guys pretty tight on OpEx in the first quarter. I think maybe a tiny bit above the 16% and 7% of revenue that you sort of laid out in the model, Bill, but on a pretty big down revenue quarter in a couple of segments, we potentially reaccelerate off the bottom in a couple of the segments that are challenged in China. Have you - are you going to reaccelerate OpEx at the same rate? Or is there a sort of - how should we think about that into the back half as the revenue potentially recovers? Thank you.
Bill Betz: Thanks, Matt. Let me address operating expenses. I think we continue to manage our operating expenses pretty well with the uncertainty in the macro markets. So in Q4, we were a bit more favorable than our guidance driven by the lower variable compensation, and we managed our discretionary spend. In Q1, we're keeping our OpEx relatively flattish, I would say despite you all know the typical headwind that we experienced in the U.S. employee benefit rates and so forth. So we're doing a good job there. And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we are going to navigate and control our spend. It's one of those levers that we have. And for 2023, I'd say we'll plan for the full year to make sure that we're below that 23% for modeling purposes. So maybe a quarter here, it may go out of balance, but for the full year, we expect to be within 23%.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stacy - yes, sir?
Jeff Palmer: That will be our last question. We'd like to pass it over to Kurt for some final remarks get right here to the end.
Kurt Sievers: Yeah. Thank you - thank you very much, Jeff. Now as we have discussed, clearly, the level of uncertainty currently is higher than what we've had through the past couple of quarters. The stance we take is that we want to be prudent and disciplined to those elements, which are in our control. We just discussed about OpEx. But much more importantly, I think this is all about inventory management. There, we don't want to be blocked by a lot of over shipping into the channel and not having a deal anymore what the true end demand is. So that's why we focused on this call and also for our guide very much on that approach. For the channel, which mind you, is more than 50% for NXP, more than 50% of our revenues are going through the channel. So that discussion is a very important piece for us. With that, we are actually in a position to certainly navigate in a good way through this period of uncertainty and at the same time, remain very prepared for a potential rebound which we think could happen in the time to come, especially in China when the infection rates come down again after this policy change. With that, thanks for your attention. Thank you very much. I speak to you all soon. Thank you.
Jeff Palmer: Thank you, everyone. We can disconnect now.
Operator: Thank you for your participation. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-11-01 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello. Thank you for standing by and welcome to the NXP Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference may be recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jeff Palmer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Jeff Palmer: Thank you, Josh and good morning everyone. Welcome to the NXP Semiconductors' third quarter 2022 earnings call. With me on the call today is Kurt Sievers, NXP's President and CEO; and Bill Betz, our CFO. The call today is being recorded and will be available for replay from our corporate website. Today's call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause NXP's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, the macroeconomic impact on the specific end markets in which we operate, the sale of new and existing products, and our expectations for the financial results for the fourth quarter of 2022. Please be reminded that NXP undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements. For a full disclosure on forward-looking statements, please refer to our press release. Additionally, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are driven primarily by discrete events that management does not consider to be directly related to NXP's underlying core operating performance. Pursuant to Regulation G, NXP has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our third quarter 2022 earnings press release, which will be furnished to the SEC on Form 8-K and be available on NXP's website in the Investor Relations section at nxp.com. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Kurt.
Kurt Sievers: Thank you, Jeff and good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining our call today. Now, let me begin with a review of our quarter three performance. Our revenue was $20 million better than the midpoint of our guidance with performance in the Mobile, Automotive, and Communication Infrastructure markets all better than our expectations. For the consumer exposed IoT subset of the Industrial & IoT market, we started to experience weaker sell-through in the channel. And let me remind you that our consumer IoT exposure is approximately 40% of the Industrial and IoT segment revenue. It is made up of thousands of customers primarily in China and serviced through our distribution partners. Taken together, NXP delivered quarter three revenue of $3.45 billion, an increase of 20% year-on-year. Our non-GAAP operating margin in quarter three was a record 36.9%, 340 basis points better than the year ago period and 80 basis points above the midpoint of our guidance. Our results reflect strong execution with solid profit fall-through on the incrementally higher revenue and better than guided operating leverage. Notwithstanding our results, which surpassed our guidance, we are facing a tricky demand environment. On the one hand, the demand trends from automotive and core industrial customers are very resilient. And we continue to face supply constraints across multiple microcontroller and advanced analog products. And on the other hand, we see weakness in the broad consumer IoT and in the Android mobile market. Given that unbalanced dynamic of the demand environment, we are going to pull those levers that are in our control, namely stringent channel inventory management and discipline and discretionary operating expense. In terms of inventory, we have decided to take a Draconian approach to managing our distribution channel inventory. Specifically, our quarter four guidance contemplates a channel inventory at the 1.6 months of supply level, which is in line with quarter three and well-below our long-term model. We prefer to keep any incremental inventory on our balance sheet, where we have the ability to control and redirect shipments as needed. And in terms of discretionary spending, amongst others, we are slowing the rate of hiring. All-in-all, we believe these measures are a prudent approach until such time as we see a clearer and more consistent view of the demand environment. Now let me turn to the specific trends in our focus end markets. In automotive, revenue in Q1 was -- in Q3 was $1.8 billion, up 24% year-on-year, near the high end of guidance. In Industrial and IoT, revenue was $713 million, up 17% year-on-year, $32 million below our guidance. In Mobile, revenue was $410 million, up 19% year-on-year, $30 million better than our guidance. And lastly, Communication Infrastructure & Other revenue was $518 million, up 14% year-on-year, slightly above our guidance. Now let me look at key operating indicators relative to the noted demand dynamics, where we see the following. In terms of quoted product lead times, overall, we dropped to just below 70% of our portfolio with lead times that are greater than 52 weeks. This metric was greater than 80% a quarter ago. While this is in aggregate an improvement from prior periods, we continue to be sold out through 2023 in the automotive and core industrial end markets. In terms of our NCNR program, most of our automotive and core industrial customers continue to demand assured supply for 2023. Our 2023 NCNR order book continues to surpass our 2023 supply capability as well as the level of NCNR orders, which have been requested for 2022. And in terms of inventory, as noted previously, our Q4 guidance contemplates distribution channel at 1.6 months, well-below our long-term target of 2.5 months. With respect to on-hand inventory at NXP, our DIO has increased five days sequentially to 99 days, and it will increase further. Given the application-specific nature of our product portfolio, we are comfortable with this direction. Now let me turn to our expectations for quarter four. We are guiding revenue at $3.3 billion, up about 9% versus the fourth quarter of 2021, within a range of up 5% to up 12% year-on-year. And from a sequential perspective, this represents a decline of about 4%, at the midpoint versus the prior quarter. At the midpoint, we anticipate the following trends in our business. Automotive is expected to be up in the high teens on a percent basis versus quarter four 2021 and flattish versus quarter three 2022. Industrial and IoT is expected to be down in the low double-digit range on a percentage basis year-on-year and down in the high teens range versus quarter three 2022. Mobile is expected to be up in the low single-digit range year-on-year and down in the upper single-digit range versus quarter three 2022. And finally, Communication Infrastructure and Other is expected to be up in the low teens range versus the same period a year ago and flattish on a sequential basis. Now in summary, there is a real dichotomy in the various end markets that we serve. The potential for some demand destruction in the consumer end markets that we noted as a concern last quarter has materialized. While we could ship more into the channel, we are taking a proactive stance to limit channel inventory buildup. And conversely, we are seeing very resilient customer demand in the Automotive and core Industrial segments, where demand continues to outpace supply, which hinders us from shipping to the true end demand. So, overall, we remain cautious in the near term due to the uncertainties in the macro environment. And with that, now I would like to pass the call over to you, Bill, for a review of our financial performance.
Bill Betz: Thank you, Kurt, and good morning to everyone on today's call. As Kurt has already covered the drivers of the revenue during Q3 and provided our revenue outlook for Q4, I will move to the financial highlights. Overall, our Q3 financial performance was very good. Revenue was $20 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. And both non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP operating profit were above the midpoint of our guidance. Now moving to the details of Q3. Total revenue was $3.45 billion, up 20% year-on-year, notwithstanding weakness in the consumer-centric portion of the Industrial and IoT segment. We generated $1.99 billion in non-GAAP gross profit and reported a non-GAAP gross margin of 58%, up 150 basis points year-on-year and both above the midpoint of guidance range, as a result of higher factory utilization and higher sales volume. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $730 million or 21.2%, up $73 million year-on-year and up $6 million from Q2, better than our guidance range and below our long-term model. From a total operating profit perspective, non-GAAP operating profit was $1.27 billion, and non-GAAP operating margin was 36.9%, up 340 basis points year-on-year and both above the midpoint of the guidance range. Non-GAAP interest expense was $91 million, with cash taxes for ongoing operations of $160 million or 13.6% effective cash tax rate. And non-controlling interest was about $12 million. Stock-based compensation, which is not included in our non-GAAP earnings, was $89 million. Now I would like to turn to the changes in our cash and debt. Our total debt at the end of Q3 was $11.16 billion, flat sequentially. Our ending cash position was $3.76 billion, up $214 million sequentially, thanks to improved operating performance. The resulting net debt was $7.40 billion. And we exited the quarter with a trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA of $5.3 billion. Our ratio of net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of Q3 was 1.4 times, and our 12-month adjusted EBITDA interest coverage was 13.8 times. Turning to working capital metrics. Days of inventory was 99 days, an increase of five days sequentially, as we continue to experience incrementally improved supply trends. The increase in on-hand inventory was evenly split between raw materials and work in process to support revenue growth in subsequent periods and an increase in finished goods due to the noted weakness in the Android mobile market and the consumer-centric portion of Industrial and IoT. As Kurt mentioned, we continue to tightly manage our channel inventory. Inventory in the channel was 1.6 months and continues to be well below our long-term target. Days receivable were 27 days, flat sequentially. And days payable were 96, an increase of two days versus the prior quarter. Taken together, our cash conversion cycle was 30 days. Our working capital management, balance sheet and channel metrics continue to be very strong and well managed. Cash flow from operations was $1.14 billion, and net CapEx was $281 million or 8.2% of revenue, resulting in a non-GAAP free cash flow of $863 million or 25% of revenue. During Q3, we paid $223 million in cash dividends, and we repurchased $400 million of NXP shares. In addition, since the beginning of Q4 through October 28, we purchased an additional $260 million of shares under established 10b5-1 program. On a trailing 12-month basis through the end of Q3, we have returned 98% of our non-GAAP free cash flow back to the owners of the company, consistent with our capital allocation strategy. The cash flow generation of the business continues to be excellent. Now turning to our expectations for Q4. As Kurt mentioned, we anticipate revenue to be about $3.3 billion, plus or minus about $100 million. At the midpoint, this is up 9% year-on-year and down 4% sequentially. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be about 57.8%, plus or minus 50 basis points. Operating expenses are expected to be around $720 million, plus or minus about $10 million, which is down about 1% sequentially, driven by lower incentive compensation and discretionary spending. Taken together, we see non-GAAP operating margin to be 36% at the midpoint. We estimate non-GAAP financial expense to be about $81 million, driven by higher interest income. And we anticipate cash tax related to ongoing operations to be about $140 million or about a 13% effective cash tax rate, which is below our communicated model, leading to a full year effective tax rate of 13%. Non-controlling interest should be about $12 million. And for Q4, we suggest for modeling purposes, you use an average share count of 262 million shares. For CapEx, we suggest you use 8%, bringing total year CapEx to 8% versus our prior expectations of 10% due to delays in equipment deliveries. Finally, I have an update to our reported financials, beginning with our guidance for Q1 2023. We will begin to apply an estimated annual tax rate to our GAAP and, thus, our non-GAAP profit before tax. This change will enable NXP to report a non-GAAP earnings per share on a go-forward basis, consistent with SEC guidelines. Given current tax legislation, we believe our new estimated tax rate will be consistent with our long-term cash tax rate of 18%, as provided at our Analyst Day in November of 2021. Overall, despite the uncertain macroeconomic conditions which are impacting some of our more consumer-oriented markets, as Kurt mentioned, we will navigate what is in our control, such as channel inventory and discretionary spending. Furthermore, over the foreseeable future, we will continue to operate within our long-term financial model. Thank you, and we now can turn the call back over to the operator for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.
Ross Seymore: Hi guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Kurt, I wanted to ask about the inventory side of the equation, both on the channel and on your balance sheet. On the channel side of things, you guys are, like you said, well below target about 1.6 months, well below where you were at similar points where people were worried about us being at a peak cycle. So, I guess the question is, could you ship more into the channel if you wanted to? And what's led to the philosophical shift to significantly lessen the channel and more on your balance sheet as in prior cycles it seems to be the opposite prioritization?
Kurt Sievers: Yes, good morning and thanks, Ross. Yes, the answer is a blunt yes. We could have shipped more into the channel against open orders actually in this fourth quarter, and that especially into the consumer IoT part of our segments. But as I mentioned, given the whole macroeconomic uncertainty, we just feel it is a much more prudent approach to actually limit this channel inventory at this very low level of 1.6 months and mind you that the delta to 2.5 months in terms of revenue would be about $500 million. And that's the level of open orders, which we would easily have, which we could serve. But we think it's more prudent because it's unclear how the macro is going to further develop and how the demand in that part of the market is going to develop. So we feel it's a better idea to keep what we have already in the pipeline to keep in-house and on the balance sheet, also for eventually being in a position to redirect it to other customers. Now that's the one side of the house. I just have to also remind you that at the same time, Ross, we have this real situation that in the auto and core industrial side of the house, we have the opposite situation. We do not have enough supply, so we continue to be sold out. And also there, we could actually -- if only we have the supply, we could make more revenue in quarter four. We have a lot of open orders, which are very real. We checked all of them, but can't really serve them. But again, back to your initial question, yes, we could sell more, but we found it is much more wise to stick to this very low channel inventory of 1.6 months at this time. It's not a long-term target, though, but at this particular period in the cycle, we feel it's the best thing we should do.
Ross Seymore: Thanks for that color. I guess as my follow-up, one is for Bill on the gross margin side of things. I'm impressed that the gross margin is staying flat, maybe surprised would be the word more than impressed, given that the revenues are dropping 4% or so. Your predecessor had a very rough rule of thumb that a 5% drop in revenue was a 1% drop in gross margin. So how are you able to keep that flat? And what's the sustainability of that ability to keep the gross margin at this general level?
Bill Betz: Yes. Thanks, Ross, for your question. And you're right, we did slightly better than our guidance driven by the higher revenues and fall-through. One area I think we need to understand a little bit better is that our internal utilizations remain in the high 90s as we are still well constrained specifically in our auto. And if you think about internally, more than two-thirds of our capacity is just pinpointed to our IP proprietary mixed-signal, auto-centric capacity internally. And we are constrained. As you heard Kurt mention, we are sold out, and we expect this to be well-utilized all throughout 2023. Second, as mentioned on previous calls, you're right, we mentioned we'd stay in a tight range, delivering toward our high-end model. And I think we've demonstrated that, and it's incorporated in our Q4 guide. And more longer term, what gets us to 58% is really those new product introductions, which are further out in the journey, I would say.
Ross Seymore: Thank you.
Kurt Sievers: Thanks Ross.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore. You may proceed.
C.J. Muse: Yeah, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, the follow-on on Ross's question, I guess, can you comment on the ability at all to repurpose wafers capacity? My sense is internal versus external, the answer is no. And then as part of that, before coming to the recovery, you had a gross margin construct, I think, of every 5% change in top line, 100 bps growth in gross margins. Now that you see a clear mix shift here in terms of auto, core industrial holding strong, yet consumer weaker, is there kind of a thought process or model we should be thinking about on the gross margin side as we push forward into some sort of further correction on the consumer side?
Kurt Sievers: Hey C.J. good morning. Let me first go at the repurposing or the potential for repurposing of capacity. So first of all, yes, I can confirm directionally that indeed repurposing between internal and external is very limited. I mean that's really how we've built our supply strategy. When you then think about within internal and within external, repurposing between the different segments which we serve, and that's now specifically between the more consumer-oriented versus the more auto or core industrial-oriented markets to a limited level, it is possible.  It is typically not at all possible on a finished product level. So once the product is completely manufactured. And sometimes program, we have hardly any products which are swappable. However, if you still speak about buyback, inventory for example, we do have the opportunity with several process nodes to actually swap between those markets, but not with all of them.  I'll give you one example which is quite sizable for us. We have a lot of product going in 55 nanometers with embedded nonvolatile memory that for example, is very, very purely automotive, which means we are sold out we are short in that technology, but that same technology is also not used for any of the consumer applications. So the demand drop in consumer doesn't really help us there.  However, there is other technologies, like 90 nanometers or 180 nanometers, where we can do this if the product is not yet finished goods. So it's a bit of an in between, but we have some liberty here. And that is also the reason why, amongst others, for example in parts of our [indiscernible] market in Q4, we start to see acceleration in our revenues because we actually could swap some of our existing capacity into those markets like the e-government markets or RFID markets, which were super constrained over the past 8 quarters.  On the margin side, I'd say there is quite some variation of margin within each of the segments. So you cannot easily draw conclusions between the four revenue segments, what their mix is and what it means to the end margin of the company. It is more sophisticated, to be fair. Bill I'm not sure if you want to go a little bit deeper. But in the end, you cannot draw conclusions on the level of the total segment.
Bill Betz: No, nothing else there.
Kurt Sievers: CJ, did you have a follow-up?
Q – C.J. Muse: Thanks guys. Yes, just a quick follow-up. The China IoT piece, I would have thought that, that would have shown weakness earlier, so I guess, are there particular kind of sub end markets that have proven to be more resilient, at least until today, that's kind of enabled that to hold up or kind of can you give us a little more color on how to think about the key drivers within that bucket?
Kurt Sievers: Yes. It really started in, I'd say, August and then going into October to quite significantly drop. But again, of course, our approach to stick to the 1.6 level of month of channel inventory gives this a different color, CJ. I mean, in former days, honestly, we would just have kept shipping. So we it would have felt like, oh, finally, we get the channel inventory up. Now, it's very much our choice that we said we don't want to do this, and that's why it sees quite a harsh decline. But again, as I explained earlier, we think that's the better way to do it. But again, it started in August time frame. I would say, it's the consumer IoT market globally which is softening. It's just such that we have a relatively sizable exposure to China. But it's not that the non-Chinese consumer IoT customers would be still very resilient. I think this is globally weakening, but it hits us harder from a China perspective. And this is also where we have a very large channel exposure, which is why this general approach which I explained earlier, I think, makes a significant difference in how we want to deal with it.
C.J. Muse: Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. You may proceed.
Vivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. Kurt, for my first one, I'm curious to get your perspective on just the supply-demand equation in the automotive industry at your OEM and Tier 1 customers. Do you think they're still undersupplied or oversupplied or just kind of rightly supplied? And just what are the hotspots of over or undersupply right now? And just how is your visibility of growth into the first half of next year? I think you've added Q4 flattish, which I assume is more a supply variable. But just what's your perspective into the supply-demand balance at your auto customers right now?
Kurt Sievers: Yes. Thanks, Vivek. First of all, let me just indeed unfortunately confirm that the sequential flat in auto into Q4 is purely a function of supply. I wish it was different, but it is a straight function of supply. Now it still has a nice year-on-year growth, by the way, but the sequential is a supply limitation. In general, many microcontrollers, if not all, in our portfolio and the large part of the analog products, which we have, continue to be significantly supply constrained in automotive. And that is after a very careful and very thorough analysis of the demand in this whole web from the OEMs through to Tier 1. So I think we have more transparent and more detailed discussions than ever before in trying to understand that. And it really shows also, given the NCNR order level which we are getting in automotive for all of last year, that those constraints will continue to be in place through a large part of next year, depending, of course, on how the supply possibly further improves above the visibility we have today. But with our current supply visibility, we will continue to be sold out in the automotive market through next year. If you’d ask me how much was the gap to true demand, probably it is in the order of -- that we have a supply coverage of 85% next year in Automotive and core Industrial versus true demand. Now there is still this golden screw problem, so I don't want to take this off the table. So sometimes one component is indeed missing from us or from another peer in the market, and then it takes a few weeks until stuff is being flushed through. But that doesn't take away that there is overall shortage in the key microcontrollers and analog products.
Vivek Arya: Got it. So my follow-up, you continue to build inventory on your balance sheet. And when I couple that with the fact that you mentioned you're sold out in automotive and core industrial, that's almost two-thirds of your business, so is it fair to assume that you're planning for next year, I know you're not giving 2023 guidance, but are you planning for next year sales to be at least flattish year-on-year with auto and core industrial growth offsetting any weakness on the consumer side, or is that stretching right too much the conclusion from combining the fact that you still continue to build inventory and your auto and core Industrial demand is sold out for next year?
Bill Betz: Hey Vivek, this is Bill. Let me take this one. First off, we're not guiding 2023, but let me go into the internal inventory and try to summarize for everyone. Yes, we've increased five days, which is about 50% raw material and work-in-process. And the remainder was in finished goods from a quarter-over-quarter perspective. Clearly, as Kurt mentioned, a portion of these finished goods was driven primarily by NXP preventing inventory buildup in the channel as we reroute this material to other customers in need or some of it's fungible and some of it is not. Areas where we have higher consumer or mobile inventory levels, we hold the wafers in die bank, as Kurt mentioned, before completing assembly and test in our back-end facilities. At the same time, we remain highly constrained in the wafer areas of 28, 40, 55, 65 and 90 in our auto and core industrial segments. And again, as we mentioned in both our opening remarks, it's better to keep control of your own inventory and putting it into the channel, which will just create future issues if demand falls. And again, majority of what we build is very application specific and long-lived, which gives us confidence to hold and be ready to service future demand.
Kurt Sievers: Thanks, Bill. Let me maybe just add that one view on next year when it comes to automotive since you were asking earlier. We see no reason why the strong trend of content increase following, amongst others, electrification and ADAS would break. I think every quarter, we look at the ratio of electric cars of the total SAAR is higher than in the quarter before. For this year, we see now 27% of the total SAAR being ex EVs. And for next year, it's forecasted to be 34%. And you know what that means for the semiconductor content in a car. So from that perspective, I think there is, from a demand view, certainly good reason to believe that it continues to be a very strong and very resilient market, while at the same time, the extended supply chain in our view continues to be underfilled. It is still actually dysfunctional, because it is still too low level. So those two perspectives should maybe add to a pretty healthy view from an automotive demand perspective on 2023.
Vivek Arya: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. You may proceed.
Stacy Rasgon: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one, I get the issues in consumer and mobile. Those seem to be in the numbers now at this point. But auto and industrial look really resilient. You're sold out. You've got these NCNRs. I guess why do you sound so worried given that long-term support in those core markets and presumably given how sustainable it is, like, are you seeing any signs at all of weakness, even small signs, any tiny upticks in cancellations or anything like that in those core markets?
Kurt Sievers: Stacy, we have no cancellations or push-outs in auto or core industrial. At the same time, I don't have a crystal ball, and I don't want to take a position here to be the economic schedule is for the macro for next year. But -- so this -- also this guidance here is based on the orders and the supply capability which we have at hand for quarter four. But I can absolutely confirm no push-outs, no cancellations in core Industrial and Auto. And the one indicator which gives maybe a somewhat better feel on the longer term is the level of inventory sitting in the extended supply chains in those two markets. And from anything we can check and see there, that level continues to be super low. And that's why we continue to believe it should stay very resilient.
Stacy Rasgon: Got it. Thank you. For my follow-up question, I wanted to, again, I guess, dig in on the channel inventories. So a lot of the consumer stuff which is weak goes to the channel, it sounds like you're not shipping that into the channel, but the channel inventories are still flat. So are you shipping other stuff into the channel that's making up for it? Like how is the mix, I guess, of end markets within that channel changing as the consumer stuff is weakening?
Kurt Sievers: We will not speak about the mix because then it really becomes complicated. But it is not that we do not ship at all in the channel. We ship into the channel to keep a steady level of 1.6 months of inventory. So it's not to say that this is so dramatic that we have to stop all shipments. That's not how it works. We just -- we are very disciplined. Bill and I are actually sitting every week as we look at the sell-through and sell-in data with each of our distribution partners by segment. And then we make sure every week, that's not only at the end of the quarter, that's true for the quarter, that it doesn't surpass the 1.6. The change we wanted to communicate today is only that, so far, honestly, for eight quarters in a row, I was desperate to get it up. I mean, I would have wished we could have shipped more into it, in order to have a higher channel inventory. Now given those consumer trends, we are actually more disciplined to make sure it doesn't go higher, especially in those parts where actual demand is -- but it doesn't mean there is zero shipments.
Stacy Rasgon: I understand that. I guess what I'm asking is, is it fair to say, even if you don't want to go to the mix, the detailed mix that the consumer mix within the channel is lower and mix of other stuff is higher now versus maybe a couple of quarters ago?
Kurt Sievers: No.
Stacy Rasgon: No? Okay.
Kurt Sievers: I'm not sure why you think it should be. No, it is not.
Stacy Rasgon: Well, I mean, if the consumer stuff is so much weaker, you said it's 40% of your Industrial business, and a lot of it goes through the channel, and clearly, demand there is weakening. And it sounds like they're limiting shipments of that stuff into the channel. That's all. But the total inventories look the same.
Kurt Sievers: Yeah, Stacy, we are limiting shipments. But I mean I think about it this way. The industrial IoT segment is 18% of the total revenue of the company, and 40% of that is the consumer IoT, and that's still not at a zero shipment level. So it is not that dramatic from a change perspective.
Stacy Rasgon: Got it. Okay. That’s helpful. Thank you guys. Appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from William Stein with Truist. You may proceed.
William Stein: Sorry, I was muted. Thanks for taking my question. I'm hoping you might have some discussion in terms of the difference in demand levels and lead times and your level of constraints between automotive on the one hand and industrial on the other. I think in prior quarters, you've noted that industrial is even more constrained than automotive. That doesn't quite get the same level of attention. Can you update us on that dynamic, please?
Kurt Sievers: We really don't have it broken down that way, but we’ll still -- the key shortages in the core industrial are indeed continuing to be highly escalated and quite painful. So I think I can repeat the statement I made earlier that while there continues to be a lot of public reports about the shortages in auto and much less noise about industrial, in our case, in the core industrial, we continue to be as short as we used to be before. I said it earlier, I think, in the context of a different question. Say for the next couple of quarters, I think about four or five quarters, we believe after risk adjusting our demand, we should have about 85% coverage against -- that used to be 80%. So you see we are five percentage points higher, but that is not necessarily because the supply capability in auto or industrial has gone up so much, it is just that the consumer IoT demand on the other side or for the total company has dropped such that in aggregate for the total we come up to 85%. But it continues to be equally painful in auto and industrial than it used to be.
William Stein: Appreciate that. As a follow-up, I'd like to linger on this small pivot you're making in terms of the way you're dealing with the channel in your inventory. And I wonder if the company has evaluated potentially moving to a consignment oriented model, which would allow you to make even more control. There's only one company that I'm aware of that has perceived that in a big way this sort of an outlier in terms of how to deal with distribution. But I wonder if that's a growing thought given your approach that you're discussing today? Thank you.
Kurt Sievers: Thanks, Bill. But that's a quick answer, no, we are not contemplating that.
William Stein: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo. You may proceed.
Gary Mobley: Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to talk about one of your smaller businesses for a second, and that is the mobile side of the business. You highlighted what sounds like 8% upside to your Q3 revenue forecast for that particular business. And we step back and look at the full year. Based on your Q4 guide, you're going to grow that business by close to 10%, which is counterintuitive given some of the weak mobile handset-related data points. So what's helping you outperform there? Is it content growth, or is it inventory channel related?
Kurt Sievers: It's got nothing to do with channel or inventory, because we put the same discipline on all segments. Now it has to do with our strategy, which is really on content growth. Think about the mobile wallet. Think about the kicking in ultra wide bands. And we also have, I'd say, directionally, it's not black and white, but we have a bias to higher-end mobile phone market, which comparably is doing better this year than the very low-end Android. So I'd say, therefore two answers. Our company-specific content increase in share gains are working out. I mean, that is very much in line with how we put it a year ago at our Investor Day. And secondly, you might say we are in a good position because we are somewhat more exposed to the higher end rather than the feature phones, with the Android phones.
Gary Mobley: Thanks for that. As my follow-up, I want to ask about the latest US export restrictions. My hunch is you're not so much directly impacted from these US export restrictions. But I guess indirectly, can you speak to how it may result in some kitting issues in certain end markets and/or whether it requires you to change your manufacturing footprint?
Kurt Sievers: Yes. So first of all, of course, at all times, we will 100% make sure that we are in total compliance with any export control regulations, and so we are also after these latest changes. All of our assessment so far of these latest changes in the regulations show that, if anything, we have super immaterial impact on our revenues. When it comes to second or third order effect, which you were hinting to, also there I must admit we haven't really found anything, which looks like being an issue for us. But of course, we keep researching it. But at this point, I can only say no, if anything, only super immaterial impact.
Gary Mobley: Thanks, Kurt.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Matt Ramsay with Cowen. You may proceed.
Matt Ramsay: Good morning. Thank you very much. Kurt, for my first question, you were very clear about the trends in your Automotive business and the business continues to do quite well. And I think to an earlier question, you mentioned that sort of on a quarterly basis, the SAAR numbers and the LTL 3 penetration numbers of ADAS continue to kind of go higher in your own estimates. But how do you guys made any changes to those kind of mix and content assumptions in the next year or two just based on interest rates? I think a lot of us externally saw some of the data out of CarMax and some other sources and the auto. New car purchases are obviously financed pretty heavily. So is there any assumptions that might have changed recently in your forecasting based on some of the interest rates? That would be interesting. Thanks.
Kurt Sievers: Yes, Matt. So we -- I give you here two answers. The one is the short term. So when it comes to the guidance for Q4 is really based on orders at hand. I mean we don't -- it holds a bit done, but we don't make these strategic considerations for the next three months. This is really about orders and supply capability. Longer term, say next year, again, I don't want to say I have the crystal ball. So we use IHS typically for the SAAR, which I think just updated their forecast for next year for a 4% SAAR growth to, I believe, something like 85 million units. However, it really isn't that important at all. What really matters is the content increase, which has a lot to do with the mix to e-vehicles, premium vehicles and other features kicking in. So I think the whole discussion around interest rates and recessions looming left and right, I agree with you it could have impact on the demand behavior of people buying cars. But unless that drops incredibly far down, I believe that the content -- semiconductor content per car is actually dumping the moves on the SAAR itself. And that is for us much more relevant. But again, I mean, we don't guide next year. I don't know what it is going to be, but we really should more and more start to look at this as a semiconductor company and industry from a content perspective rather than a unit perspective in automotive.
Matt Ramsay: Thanks for that. Really it’s a tough, big picture question. But it’s the one that we’re getting. As my follow-up, I wanted to ask, in the automotive sector, you guys obviously have a strong position in BMS, so managing the battery. But there's two sides to managing the battery. There's actually running the car, and then there's the charging side and lots of conversation on why, one, in batt semis and what it means for fast -- onboard fast chargers. And I wonder, as a full BMS solution managing the charging and the discharge of the battery, is that something that you guys are looking into, not the manufacturer or anything applied against it, but buying it from someone else and doing a fully integrated both side of the battery type solution? And any thoughts there would be helpful. Really appreciate it.
Kurt Sievers: Well, actually, we not only look at it, but we work the system end-to-end. So we are also very busy with companies building and providing the charging infrastructure. I think we have revealed earlier, so I may use the name. We work closely with ChargePoint, for example, in the US. And that is not only on the charging, but that even includes payment to make this a very seamless process for the consumer. So our payment and identification and security technologies are also being included in this. So yes, we look at it as a -- from a total end-to-end basis. However, I have to say this still means we are not going into discrete power. So whenever these systems and wherever they need discrete power solutions, so like silicon carbide, this is not our focus. Our focus remains on the advanced analog and logic products, which we think is about 50% of that opportunity.
Jeff Palmer: Josh, we’ll take the next question please.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.
Joseph Moore: Great. Thank you. I know last quarter you guys have talked about the desire of the automotive companies to build up safety stock at the Tier 1 level. I think you talked about six months. Where are they in that process? I mean it definitely sounds like things are still pretty tight, but is there any indication that they're able to put any of that inventory into place?
Kurt Sievers: Yeah. Indeed, that is strategic requirement, which, in many cases, OEMs are and have been putting on Tier 1s. My guess is -- it's very hard to get the full picture of this, but my guess is that in some few cases, they start to be able to start building somewhat on a lot of those core products which are plaguing us and others from a sheer built performance perspective, they are very, very far from achieving anything in this, because, again, even before that would happen, the whole supply chain, the whole extended supply chain needs to build a higher inventory level. That's not just in one company, but it's just that the whole trade becomes more functional. So, I would say, given the end demand trends and how I would judge the supply capability of us and the industry, this will take all of next year still, before we come even close to that requirement.
Joseph Moore: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. One moment -- 
Jeff Palmer: Joe, did you have a follow-up or is that it?
Joseph Moore: No, I'm good, Jeff. Thank you.
Jeff Palmer: This will probably be our last question. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed.
Toshiya Hari: Hi. Good morning. Thanks so much for squeezing me in. I have two questions. First one is on pricing. I think if we take the midpoint of your Q4 revenue guidance, you're going to be growing around 19% for the full year. I think you gave really good color last quarter on how significant the tailwind is from pricing. If we can get an update on 2022 pricing, that would be great. And then your preliminary thoughts into 2023, again, from a pricing perspective particularly given, I think, the intent on your foundry supplier to raise pricing next year as well.
Kurt Sievers: Yes, Toshiya, so as a good practice, as we've done for last year, we will provide the full year pricing impact for calendar year 2022 in quarter one of 2023. It's still very, very dynamic, I would almost say day-in, day-out. So we will give you and provide you the aggregate pricing impact on our revenue growth for this year in Q1 of next year. From an overall dynamic perspective, we continue to see quite sizable cost -- input cost decreases to us. That is from the foundry partners, but there's also a lot of other inflationary cost increases. And, of course, we absolutely walk the talk that we stick to our strategy to pass on those input cost increases to our customers to exactly that level that we can protect our gross profit percentage. And seeing how the supply-demand imbalance in our core markets is moving into next year, I guess, it is reasonable to assume that we will continue to raise prices also next year. We are now so much to the end of 2022 that I think it's fair to say it's highly likely that we will also continue next year's prices, just following those input cost increases.
Toshiya Hari: That's helpful. Thank you. Sorry.
Kurt Sievers: Yes. Go ahead.
Toshiya Hari: Sorry about that. As my follow-up, just on how you're thinking about utilization rates and CapEx going forward, Bill, you talked about utilization rates being in the high 90s, given your comment on inventory growing in the quarter, my guess is you're keeping utilization rates to where they are but just wanted to clarify that. And then on CapEx, you mentioned you've had equipment delivery delays. Should we expect CapEx to be elevated into 2023, or is it a little bit premature to say at this point? Thanks so much.
Kurt Sievers: So let me quickly take the utilization, and Bill is going to speak about CapEx. On the utilization, yes, we will stay very, very highly utilized because, as Bill put it earlier, the majority of our internal front-end factories are working for automotive and core industrial. So that's exactly there where we see the strong demand continuing, and that's why the utilization rates there will stay very high. Bill, over to you for CapEx.
Bill Betz: Yes. Related to the CapEx, as I mentioned, we will do better this year, 10% going to 8%. And next year, we will be in the range between 6% and 8%.
Toshiya Hari: Thanks so much.
End of Q&A:
Kurt Sievers: Yeah. I guess that gets us to the end of the call. So in summary, I would say we are cautious in the near-term given all the macro uncertainty. However, under the surface, we see what I call the dichotomy, which is really a very disciplined approach to a weakening consumer IoT market, where we want to stay ahead of the game and not trap the channel while, at the very same time, we continue to be supply constrained quite significantly in our core industrial and automotive markets, where we try to do everything in-house and with our foundry partners to get the supply the soonest in line with the pretty resilient demand signals, which we are having. And that sets it for the call today. Thank you all very much. Thank you.
Jeff Palmer: Thank you, Josh. Appreciate everybody's attendance. That concludes the call today.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-07-26 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by and welcome to the NXP Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator instructions] Please be advised that today's conference maybe recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker host today, Jeff Palmer. Please go ahead sir.
Jeff Palmer: Thank you, Lydia. Good morning everyone. Welcome to NXP Semiconductors' second quarter 2022 earnings call. With me on the call today is Kurt Sievers, NXP's President and CEO; and Bill Betz, our CFO. The call today is being recorded and will be available for replay from our corporate website. Today's call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause NXP's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, the macroeconomic impact on specific end markets in which we operate, the sale of new and existing products and our expectations for the financial results for the third quarter of 2022. Please be reminded that NXP undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements. For a full disclosure on forward-looking statements, please refer to our press release. Additionally, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are driven by – primarily by discrete events that management does not consider to be directly related to NXP's underlying core operating performance. Pursuant to Regulation G, NXP has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our second quarter 2022 earnings press release, which will be furnished to the SEC on Form K and is available on NXP's website in the Investor Relations section at nxp.com.  Now I'd like to turn the call over to Kurt.
Kurt Sievers: Thank you very much, Jeff, and good morning everyone. We appreciate you all joining our call today. Let me begin with a review of our quarter two performance. Our revenue was $37 million better than the mid-point of our guidance with automotive and industrial and IoT above our guidance while trends in the mobile and communication infrastructure markets were in line with our expectations. Taken together, NXP delivered quarter two revenue of $3.31 billion, an increase of 28% year-over-year. Our non-GAAP operating margin in quarter two was a record 36%, 400 basis points better than the year ago period and about 30 basis points above the mid-point of our guidance. Our results reflect strong execution with better than guided operating leverage and profit flow through on the incrementally higher revenue on top of improved gross profit. Now let me turn to the specific trends in our focused end markets. In automotive, revenue was $1.71 billion, up 36% year-over-year near the high-end of guidance. In industrial and IoT revenue was $713 million, up 25% year-on-year better than our guidance. In mobile, revenue was $388 million, up 12% year-on-year in line with our guidance. And lastly, communication infrastructure and other revenue was $498 million, up 20% year-on-year in line with our guidance. Looking at the trends across our end markets, we are not naïve to believe. NXP is immune from the clearly weakening macro environment. We are highly alert and we review frequently and very closely several key indicators relative to the dynamics of customer demand versus supply, inventory per channel, per end markets and per geography. When we look at demand signals, we have a high level of confidence in the intermediate term outlook. This is especially true in terms of demand trends in the automotive and industrial markets, which account for the majority of our total revenue. While there is well documented weakness in the low end Android handset markets, it is important to note that our mobile business is more biased towards the premium-tier members. And in aggregate, our mobile business accounts for only about 12% of our total revenue. In terms of the PC and broad consumer electronics markets, there are much smaller contributors in the IoT portion of our industrial and IoT segment. In terms of customer behaviors, we do not see any substantial weakening within the auto and industrial customer base. Relative to long-term committed customer demand, a large percentage of our major customers continue to firmly desire our supply assurance, commitments which are facilitated by placing non-cancelable non-returnable orders with us throughout 2023. And currently, the level of NCNR orders into 2023 is greater than our ability to service. In terms of key operating metrics, which inform our short term decisions, demand continues to outpace our gradually and incrementally improving supply capability. Furthermore, even as we actively de-risk our existing backlog for potential double or any stale orders, we judge supply to only address approximately 80% of the underlying demand. Additionally, we continue to redirect shipments to those customers, which are at risk of going limestone thus avoiding excess or stagnant inventory buildup. When looking at customer inventory, we continue to see a dysfunctional supply chain, which struggles to get the right product mix and complete kits to the correct location in the extended automotive and industrial markets. Now, in terms of our own on hand inventory, it has increased through quarter two on a dollar basis consistent with orders placed with suppliers and internal built plans. The primary area of increase is in raw material and work-in progress in order to fulfill firm customer commitments in future and especially in quarter three. On a days basis, DIO was 94, an increase of five days sequentially and closer to our long-term target of 95 days. Now moving to the distribution channel, which services about half of our total revenue, inventory continues to remain stubbornly below our long-term targets. During quarter two, the months of supply in the channel was barely 1.6, which is about a month below our long-term target and it is now the seventh consecutive quarter of an exceedingly tight supply situation in the channel. Finally, let me speak to our ability to service customer requirements. Lead times continue to be extended with more than 80% the whole products being quoted at 52 weeks or greater, which is actually on a similar level to last quarter. So in summary against this dynamic backdrop, our second quarter and the first half of the year was a good beginning to what we view will be a positive year for NXP. We do continue to see the second half of the year greater than the first on an absolute dollar basis. Now let me turn to our expectations for quarter three. We are guiding revenue at $3.425 billion, up about 20% versus the third quarter of 2021 within a range of up 17% to up 22% year-on-year. From a sequential perspective, this represents growth of about 3% at the mid-point versus the prior quarter. At the mid-point, we anticipate the following trends in our business. Automotive is expected to be up in the low 20% range versus quarter three 2021 and up in the mid single digit range versus quarter two 2022. Industrial and IoT is expected to be up in the low 20% range year-on-year and up in the mid single digit range versus quarter two 2022. Mobile is expected to be up about 10% year-on-year and down in the low single digit range versus quarter two 2022. And finally, communication infrastructure and other is expected to be up in the low double digit range versus the same period a year ago and up in the low single digit range on a sequential basis. Let me summarize. The growth we have anticipated for 2022 is materializing, notwithstanding the clear macro cross currents and the continued supply challenges. We do continue to see strong customer demand in the automotive and industrial segments as well as within our company specific accelerated growth drivers. Overall, demand continues to outpace increasing supply. However, we are staying paranoid about the macro environment and hence we will continue to work very diligently and in a very disciplined manner to assure inventory across all end markets remains lean. And with that, I would like to pass the – Bill over to you – the call over to you Bill for a review of our financial performance. Bill?
Bill Betz: Thank you, Kurt, and good morning to everyone on today's call. As Kurt has already covered the drivers of the revenue during Q2 and provided our revenue outlook for Q3, I will move to the financial highlights. Overall, our Q2 financial performance was very good. Revenue was $37 million above the mid-point of our guidance range and both non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP operating profit were above the mid-point of our guidance. Now moving to the details of Q2, total revenue was $3.31 billion, up 28% year-on-year and above the mid-point of our guidance range. We generated $1.92 billion in non-GAAP gross profit and reported a non-GAAP gross margin of 57.8%, which is up 170 basis points year-on-year and both above the mid-point of the guidance range as a result of higher revenue and positive product mix. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $724 million, or 21.9%, up $98 million year-on-year, and up $36 million from Q1 in line with our guidance range, but below our long-term model. From a total operating profit perspective, non-GAAP operating profit was $1.19 billion and non-GAAP operating margin was 36%, up 400 basis points year-on-year and both above the mid-point of the guidance range. Non-GAAP interest expense was $97 million with cash taxes for ongoing operations of $150 million or approximately 13.7% effective cash tax rate and non-controlling interest was $13 million. Stock-based compensation, which is not included in our non-GAAP earnings, was $89 million. Now I would like to turn to the changes in our cash and debt. Our total debt at the end of Q1 was $11.16 billion, up $587 million sequentially as we issued $1.5 billion of new debt and simultaneously retired early the $900 million of debt, which was due in June of 2023. Our ending cash position was $3.55 billion, up $862 million sequentially due to a combination of the previously mentioned financing, CapEx investments and capital returns during Q2. The resulting net debt was $7.62 billion and we exited the quarter with a trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA of $4.96 billion. Our ratio of net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of Q2 was 1.5 times and our 12-month adjusted EBITDA interest coverage was 12.7 times. Turning to working capital metrics, days of inventory was 94 days, an increase of 5 days sequentially and close to our long-term DIO target of 95 days as we continue to experience incrementally improved supply trends. The increase in on hand inventory was primarily in raw materials and work-in process to support revenue growth and subsequent periods, especially Q3. We continue to closely manage our distribution channel with inventory in the channel at 1.6 months. Well below our long-term target, days receivable were 27 days flat sequentially and days payable were 94, an increase of one day versus the prior quarter. Taken together, our cash conversion cycle was 27 days reflecting strong customer demand, solid receivable collections and positioning for customer deliveries for future periods. Our working capital management and balance sheet metrics continue to be very strong. Cash flow from operations was $819 million and net CapEx was $268 million or 8.1% of revenue resulting in non-GAAP free cash flow of $551 million or 17% of revenue. During Q2, we paid $222 million in cash dividends. On a trailing 12-month basis, we have returned 132% of our non-GAAP free cash flow back to the owners of the company, consistent with our capital allocation strategy. The cash flow generation of the business continues to be excellent. Turning now to our expectations for Q3. As Kurt mentioned, we anticipate revenue to be about $3.425 billion plus or minus about $75 million at the mid-point. This is up 20% year-on-year and about 3% sequentially. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be about 57.8% plus or minus 50 basis points. Operating expenses are expected to be about $743 million plus or minus about $10 million, which is up about 3% sequentially driven by hiring, especially new college graduates and our normal project spend. Taken together, we see non-GAAP operating margin to be 36.1% at the mid-point. We estimate non-GAAP financial expense to be about $95 million and anticipate cash tax related to ongoing operations to be about $160 million or about a 14% effective cash tax rate consistent with our communicated model. Non-controlling interest should be about $13 million. For Q3, we suggest that for modeling purposes, you use an average share count of 265 million shares. Finally, I have a few closing comments I like to make. First, as Kurt mentioned in his prepared remarks, we have attempted to de-risk our Q3 outlook given the combination of the uncertain macroeconomic environment and well documented weakness in the mobile and consumer end-markets. Despite these potential risks, customer demand in the automotive and industrial remains strong and greater than our immediate ability to supply. Secondly, from a unique revenue growth standpoint, since November of last year at Investor Day, we discussed six accelerated growth drivers. Looking at our first half performance of 2022 versus the same period last year, we are very well on track to the targets we presented. Lastly, our people. We are very proud of our – all our team members globally, and especially those in China, who continue to overcome severe COVID restrictions while simultaneously dealing with global supply chain disruptions this past quarter. We continue to be amazed at our employees' incredible dedication and resilience. And for powering through these extremely tough times, our results are a testament to their hard work. With that thank you and I'll now turn it back over to the operator for questions.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our first question. Now, first question coming from the line of William Stein from Truist. Your line is open.
William Stein: Great. Thanks so much for taking my questions and congratulations on the strong execution. My first question relates to your reference to risk adjusted backlog. Bill, you've done a – both Bill and Kurt have done a bit of explaining that in the prepared remarks. But I'm wondering if you can comment on your nominal backlog and it sounds like the reasoning is related to more things you see outside of the company than what you see in your actual order trends. Maybe you can talk about the thought process and the magnitude of that risk adjustment. 
Kurt Sievers: Yes, thanks. Thanks, good morning Bill. What I try to convey is indeed, first and foremost, that for the foreseeable period ahead of us we are actually only covered with 80% with our supply against true demand which we see. And when I say true demand then that comes back to the risk adjustment. For good reasons we have never revealed the size of our backlog through the past quarters, because I think I have always been clear that we’ve always believed inside the huge backlog there might be double orders which is just normally human behavior in times of slowness. Now over the past quarters we have clearly learned much more from a transparency perspective about the true minimum needs of our end customers across all markets. And we have very rigidly applied to that knowledge to try and actually risk adjust that backlog in order to come to a number which is mainly more meaningful. And I just want to emphasize after doing that Bill we still have only that 80% coverage of our increasing supply capability against that risk adjusted demand. So what we try to say is we try to be realistic around the size of the backlog that’s why we risk adjust it and that is different in each of the markets we serve, the result of it leads in the foreseeable future to 80% coverage of that adjusted demand.
William Stein: All right, that’s helps a lot. May be the follow-up to that is pretty natural is what is the company doing to improve with internal capacity, your current foundry partners and is there any effort underway to extend foundry relationships that could allow you to sort of come closer to meeting your customer demand? Thanks so much.
Kurt Sievers: Yes, clearly we absolutely stick to our hybrid manufacturing model. We continue to believe, and I think the results of the past six to eight quarters have given good evidence of that that this is for the portfolio we are serving a very superior model of serving the needs of our customers. And what that means is that indeed we are working on both ends of the equation, about 60% of our current wafer supply is coming from foundry partners and that is more and more predominantly tuned into seamless logic processes. Especially, when it comes to 300 millimeter and when it is below 90 nanometers. And in there, we are definitely ramping up significantly our partnerships and our strategic collaboration with key foundry partners. We've spoken about this in the past, and that is also what clearly is helping us in the past quarters. In the coming quarter, we talked about the sequential growth going forward and incrementally increasing our supply. At the very same time, we are remodeling our own factories, which are all 200 millimeter facilities to be the prime place for manufacturing proprietary, specialty processes which are unique to NXP. And by moving out more of the CMOS to our foundry partners, we are creating more space internally in our existing facilities to serve the increased and ever growing needs for these proprietary technologies going forward. So that is a refinement of the hybrid model, but it's still important that I really want to emphasize, we stick to the hybrid model, which again has also allowed us to outgrow our key pillars in that market over the last six quarters.
William Stein: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question coming from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Ross Seymore: Hi guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Kurt I wanted to dive a little bit into the potential disconnect of you guys doing everything you can to manage the backlog, scrub it, appreciate what's going on in macro, but yet the guidance seems fine in the quarter. And you said you are going to grow in the second half versus the first. So I guess, as you look at that, when do you think it will start to be a little bit more apparent what macro is doing, if it stays like it is?  And maybe more pointedly, it's great that you are growing in the second half. But last quarter you said you thought you would grow sequentially in the third and fourth quarter. So does that growth in the second half imply that you would still believe you will grow sequentially in the fourth quarter?
Kurt Sievers: Yes, so thanks Ross. First of all, indeed, we try to make sure that you all hear loud and clear that we are not neglecting the cross currents in the macro, which have also started to be visible in our orders, especially in the mobile market. Now mobile is for us relatively small, so it doesn't really impact the whole company very much. But the principle we are applying is to be hyper disciplined and hyper paranoid to not grow any inventory down the chain. So, we try to stay there as disciplined as we can be. And the first area where we are applying this as we speak is in our mobile market and to a certain extent in the small portions of consumer, more consumer-oriented segments inside our industrial and IoT sector. Now, when you ask about the second half, yes, we are confirming within that more turmoiled macro that the second half is going to grow sequentially over the first half in absolute dollar terms. We just gave you the guidance for quarter three. I don't have a crystal ball for quarter four, but I can tell you that we remain totally sold out for the rest of the year. I also tried to highlight that supply continues to ramp up sequentially into the next quarters. So I cannot really make a firm assessment on what mobile and other consumer markets will do into the fourth quarter. But clearly from the strength in the automotive and industrial sectors, which we are serving, we are quite optimistic for the second half to also continue to grow sequentially.
Ross Seymore: Thanks for that color Kurt. I guess my follow-up one for Bill I noticed this was the first quarter in, I think, couple years that you guys didn't repurchase any shares. Lots of people trying to read into what that may or may not mean, but can you go into the thinking of what led you to stop the buyback for a quarter?
Bill Betz: Yes. First off, thanks Ross for your question. And I wouldn't read too much into it. First off, there is no change to our capital return policy. I stated many, many times we will return all excess free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis. During Q2, in my prepared, remarks, we returned 132% of our trailing 12 months for free cash flow. Remember we also raised our dividend in the quarter by 50%, and we still have authorization buyback of over $3 billion from our board. At the end of the year, we do expect to return to be at least a 100% or higher consistent with our state of policy.
Ross Seymore: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question coming from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
C.J. Muse: Yes, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question, Kurt, I was hoping you could speak to how you are thinking about the overall state of the auto industry. This morning since auto missed, but it looks like their second half prior outlook was perhaps a bit aggressive. At this same time you have OEMs that are waiting for those golden screws and hopefully we'll get those. But as I look at your mix, obviously EV and ADAS along with higher input costs and higher ASPs, are sustaining excellent growth for you guys. So, curious how do you see things playing out? And when do you think we can normalize in the auto supply demand side of things? Is that in 2023 or might that be longer?
Kurt Sievers: Yes thanks C.J. That's not an easy question. I dare to follow IHS in the first place, which, I think, hasn't changed the forecast for this year for the SAAR very much. I think they continue to speak about like a 5% growth of the SAAR this year, which would get us to, well, just short of 81 million cars this year. However, that includes a 9%, half two over half one growth in car production this year, which is not a big surprise because, I think, half one again has suffered massively from semiconductor shortages. And especially in the second quarter, it has suffered a lot from the COVID shutdowns in China, which impacted mainly the Japanese, Chinese and Southeast Asian car production. I mean, there was a little less pronounced for the Western world, but a lot in China and Japan. And mind you that China continues to be the largest car country in the world. So, from a shorter term perspective, C.J., I think half two car production will grow quite nicely over the first half, finally. And that trend should also continue according to IHS into the next year, which I think, will be another 8% growth or so. All of that in our views is still probably short of consumer demand. Now it will depend on the macro and looming recessions in different geographies to what extent consumer demand is muted for cars. But we think the car production is so low and so far below the highs in 2018 or early 2019 that even if consumer demand is muting, there is still a gap such that, I think, it's very realistic to assume the car production continues to grow. Now at the same time and I know we've discussed it to depth before, the bigger factor for us, however, certainly remains the content increase. And from a content increase, it's just amazing every quarter I come with new numbers here, especially EV penetration has accelerated again. I think the latest forecast for this year is now the 26% of the global car reduction is going to be XUVs. I think last quarter we talked about 23%. I mean, these are massive numbers and, and this 26% this year is in absolute terms of 46% year-on-year growth in XUV production. And again, mind you that with our battery management, inverter control and many, many microprocessors and micro controllers associated with XUVs and an overall semi contact which is more than 2x relative to combustion engine cars, this continues to be a massive momentum ahead of the car production, which in it itself is now also growing. So sorry for the lengthy reply, but we are quite animated about the fact that there continues to be a big gap there. And the content increase is pulling the cart for us.
C.J. Muse: That's very helpful. As my follow-up, I heard the earlier comments around absolutely adhering to your hybrid manufacturing model. But you did speak to optimizing your internal capacity. And considering the eight-inch 90-nanometer and above demand that's out there. Is there a point in time where you would need to consider a new JV factory with TSMC?
Kurt Sievers: Well, first off of your question, yes. Second half, I will not comment to, because the matter of the fact is yes what I described will very naturally with continuously growing demand leads to a moment where our internal four walls existing capacity, even after the reshuffling I described will not be enough to serve future demand. So yes, we will do something about it, but there is various different ways of achieving this C.J. So it don't get – got locked down into the idea with TSM. There is all sorts of options, which we can do including, but again, not exclusively, but also including the opportunities which are being provided by the trip techs in Europe and the U.S. where the majority of our facilities are.
C.J. Muse: Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question, coming from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Vivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. Kurt, I wanted to ask about NCNR orders and pricing dynamics. Let's say if auto production is flat or down next year, I'm curious how enforceable are these NCNR orders and how defensive will the pricing strength be in that kind of market?
Kurt Sievers: Yes, thanks Vivek. Let me start with the second part, the pricing. Given the very stubborn imbalance between supply and demand in most of the technologies needed for automotive I have a very high confidence that the pricing is very stable. I would actually, and maybe unfortunately go a step further. We do continue to see our input cost rising also into next year which would indeed force us to also continue to raise our pricing. So rather than thinking about pricing to become software again, I believe that especially in the automotive environment where there is supply demand imbalance is heading into next year there is a chance that pricing continues to go up into next year again. And I think I said it [indiscernible] a number of times, we have a very and very much transparent policy here that we are increasing our prices to the customers in line with the input cost increases, which we are experiencing in order to protect our cross margin percentages. So on that side from a pricing perspective even with a flat car production or maybe, as you said – as you suggested, which I don't think is going to be the case, reducing car production, I think, that would still be the case because of the content increases, which are driving so much demand anyway. Now the other side was the supply situation, per se, in a way I answered it, given content increases, surpassing the impact or out balancing the impact of the SAR so much, I unfortunately believe that even in a soft reduction of SAR next year, we would continue to see in many technologies, an imbalance between supply and demand next year.
Vivek Arya: All right. And then my follow-up is on the margins. So gross margins are getting towards the high end of your target. And I think EBIT margins, from what I see you are guiding a little bit above the high end of your target model, is it time to revise the model? And let's say if Q4 grows sequentially can margins also continue to expand? Is there still positive leverage in the model? Thank you.
Bill Betz: Hey Vivek, this is Bill. I'll take that question. So, related to the high end of our model, yes, we are performing at those levels at this current time. I would just like to remind everyone that we will focus on growing our top line or revenue and a faster growth at the top line of 1% will be greater and better than a 1% change in our margin as we go forward. We're not going to update our long-term model every quarter or every year. And we'll revisit this during our normal three-year long-term model that we provide, or if there's any material change to our business model. So no change, we feel very confident to run like I mentioned, last call in the – toward our high end of the model for the rest of the year.
Vivek Arya: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question is coming from the line of Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Gary Mobley: Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. I appreciate your commentary with respect to how you de-risked in your third quarter guide, the different macro issues and what whatnot. But want to ask conversely, what can go right in the last two plus months of the quarter to maybe hit the high end of the expectation as it relates to COVID mitigation in China, kidney issues, additional supply and whatnot.
Kurt Sievers: Well Gary, I mean, we give a guidance with a midpoint and a range in order to comprehend risks and opportunities at the same time. I think the elements you just listed are certainly part of both potential risk and potential opportunities. Again, we carefully thought about weighing the upsides and downsides, and that's why we landed on the midpoint of $3,425, as we just guided a couple of minutes ago. I would say the following. For us, the overall sentiment is given the big percentage in our revenue is obviously dominated by how automotive and industrial markets are going. And here a guidance for the next quarter is really driven by what we hear from our customers. I mean, it's such a short period of time in a way that it is really just tuned into the short term customer confirmed orders and our supply capability.  And the way I would put it Q3 upsides are probably more than anything dominated by our supply capability since we are sold out for the quarter.
Gary Mobley: Appreciate the color Kurt. As my follow-up, I wanted to ask about the six accelerated growth drivers that you began to outline [indiscernible] and continue to outline. Off the six I'm looking out over the next 12 months, which of those six would you expect to be the biggest contributor to your revenue growth?
Kurt Sievers: Well, the six – the six accelerated growth drivers. I mean, we guided them for three years. When we did our Investor Day in November of last year that was really meant us a three year guidance. And you've also seen there the relative sizes between them and the relative growth speed. And I think, Bill, in his prepared remarks emphasized that we are – what did you say very well on track Bill for all six of them? So I think the way you should look at this is that all six are very much intact, and the relative contribution of them is in line with how we guided them at the Invested Day last November. There is no change, but what I think is important to say is that they're all on a very – on a very good track.
Gary Mobley: Thank you, Kurt.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question coming from the line of Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Joseph Moore: Great. Thank you. You answered to your prior question you said you were going to be careful with sort of customers trying to build inventory, but there's also a clear message from your automotive customers that they do want to hold a larger amount of safety stock. Can you talk to that effort generally? Do you see that build having started yet? You know, where do you – do you plan to allow them to have to hold more safety buffer? And do you expect that to happen at the OEM level or at the Tier 1 level if that does happen? Thank you.
Kurt Sievers: Yes, Stacy [ph]. That is an important dynamic indeed. So in general I'd say the OEMs try to leave that challenge with the Tier 1s. There might be exceptions here and there, but the, the more general direction is that the OEMs put this on the shoulders of the Tier 1s. Size of that is varying. We see and hear about requests, which are in the order of three months. We hear others which talk about six months of inventory. It is also not the same for each product. They categorize, I think more into very single-source, very strategic products versus more commodity like products. So it has all sorts of variations, but I think first of all general message more with the Tier 1s than the – than the OEMs. Has it started yet? No. The supply capability at least relative to NXP product, I mean, I can't make that that comment for my peers, but for our product, no, it hasn't started yet. Any inventory built, which accidentally might happen at Tier 1s at the moment is indeed more related to the golden screw problem where it builds for a while and then it flushes through again when the golden screw product becomes available, but that's not associated with or because of the intended safety stocks. I believe that someone in the course of next year that will Bill in a more methodical way start to be – start to be built. I do indeed believe that towards six months might be a consensus many of them want to achieve, but again only – only in the course of next year.
Joseph Moore: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question coming from the line of Stacy Ragson with Bernstein Research. Your line is open.
Stacy Ragson: Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one, Bill, I wanted a follow-up on a comment that you might have made in, in passing. I know you guys had talked about the risk in Q3 backlog, but Bill, you actually said that you de-risk Q3 outlook. I'm actually wondering, did you actually reduce the revenue outlook that you gave coincident with some of the cautions that you talked about? I'm not sure you did because it also sounds like your supply constrained anyways, but was there any sort of reduction at all in your outlook given the macros that you're seeing and if so like how much was it and which end markets?
Bill Betz: Yes. So probably that is a matter of fact for especially the mobile market where you saw that we actually guided sequentially a touchdown since we are not overly but we are also exposed to the low-end Android players in China. And I have a total paranoia to not build any inventory there. So I'd say there is probably indeed a risk adjustment on, from the macro perspective relative to mobile in that particular part of our business. There at the same time in auto and industrial for the third quarter, I can only repeat what I said earlier. We are sold out and the revenue capability is much more detail mind by our supply capability in the third quarter. So it's a mixed picture where the maturity is, is clearly continues to be supply constraint.
Stacy Ragson: Got it. Thank you.
Bill Betz: The risk adjustment – let me take one more.
Stacy Ragson: Yes go ahead.
Bill Betz: The risk adjustment was also a longer term message which is really related to the assessment of about 80% supply coverage against demand. That is not just a statement for Q3. I mean, that is really a statement for the longer term period. I would go that far to say it includes very large parts of next year, actually where that judgment is done after risk adjustments and risk adjustments are also when we – when we get order patterns say in automotive from automotive customers and we add them all up and then we know what content increases should be. We know where the car production could possibly be next year. And then of course you see that all the different Tier 1s want to win market share. All the OEMs want to win market share against each other. And the sum of the parts is the bigger of what could be realistic. So then we make a risk adjustment to this because we know that the SAR can only be at a certain size next year. So that's, that's one of the elements, which I would label practically speaking risk adjustments, where we bring down what looks like overwhelmingly huge backlog.
Stacy Ragson: Got it. That's super helpful. Thank you. For my follow-up, I wanted to repeat a question somebody else asked it, but I don't think you actually answered it. It was run the, the non-cancelable non-returnable orders. We've seen these from other companies and it turns out in practice, maybe they're not quite as non-cancelable as they appeared. How non-cancelable non-returnable are your seeing orders really?
Kurt Sievers: Well, indeed. Sorry, I know that most part of an earlier question, I think I missed – I missed speaking to it. Well, it's like with every contract. There is clearly a legal system in place. But in the end of course reasonable behavior will prevail. What I can tell you, however is that so far every one of them has been – has been fulfilled. I mean, there is no – we don't see any in automotive industrial. There is no pushout, there is no cancellation. People want to have more products, now, how that looks at some time in the future, when maybe macro continues to change more, could be different. But fundamentally we put that system in place in order to make sure that our customers are serious. And think two times and three times about what level of orders they want to put on us and mind you that in many markets different products from different customers go into one end product. So we have to make sure that there is a proper allocation between them then otherwise the car company is only suffering in the end. I mean, if there is too much orders from one Tier 1 and the other one orders not enough, then it doesn't help the car company. That's another reason why we are really trying to put NCNR in arsenal place in order to hold people to the truth.
Bill Betz: Let me just add to what Kurt mentioned. What we said this year, NCNRs were larger than our long-term commitment. Of those NCNRs we can't serve to them all. We have started our process for 2023 NCNRs and they were tracking to similar levels as well, which we won't be able to supply as we go forward.
Stacy Ragson: Got it. That's super helpful guys. Thank you so much.
Jeff Palmer: Lydia, do we have other question?
Operator: Yes. Our next question coming from the line of Matt Ramsay with Cowen. Your line is open.
Matt Ramsay: Yes. Thank you very much. Good morning. Bill, I wanted to ask a question about OpEx in sort of the context of the macro environment that we're talking about here. You guys have with the revenue growth and the gross margin expansion I think growing gross profit, I don't know it'll be 75% or something like that from 2020 to 2022. And that's allowed for a lot of expansion of the operating expense while you're still getting leverage. And I guess the question is with inflationary pressures and wages and all those things, it seems like there's still some, some upward pressure in the OpEx line, and I just wanted to know what, what kind of levers you had to control that and what the priorities would be to control that if in fact the macro did turn? And would you be committed to sort of holding the operating margin flat or is there a case where you're going to need to keep spending despite what might go on in the macro. I guess just puts and takes on OpEx would be helpful? Thanks.
Bill Betz: Sure. Thank you for your question. Again, we continue to do very well here, as we are operating below the 23% long-term model. Q2 we finished at 21.9% and that was slightly better than our guide, and I think we just guided 21.7%. And again, that primary increase from an absolute standpoint is really being driven by our new college graduates joining the company and continuing R&D investment supporting our growth ambitions. Now, if there is a downturn, what will we do? We have a plan for that. It's well defined and it's all around protecting our free cash flow. Our plan actions would potentially include reducing variable compensation, reduced discretionary spending, reducing noncritical CapEx, we'll slow down our non-engineering hiring, and also right, our attrition runs around 10%, 12% we would obviously not back fill all of those depending on how severe it gets. But at all means we will protect our R&D engine of the company, which I've said in the past as well as Kurt is the lifeblood of our growth. And then similar with optimizing our costs, you have to remember the last two years we've been optimizing toward material shipments to prevent customer line downs, we haven't been focused on our mix or optimizing of costs or yields or cycle time. So that's another level that we have in our playbook to maintain our margins in our range that we shared during our Analyst Day.
Matt Ramsay: Got it. Thanks Bill. Quick follow up for Kurt. I was interested in your prepared script; I think you mentioned that the same sort of ratio of your product portfolio still had 52-week lead times as was last quarter. We get a lot of investor questions about maybe there's shortages of Part X, but there's inventory builds of Part Y and Part Z and things are out of balance. It doesn't seem like that's the case with NXP business. I'd be interested if you could comment on that a bit further? Thanks.
Kurt Sievers: Yes, absolutely. Matt, I guess that really has to do with the – with the mix of our end market exposure. So I would actually confirm that in mobile, we are probably moving away from supply constraints but those technologies are badly needed in other markets, which we are serving, which are heavily underserved while the demand there continues to go up. So it is of course a puzzle where we quickly try to redirect from where demand is softening, and again that's especially the low-end Android handsets. And some of the – some of the more consumer oriented products in China, which is little for us. I mean, that the whole point is this is not that much for us, but that little where we have it, we move it to other areas in auto and industrial, we are actually demand continues to go up such that in bottom line in the end we be unfortunately, and I really have to put it that way. We are still at a similar lead time pattern as we had indeed last quarter, which is did about 80% of the portfolio since at 52 weeks plus lead time, but it is different product. So that that's why I totally understand and support your question, it is not exactly on the same products because it's moving but in the mix it still – it still stays at that level.
Jeff Palmer: Okay. Lydia, I think we'll move to the last question for the call today, please.
Operator: Certainly. And our last question coming from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Toshiya Hari: Hi, good morning. Thanks so much for taking the question. I was hoping you can speak to trends that you're seeing in the China business particularly around industrial and distribution. I think historically it had been a fairly volatile part of your business, but clearly based on your overall industrial and IoT numbers you seem to be doing really well. So any sort of puts and takes around – particularly around the lockdowns going into it, coming out of it, any comments would be super helpful?
Kurt Sievers: Yes. So first of all relative to the lockdowns, I mean, we had indeed also risk adjusted our quarter two guidance, which had to do much more with supply than demand that was about epoxy suppliers, leadframe suppliers and others. And as you can see from how we managed to make our actuals work, some of that exactly materialized, I mean, indeed we sold it, however, we see now since June pretty significant and impactful stimulus programs by the China government, which are starting to take effect, and that's both into the industrial as well as into the automotive market. So there is a slight optimism, notwithstanding the risk of further lockdowns, of course, in China, but from a government stimulus program perspective, there is optimism both for the industrial as well as for the automotive markets in China for Q3 and for the second half of the year. I had – I think, mentioned it briefly in my prepared remarks our channel inventory is sitting still only at 1.6 which is very low and mind you that the industrial business of NXP and with that especially in China is dominated by the distribution channel. So a lot of that is in China, and as you can see it, it really hasn't moved up much. I think we had 1.5 the last two quarters, 1.6 before. So we are still hovering at that very low level, which is a month below our 2.5 target actually.
Toshiya Hari: Yes. That super helpful, thank you. And then as my quick follow up, separate topic but on the currency dynamics. Obviously you've seen the dollar appreciate significantly relative to other currencies and I recognize that customers don't swap in and out components given long qualification cycles and whatnot? But as we think about the competitive landscape and micro controllers over the next couple of years, just given how strong the dollar is today, is that something that we should be cognizant of and worried about as you compete with companies like STM and Renaissance, or is that not really a topic that we should be spending too much time on? Thank you.
Kurt Sievers: Yes. I'll take that one. Thank you for your question. NXP is a global company. We're U.S.-based we're naturally hedge against the Euro. So I'm not really too concerned about it.
Toshiya Hari: Thank you.
Kurt Sievers: All right. So I think that gets us to the end of the call. And let me just highlight once again, we feel we have operated well in the second quarter in a pretty turmoiled environment. We are also very cognizant of the of the macro cross currents, which we also discussed quite a bit in this call. Yet the outcome is that in the majority size of our revenues which is the industrial and automotive markets, we continue to be sold out. We think the underlying secular growth trends especially from content increases both in industrial and automotive applications are also providing a pretty safe landing going forward relative to demand. The one thing which we are very paranoid and very hard working on is indeed making sure that our inventory down the chain remain low. We think today they are low. We have evidence of this in the channel with 1.6 months and our whole focus day-in day-out is to make sure that on the one-hand we organize more supply. But on the other hand we make sure that there is no excess inventory being built in the market down there. With that I want to thank you all on behalf of NXP for today's call, and see and speak to you all soon. Thank you very much. Thank you.
Jeff Palmer: Thank you very much. This ends our call today. Thanks to everyone. Bye now.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen [indiscernible] our conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect today. Good day.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-05-03 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the NXP First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jeff Palmer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Jeff Palmer: Thank you, Katherine, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to NXP Semiconductor's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. With me on the call today is Kurt Sievers, NXP's President and CEO; and Bill Betz, our CFO. The call today is being recorded and will be available for replay from our corporate website. Today's call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause NXP's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, the macroeconomic impact on specific end markets in which we operate, the sale of new and existing products and our expectations for financial results for the second quarter of 2022. Please be reminded that NXP undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements. For a full disclosure on forward-looking statements, please refer to our press release. Additionally, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are driven primarily by discrete events that management does not consider to be directly related to NXP's underlying core operating performance. Pursuant to Regulation G, NXP has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our first quarter 2022 earnings press release, which will be furnished to the SEC on Form 8-K and is available on NXP's website in the Investor Relations section at nxp.com. I'd now like to turn the call over to Kurt.
Kurt Sievers: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining our call today, and I can tell you, after two years, finally, I do very much look forward to a series of in-person investor meetings through the rest of this week. Now let me begin with a review of our quarter one performance. Our revenue was $36 million better than the midpoint of our guidance with automotive, industrial, IoT and mobile at or above our guidance. So trends in the communication infrastructure markets were just slightly below our expectations due to supply issues. Taken together, NXP delivered quarter one revenue of $3.14 billion, an increase of 22% year-on-year. Non-GAAP operating margin in quarter one was a strong 35.7%, 480 basis points better than the year ago period and about 70 basis points above the midpoint of our guidance. Our results reflect strong execution with good operating leverage and profit fall through on higher revenue, improved gross profit and modestly lower operating expenses. Now let me turn to the specific trends in our focus end markets. In automotive, revenue was $1.56 billion, up 27% year-on-year, in line with our guidance. In industrial and IoT, revenue was $682 million, up 19% year-on-year better than our guidance. In mobile, revenue was $401 million, up 16% year-on-year better than our guidance. Lastly, Communication Infrastructure and Other was $496 million, up 18% year-on-year just modestly below guidance as a result of ongoing supply changes. Overall, the demand in our strategic end markets continues to be robust, putting our customers' requirements in excess of our improved supply capability. And in that context, let me provide some data points of what we see in our daily engagements with our customers. In the distribution channel, which services about half of our total revenue, inventory remains [indiscernible] only below our long-term targets. During quarter one, the months of supply in the channel was 1.5 months, which is about a month below our long-term target. And it is now the sixth consecutive quarter of an exceedingly tight supply situation in the channel. Internal inventory days continue to be below our long-term target of 95 days. In quarter one, DIO increased by six days with all of the increase in support of our growth outlook for the second quarter. Lead times across the board continue to be extended, with more than 80% of all of our products being quoted at 52 weeks or greater. Essentially, we are supply constrained for all of 2022. The level of inbound supply-related customer escalations continues to be elevated across all focused end markets and regions. And lastly, let me zoom in on the trends we see in the automotive market. In the U.S., new car inventory at dealers is substantially below historic levels at 27 days versus the historic metric of 64 days. The pace to xEV vehicle penetration globally continues to rapidly accelerate hitting 19% of global production in 2021 and is expected to hit 23% penetration in 2022 and moving to 30% next year in 2023. With xEVs having roughly 2x to semiconductor content, this is another strong secular tailwind to semiconductor content growth. The Ukraine war has disrupted predominantly European Tier 1 suppliers and OEMs with shortages of wiring harnesses. In China, the COVID-related shutdowns are creating yet another level of significant supply uncertainty. The extended auto supply chain continues to be very lean, with reported days of inventory at the Tier 1s and at the auto OEMs out of sync with each other. And lastly, based on our very frequent and detailed customer conversations across the supply chain, the Tier 1s and OEMs continue to be challenged by kitting issues to complete module and vehicle assemblies. These kitting issues are not due to one semi supplier or shortage of just one common golden screw device. Against all of this dynamic backdrop, our first quarter was a very good beginning to what we view will be a positive year for NXP. In the face of the loaded customer escalations and elevated lead times, we are proactively and relentlessly working with our customers to redirect material to assure that customers get what they need, where they needed and when they needed. And zooming out, customers have begun to much better appreciate and embrace the strategic value of semiconductors play in their long-term success both from an innovation as well as a supply perspective. Hence, as a result of our adaptability, the level of engagements with strategic customers is resulting in unprecedented levels of customer intimacy. Our engagements are unlocking new and significant long-term customer arrangements and cooperation that is closer than ever, which will enhance our relative market share over the longer term. Now let me turn to our expectations for quarter two. We are guiding revenue at $3.28 billion, up about 26% versus the second quarter of '22 within a range of up 22% to up 30% year-on-year. From a sequential perspective, this represents growth of about 4% at the midpoint versus the prior quarter. At the midpoint, we anticipate the following trends in our business: Automotive is expected to be up in the low 30% range versus quarter 2, 2021 and are in the high-single digits range versus quarter one 2022. Industrial and IoT is expected to be up in the low 20% range year-on-year and up in the low single digits range versus quarter one, 2022. Mobile is expected to be up in the low double-digit range year-on-year and down in the low single-digit range versus quarter one 2022. And finally, Communication Infrastructure and Other is expected to be up about 20% versus the same period a year ago and flattish on a sequential basis. Our guidance incorporates several items to be aware of. First, the year-on-year comparison of our auto business in the second quarter benefits from the easy compare versus quarter two 2021 when we were impacted by the effects of the winter storms on our wafer manufacturing facilities in Texas. Second, our Tianjin back-end facility in China is fully running at maximum capacity. Remember, we lost about one to two weeks of output during the early part of quarter one. And lastly, our guidance does contemplate several tens of millions of dollars of potential supply and logistical disruptions due to the lockdowns occurring in China related to COVID outbreaks. Now before I pass the call to Bill, I would like to provide an update on our ESG journey, something our management team and I are personally committed to. On April 1, we published our annual corporate sustainability report, which included the achievement of several goals. On a year-over-year basis, we have reduced our normalized carbon footprint by 11% and have increased the use of renewable electricity in our facilities to 31% of our total consumption. Additionally, we have realized an 11% normalized decrease in our water consumption and 76% increase in our recycling efforts. These are all solid and positive steps, but I believe we can and should do more. Looking forward, we have committed to achieve carbon neutrality by 2035. We have formally committed in the science-based targets initiative, and we are transitioning toward 100% renewable energy sources in our facilities. This will all be a significant task for our organization, and we are committed to providing regular updates documenting our progress. From a global employee perspective, we grew by 8% during 2021, despite a difficult talent market and women now represent 37% of our total employee population. To keep the organization focused on the sustainability journey, I am proud to announce Jennifer Wuamett, our General Counsel, has been named NXP's Chief Sustainability Officer, and she will oversee our sustainability program. Finally, to demonstrate that we, as an organization, are all responsible to improve the impact we have in our environment the NXP Board has approved that a portion of our employee annual incentive compensation will be tied to achieving progress towards long-term sustainability goals. Now in summary, the robust growth we have anticipated for 2022 is materializing in spite of all supply challenges. We do continue to see strong customer demand, especially our company-specific accelerated growth drivers. Overall, demand continues to outstrip increased supply and inventory across all end markets remains very lean. And with that, I would like to pass the call over to you, Bill, for a review of our financial performance. Bill?
Bill Betz: Thank you, Kurt, and good morning to everyone on today's call. As Kurt has already covered the drivers of the revenue during Q1 and provided our revenue outlook for Q2. I'll move to the financial highlights. Overall, our Q1 financial performance was very good. Revenue was $36 million above the midpoint of our guidance range and both non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP operating profit were near the high end of our guidance. Now moving to the details of Q1. Total revenue was $3.14 billion, up 22% year-on-year and above the midpoint of our guidance range. We generated $1.81 billion in non-GAAP gross profit and reported a non-GAAP gross margin of 57.6%, which is up 340 basis points year-on-year and both above the midpoint of our guidance range, driven by the improved utilization, higher revenue and positive product mix. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $688 million or 21.9% of sales, up $88 million year-on-year and up $7 million from Q4, which was below our midpoint of guidance and the lower long-term model. From a total operating profit perspective, non-GAAP operating profit was $1.12 billion and non-GAAP operating margin was 35.7%, up 400 basis points year-on-year and both at the high end of our guidance range, reflecting solid fall-through and operating leverage on the increased revenue levels. Non-GAAP interest expense was $103 million with cash taxes for ongoing operations of $122 million and noncontrolling interest was $9 million. Furthermore, our stock-based compensation, which is not included in our non-GAAP earnings was $89 million. Now I would like to turn to the changes in our cash and debt. Our total debt at the end of Q1 was $10.57 billion, flat sequentially. Our ending cash position was $2.68 billion, down $147 million sequentially due to capital returns and increased CapEx investments during Q1. The resulting net debt was $7.89 billion, and we exited the quarter with a trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA of $4.58 billion. Our ratio of net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of Q1 was 1.7x, and our 12-month adjusted EBITDA interest coverage was 12x. Turning to working capital metrics. Days of inventory was 89 days, an increase of six days sequentially. The increase in inventory was all in raw materials and work in process to support revenue growth and continues to be below our long-term target of 95 days. We continue to closely manage our distribution channel with inventory in the channel at 1.5 months, well below our long-term target. We anticipate the coming year will be very similar to 2021 where customer demand is in excess of incrementally improving supply. Days receivable were 27 days, down one day sequentially. Days payable were 93 days, an increase of six days versus the prior quarter as we continue to increase orders with our suppliers. Taken together, our cash conversion cycle was 23 days, an improvement of one day versus the prior quarter, reflecting strong customer demand, solid receivable collections and positioning for customer deliveries for future periods. Our working capital management and balance sheet metrics continue to be very strong. Cash flow from operations was $856 million and net CapEx was $279 million, resulting in non-GAAP free cash flow of $577 million. During Q1, we paid $149 million in cash dividends and repurchased $552 million of our shares. Overall, we returned 121% of our non-GAAP free cash flow back to the owners of the company, consistent with our capital allocation strategy. And again, the cash flow generation of this business continues to be excellent. Turning now to our expectations for the second quarter. As Kurt mentioned, we anticipate Q2 revenue to be about $3.28 billion plus or minus about $100 million. At the midpoint, this is up 26% year-on-year and up about 4% sequentially. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be about 57.6% plus or minus 50 basis points. Operating expenses are expected to be about $720 million, plus or minus about $10 million, which is up about 5% sequentially, driven primarily by our annual merit increases. Taken together, we see our non-GAAP operating margin to be 35.7% at the midpoint. We estimate non-GAAP financial expense to be about $103 million and anticipate cash tax related to ongoing operations to be about $154 million or about 14.5% effective cash tax rate, consistent with what we communicated during Analyst Day of 15%. Noncontrolling interest will be about $13 million. For Q2, we suggest for modeling purposes, we use an average share count of 265 million shares. Finally, I have a few closing comments I'd like to make. First, as Kurt mentioned in his prepared remarks, we have attempted to derisk our Q2 outlook given the uncertain macroeconomic environment and the potential impact on our supply chain. Despite these potential risks, customer demand for NXP products remain very strong in the markets we serve. Secondly, from a revenue standpoint, we expect our second half revenue to be greater than our first half on an absolute basis as we continue to work on improving supply. From a modeling perspective, think of a gradual quarterly improvement sequentially through the remainder of 2022. But this improvement is still well short of the demand signals we are seeing and constantly monitoring from our customers. Overall, we believe supply will remain constrained and challenging throughout 2022. Lastly, barring any significant supply disruption we believe our gross margin should trend in a fairly tight range consistent with our performance in the first half of the year. We continue to see the business as generating strong cash flow, and we will continue to execute to our well-communicated capital allocation strategy consistent with past periods. With that, thank you, and we can now turn it over to the operator for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.
Gary Mobley: Good morning everybody. Thank you for taking my questions. I noticed in the 10-Q filing that your purchase commitments were down about 10% from the fiscal year '21 end. Was that the high watermark for fiscal year '21 end? Or should we think about NXP perhaps reloading on the purchase commitments?
Kurt Sievers: Yes, hi, Gary. So indeed, it came down somewhat, which is simply a consequence of selling that part of it. So it's just the regular revenue, which -- so it was converted into revenue. Going forward, I would not exclude that we might again enter into longer-term obligations with our suppliers. Since the context and the environment of the, say, supply-demand situation has not fundamentally changed, which means we are effectively sold out for the rest of this year. Certainly in certain technologies and capacity buckets, we also see that demand will continue to outstrip available supply further into the future, so also going into next year. And with that, yes, I would not exclude that we also enter additional and separate supply commitments to the ones which are in place already.
Gary Mobley: Thank you for that, Kurt. Bill, I think you mentioned previously that supply chain increases were a headwind to gross margin or tailwind to gross -- excuse me, headwind to gross margin in fiscal year '21, but you would expect it to be a tailwind your price increases that is going to be a tailwind for fiscal year '22. Is that still the case and perhaps if you can quantify that tailwind?
Bill Betz: Sure, what we've mentioned related to pricing from our customers is that we're only passing on the higher input costs and inflationary costs that we're seeing on to our customers related to it. If I look internally, we do about 43% in-house on our front-end manufacturing side. And we are running in the high 90s compared to a year-ago when we were in probably the mid-80s. So we're maxed out internally from a utilization standpoint, expect our margins to be, as I indicated in my prepared remarks, to be at these levels, plus or minus the 50 basis points we talk about mix in any given quarter. Our #1 priority is really servicing our customers with as lines are down, escalations are occurring, and we're doing everything possible firsthand for our customers.
Gary Mobley: Got it, thank you guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Vivek Arya: Thank you for taking my question. Kurt, I had a question about just the quality of the demand signals that you're getting from your automotive customers. I believe you mentioned that days of inventory at Tier 1 and OEMs is out of sync because of kitting issues. I was hoping you could expand on that. And how does that impact your visibility and confidence in shipping to the automotive end market and give you the confidence you are shipping in line with demand. Because when I look at auto semiconductor sales and auto unit production, there is this kind of consistent, almost 40-point delta which was there last year, and it's probably there in Q1 also. So just what is giving you the confidence that you're shipping in line with demand, right, and that you're not over shipping just given the state of flux among your Tier 1s and OEMs.
Kurt Sievers: Yes, good morning, Vivek. Indeed, I mean that question, we also watch that very carefully. And I can tell you from continued very personal experience. So I continue to spend a good time of my work week in escalation calls, especially with automotive and industrial customers. It is actually to the point now on this kitting that we are here and there redirecting product because it is falling so short in places that we actually go back to other customers and ask if not, they have a few parts, which they only maybe need a week later and then we use that week to redirect the part to somebody else. So I think we are extremely close to the pulse of the production of our customers and our customers' customers. So this is a triangular supply relationship with the Tier 1s and the OEMs, which is why I have a very, very high confidence that we are not at all over shipping but actually barely meeting the demand. I would actually say Vivek the reduction we have now seen from IHS in the forecast for the SAAR for this year, I think it came down from something like 8% to 9% in the last quarter to now a forecast of only 4.5%, so almost halved. A good part of that is due to semiconductors again. So all of these modulations you see there in terms of possible demand is actually above what we can service anyway. So that's why we still fight day in, day out to try to fill holes and actually meet production demand. From a bigger contextual perspective because you mentioned again this striking delta between SAAR and the, say, the semi shipments into automotive, it comes back to the same points we had mentioned earlier, which is a massive and accelerated content increase, thanks to the penetration of xEVs. And I have to mention also premium vehicles. So what we did now is we looked at the combination of premium ICE vehicles plus xEVS. And if you put that in one basket because it has similar levels of semiconductor content, you actually find it's about 30% of the global car production already. And along that is double from the levels we had in 2017 or 2018 pre this whole turmoil. So our content increase continues to be an accelerating very strong factor. Then there is certainly a portion of pricing. There are the NXP-specific share gains, which continue to be very much in check, I would say, with our planning. And finally, there is this inventory situation across the extended supply chain to actually keep it functional. And I can only say it continues to be dysfunctional, so the overall inventory level across the extended automotive supply chain is still too low, which means the whole thing is totally dysfunctional.
Vivek Arya: Got it. And for my follow-up, Kurt, many investors are worried about some kind of demand slowdown, right, you've been talking about recession at some point over the next one or two years. How do you think about your trough gross margins if that were to happen, you have a very interesting hybrid model. So what steps would you take, let's say, semiconductor sales were to go down 5% or 10% hypothetically next year? What Steps would you take? And then how should we think about the bottom in your gross margins? Thank you.
Kurt Sievers: Well, Vivek, I would say, in principle, we don't guide here next year. And in the end, what counts is the model which we have given you in our Investor Day back in November of last year. Yes, I think I can give you a few bits and pieces to this question. Clearly, our gross margin benefits from utilization of our internal facilities at the moment. We are running full out. Secondly, and Bill just replied this to a different question. We are compensating our input cost increases with price increases to our customers. And I absolutely do not believe that pricing will go backwards going forward. I think the environment is simply such that we move now to a higher level of pricing. And this is to stay. So that doesn't mean that there are not ASP erosion again going forward but from that higher level. So don't worry about that impact on the gross margin. I think the pricing is a step function, which has been or is being achieved, and then we operate from the new level through the next years.
Vivek Arya: But the bottom of your range, the 55% to 58%, is that the right way to think about trough gross margins?
Kurt Sievers: Well, we've given the model and we have the absolute intention to stick to our model, yes.
Vivek Arya: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Ross Seymore: Hi guys, thanks for me asking a question. I want to ask one short-term one and then a follow-up will be a longer-term one. Kurt, in the shorter term, I just wondered, you talked about derisking due to a lot of the macro events. We've seen different companies say basically it's not having any impact. Others take a big haircut with little precision. Just wondered where you fall in that spectrum, kind of any more details on what you're seeing on China? And maybe is it a bigger or smaller cut than what you experienced in the first quarter?
Kurt Sievers: Well, so in the first quarter, I think we actually quantified it. I think I remember we said about $50 million, which is really what it was, which was this one to two week shutdown of our own Tianjin facility in the neighborhood of Beijing. For the second half, what I just said is a couple of tens of millions, which we see as impact, which is baked into the guidance, which we just gave you. Now what I think, how I would qualify this, Ross, is this is entirely a supply discussion. And I say that because I know that some of our peers talked about demand issues. I want to highlight that -- in our case, we clearly talk about derisking from a supply perspective. And that has to do with logistics issues in the Greater Shanghai area, and it also has to do with all sorts of suppliers from the Shanghai area into our own operations. Think about epoxy suppliers, substrate suppliers, et cetera. And that's the impact which is baked into our guidance. From a demand perspective, Ross, it's a little different. We -- in the meantime, I have numbers that solidly more than half of our customers in the Shanghai area are fully operational again. So they are running 100% of their operations again. And another third is say partially operational and rapidly coming back now. And during their shutdown periods, they pulled all the products because they all knew they would come back very quickly. We have been under shipping them anyway for 1.5 years now. So that's why that doesn't have any demand impact on us. So all of this derisking, Ross is a supply consideration and a couple of tens of millions. So I leave it to you how you want to integrate this from an exact number perspective, but it is about our supply situation out of the Shanghai area.
Ross Seymore: That's very helpful. Thank you for that. And I guess a longer-term question. This kind of goes back to what if the world isn't as good at some point in the future. Earlier in your narrative, Kurt, you talked about the closer relationship with your customers, more intimate relationship, value-add, et cetera, et cetera. I was wondering, does that change your inventory strategy? And the last couple of downturns, you guys were very aggressive to cut your utilization. I know you don't have standard products that are very application specific, et cetera. But to the extent your customers are giving you more visibility, you have that more intimate relationship, is your willingness to go above the 95 days in a downturn and not cut utilization is your willingness for the channel to hold more inventory? Is that at all different from prior cycles or do you think that you will run it with just as abrupt if changes with your factory utilization as you have in the past?
Kurt Sievers: Yes, we've been looking into this very carefully because indeed, we have certainly lots of discussions with our customers about longer-term supply assurance programs, et cetera. The solution to this is not to increase our internal inventory. So I have a clear-cut answer, Ross, no, the 95 days stand. I'm actually glad when we get there again because you see we are still below that. But no, we don't have an intention to change that because we kind of remodeled how we went into this crisis and what we find out is that even if we had more inventory, it would have -- it wouldn't really have made a significant difference to the whole situation at all. However, we are, of course, working with customers on all sorts of different models, their inventory at our customers in the chain, maybe distribution partners in cases is part of an overall package to have better supply assurance going forward. But one big element that you said it yourself is actually the transparency and knowledge about the ultimate end customer demand. I think in the past, we and I would dare to say the whole industry, we have too much relied on demand signals of our direct customers, not fully understanding and not having full transparency to the end customers. And that is something which in this relationship concept, which I mentioned, which has significantly changed over the last 1.5 to two years. So that gives me some confidence that we are in a better position to handle this going forward. Again, internal inventory is not going to be the one which is going to be changed.
Ross Seymore: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Your line is open.
Stacy Rasgon: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So my first one, you talked about revenues kind of like ramping incrementally sequentially into the second half as supply improves. Are there any end markets where you think supply is getting better or worse? Are you prioritizing any particular end market in the second half? Like how should we be thinking about that trend like spread across your end markets, just given the supply trends and demand trend you're seeing?
Kurt Sievers: Hi, Stacy, I think we are across the board continuously short of supply. So that applies to all of our four revenue segments. If I have to qualify it and I would say the worst case we have in industrial and automotive, so those two continue to have probably the biggest gaps between supply and continued growth in demand. And I also see that in those two, this is a longer-term situation ahead of us. When we speak about the gradual increase of revenue through the year then at least for this year, I would indeed say that is largely a function of supply becoming available, Stacy. So it isn't that much a question of what is the demand pattern in those four different markets. It is much more where are we coming closer through the year to the demand signal from a supply perspective. And as we discussed earlier, this is something -- it comes from different factories. It's internal supply ramping up. It is external, it's foundry supply going up, et cetera. So it's a pretty -- and it's also not the same each quarter. So I cannot qualify the revenue, the gradual revenue growth through the year by segment from a demand perspective because all of our supply is still under the demand signal anyway.
Stacy Rasgon: Thank you, thank you. So my follow-up, I want to revisit the China COVID situation, and I heard what you said in a prior question. But at the same time, like you're calling for maybe 1% or less overall impact to next quarter from China. You're bigger -- your competitor obviously was calling for 10%. I know you talked about maybe differences in what you're seeing in terms of demand versus supply. But I think both of you have more than 50% of your revenues going into China. How can that be that one of them is seeing demand issues, but think their demand issues were also logistics related. Why do you think you're not seeing anything along those lines and they are? Is it just the nature, you have a channel so there is a bigger buffer in China? Or what are some of the differences you think are going on that actually could be driving you to not see an impact along the lines of like some of the others in the industry just given the amount of your revenue that's actually going into that region.
Kurt Sievers: Stacy, obviously, I really cannot speculate and don't want to speculate about the specific strategies and situations of one or more of our peers. I just cannot. However, I can assure you that we put a lot of rigor and a lot of attention into assessing this particular question because it's been obviously very important for us to understand how to sit safely and confidently guide for this quarter in this turmoiled environment. Given that this is very near term, it is -- it really has to do with the order patterns we have on the books and with this particular customer situations we talk to. So this isn't much about strategic consideration, Stacy. It's really about what are we still getting out the next eight weeks of this quarter. And the bottom line of the analysis is, it is not about demand. It is all about the supply disturbances from this situation. And there, I feel we took a very balanced risk-balanced approach to figure that in. But again, I can't hold it against competitors because I really don't know what their exact chapters and other policies are.
Stacy Rasgon: Thank you. Would you have the supply to ship the extra if there was no impact?
Kurt Sievers: Yes, well the impact is on the supply, Stacy. That's the problem. So if we did not have the COVID-related shutdowns in the Shanghai area, we had a higher guidance. Absolutely, that's the answer. So that's what I tried to say. The whole reason of derisking is supply out of China. And that's a couple of tens of millions. And if that China zero COVID policy wouldn't hitting -- wouldn't be hitting now our Shanghai and possibly Beijing later in the quarter, we would have a higher guidance, yes.
Stacy Rasgon: Got it, thank you guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Your line is open.
C.J. Muse: Yes, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question, I was hoping you could discuss plans for CapEx. I know you're 100% sticking with the hybrid model. But your CapEx intensity is now up to, I think, 8.9% in the quarter. Curious if that's sustainable through '22? And how should we think about beyond 2022?
Bill Betz: Sure, C.J. This is Bill. As mentioned during last quarter and our Investor Analyst Day, our long-term model is 6% to 8%. However, we do expect 2022 will be a bit higher around that 10% and then come back within the range in 2023 and beyond. And just to look back again in 2020, we spent about 4.5%, 4.6%; at '21 6.9%. And as you can see here right, in Q1, we spent about 8.9%.
C.J. Muse: Very helpful. I guess as my follow-up question. Mobility was unusually strong in Q1 -- in your K or Q rather. You suggested strength in China, secure mobile wallets as well as early adoption of UWB. Curious how we should think about kind of those drivers into the second half of '22. And is it UWB that really is the incremental driver or just overall handset units? Thanks.
Kurt Sievers: It isn't really units. I think the mobile market, as we can all read is -- well, it's a bit patchy maybe globally. But we are still on this content growth strategy. I mean, in the end, it is indeed about mobile wallet and the early stages of ultra-wideband penetration and both are very much on track. The fluctuations between quarters is really supply related. I mean I talked painfully about very, very tough supply constraints in mobile in quarter three and quarter four of last year. And I was anticipating it would get better. It got better now in Q1, but it's not perfectly permanent. So I think this is a -- it was a bit of a catch-up from a supply perspective in Q1 not perfect going forward since you saw that we guided single-digit down actually sequentially into the second quarter, where, again, we also have to -- and this is a constant process we have to balance our available supply, very disfungible between segments to the extent possible. So we -- every quarter, again, in this current environment, we have to see where we have the possibility to that we are rebalancing between the segments where technology or capacity buckets are fungible with each other. And this is where it hits a bit the mobile one in the second quarter. So don't read too much into it. This is all -- it all has to do with supply between Q1 and Q2.
C.J. Muse: Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from William Stein with Truist Securities. Your line is open. 
William Stein: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the strong results and outlook. I'd like to ask if you could remind us of your capacity expansion plans overall. What are you telling your customers in particular as to how you're going to recover from the current situation and meet their demand?
Kurt Sievers: That's a big question, Bill. So what we clearly communicate and break also to customers, of course, a bit more out in more detail as we can do it here is, A, what we do with the 10% CapEx, which Bill was speaking about. And I think still 6% to 8% probably in the coming years against the significantly elevated revenue. So this is from an absolute amount of significant CapEx increase to fulfill that demand. Secondly, and I think that was one of the first questions in this call. We have these long-term purchase agreements with foundry partners, which are assuring us capacity corridors going forward. Now the way how it plays out is that indeed, we see this year, but especially the next year. We see more strong increments coming online from our internal capacity expansions in the front end. I mean we have this all the time in the back end because you know that the cycle time to -- from putting tools and getting capacity out is much faster in the back drop. This is an ongoing process. But if you think about the investments into the front end, which is specifically in our mixed signal and analog processes in-house, that we see the positive impact from those coming late this year and then especially next year. And we work continuously with our foundry partners to give us more access to capacity. In the end Will, that is why Bill highlighted in his prepared remarks that we will grow second half revenue of this year over first half revenue, with gradual increase quarter-on-quarter. I mean that normally, we don't do this full-year kind of directional guidance's. But this since we have that supply in line of sight, unbroken demand signals, this is where -- what it's going to yield. Mid-term, I think, Will, the industry will continue to have quite significant capacity constraints, especially in the field of trailing edge. So if you think about technologies, say, above 16 nanometers, so especially in the area of 28, 40 and 90, I do believe that the industry in the end hasn't invested that much CapEx. Most of the CapEx went really into the leading edge. While the demand for those nodes, which is especially from automotive and industrial continues to be super robust through the coming period.
William Stein: That's very helpful. Appreciate it. One more if I can. How much of the year-over-year growth achieved in Q1 and guided for Q2 approximately comes from units versus pricing versus mix?
Kurt Sievers: Well, I think Bill kind of hinted to this earlier. We are not passing price and units on a quarterly level, Will. We -- I think we gave you the information for last year where we said that pricing was a very low single-digit element to our growth in revenue. And you will get a similar information for the full calendar year 2022 at the beginning of next year.
William Stein: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Your line is open.
Blayne Curtis: Hey, thanks for taking my question. I just curious, when you talked about -- going forward, you pass through additional costs, gross margin kind of stable here. So I guess it is in balance. Just curious as you look to the rest of the year, do you foresee any increased costs going forward the way for back end?
Kurt Sievers: Well, Bill can go into more detail, and I think he also in his prepared remarks, he hinted to how we see this. So Blayne, yes, I unfortunately, given this inflationary environment. We can, of course, not exclude continued input cost increases. But our principle stance that if that happens, we will raise prices to protect our gross margins accordingly. Now Bill, I'm not sure you want to add a little bit to this.
Bill Betz: No, nothing more.
Blayne Curtis: Great. And then I just want to ask, you said channel inventory is about a month below where they should be. When you look at sequential growth in over the year, it does brought some seasonality in your core end markets. I was wondering if you thought that you would make any improvement in that gap in the channel inventory?
Kurt Sievers: Yes. Blayne, I wish we could. Again, I -- this is really the target of two and a half months, which we had held over years in the past is still our target. I am personally deeply convinced that it is a disadvantage that we currently do not have this two and a half months. So I wish we could get there. But we are just held back by supply. I mean the more we ship into the channel, it's being pulled through immediately. So it immediately translates into POS. So again, this is not a guidance, but I see little chance that we get this anyway near back to our target in the course of this year.
Blayne Curtis: Thanks Kurt.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Caso with Raymond James. Your line is open.
Christopher Caso: Yes, thank you. Good morning. The question on cash return. And last quarter, you did return more than 100% of free cash flow. Could you give us an update of kind of what your thinking is here? Obviously, the cash flow is very strong in this environment? And what are the plans for that?
Bill Betz: Sure. I'll take that. Again, no change in our policy, and we continue to execute to our capital allocation strategy. As you mentioned, we returned 121%. If I just look at the trailing 12 months, I think we returned 185%. We'll continue to do so. We raised our dividend in Q1, as you all saw, and we also got approval for buybacks. Again, we've been very consistent here and we'll continue to execute to that strategy.
Christopher Caso: Thank you. And as a follow-on, just another question on OpEx. And you talked about the 5% increase for this quarter on the merit raise. Does that tend to flatten out as you go through the year? And just generally, are you comfortable with the level of spending that you're at right now. I know some others have spoken about just kind of difficulty in hiring and getting access to talent?
Bill Betz: Yes, related to OpEx, we continue to do very well here. And as you can see, we're operating below the 23% long-term model. Q1 finished at 21.9% of sales, better than what we guided at 22.4%. We also guided 22% of sales, again, which incorporates that higher annual merit increases in project spend as we continue to manage and execute our portfolio to our strategy very well. I'm not going to guide the second half, but with all the different signals, we just provided on revenue and gross margin, and we should be probably trending below our long-term model of 23%. So we're not going to get to 23% probably in the second half.
Christopher Caso: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Ramsay with Cowen. Your line is open.
Matthew Ramsay: Thank you very much. Good morning, everybody. Kurt, there's obviously been a lot of conversation on this call about visibility and whatnot. But the one data point that really stood out to me was I think you mentioned 30% xEV penetration this year in the auto market in terms of units of production. And that was quite a bit higher than what we were modeling despite the bullish trends in EVs. So I wonder if you could give us a little context there. Is that supply constraints that are hitting ICE vehicles maybe more disproportionately than EVs? Is this new regulatory push? Is it infrastructure that's being build out more quickly for charging. I'm just trying to get an idea of why sort of a step-up or some bullishness on the xEV penetration? Thanks.
Kurt Sievers: Yes. Thanks, Matt. And thanks for maybe then giving me the opportunity to correct what at least you understood, I'm not sure exactly what I said. The 30% I quoted, Matt, is the some -- the integral sum of xEVs and premium ICE vehicles this year. And to break it out, it's about 23% XEVs and 7% premium vehicles. But I put them together into this 30% number, because from a semi content perspective, they are in a similar ballpark, which is this at least two to three, sometimes 3x of the average car. So sorry if that was not clear. So the 30% is the sum of premium ICE and xEVs together. Yes, the principal holds, which you said because the xEVs, I think they were more like 19% last year and moving to 23% this year. So this is a significant increase. And I think next year, it's going to be another significant step up. But again, it is important to understand that concept of lumping into this also the premium ICE vehicles, because that number that 30% I quoted there is actually almost doubled from what it was between 2017 and '18, where it was more in the ballpark of 15%. And so there is an accelerated trend both to premium cars and to XEVs, and that's an enormously strong driver to semi-content. The xEV trend, by the way, is clearly pulled by China and Europe. It is a little lower still. I think it's also going to come, but it's a little lower still in the U.S. And as you rightfully said, in Europe, that has a lot to do with legislation and tax incentives and stuff. And in China, I think it has to do with in a way, an ideal situation for the industry because they don't have a lot of legacy from combustion engine cars. I mean they -- many, many start-up companies there jump right away into xEVs.
Matthew Ramsay: Thank you for that, Kurt, and for clearing up the assumptions. As my follow-up, there's -- a lot of the call here has been focused on supply demand and visibility in the auto business. Maybe you could compare and contrast where you are closeness to customers' visibility in autos versus what you're seeing in industrial and comps? Thanks.
Kurt Sievers: Yes. Auto is very hard to serve because of the supply constraints, but the transparency is actually, in the meantime, very good. I mean it's a complicated supply chain. But I think we have now after exercising more than one and a half years, very close and standing relationships to the Tier 1s and the OEMs when it comes to these supply challenges. So I think the transparency is good. And that's why I also probably radiated here a solid confidence that we know that we don't over ship, because we have very clear visibility. In industrial and IoT, it is obviously more complicated because a solid part of the business there is going through the channel such that the channel inventory, which we discussed earlier, the one and a half months, which is stubbornly low, is probably the best indicator we have there. That doesn't exclude the fact that also in Industrial and IoT, we are serving well-known, very big customers. I mean it doesn't harm to mention names like maybe Honeywell or Schneider or Siemens. I mean that kind of customers. We, of course, also serve and that's the more direct where we have a similar visibility level like in automotive. And I'm afraid I have to say I fear at the moment at least for us, for NXP, the shortages in industrial are even worse than in automotive.
Operator: Thank you. And our last question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Toshiya Hari: Hi, Good morning. Thanks so much for squeezing me and Kurt, in response to a question, you talked about your wafer processing capacity, potentially taking kind of a leg up in 2023. Can you help us quantify how much your capacity been increase there? And related to that, consistent with what you said at your Analyst Day, you mentioned that capital intensity in the business should revert lower in 2023. Throughout the call, you sounded really, really confident about the sustainability of demand here and how in some of the more mature nodes, you're kind of in the structural undersupply. Why not keep investing at a high level in '23 and beyond?
Kurt Sievers: Yes. That is actually because the level we need to achieve, Toshiya, with our own wafer facilities will then be satisfied to the possibilities we have. So that doesn't necessarily mean it closes all the gaps to demand, but it's as much as we can do with the four walls and the facilities we have. That does not mean, of course, that we would not continue to push very hard to get a higher supply from our foundry partners. And because in the end, within our hybrid manufacturing strategy the share of external foundry supply to NXP is only going to grow. I think we are currently at a 55% to 45% level, so 55% external, 45% internal. And I would there to forecast that this -- it will not take that long. It's going to be more like 60-40, et cetera. So that's why if you think about a revenue generation and customer satisfaction from that perspective, then the internal part on the mid-term is actually the smaller part of this. And the bigger part is coming from the foundries. And of course, they keep investing and we keep getting there more.
Toshiya Hari: Got it. That's helpful. And then finally, as my follow-up. I think in your prepared remarks, you talked about supply issues in Q1 driving the very slight miss and comms. Can you sort of elaborate on that? And has that been resolved at this point? Thank you.
Kurt Sievers: Yes, that's just -- it's just the normal stuff. I mean we have our LDMOS production in the RF comms business, which is running in those facilities, which are also serving automotive and industrial customers, and they are just full. So we were too ambitious, to be honest. I mean it's just a couple of million in the end, but we were too ambitious in what we could get out to these comms customers. So nothing dramatic in the end because you saw it also -- it still continued to grow very nicely from a year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter perspective. But we just had a two ambitious plan from an output perspective, but nothing special in a way.
Kurt Sievers: Now with that, I guess we get to the end of the call. So many thanks for attending this morning. In summary, I would say that we very rigorously reviewed the quarter two guide given this uncertain situation out of China. I want to highlight again, we see this as a pure supply challenge. But we feel now very confident with the forecast, which we have given you that this is in line what we will achieve. And from a more longer-term perspective, I think the anticipated strong growth for the year is materializing, second half ahead of first half and we see a continued imbalance between supply and demand through the whole year, especially in our strategic segments of automotive and industrial, which have very secular growth trends. With that, many thanks, and I look forward to seeing some of you in-person later through the week. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-02-01 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the NXP Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.  I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jeff Palmer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Jeff Palmer: Thank you, Katherine, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the NXP Semiconductors fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. With me on the call today is Kurt Sievers, NXP's President and CEO; and Bill Betz, our CFO. The call today is being recorded and will be available for replay from our corporate website. Today's call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause NXP's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, the macroeconomic impact on specific end markets in which we operate, the sale of new and existing products and our expectations for financial results for the first quarter of 2022. Please be reminded that NXP undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements. For a full disclosure on forward-looking statements, please refer to our press release. Additionally, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are driven primarily by discrete events that management does not consider to be directly related to NXP's underlying core operating performance. Pursuant to Regulation G, NXP has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our fourth quarter 2021 earnings press release, which will be furnished to the SEC on Form 8-K and available on NXP's website in the Investor Relations section at nxp.com. Before we start the call today, I'd like to highlight, NXP will be attending the Morgan Stanley TMT Conference in San Francisco on March 7 and 8.  Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Kurt.
Kurt Sievers: Thank you very much, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. We really appreciate you all joining our call today. I will review both our quarter 4 and our full year 2021 performance, and then I will discuss our guidance for quarter 1. Beginning with quarter 4, our revenue was $39 million better than the midpoint of our guidance with most end markets stronger than planned and with the trends in the communication infrastructure markets more in line with our expectations. Taken together, NXP delivered quarter 4 revenue of $3.04 billion, an increase of 21% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin in quarter 4 was a strong 34.9%, 440 basis points better than the year ago period and about 110 basis points above the midpoint of our guidance. Year-on-year outperformance was largely due to the impact of improved factory utilization and higher revenues. For the full year, revenue was a record $11.06 billion, an increase of 28% year-over-year. And as 2021 progressed, our customers continue to accelerate orders on NXP. We consistently found ourselves in a situation where robust demand outstripped available supply even as production levels both internally and from our supply partners improved across the year. We do anticipate a continuation of strong demand throughout 2022, likely better than we originally contemplated at our recent Investor Day in November. The full year non-GAAP operating margin was solid 32.9%, a 700 basis point improvement as a result of improved factory loadings, higher revenue and positive leverage on our operating expenses. Now, let me turn to the specific trends in our focus end markets. In Automotive, full year revenue was $5.49 billion, up 44% year-on-year, a reflection of the strong company-specific product drivers we noted at our Investor Day, the step-up in content per vehicle as OEMs prioritized premium vehicles in a limited supply environment and the accelerated transition towards electric vehicles, which have fundamentally higher semiconductor content. For quarter 4, Automotive revenue was $1.55 billion, up 30% versus the year ago period and slightly better than our guidance. Moving to Industrial and IoT. Full year revenue was $2.41 billion, up 31% year-on-year, driven by our solutions offering with a combination of industrial and crossover processes, wireless connectivity and our analog attached products, all driving the year-on-year growth. For quarter 4, Industrial and IoT revenue was $661 million, up 29% versus the year ago period and better than our guidance. In Mobile, full year revenue was $1.41 billion, up 13% year-on-year. During the year, we experienced continued strong adoption of our secure mobile wallet and early ramps of secure ultra-wideband solutions and a good traction for our mobile-embedded power solutions. These positive trends were modestly offset by a discontinuation of certain custom analog products. For quarter 4, mobile revenue was $374 million, down 9% versus the year ago period and better than our guidance. Lastly, I will move to Communication Infrastructure and Other. Full year revenue was $1.75 billion, up 3% year-over-year. The year-on-year growth was due to a rebound in demand for secure transit, tagging and access solutions as well as solid demand for RF power products for the cellular base station market, somewhat tempered by the anticipated moderation in demand for network processing solutions. For quarter 4, revenue was $457 million, up 16% year-on-year and in line with our guidance. In review, 2021 was an excellent year for NXP. We experienced significant design win traction across the entire portfolio and especially within the areas of our strategic growth drivers. Our priority has been to assure the health and safety of all our employees. And it is their engagement and performance which has been truly outstanding. We are extremely proud of their adaptability, dedication and hard work in the face of adversity. Now before I will turn to our expectations for quarter 1, I'd like to offer you some perspective on the coming year. For those who were able to join us at our recent Investor Day in November, you will remember, we offered a positive view of 2022, expecting revenue growth near the high end of our 8% to 12% long-term growth target. Now as we enter into early 2022, we are more optimistic about the opportunities in front of us, both in the short term as well as over the intermediate horizon. The demand signals from our customers continue to be very strong. Inventories across all end markets appear very lean, and our ability to supply continues to improve. Hence, we anticipate 2022 will be another year of demand/supply imbalance with lead times extending out across almost the entire portfolio and the level and intensity of supply-related escalation conversations with our customers remains elevated. Against this backdrop, we are guiding quarter 1 revenue at $3.1 billion, up about 21% versus the first quarter of 2021, within a range of up 18% to up 24% year-on-year. And from a sequential perspective, this represents growth of about 2% at the midpoint versus the prior quarter. At the midpoint, we anticipate the following trends in our business. Automotive is expected to be up in the mid-20% range versus quarter 1 '21 and flat versus quarter 4 '21. Industrial and IoT is expected to be up mid-teens year-on-year and flat versus quarter 4 '21. Mobile is expected to be up about 10% year-on-year and up in the low single-digit range versus quarter 4 '21. And finally, Communication Infrastructure and Other is expected to be up in the low 20% range versus the same period a year ago and up in the low double-digit range on a sequential basis. In summary, we do continue to see growing customer demand outstripping our improving supply as the inventory across all end markets remains very lean. Customer engagement levels and design win momentum in our strategic focus areas continue to be very positive. This underpins our continued confidence of robust growth throughout 2022, and we do continue to be very optimistic about the long-term potential of NXP. Now, at this point, I would like to pass the call over to you, Bill, for a review of our financial performance.
Bill Betz: Thank you, Kurt, and good morning to everyone on today's call. As Kurt has already covered the drivers of the revenue during Q4 and provided our revenue outlook for Q1, I will move to the financial highlights. Overall, our Q4 financial performance was very good. Revenue was above the midpoint of our guidance range, and both non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP operating profit were above the high end of our guidance. I will first provide full year highlights and then move to the Q4 results. Full year revenue for 2021 was $11.06 billion, up 28% year-on-year. We generated $6.21 billion in non-GAAP gross profit and reported a non-GAAP gross margin of 56.1%, up 500 basis points year-on-year as a result of increased internal factory utilization, higher revenue levels and product mix. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $2.56 billion or 23.2% of the revenue, in line with our long-term model. Total non-GAAP operating profit was $3.64 billion, up 63% year-on-year. This reflects a non-GAAP operating margin of 32.9%, up 700 basis points year-on-year and consistent with our long-term financial model. Non-GAAP interest expense was $365 million. Cash taxes for ongoing operations were $276 million. Non-controlling interest of $35 million. And stock-based compensation, which is not included in our non-GAAP earnings, was $353 million. Full year cash flow highlights includes $3.08 billion in cash flow from operations, $766 million in net CapEx investments, resulting in $2.31 billion of non-GAAP free cash flow or a solid 21% of revenue. During 2021, we repurchased 20.6 million shares for a total of $4.02 billion and paid cash dividends of $562 million. In total, we returned for that $4.58 billion to our owners, which was nearly 200% of the total non-GAAP free cash flow generated during the year. Now moving to the details of Q4. Total revenue was $3.04 billion, up 21% year-on-year and above the midpoint of our guidance range. We generated $1.74 billion in non-GAAP gross profit and reported a non-GAAP gross margin of 57.3%, up 440 basis points year-on-year and above the upper end of our guidance range, driven by improved utilization, higher revenue and product mix. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $681 million or 22.4%, up $118 million year-on-year and up $24 million from Q3, in line with the midpoint of our guidance and again, consistent with our long-term model. From a total operating profit perspective, non-GAAP operating profit was $1.06 billion. And non-GAAP operating margin was 34.9%, up 440 basis points year-on-year, which is above the high end of our guidance, reflecting solid fall-through and operating leverage on the increased revenue level. Non-GAAP interest expense was $93 million, with cash taxes for ongoing operations of $100 million, and non-controlling interest was $8 million. Stock-based compensation, which is not included in our non-GAAP earnings, was $88 million. Now I would like to turn to the changes in our cash and debt. Our total debt at the end of Q4 was $10.57 billion, up $979 million sequentially as we issued $2 billion of new notes at very attractive rates with longer durations and retired early the 2022 $1 billion notes with a rate of 3.875%. Our ending cash position was $2.83 billion, up $527 million sequentially due to the cumulative effect of the previous note debt repayments, capital returns increased CapEx investments and cash generation during Q4. The resulting net debt was $7.74 billion, and we exited the quarter with a trailing month adjusted EBITDA of $4.23 billion. Our ratio of net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of Q4 was 1.8x. And our 12-month adjusted EBITDA interest coverage was 11.6x. Cash flow generation of the business continues to be excellent, and our balance sheet continues to be very strong. During Q4, we paid $150 million in cash dividends and repurchased $750 million of our shares. Subsequent to the end of Q4, between January 1 and January 31, 2022, we repurchased an additional $400 million of our shares via a 10b5-1 program. Additionally, the NXP Board of Directors has authorized an incremental $2 billion in the company's repurchase capacity, bringing total new authorization and remaining authorization to $3.35 billion. Further, the Board has approved a 50% increase in the quarterly cash dividend, bringing the quarterly cash dividend to $0.845 per share. These actions are all aligned with our capital allocation strategy that we continue to execute to. Turning to working capital metrics. Days of inventory was 83 days, a decrease of 2 days sequentially, which is below our long-term target. We continue to closely manage our distribution channel with inventory in the channel at 1.5 months, also below our long-term targets. Both metrics reflect the continuation of customer shipments at a robust pace combined with supply challenges we continue to experience. We anticipate the coming year will be very similar to 2021, where customer demand is in excess of available supply. Days receivable were 28 days, down 3% sequentially. And days payable were 87%, an increase of 4 days versus the prior quarter as we continue to increase orders with our suppliers. Taken together, our cash conversion cycle was 24 days, an improvement of 9 days versus the prior quarter, reflecting strong customer demand, solid receivable collections and positioning for customer deliveries in future periods. Cash flow from operations was $785 million, and net CapEx was $266 million, resulting in a non-GAAP free cash flow of $519 million. Turning now to our expectations in the first quarter. As Kurt mentioned, we anticipate Q1 revenue to be about $3.1 billion, plus or minus about $75 million. At the midpoint, this is up 21% year-on-year and 2% sequentially. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be about 57.3%, plus or minus 50 basis points. Operating expenses are expected to be about $693 million, plus or minus about $10 million. Taken together, we see non-GAAP operating margin to be about 35% at the midpoint. We estimate non-GAAP financial expense to be about $105 million and anticipate cash tax related to ongoing operations to be about $125 million. Non-controlling interest will be about $9 million. For Q1, we suggest for modeling purposes, you use an average share count of 266 million shares. Finally, I have a few closing comments I'd like to make. First, as a housekeeping reminder, we anticipate our cash tax payments will trend towards 15% in 2022 based on the current U.S. tax legislation and law. As can be seen in our Q1 guidance, we are expecting a slightly lower tax rate in the short term and anticipate it will increase as we progress through the year. Secondly, we are investing to support our more profitable long-term growth. We currently have about $4 billion of long-term material supply obligations as discussed at the Investor Day. Our CapEx investments for 2022 will be above the high end of our long-term CapEx model. These investments are focused on the combination of assured external foundry wafer supply, expansion of our internal back-end capacity and a modest expansion of our internal front-end capabilities. While significant, the investments we are committed to are more than balanced by the robust level of non-cancelable, nonreturnable orders from our customers. In closing, we are very confident in our profitable growth over the intermediate to long term, especially in the key areas of the Accelerate growth drivers as we highlighted during Investor Day. Our gross profit will continue to expand. And we have demonstrated solid control over our operating expenses while consistently investing in those areas which will enable our long-term growth. Together, these results in solid operating profit leverage and robust cash flow generation. And lastly, we have a proven track record of returning all excess free cash flow to our owners via our clear capital return policy. With that, I'd like to turn it back to the operator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore: I guess, Kurt, the first question I have is on the full year commentary. At the Analyst Meeting, you talked about, I guess, at the high end of your range before about 12%, and now you're saying better than that. What changed? And do you have the supply necessary to grow sequentially through the year to what seems to be something that in the mid-teens, roughly, that you're guiding to now? 
Kurt Sievers: Yes. Hey, good morning, Ross. Thanks for your question. Indeed, the commentary I made is that we have grown optimism that we can grow above the high end of our long term growth range which was 8% to 12%, so about 12%. So, indeed. Yes, we do have the supply capability. We are gradually building more supply capability through the year. It's a huge amount of different actions, both in our own back-end test and assembly sites, in our internal front-ends. And mind you, that this year, we will be running full out with our internal front-end factories. While last year, we had the winter storm taking capacity away and we had only started to ramp the factories full up during the first and second quarter. So from a year-on-year perspective alone, that does give us more supply. But also with third-party foundry suppliers, and Bill just mentioned our supply commitments and obligations here, we purchase from our prospective obligations here. We are growing our supply capabilities. So yes, the supply capability is here. And while we will not guide the full year, Ross, it was still important I felt to make that comment because the demand situation has continued to be very, very strong. And I say continue to be very strong since our Investor Day in November. And we see the inventories, both our own ones, and I think we talked about the 83 days, we talked about the channel inventory even coming a little bit down. But also at our customers, we think inventories continue to be super lean such that we see the potential of outgrowing the 12% high end of our long-term growth trajectory.
Ross Seymore: I guess as my follow-up, just sticking on the revenue line, it's been going a little shorter term for the first quarter. Are there any specific dynamics that are keeping automotive and industrial flat sequentially? Is it simply a supply issue? I think that's the first time in, I don't know, 6 quarters that those will have been flat sequentially. So the dichotomy between auto and industrial flat and the relatively smaller segments growing was a little surprising to me. So any color on those dynamics would be helpful.
Kurt Sievers: Yes, it is actually totally supply regulated. I mean we have more than enough demand. It is all a function of supply. And maybe here, it is worthwhile to note that you all might have seen that in the City of Tianjin in China, there was a controlled movement order, which actually meant factory shutdowns. One of our test and assembly back-end sites is Tianjin. So we had a factory shutdown there for between 1 and 2 weeks. Think about maybe $50 million impact for the first quarter. And that is all sitting on industrial and auto, which is another factor which is actually hampering supply a little bit further than we would have wished into the first quarter. Mobile, on the other hand side, Ross, you know that the last 2 quarters, we've been really struggling with supply in mobile. I think we talked about this consistently in the call. This starts to get better, which actually helps us to start to do much better in Mobile. So all of the, say, the movements quarter-on-quarter are much more a function of supply capability rather than demand.
Operator: Our next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore.
Christopher Muse: I guess first question on gross margins. You're 70 bps away from the high end of your target. And in your prepared remarks, Bill, you talked about expectations for gross margins to continue to expand. So curious how you're thinking about upward bias here in '22? And then moreover, I guess, '23, '24 as new products that carry higher margins come through the model?
Bill Betz: Hi, C.J., yes, for the rest of the year, we're not guiding. But our goal was to maintain, I'd say, a gross margin in the 57% range with the pluses and minuses we continue to talk about in any given quarter. Kurt just mentioned about the slight impact with Tianjin, which is impacting our margin a little bit in Q1. But that is offset by the higher revenue and volume that we're experiencing quarter-over-quarter by $60 million. So that kind of keeps it flat there for Q1. As we go forward, again, mix will play an important role as we are supply constrained. And then over the long, long term, as we talked about, is really driven by our new product introductions out further.
Christopher Muse: Very helpful. And as my follow-up, I guess, Kurt, you talked in your prepared remarks about making real traction with some of the newer products. And I know, in particular, on the S32 domain processor side, there's significant architectural decisions being made today by your potential customers. So curious, any update in terms of the traction there? And I guess how to think about maybe some of these new products? And which we should be focused on in terms of driving real incremental growth into '23, '24?
Kurt Sievers: Yes, C.J., absolutely. I think at Investor Day, we tried to give a bit more of the deep dive on where we are in this area. And it's indeed especially about what we call the S32 platform, which is a software compatible growing family of products, mainly for the networking infrastructure part of the car. And there is a very rapid, and I would also say very forceful rearchitecture action in place with all of the OEM customers. And one of the big features here is going to be over-the-air updates, including the required security. So to make sure that the performance of the car over its lifetime can be upgraded by software updates without changing the hardware. And the way to do this is over-the-air updates and then a very, say, both elegant and efficient network architecture inside the car. And the chip which does this over-the-air update is a gateway chip. And that's one of the flagship products which we are ramping. It's called S32G for gateway. And that is ramping with major OEM names through the next few years. So that's just -- it's just 1 nice example. There is obviously more. I'm actually proud to mention because it's always difficult with OEM names in that particular industry. But I'm proud to mention or reflect on the announcement which we did, I think, in November with Ford Motor company together where we spoke about the fact that their new F-150, the Bronco, the i.MX, they will all be using, amongst others, this S32G platform for the gateway functionality.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities.
Vivek Arya: I just wanted a clarification first. You identified the material weakness in internal controls in your earnings press release. I was just hoping you could maybe just discuss that issue. How much is any potential impact and how soon can those issues be rectified?
Bill Betz: Hey, Vivek, I'll take that question. As shared in our EPR, as part of our annual year-end audit process, we did identify a potential material weakness associated with our general internal IT controls in the areas of user access, change management and documentation. At this moment, we are very comfortable there had been no impact on our current or past financial statements. We are actually very pleased with the fixes the teams are implementing, which just take time. And we feel confident that we'll be able to remediate these internal IT controls in 2022 and ensure the proper monitoring throughout the year. We want to disclose this now for full transparency. And we plan to disclose more about the details in our annual 10-K, per our normal scheduling in the late February.
Vivek Arya: Great. Very helpful. And for my follow-up, Kurt, if I look at last year, we saw a nearly 40-point delta between auto unit production and your sales. I'm curious, what is the way you think about a more sustainable kind of content delta we should think about between units and sales over time? And what are you doing to ensure the quality of orders and the utilization of your products? So we are not surprised by any excess inventory, right, that might be there at your OEMs or Tier 1s?
Kurt Sievers: Yes. Thanks, Vivek. So first, let me just highlight again that, indeed, we are not at all concerned about that delta between the 44% of our revenue growth and the 2.5%, I think, SAR growth last year. And that is given the content increases relative to premium vehicle mix changes and electric vehicle acceleration. But also the fact that in 2020 and already earlier '19, a lot of inventory in the very, very complex extended supply chain has been or had been depleted. And then, of course, I definitely see that we also have grown market share. So indeed, for the history, we are not concerned about this. On the contrary, I continue to be chased on a -- really on a daily level to ship more product into automotive. It's still low enough as we speak. Now the measures to cope with this are, one, a very, very much higher level of transparency, which we not only do with our Tier 1 customers, but also especially with the OEM customers. So we have a lot of direct relationships built up now with the OEMs and get multiyear forecasts, which are very specific by model, by equipment, which gives us a much better view into the future in what is realistic content growth and whatnot. And in the more shorter term, of course, we work with the NCR order concept, which I think Bill had in his prepared remarks, which we actually -- especially in automotive, not only in automotive but especially in automotive, which give us a confirmed and non-cancelable or non-reschedulable order pattern for the full calendar year 2022, which is a hell a lot of more stability than we've ever had in the past. I -- from just a directional perspective, I do believe the content increase continues to accelerate. And probably on the midterm, the 2 main factors are actually the acceleration of the share of xEVs, so electric and hybrid electric vehicles, which simply have so much more semiconductor content. But also the Level 2+, Level 3 autonomy efforts are getting more and more traction again, which is a big deal for us when you think about our position in radar. So we do believe that we will continue to outgrow this market, win share and have, at the same time, a faster market development given these changes. But with the NCR orders and our relationships to the OEMs, I think we have a good handle to keep this in good track.
Operator: Our next question comes from William Stein with Truist.
William Stein: There's been a clear imbalance between supply and demand for the last few quarters. It's triggering very extended lead times in the last year. I don't I've heard an update on that condition during the call or in the press release or presentation. I'm hoping you can update us as to how that's trended in the most recent quarter. I would imagine given the inventory decline that lead times are still quite stretched. Any normalization you anticipate for that through this year?
Kurt Sievers: Yes. So Bill, clearly, it has not improved. If I think about it from a supply perspective or if I put my more positive perspective on this, the demand continues to be very, very strong. So if I look forward into Q1 and into the rest of the year, Q1, very clearly -- and I just want to be very explicit here relative to the guidance, this is completely kept by available supply. So much more demand than what we have in terms of supply. You mentioned some of the metrics which we can actually use in order to get a better feel on where this is going. Indeed, our internal inventory has further reduced. And I'm not happy to say that also the channel inventory dropped a little bit to 1.5 months. I mean we've been standing now at 1.64 for quite a long time all through last year. And mind you, this compares to a target of 2.4 to 2.5 months. And that's also the level we have come from. And the loan debt delta is about $500 million. So I do not think that we get out of this imbalance through this calendar year. It might get better in certain spots. But overall, in the markets which we are serving, and again, I don't make a comment here about the whole semiconductor industry, but I make a comment about the key markets we are being exposed to, there, I do not see that we totally come out of this imbalance until the end of the year.
William Stein: That really helps. One other, if I can. I'm going to ask the content, automotive content question a little differently. It's clear and you've made a pretty good case that some of this content is a more permanent shift, like the new networking architectures and the like. But I think it's fair to say that some of the growth that we've seen in the last year has resulted from favorable mix shift to higher-end models and higher-end trims within those models that probably drive a little bit better semi content that's more profitable for the OEM customers. What should -- what would you encourage investors to think about for this trend over the coming year? Does it continue? Or would it reverse as availability becomes more plentiful?
Kurt Sievers: Yes. So Bill, I completely confirm what you said. Definitely, last year has seen a spike in content increase due to the mix change to more premium vehicles. Absolutely agreed. I think this is going to find a natural balance. As long as overall supply of the semi industry into the auto industry will continue to be constrained, they will continue to build the more profitable, the premium vehicles. I mean that's very natural. And as soon as this maybe gets over time into a better balance, they will also start to build more of the volume cars again. But again, that is not a -- I cannot see this as a negative, Bill, because they want to build and could sell more cars anyway. I mean if you look at dealer inventories in the meantime, not only in the U.S. but also in China, they are just at rocking all-time lows, and it's getting worse and worse. So yes, it will change a little, but that is not going to go against -- as a negative against our demand because then they simply build more cars as a result.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer: Kurt, I wonder if you could spend a couple of minutes just talking about the impact of inflationary pressures on the business right now both on revenue and on OpEx. And I know you've said historically that you're not raising pricing above your increase in cost. But I'm trying to get a sense of how much of a tailwind price is to your view that you'll be above the high end of that 8% to 12% this year. And conversely, what's the impact it's having on OpEx relative to higher prices?
Kurt Sievers: Well, in general, John, I absolutely want to reconfirm loud and clear that we will not use this current -- or have used, I would almost say, this current situation to pad our margins. So we do absolutely stick to the policy I've talked about before, which is that, of course, we are passing on the increased input cost and raise prices to our customers along with that. That is something we had to start doing last year and we have to continue to do through this year. This is a function of the kind and the type of business we are in, which is the opposite of a commodity business. It's very application-specific. It has, I think, very specific and long-term customer relations where this is the only way to do it. And trust me, it's not an easy one for us to do this. But yes, that's what we do. I anyway can't guide the year going out into Q2, 3 and 4. But I can tell you, John, that for last year, the impact of pricing was absolutely minimal to the revenue growth. So don't think about this being the key factor here. And maybe, Bill, you want to speak a little bit about the impact on OpEx?
Bill Betz: Yes, sure. Hi, John. I'd say we continue to do well here and near our 23% long-term model. As you know, Q4 finished at 22.4% of sales, which was better than our guidance of the 22.7%. We just guided Q1 to be about 22.4%. And this is up mainly because of the U.S. benefits for FICA and 401(k) tending to be higher in the U.S. in Q1. But as you think ahead, and this is where you're going, we mentioned during Investor Day, we like to run around 23% with quarters fluctuating a bit. But we do see that we can get additional leverage on the model, especially in the SG&A side.
John Pitzer: That's helpful. And then as my follow-up, Bill, you talked about in your prepared comments, CapEx this year being above target. I'm wondering if you could give us a little bit more granularity as to kind of what number you're thinking about for the full year? And Kurt, as he answers that, I'm curious as to what your internal versus external sort of capacity strategy is, especially in the auto business where historically, you've done more of the front end internally and especially against some of your peers that are looking to really expand their internal capacity, how confident are you that given the strong growth you expect, especially in autos over the next several years that you can get everything you need from your outsourcing partners?
Kurt Sievers: Yes. Let me maybe get started, John, on the strategy here. We absolutely stick to our hybrid manufacturing strategy. And I also want to highlight, it has never been a function of doing this in auto and doing that in industrial and something else in mobile. It's much more a function of the kind of processing technology. There is simply anything which is below 90 nanometers, we will not do in-house. And we see no reason to change this. Honestly speaking, if you look at our results for last year, I think we've grown 28.5% year-over-year. We've probably grown faster than most of the comparable peers, which might partially have more of an in-house manufacturing strategy. I think last year, the flexibility which we could apply is actually a fantastic proof point that this manufacturing strategy is not wrong. Now going forward, we clearly are intensifying and working on long-term partnerships also with foundry partners. I mean as much as I talked earlier about the longer-term nature of our relationship with customers and the better transparency we gain here from a demand perspective, obviously, we are doing exactly the same thing on the foundry side in order to make sure this is in good balance. So no change here. There, of course, we are investing and increasing our output capability is in the -- on the back end. Because there, I think, currently, it's like 85% or so, which we are doing in-house. We don't see a reason to change that either. So here, we are continuing to expand.
John Pitzer: And that will [jump up] this year?
Bill Betz: Let me do that.
Kurt Sievers: Yes, Bill, go ahead.
Bill Betz: Yes. Thank you. Again, if you look at CapEx, just a quick recap, in 2020, we spent 4.6%. 2021, we spent 6.9%. And you just saw in Q4, we spent 8.8%. So we think that's going to go up a little bit more for 2021 without giving you the absolute guide, but think maybe another point or so on it related to it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.
Stacy Rasgon: I wanted to first ask about the mobile strength into Q1. And I get what you said on some of the supply constraints in that business that have been there easing a little bit. But is there anything else there around customer pull-forward or anything like that? What is actually driving that strength? And how do we think about the sustainability of that profile into Q2 and beyond, just given the above seasonal nature of it into Q1?
Kurt Sievers: Yes, Stacy, it's indeed 2 things. It is demand, and I speak about this in a second, and it is obviously supply. We've really been held back by supply the last 2 quarters. So Q3 and Q4 of last year, we clearly had a significant issue here from a supply perspective. By the way, not everything resolved, but at least improving into Q1. So that's one element. The other element is demand. And I mean I think I can understand why you are asking. But you know that we are not overly dependent on only one customer, on one mobile customer in that particular segment. So if you think about the mix of our customers, you will appreciate that there is a strong case to be made for demand going into the first quarter. And I also don't think about it as a spike, Stacy. This is not just a spike or something. It's -- I think it continues with our strategy of the attach rate of the mobile wallet. I mean that's the main factor in there and the more and more growing -- early growing part of the -- of our secure ultra-wideband solutions.
Stacy Rasgon: Got it. My follow-up, I wanted to ask about Industrial, particularly in China. What are you seeing there? I mean they have COVID-zero. There were shutdowns as you mentioned on something, some of the data points are not great. Are you seeing any issues particularly around China, especially for the Industrial business?
Kurt Sievers: No, we don't see it at this stage, Stacy. I mean I'm reading the same news. Our main concern is in Tianjin, China much more about our own production, which -- and I said this before, is in the meantime, fully up and running again. But that is actually where we see the issue, from a demand perspective, which indeed is largely the industrial markets largely served through distribution. We do not see any slowing at all. On the contrary, when you think about the fact that our channel inventory has further dropped, unfortunately, you know that a good -- a solid portion of that is actually in China. So, no, we are not concerned here about the demand slowing in Industrial in China.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Caso with Raymond James.
Christopher Caso: Kurt, I wonder if you could go through a bit about some of the commitments that you've had to make to secure that additional capacity. What is the commitment now to the foundry partners? And how has that changed versus prior cycles? And I'm guessing by your comments that your feeling is that that's backed up by the commitments from your customers to you. And how resilient do you think that will be over time as conditions change? And obviously, this seems like this is something different for the industry.
Kurt Sievers: Yes. Thanks, Chris. Maybe Bill, you want to speak a little bit first about the $4-plus billion purchasing obligations, which we entered into?
Bill Betz: Yes, that was in my prepared remarks. At the moment, we have $4 billion. And those are strongly supported by actually greater than our supply commitments, backed by the non-cancelable, nonreturnable orders that we see. So the demand continues to be strong. Our customers are actually coming to us. And unfortunately, we can't serve them all.
Kurt Sievers: Yes. And then adding to this, Chris, on the NCNR, on the order side, I mean, it is as strong as a contract can be, Chris. We all know how the world can flip around. But I -- there is solid contracts behind that. So we really, really feel good about it. And I would tell you, we have actually customers who want more. So just no confusion here, it is not that we were hungry for these NCNR orders. It's actually the opposite. We cannot cover them all. So we are oversubscribed here. We cannot fulfill them all. And customers would love to place them actually over even longer periods of time. So reaching out into '23 and '24 where we are still seeing how we can best do this. So that dynamic is still going one way only. We don't see any softening. And I -- actually, I didn't say it before, but maybe I should just highlight this here. We see absolutely no order cancellation. We see no push-outs or no rescheduling of any backlog.
Christopher Caso: Got it. That's very helpful. And for a follow-on question and we will return to pricing. And really kind of 2 questions on pricing. One is, obviously, we've seen foundry price increases announced last year. Do you think that is now behind us? Or with the continuing tight supply situation, is there potential for additional input cost increases as we go through the year? And then with that, I think there's an investor concern that some of these price increases are transitory because of the strong conditions and obviously, the input costs on you, you're passing along to the customers. So what's your view of the stickiness of these price increases that this is kind of a permanent ratchet up as opposed to something that's transitory just because of the supply conditions?
Kurt Sievers: Yes. I actually think, Chris, unfortunately, there's always a chance for more cost increases. So this can never be totally ruled out. So on your -- on the first part of your question, I trust we have a good visibility and also good agreements for this year. But is it truly the end forever? I don't know. I mean there could always be something. On the durability of that, I have a very firm view that this is really a reset of the industry. So no, I do not think that things will go backward, and unfortunately, neither the input costs nor our pricing to our customers. I think the 4 or 5 quarters now of this really, really tough supply situation has learned the world a lot more about the value of semiconductors in many critical infrastructure and other applications. So I think the appreciation for this industry and for the kind of product which we do to enable applications, end applications has significantly grown. And with that, hand-in-hand, has gone a reset of the pricing structure. So I don't think this is going to go backwards.
Operator: And our last question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.
Joseph Moore: You talked about non-cancelable backlog throughout the year. I think that was an automotive comment. Can you talk about your backlog coverage for the other businesses? And how far out does that extend? And do you see it -- if in the areas like auto, as you see it extending out a full year, do you think we continue to get that 1 year visibility as we move forward? Are people still looking out that far?
Kurt Sievers: So Joe, yes, first, I talked about automotive, but this is not just a phenomenon in automotive. I'd say with all of our direct customers, this NCNR pattern is a big desire because all of our customers consider this as a way to secure supply over a short- to medium-term period. So it ranges well beyond automotive. I should maybe also highlight that the shortages in the industry are at least as bad in industrial and other applications as in automotive. It's just that automotive continues to catch better headlines in the news, but it's not that the situation is any easier in any of the other segments we are serving. I -- if you think about the order visibility, customers want to have it longer. I said -- I think earlier I might have mentioned it already that they would love to have NCNRs for 2 years out.  So yes, I'm definitely sure on your question if they want to continue to go with a 1-year horizon. They definitely want to. I think, actually, if we are prepared for it, there might be also more cases coming where people want to have it even lower, so more than a year. And again, think about this commentary really being commentary mainly about automotive and industrial markets with very sticky products, very long life cycles, so it fits the nature of those industries. So I think it's a learning from our overall industry in order to better deal with the requirements of those markets. I don't know if this is ever going to be the case in markets like mobile and computing. It might be different there, where also the end product cycles are much shorter. So that's why my commentary is probably biased to the automotive and industrial side of the house where I think it is a big learning out of last year for the entire industry. I think -- yes, sure. Joe. I guess we run now to the end of the call. So I just want to summarize and highlight again. We feel we come off a very strong 2021 with more than 28% revenue growth. Maybe it's also worthwhile to say that if we look at the revenue growth over 2019, which was the pre-pandemic year, it is still a 25% growth. So '21 over 2019 is 25% growth. So we feel we are very well on track to our projected 8% to 12% long-term growth target. And if we look into -- more into the near term into this year, we feel increasingly optimistic, as I said, that we can be above the high end of that 8% to 12% for the calendar year 2022.
Kurt Sievers : And with that, I would like to thank you all for your attention today and speak to you next. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-11-02 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the NXP Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a Q&A session. [Operator Instructions]. And now I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jeff Palmer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Jeff Palmer: Thank you, Dexter. And good morning, everyone. Welcome to the NXP Semiconductors Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. With me on the call today is Kurt Sievers, NXP's President and CEO, and Bill Betz, our CFO. The call today is being recorded and will be available for replay from our corporate website. Today's call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause NXP's results to differ materially from management's current expectations.  These risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to statements regarding the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, the macroeconomic impact on the specific end markets in which we operate, the sale of new and existing products at our expectations for the financial results for the fourth quarter of 2021. Please be reminded that NXP undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements. For a full disclosure on forward-looking statements, please refer to our press release.  Additionally, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures which are driven primarily by discrete events that management does not consider to be directly related to NXP's underlying core operating performance. Pursuant to Regulation G, NXP has provided reconciliations to the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our third quarter 2021 earnings press release, which will be furnished to the SEC on Form 8-K and is available on NXP's website in the Investor Relations section at nxp.com.  Before we start the call today, I would like to remind everyone of our upcoming Analyst Day on Thursday, November 11, 2021. We are hosting a hybrid event. We will be in person in New York City, but also simulcasting the event from our website for virtual attendees. After the event concludes, we will post the slides to the Investor Relations website. I would like to turn the call over to Kurt.
Kurt Sievers: Yeah, thanks very much, Jeff. And good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining our call this morning. I will review our Q3 results and then discuss our guidance for Q4. Overall, our Q3 results were better than the midpoint of our guidance with the mobile end markets stronger than planned as a result of improved supply. At the same time, the trends in the Auto, Industrial IoT, and Communication Infrastructure markets, were all in line with our guidance. Taken together, NXP delivered Q3 revenue of $2.86 billion, an increase of 26% year-on-year, and $11 million above the midpoint of our guidance range.  These are very good results given the constrained supply position we knew we would face entering the quarter. And we continue to view our channel and on-hand inventory metrics below our long-term targets. We exited quarter three with our distribution channels supply metric at 1.6 months, almost a full month lower than our long-term target. And we expect this to be the situation in quarter four again as well. Our non-GAAP operating margin in quarter three, was a strong 33.5%, which is 770 basis points better than the year-ago period. And 50 basis points above the midpoint of our guidance.  Operating profit dollars were $19 million better than guidance, driven by higher revenue and lower expense. Now let me turn to the specific trends in our focus ends markets, starting with Automotive. Q3 revenue was $1.46 billion, 51% up versus the year-ago period, and in line with our expectations. In Industrial and IOT, Q3 revenue was $607 million, up 18% versus the year-ago period, and again, in line with our expectations. In Mobile, Q3 revenue was $345 million, up about 2% versus the year-ago period, and above our expectations.  Lastly, in communication, infrastructure and other, quarter three revenue was 454 million, about flat versus the year-ago periods. And in line with our expectations. With this, let me move straight to our outlook for quarter four. We expect the midpoint of quarter four revenue to be 3 billion up 20% versus the fourth quarter of 2020, within a range of up 17% to up 23% year-on-year. From a sequential perspective, this is up 5% at the midpoint versus the prior quarter. And we again anticipate demand outstripping available supply in our quarter four outlook.  At the midpoint of this range, we anticipate the following trends in our business. Automotive is expected to be up in the high 20% range year-on-year and up in the mid-single-digit range versus Quarter Three '21. Industrial and IOT is expected to be up in the high 20% range year-on-year and up in the mid-single-digit range versus Quarter Three '21. Mobile is expected to be down in the mid-teens range year-on-year and up in the low single-digit range versus Quarter Three '21.  And finally, Communication, Infrastructure, and Other is expected to be up in the high-teens range versus the same period a year ago, and up in the low single-digit range versus Q3 '21. Over the course of the last 2 quarters, investors continue to ask how to reconcile the revenue performance of NXP's Automotive business with that of the global vehicle production numbers as they are reported by IHS. Specifically, NXP's Automotive segment revenue is expected to be up over 40% in 2021.  Against this, the auto OEMs continue to struggle to match supply to strong consumer demands with the auto industry likely not able to meaningfully grow unit production versus 2020. Now let me make a few observations which may help you understand these diversions. First, the auto supply chain is very extended and complex, with multiple points of product transformation across the globe. This extended supply chain needs to coordinate the timing and delivery of up to 30,000 props and up to 1500 different semiconductors, from hundreds of suppliers to build just one single-car.  During normal periods from the time at which NXP ships of finished components to when the final assembly is fitted into a finished car, it takes up to 6 months. And this is on top of the normal semiconductor manufacturing cycle times of 3 to 6 months. At each step of the transformation, thousands of parts move through a complex global network of suppliers.  For the process to work efficiently, it is essential that all of the components needed to complete a car are available exactly where and when they are required. Now, we believe the extended auto supply chain significantly depleted on-hand inventory of all types of products, including semiconductors already by the beginning in the second half of 2018 and continuing through 2019 and most of 2020.  That depletion was a result of global car production declining 6% in 2019 and another 16% in 2020. While NXP 's auto business, despite content increases, declined by 7% into 2019 and by another 9% into 2020. Let me illustrate the impact by using the NXP Distribution Channel as a proxy for overall auto supply demand trends, and how we have been directly affected. We consistently monitor and measure all component movements in inventory data at our distribution partners at the end-market level.  Throughout 2021 these metrics for Automotive have been at record low levels, with on-hand inventory being about 1 month below our long-term target of 2.5 months, with demand in the intermediate term being consistently greater than our ability to rebuild inventory back to normalized levels. In our and my personal daily discussions with our customers throughout the auto supply chain, we hear the consistent message that they want significantly more products.  And in some cases, Tier 1's are struggling to assemble fluid kits. And in other cases, the OEMs choose to build partially completed cars or hold their production lines all together. For NXP, lead times for about 75% of our automotive products continue to be above 52 weeks. Against this backdrop, our customers are placing NCNR orders to assure long-term supply. We in turn are making long-term supply commitments to our supply partners. In summary, we think the automotive supply demand equation, build continued to be out of balance through 2022.  In addition, as a learning all of the current material shortage situation, and in order to mitigate the impacts of the Auto-AM's are experiencing today. Our Tier 1 partner explicitly demands that more supplies and inventories will be needed in the extended supply chain, which we believe cannot be broadly achieved before 2023. Now, with this currently dysfunctional supply chain as a backdrop, there are very clear and very positive trends that have simultaneously increased the demand for auto semiconductors industry-wide, as a consequence of content growth.  We have seen multiple OEMs prioritized to production of premium vehicles, which require uploads of twice the semiconductor content from NXP and others. And another clear and emerging secular content driver for the auto semiconductor markets, is the fast exploration of fully electric and hybrid electric vehicles, which combines have moved from 8% of global production in 19% to about 20% of production in 2021.  This is very impactful since the average semiconductor content on xEV is above $900, which is roughly 2 times that of an equivalent ICE vehicle. These trends have resulted in industry-wide content per vehicle increasing at 10% per year, over the last three years. And on top of all of this, NXP is consistently gaining share in our focused growth areas and increasing content.  These content gains include 77 gigahertz radar safety systems, multiple electrification system opportunities, beyond just battery management, and new domain and zonal processing as well as others. Now for NXP, it's of course not just automotive driving our performance. Within the Industrial and IoT markets, we see our ability to provide complete turnkey connected etch processing solutions, consisting of processes, connectivity, security, and analog, all leading to increased customer traction.  These are all just a few weeks samples that underpin our confidence in our Company-specific growth. As Jeff mentioned earlier, we plan to go into much greater detail at our Investor Day on November 11th, next week in New York. In summary, we continue to execute very well in a strong demand environment, notwithstanding the industry-wide supply challenges. From a Company-specific perspective, NXP is experiencing very positive customer traction of our newest products and solutions.  Putting it all together, we are highly confident that the Company-specific drivers within our strategic end-markets, they will continue to build also beyond Q4 into Q1, as well as over the intermediate term through 2022. Now, before we move to the financial details of the quarter, I'd like to make a few remarks in the context of our recent announcement of Bill Betz as our new CFO. I have personally worked with Bill as a business partner and one of Peter Kelly's key finance leaders for over eight years.  Bill brings both a strong track record and career in the semiconductor industry, as well as truly intimate knowledge of NXP and consistency to his new role. I personally drove the evaluation the interview process, in the viewing of wide number of external candidates, as well as Bill. And I concluded Bill is the right person to lead our NXP finance organization, and I'm personally truly excited to work with Bill and drive NXP's profitable growth going forward.  At the same time, I would like to highlight the outstanding contribution Peter Kelly has played in the strategic evolution of NXP. Peter first came into the Company in an operations role, over a decade ago, and then quickly move into the CFO role to drive the financial discipline, our stakeholders have all come to expect. He has been a clear-thinking strategic advisor to myself, and a highly valued mentor to many on the NXP management team.  Obviously, including both Bill and Jeff. We wish Peter the very best in the next phase of his life, and hope he gets to spend more quality time with his family. And with that, I would now like to pass the call to you Bill, for a review of our financial performance. Bill.
Bill Betz: Thank you, Kurt and good morning to everyone on today's call. As Chair has already covered the drivers of the revenue during Q3 and provide our revenue outlook for Q4, I will move to the financial highlights. Overall, our Q3 financial performance was very good. Revenue was above the midpoint of our guidance range. And we drove an improvement of non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP operating profit, both of which were at the high end of our guidance range. Now, moving to the details of Q3, total revenue was $2.86 billion up 26% year-on-year and above the midpoint of our guidance range.  We generated $1.6 billion in Non-GAAP gross profit and reported a non-GAAP gross margin of 56.5% of 640 basis points year-on-year and near the high-end of our guidance. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $657 million up a $107 million year-on-year and up $31 million from Q2. This was 8 million below the midpoint of our guidance, due to lower material and mass spend during the quarter.  From a total operating profit perspective, non-GAAP operating profit was 959 million and non-GAAP operating margin was 33.5% up 770 basis points year-on-year. This was also at the high-end of our guidance range, as a result of better fall-through on higher revenues. Non-GAAP interest expense was 94 million with cash taxes ongoing operations of 86 million and non-controlling interest was 7 million. Taken together, the -- below-the-line items were 8 million betters than our guidance. Stock-based compensation, which is not included in our Non-GAAP earnings was $81 million.  Now, I would like to turn to the changes in our cash and debt. Our total debt at the end of Q3 was $9.59 billion flat on a sequential basis. Our ending cash position was 2.3 billion down 607 million sequentially due to higher Capex and robust capital returns during the quarter. The resulting net debt was 7.29 billion and we exited the quarter with a trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA of 3.92 billion. A ratio of debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of Q3 was 1.9 times. And our 12-month adjusted EBITDA interest coverage ratio was 11 times. Our liquidity continues to be excellent and our balance sheet is very strong.  During Q3, we re-purchased 1.16 billion of our shares and paid a 152 million in cash dividends for a total of 1.31 billion of capital return to our owners. Subsequent to the end of Q3 between October and November 1st, we repurchased an additional 300 million over shares of [Indiscernible] resulting in a total of 4 billion return to our owners year-to-date. Turning to working capital metrics, days of inventory with 85 days, a decline of three days sequentially. Our DIO continues to be below our long-term target of 95 days. We continue to closely manage our distribution channel with inventory in the channel at 1.6 months, flat sequentially and below our long-term targets.  Both metrics reflect the continuation of strong customer deliver rates, in a tight supply environment. We continue to believe it will take multiple quarters before we're able to rebuild on-hand and channel inventories to our long-term target of those. Day’s receivables were 31 days down 4 days sequentially. And days payable were 83, a decline of 9 days versus the prior quarter. Taking together our cash conversion cycle of 33 days, an increase of two days versus strikes winner. Cash flow from operations was $924 million and net Capex was $200 million, resulting in non-GAAP free cash flow of $724 million.  Turning to our expectations for Q4, as Kurt mentioned, we anticipate Q4 revenue to be $3 billion plus or minus $75 million. At the midpoint, this is up 20% year-on-year and up 5% sequentially. We expect Non-GAAP gross margin to be about 6 to 6.5% plus or minus 50 basis points. Operating expenses are expected to be about 680 million plus or minus about 10 million, consistent with our long-term model.  Taken together, we see non-GAAP operating margin to be about 33.8% at the midpoint. We estimate non-GAAP financial expense to be about 94 million and anticipate cash tax related to ongoing operations to be about 100 million. Non-controlling interest will be about 9 million. For Q4, we suggest for modeling purposes, you use an average share count of 270 million shares, which is down 15 million shares from a year-ago period as a result of the consistent execution of our communicate capital return policy.  Finally, I have a few closing comments I'd like to make. First, demand trends continue to be strong across our target end markets, and customer interest in our newest products continues to be very robust. At the same time, we are closely working with our customers and our suppliers to address order requests in a timely manner.  Second, our Q4 guidance reflects the clear potential of our business model, both in terms of revenue growth as well as the significant profit fall through, which will enable us to consistently drive our non-GAAP gross margin above the midpoint of our gross margin targets. Thirdly, our business continues to generate significant free cash flow. And we are committed to our capital return policy and will return all access free cash flow to our owners, so long as our leverage ratio remains at or below 2x net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA.  I'd also like to take this opportunity to thank Peter Kelly for a significant contribution to NXP since he joined the Company in 2011. Not only did Peter guide NXP from a financial perspective, but he truly helped lead the Company and drive the strategy that made NXP what it is today. And on a personal note, I consider Peter a great leader, a mentor and a friend, and I will always be grateful for his support. And then finally, I'd like to thank all my colleagues across NXP for their outstanding work and dedication. We shouldn't forget that we're all still working under strict pandemic protocols. So, with that, I'd like to turn it back to the Operator for questions.
Operator: Thank you. As a reminder to answer a question -- > [Operators Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ross Seymore. Your line is open.
Ross Seymore: Thanks for letting me ask a question, and Bill, congratulations on the new role as CFO. My first question is for Kurt and it's one on customer behavior. You gave a great deep dive into the apparent disconnect between the auto-revs you have in production and all those explanations. And I really want to get into -- are the customers changing their behavior? And if so, is it just with longer visibility for you, greater certainty, or the profitability that all the auto semi production companies are going to be able to garner from this sector, starting to improve as well.
Kurt Sievers: Good morning, Ross. Indeed, a couple of -- a couple of changes. First of all, very tactically and I just have to highlight that because it sits on top of my agenda every day in and out, there's continues to be no change in pressure to get more products. So, expedite, escalation calls, all sorts of weird actions to try to get products faster to their manufacturing locations has not slowed down by an inch.  So, we see -- we see that continuing. From a more strategic and say learning perspective, I would say clearly the whole auto industry has realized now -- and that's where me, a step function and the resets at the same time has realized now how big the significance and importance of semiconductors is for their future. Today, but also years-old. I mean, that's about innovation, but obviously it's also bought for being able to build complete cars. And that has let too much closer and better relationships between us, and directly the OEMS in terms of understanding both their innovation needs, but also the from a more technical perspective, there -- their product supply needs in the near mid-term.  All of that leads them to a number of significant, I would say quite significant changes. We are seeing longer-term orders. So, we get the so-called NCNR orders, which easily reach out for the entire next calendar year. These are coming from the Tier 1 customers so far. But of course, they do this since they get similar behavior from the OEMs. But we also get greater visibility into the longer term, which I find very important prospective which reaches then over to innovation. Because the intimacy which we can build with the OEMs now to think about future systems is a great help for us to construct the right roadmaps.
Ross Seymore: Thank you for that color and I guess as my follow-up, just shifting gears quickly to a little bit of a nearer-term potentially question. And that's on the mobile business. It's good to see that it upside surprised in the third quarter versus your original guidance. But I guess if I put the two quarters together, I know supply is tight and maybe you're just doing some allocation. But the mobile business is a bit weaker, seasonally than we would have expected in the combination of the quarters. And I had thought that that was supposed to snap back a little bit in the third -- or in the fourth quarter, excuse me. So, can you just talk about what's driving the relative weakness on a year-over-year basis in that business?
Ross Seymore: It's clearly a supply or the like there off was. So, as we -- when we went into quarter three, I think we talked about a sequential decline which we could -- which we could avoid. So, we could pull in some supply and that's the whole reason why we actually ended up in Mobile better than guidance. So, there is no difference in sockets or anything. It was just that we had the somewhat better supply capability and be continued to forecast a similar thing into the fourth quarter. But overall, if you take the full second half of this year, we are unfortunately significantly constrained in supply
Kurt Sievers: into the mobile market. It is gradually getting better, which is why we have this performance I just quoted. But if you hold it just in total, it is pretty significantly suffering. From a year-on-year perspective for us, it's a more difficult compare. Last year Q3, we had the ban on Huawei coming into play which officially bumped up quarter three and quarter four one of our very large mobile customers needed a lot of products which also has to do with the phasing of the quarter of last year, which was later than normal.  That's why the year-on-year comparisons, both for Q3 and Q4 need some bridging, given those two specific customer events. All in all, I just want to absolutely re-confirm, we haven't lost a single socket there, so everything is going as we had planned. We had supply constraints, but the bigger drivers being the adoption of mobile wallets, attach rates, and also the early penetration [Indiscernible] which are vital solutions? are fully on track with earlier targets and earlier planning.
Ross Seymore: Thank you.
Operator: Okay. Next, we have Vivek Arya. Your line is open.
Vivek Arya: Thank you for taking my question and good luck to both, Peter and Bill. Kurt, on the automotive industry, if one had told you that auto production would be flat this year, but your auto sales would have been up 40%, would that have been predictable? And if not, what do you think surprised NXP other than some of the bad [Indiscernible] and the [Indiscernible] shutdown effect. Was it mixed that surprised you? Was it pricing? Was it content? What specifically was the surprise this year to create this big gap between production and sales.
Kurt Sievers: Yeah, Hi, Vivek. I mean, very transparently and honestly, with some knowledge of today, of course, we could have predicted it with the knowledge at the time, no. So no, we didn't know. And now, what you call surprises is what actually happened, a few things. One, clearly, the mix change to premium vehicles, which is an optimization to higher profit on the OEM side, clearly is something we have not foreseen, I think nobody has anticipated that.  And that has a significant impact on semiconductor consumption, given that premium vehicles can easily have twice the semi content of a mass volume car. And on the same note, again, the xEVs penetration, which I think is a result of the the big focus on the growth on CO2 targets, but also a lot of government subsidies in various countries to boost actually more electric vehicle.  Those two elements, so the mix to premium and the much stronger penetration or faster penetration of xEVs, those have significant positive impact on the content increase for semiconductors. So even if the car production is flat, the content goes up massively. Again, think about that both of these elements, each one on its own right, are potentially bringing the semi content of a car to effectual of 2x. That's -- I mean, this is just outstripping any car production by far.  The third element which I would say -- I use your language, surprised us. I would rather say, we gained more insight, is the enormous steps and complexity of the extended automotive supply chain. which means how many stages and companies sometimes are between us after we ship a product before that product ends up in a car. And, if that supply chain is enormously depleted, as it has been the case off to 2019 and 2020, it becomes incredibly dysfunctional.  And we are still in the process of refilling that supply chain just to normalized levels. It's really important. This is not about building any strategic inventory, is just getting back to more normalized levels which allow for appropriate operational [Indiscernible] supply chain. And that's -- that we didn't see either. I would say, we had no idea how far it has been depleted, how deep it has been depleted, nor how deep it is. Which means how much elasticity is in there to be refilled in the first place, to make it -- to try to make it functional. Again, it is still dysfunctional at this stage.
Vivek Arya: And for my follow-up, Kurt, just to continue that line of discussion, you mentioned over the last few years that the content Delta, right between units and sales have been, for the industry, has been about 10 points, so then XP doing better. If I look at the current IHS production forecast for next year, and I know that they keep on changing all the time, but right now it's about 10%-11% unit growth. Assuming that happens, what is the crystal ball saying in terms of that rough delta for the industry next year. Do you think it'll be that add that 10 points or it'll be closer, right, to the much bigger number we saw this year? Thank you.
Kurt Sievers: Yeah, Vivek. So first of all, you just mentioned another very important elements which is obviously our performance in all of this. I mean, what I described to your earlier question was is how we think the industry surprised us all. The third element, clearly as CNXC's specific companies specific content gains where we grew share, which makes it even faster.  Now how that all goes into all these means for the next year and the next years from both the content growth perspective as well as a NXP's specific revenue growth perspective. I'd just ask you to wait for a week -- next, next week when we have our Investor Day in New York, we will give you the detail you're looking for. We will guide the next few years, both, how we think the semi -market and auto is going to develop, as well as our performance relative to that. So, please hold your horses until next week.
Vivek Arya: Thank you, Kurt.
Operator: We have a question from John Pitzer. Your line is open.
John Pitzer: Good morning, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the questions and congratulations on the solid results. Kurt, I think we all appreciate all the details you gave in your opening comments about the complexity around the auto supply chain. I'm curious. You can spend a couple of minutes just talking about your ability to grow supply from here, both internally, externally, both on the waver side, and on the back end and tests. I'm assuming that the nice sequential jump in autos means that some of the weather events in the first half of the year have reversed themselves. But specifically, as you look over the next several quarters, would you expect your ability to grow supply to be relatively linear or is it going to be chunky? And is there a point in time where your ability to grow supply accelerates in 2022?
Kurt Sievers: Thanks, John. Let me give you a few pieces on this. The one is indeed the negative impact from the -- which we had some, I think early Q2 in Texas isn't deep behind us. I mean, just put this to file, both factories which were impacted are running very much at least on levels and we are good. Another element I have to mention here because it has impact on the industry. You've seen that over summer, there have been quite a few factory shutdowns for back-end test and assembly sites in Malaysia.  I want to highlight that we have been in a very disciplined position to organize and manage our own factories in such a way that our shutdowns were very immaterial. So, we had a few days but by and large, we have very little negative impact from those shutdowns on our revenue. So, when you think about what we shipped in Q3, assume there was hardly any negative impact from COVID factory shutdowns from Southeast Asia and/or specifically Malaysia. Now going forward, we will clearly see improvements on the [Indiscernible] side. We talked about earlier that we are entering into long-term supply commitments with our supply partners.  And that's largely on the wafer side, which is going to start benefiting us next year, but also the years after. And again, this is in balance against the NCNR orders which we are -- which we are collecting from our customers. The back-end test and assembly, which largely is in-house for NXP. We are forced to put all the Capex and all the investments in place to make sure that any wafer we get our hands around will also find enough capacity in-house to be tested and assembled into finished products.  So, think about the test and assembly increase in capacity as pretty gradual because it is something which we are putting in tune with the wafers coming in. On the wafer side, it is in a way more discreet, but it's not [Indiscernible] shown because we have obviously several wafer suppliers and they don't improve all at the same time. From that perspective, what comes out into the revenue, think about something which is gradual, which doesn't have huge shoots step functions at any specific point in time.  However, the result of all of business that clearly our supply capabilities as it has done through this year, they continue to grow also through next year. Now, finally, I should say this is clearly an over comment which is in any way or form specific to automotive business of broad comments. Because the supply shortages which we are facing is across all markets. We discussed earlier briefly mobile.  Anyway, anybody knows about automotive, but we have the same negative impact on our industrial IoT business and partially in the content for our business. All of these improvements build health and build support revenue growth across all of our end market segments.
John Pitzer: That's really helpful color Kurt. And then maybe for my follow-on, one for Bill. First, congratulations. Looking forward to working with you in your new role. I'm just curious on the gross margin line. Another really solid gross margin quarter. Given some of the logistic inflationary costs out there, often times it's hard to, within a quarter, to get all of that rate relative to pricing.  Was there anything holding back gross margins from a cost side in the quarter? And I guess more importantly, as you look out across these LTAs, can you help us understand either how they're being constructed relative to your gross margin goals. I would assume it's much easier to price -- to value in this sort of environment. Does that mean we could see some ticks up -- tick up here in gross margins over the next several quarters?
Bill Betz: Yes, thank you for your question. Let me give a bigger picture on the margin and more color about it. So as mentioned on our previous calls, our gross margin had improved drastically versus last year driven by the higher volumes and improved internal utilizations from our factories. For example, if I try to remember, I think Q3 utilizations last year, were in the mid-60s and today we are in the high 90s. And from a guidance standpoint, as you saw, we were slightly better from a quarter-over-quarter basis by 2030 bps, related to the improved product mix. Now, as we move forward over the next several quarters, it's going to be really difficult to have that additional fall through on our internal factories.  As basically they're running full-out. To address your question on pricing. We are only passing on the increases of our input costs from our suppliers to our customers. And we're not having any of our margins in this process as we value our long-term relationships with our customers, I'd say. And we're really equally sharing the pain together. As you could see in Q4, we are guiding our gross margins to be flat quarter-over-quarter,  And any additional margin expansion, I'd say would come in the short-term will be driven by that continued product mix. And more longer-term will be really driven by the expansion of our new NPIs. I'd say overall, we're very proud of achieving these levels and we look forward to continue delivering towards that higher end financial state of model 57% as we go forward.
John Pitzer: Thanks guys.
Operator: Our next question is from Stacy Rasgon (ph), your line is open.
Stacy Rasgon: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow up on the other pricing question. I know you're not trying to extract more, but to play devil's advocate a little bit, given the shortages out there, why not? You're in a period of time right now where the supply chain is probably tighter than it ever has been and ever will be.  And there is demand for your products that's off the chart. You're locking customers in. At this point, why is this not the time even on a selective basis to try to extract more? Especially given it seems like some of your peers actually are going down that [Indiscernible] Why not you guys?
Kurt Sievers: Yeah. Hi Stacy. There is a very clear answer to this, which is we are not in the commodity business. The very vast majority of our portfolio is application-specific. And with that portfolio, we are in very deep, longer-term relationships with our customers. So, what we do is, as Bill said, we pass on the input cost, which is already, in some cases a pretty significant element to digest for our customers. But we want to be transparent and we want to have long-term relationships which are built on trust with our customers.  And in that context, we absolutely consider it the right thing to pass on the input costs, but not use it to pat on our margins. I would personally say from being in different markets in the past, in the commodity market that works different. But that's not the kind of market environment we are -- we are moving in. And I'm very very sure that this will pay off positively in the long term relative to the customer relations which we need to continue to build our business.  In that context, it is also important to note that the whole -- the whole environment clearly has a lot of input costs which is going out for our customers. I mean, it's not just on semis. A lot of other things are also moving. So, it's a tough environment for all the participants where I think consistency, transparency, and trust in -- into the long-term relationships is a big value. And that's something where we do differentiate.
Stacy Rasgon: Thank you. I guess for my follow-up, even to follow up on that a little bit, the historical pricing practices, at least at a high level, especially in automotive, was to have long-term price downs that were built-in to the contracts, and you'd be fighting that every year. I guess, understanding that we're maybe coming off a higher base now, at least on raising price because of the input cost increases, do you foresee like a similar type of long-term pricing behavior that'll be built into the long-term contracts? Are you still going to be fighting couple of 100 basis points of margin compression every year just off the higher base like as part of these long-term contracts? Or is the general pricing structure like long-term of these contracts different than it was in the past?
Kurt Sievers: Yeah, Stacy that's indeed the other side of this discussion. I mean, I can't discuss any customer or very segment-specific trends here. But the overall situation indeed is a reset. And that is important and positive. And with reset, what I mean is that the step function, which we have to take is something it is here to last.  And that comes with -- I think I made the comment earlier with the realization of all the industries we are serving, that's not just for automotive, of how important semiconductors are. It just represents a different value to them. And from that perspective, I think we make a step here, which is a reset, which is here to stay. How that goes then in individual cases, on individual prices year-on-year, it’s hard to anticipate, but I don't think it will go backwards.
Stacy Rasgon: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from William Stein. Your line is open.
William Stein: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I think you just spoke about this a moment ago, but can you talk about the magnitude and duration of your purchase commitments to foundry and your customer purchase commitments to NXP?
Kurt Sievers: Well, Bill would fill in maybe with a bit more detail, but I'd say in general, it really varies. We have some of them on the NCNR site which is the customer orders, they would typically easily cover next year. So now, getting an order which stretches all the way until the end of next year. If you think then on the other side, which is the agreements with our foundry and supply partners, I think we actually published a new number, which if I remember right, is between $4.3 billion and $4.4 billion off agreed and signed supply commitments, which we have entered into with our supplier base. The vast majority of it is obviously in wafers. But mind you, this is not just for 1 year, this stretches out over multiple years to come, 4.4 billion to give you a feel.
William Stein: That helps. Thank you. And Bill, I want to offer some congratulations on your new role. Of course, you have some pretty big shoes to fill given Peter's very strong performance and the Company's strong performance in the last 10 years or so. I'm hoping you might give us a preview of what you might say next week, at least in terms of your priorities as the new CFO. Thank you.
Bill Betz: Yes, thank you for your question. First off, I'm very honored and thankful for the role. I've been in the semi-industry for about 20 years prior NXP. I've worked for Fairchild, LSI systems. And really no change as you have to remember, I've been with NXP for about 8 years supporting the Company's financial strategy alongside with Peter, Kurt and Jeff and the entire management team. I'd say my style's a bit different than Peter, but principles are the same.  Focus on delivering like you mentioned, there's commitments and driving long-term value to our customers and employees and shareholders. Relay to Analyst Day, yes, I'll share that next week, relay to our long-term financial model. But we really like to save that for next week and not address that in this call.
Operator: We have a question from Chris Caso, your line is open.
Chris Caso: Thank you. Good morning. First question, I wonder if I could just ask about those long-term agreements that you're signing with your customers now. Can you tell us what what sort of commitments have your customers made to you under those agreements? And it sounds like you're using those agreements from your customers to backstop the agreements that you are making with your suppliers. Is that for specific volume commitments over a certain amount of time? and is pricing committed to -- in those agreements as well, such that you have visibility on both volume and pricing?
Kurt Sievers: Since I really can't go into great detail on this, as you will understand, Chris. But the headline is indeed in line before you were saying those customer agreements would typically cover volume and price for say -- for example, a period of until end of next calendar year. And they even fixed it by quarter. So, it's not just one number for the whole year. But in many cases, it even goes to binding it two quarters.
Chris Caso: And very helpful. And if I can follow up pricing as well, and clearly, over the past couple of quarters, you've been passing along as you've said, those -- those price increases you've gotten from suppliers. Can you give us a sense of the magnitude of the pricing benefit you've seen out of the -- this sort of 26% year-on-year increases you've seen in revenue? How substantial has price been in that calculation? And then as you go forward, are you expecting, as you go into next year, there's still going to be a pricing tailwind as the input costs rise?
Kurt Sievers: Well, generally, as we discussed before, we will continue to match the rising input costs with adjusting the prices accordingly. Such that yes, since input costs will continue to go up also next year, they will also continue to be uprising adjustments into next year in general terms. For the rest of your question, I really cannot and don't want to go into greater detail in how much is what piece. It's really just important that the leading concept and philosophy of all of this is that the price increase is just matching the input costs increase, and that's it. But that is something which indeed we have this year and which is going to follow up next year too.
Chris Caso: Thank you.
Operator: Next question is from Blayne Curtis. Your line is open.
Blayne Curtis: Hey, thanks for taking my question. I'll offer my congratulations to Peter and Bill as well. Just -- going back on the audio side, I just wanted to be clear. You've heard from some other companies that they are seeing the customers started to be more selective, trying to get kids together. Thanks for all the detail, Kurt on -- that supply chain seems very complex. I'm just curious, are you seeing that same behavior, maybe seeing offsetting strength elsewhere, or are you a bit different given the Company's specific [Indiscernible] and some of the secular growth that you're not seeing that selective behavior on certain parts? Thanks.
Kurt Sievers: Blayne, I think what you tried to ask me is am I seeing a slowdown, and the clear answer is no. We absolutely don't see a slowdown and you can imagine that especially, the car companies with the pretty significantly negative impact to their car production numbers of this year, and the ambition to grow them next year by, I don't know 10% plus over this year? They clearly need more semiconductors. And that is not limited to one product or one technology. I think I also made the very open comment earlier that 75% of the product portfolio in our automotive business still has a lead time of above 52 weeks. I think that says it all.
Blayne Curtis: Thanks. Maybe you can just [Indiscernible] to ask on the Industrial IoT. Maybe just kind of discussion about what the areas of strength are for you. And maybe you just described the supply chain as well for the back half of the year - to - year. Are you -- is it just as tight that'd be helpful? Thanks.
Kurt Sievers: Yeah Blayne. It is very tight too. I would say, no different to automotive. Also, by the way, the impact of not shipping enough product is at least as significant as in automotive. It just catches less headlines in newspapers. But if you think about the impact on industrial automation, which are huge -- which is huge machinery, which cannot be built if -- if there was more semi -- semiconductor supply or in the smart home. It's equally drastic as -- as it is in automotive, just catching less headlines.  Now, our big differentiator, more and more is our capability to offer complete solutions. Complete solutions around the processor. We've had that leadership in the -- in a very wide range and portfolio of processing solutions into industrial, but it's not very nicely complemented by connectivity, security, and analog attach, which really differentiates us from our competitors.  I would dare to say it's a very unrivaled position and offering here, which by the way, is also going to be very much in the spotlight of our Investor Day next week to give you much more detail, what we have and why we think that makes us grow so much in the time to come. Now from a supply chain or channel perspective, a lot of that business indeed is going through distribution, which because it goes to thousands, literally thousands of small customers. And this is exactly why that solution capability of NXP makes such a big difference. Because many of these companies which we are serving there through distribution don't have the capability themselves to deal with the complexity of these connected etch applications. When and if --we can offer them a complete solution than -- that has a huge advantage for both time-to-market levels or from an R&D perspective for them.  That's actually what I think is really a very very significant differentiator for us. Now, another element in the equation is we do have a relatively strong exposure to China. If you think about the industrial business, a lot is going through distribution and a lot is going into China. And just to anticipate the question, we do not see a slowdown there in China. But again, mind you, it's also that we are -- we continues to be supply kept.  As I said earlier, also in industrial, we could certainly run higher revenues if only we have more supply. Good news is also there our supply capability, as we discussed with [Indiscernible] earlier, is improving every month so that over time also there be hopefully get into a better place.
Blayne Curtis: Okay.
Operator: I'll ask questions to C.J.
Kurt Sievers: We'll take one last call.
Operator: Okay. And our last question is from C.J. Muse. Your line is open.
C.J. Muse: Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. I guess first question for you, Kurt, in your prepared remarks, you talked about auto supply demand balanced, probably not achieved until 2023. And so curious, as you contemplate that, what kind of assumptions are you making in terms of what kind of future inventory management will look like, both at the Tier 1 and OEMs. I imagine there's more of adjusting case as opposed to just in time. So, we would love to hear your thoughts on kind of that evolution that is likely coming ahead for the auto industry.
Kurt Sievers: Yes, C.J. Absolutely. I did indeed say that's I don't think there is broadly speaking enough supply next year. Two already stopped building those additional inventories. Because that's exactly what you're asking for, yes, we clearly see a demand by the OEMs to the Tier 1's and other participants in the extended supply-chain, explicitly not to semi companies, but in between, between us and the OEMs, the demand and the requirements to build more inventory.  Typical, if you want to size this, a typical ask is somewhere between 3 and 6 months, sometimes longer. And it has a very simple reasoning that's the manufacturing cycle time for semiconductor product. In a very simple way, they say, " Okay, if this is the additional inventory, then that puts us maybe on the safe side for more flexibility. " And, yes, this is something which I don't see the industry has the capability to build [Indiscernible] next year, but let's stem for '23.
C.J. Muse: Very helpful. And then I guess, my follow-up question, obviously we've seen positive mix shift on the EV side, which you spoke to earlier. I'm curious, as we're seeing more and more OEMs target full platforms, moving over to EV or hybrid as well. Curious how that has played with your full solution which I would think would fit nicely. I would love to hear your thoughts there.
Kurt Sievers: We love it C.J. We talked a lot about our capability from -- actually also from a solution perspective in battery management solutions, which is greatly benefiting from this foster and accelerated penetration. We will open the [Indiscernible] next week a little bit more in the Investor Day and give you insight in what else we do in electrification, because we are not only with BMS exposed to this accelerated trends.  It's a very good thing for NXP, and it goes beyond battery management. By battery management itself, obviously, is benefiting very, very greatly. I guess, with this we come to the end of the call. Which may be gets me in a position just to summarize very briefly. I mean, it's a turbulent time out there, but I'm really proud that we could deliver what I think is a very good quarter three, have a strong guidance into quarter four, but even more so, we continue to have excellent momentum also into next year, which means continued strong demand across our end markets. No inventory build out there.  And we see that our supply capability is getting better and better and better up to stop matching that demand in the future. So with that, I thank you very much for your attendance today and I hope to hear and see quite a few of you also next week when we have our much more extended Investor Day in New York. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, you may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-08-03 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to NXP's 2Q '21 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Jeff Palmer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Jeff Palmer: Thank you, Crystal, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the NXP Semiconductor's second quarter 2021 earnings call. With me on the call today is Kurt Sievers, NXP's President and CEO; and Peter Kelly, our CFO. The call today is being recorded and will be available for replay from our corporate website. Today's call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that can cause NXP's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, the macroeconomic impact on specific end markets in which we operate, the sale of new and existing products and our expectations for the financial results for the third quarter of 2021. Please be reminded that NXP undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements. For a full disclosure of forward-looking statements, please refer to our press release. Additionally, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are driven primarily by discrete events that management does not consider to be directly related to NXP's underlying core operating performance. Pursuant to Regulation G, NXP has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our Q2 earnings press release, which will be furnished to the SEC on Form 8-K and available on NXP's website in the Investor Relations section at nxp.com. Before we start the call today, I'd like to highlight our upcoming 2021 Analyst Day. At this time, we are planning on hosting an in-person event in New York City on Thursday, November 11, 2021. We will open up an online registration site over the next week, and we would suggest interested parties to pre-register as space will be limited this cycle. I would like to now turn the call over to Kurt.
Kurt Sievers: Yes. Thank you very much, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. We really appreciate you joining our call today. I will review our quarter two results and I will discuss our guidance for quarter three. Furthermore, I will provide an updated perspective on how we view the current demand environment. Now let me start with quarter two. Overall, our results were better than the midpoint of our guidance with the contribution from the communication infrastructure end markets stronger than planned and above the high end of our guidance. At the same time, the trends in the auto, industrial and mobile markets were all slightly above the midpoint of our guidance. Taken together, NXP delivered quarter two revenue of $2.6 billion, an increase of 43% year-on-year and $26 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. These are very good results given the constrained supply position we knew we would face entering the quarter. Our non-GAAP operating margin in quarter two was a strong 32%, 1,130 basis points better than the year ago period and 70 basis points above the midpoint of our guidance. Our strong operating profit performance was driven by a richer product mix. Now let me turn to the specific trends in our focused end markets. In automotive, quarter two revenue was $1.26 billion, up 87% versus the year ago period and slightly above the midpoint of our guidance. In industrial and IoT, quarter two revenue was $571 million, up 31% versus the year ago period and slightly above the midpoint of our guidance. In mobile, quarter two revenue was $347 million, up 36% versus the year ago period and slightly above the midpoint of our guidance. And lastly, in communication infrastructure and other, quarter two revenue was $416 million, down 8% year-on-year, however, about $21 million better than our guidance. With this, let me move to our outlook. We are guiding the midpoint of quarter three revenue to $2.85 billion, up 26% versus the third quarter of 2020, within the range of up 22% to up 29% year-on-year. From a sequential perspective, this is up 10% at the midpoint versus the prior quarter. At the midpoint of this range, we anticipate the following trends in our business. Automotive is expected to be up in the low-50% range versus quarter three 2020 and up in the mid-teens range versus quarter two '21. Industrial and IoT is expected to be up in the high-teens percent range year-on-year and up in the mid-single-digit range versus quarter two '21. Mobile is expected to be down in the low-single-digit range year-on-year and down in the mid-single-digit range versus quarter two '21. And finally, communication infrastructure and other is expected to be up in the low-single-digit range versus the same period a year ago and up about 10% on a sequential basis. At this point, let me give you an update on NXP's current demand position. As I shared with you on our last earnings call, we had anticipated product supply to be a challenge in quarter two, and this is indeed what we experienced. With the continuation of robust demand, we expect supply to be a challenge for the foreseeable future. We do continue to work very closely with our customers on a day-to-day basis to accommodate their most pressing short-term requirements. During quarter two, based on the orders and all of the various actions we took over the last six to nine months, we began to see wafer supply from our foundry partners and internal fabs improve. We do anticipate continued increase of wafer supply during quarter three and beyond, which will support our revenue growth in subsequent quarters. However, with customer demand outstripping current supply, a situation that we see across all our end markets, we are working diligently to secure additional supply to achieve a healthy balance of demand versus supply. A significant number of our customers are also taking action by placing non-cancellable and non-returnable orders for the medium term. Furthermore, based on customer discussions and also based on our own analysis, we do not believe there is excess inventory of NXP components along the extended supply chain. Additionally, we continue to make significant investments as a direct result of the very detailed conversations and associated commitments concerning long-term demand across our customer base, especially within the automotive and industrial end markets. These investments include long-term contractual commitments to our front end foundry partners in order to assure supply as well as making investments to expand our internal front end capacity and our internal back end test and assembly capabilities so as to avoid potential bottlenecks as wafer supply materializes. Notwithstanding this challenging supply environment, our results and guidance clearly validate the excellent underlying long-term growth, profitability and cash-generating capability of our business. We continue to see our company-specific key revenue growth drivers in our strategic end markets unfold as we have long anticipated. These drivers include our 77 gigahertz radar systems, our e-corporate solutions, the domain and zonal processes and the electrification products, including our battery management systems, all in the automotive market. And within the broad-based industrial and IoT market, our significant and focused investments to enable complete secure connected edge processing solutions are being very well validated by strong customer design win awards. And these are just a few of the opportunities we have shared with you at our Product Teach-In, all of them will continue to contribute to our future growth. While we will not provide specific guidance beyond the current quarter, we do anticipate quarter four revenue will be greater than quarter three on an absolute basis. And we are highly confident that 2021 marks just the beginning of a longer term upside for NXP within our strategic end markets. In summary, we are very encouraged by the continued and consistent rapid rebound in demand across our end markets. Our employees are highly engaged to drive our success. We have a robust pipeline of new and innovative products. And the customer response engagement and design win momentum all underpin our optimism about the future potential of NXP. Before concluding my prepared remarks, I would like to speak to the impact the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have on NXP. The pandemic remains active with spikes that continue to plague multiple regions where we have operations, namely India in the second quarter and Southeast Asia most recently. We continued to remain very vigilant enforcing our safety protocols across all of our global sites. We have initiated successful vaccination drives in several countries for our team members and their families. However, the highly contagious Delta variant has required that we reverse to a complete work from home situation in several of our locations. I am extremely proud of all our employees for their dedication and for their resilience during this very challenging period. I would like to especially commend our manufacturing operations and customer-facing teams for their relentless focus and energy while assuring our customer success. It is their dedication and their hard work in the face of the pandemic and the very challenging supply environment at the same time, which truly make a difference. Now I would like to pass the call over to you, Peter, for a review of our financial performance. Peter?
Peter Kelly: Thanks, Kurt. Good morning to everyone on today's call. As Kurt has already covered the drivers of the revenue during the second quarter and provided our revenue outlook for the third quarter, I'll move to the financial highlights. Overall, our second quarter financial performance was very good, revenues were above the midpoint of our guidance range and we drove an improvement of non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP operating profit, both of which were above the high end of our guidance range. Additionally, we have implemented long-term supply agreements with our foundry partners, which we believe will enable NXP to deliver robust growth in the coming periods. Now moving to the details of the second quarter. Total revenue was $2.6 billion, up 43% year-on-year and above the midpoint of our guidance range. We generated $1.46 billion in non-GAAP gross profit and reported a non-GAAP gross margin of 56.1%, up 700 basis points year-on-year and above the high end of our guidance. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $626 million, up $110 million year-on-year and up $26 million from the second quarter. This was $3 million above the midpoint of our guidance due to increased variable comp driven by an improved first half performance. From a total operating profit perspective, non-GAAP operating profit was $830 million and non-GAAP operating margin was 32%, up 1,130 basis points year-on-year and was above the high end of our guidance. Non-GAAP interest expense was $91 million, $4 million above guidance as we issued $2 billion of new debt early in the quarter. Cash taxes for ongoing operations were $50 million and non-controlling interest was $9 million. Taken together, the below the line items were $1 million better than our guidance. Stock-based compensation, which is not included in our non-GAAP earnings, was $93 million. Now I'd like to turn to the changes in our cash and debt. Our total debt at the end of the second quarter was $9.59 billion, an increase of $1.98 billion due to the previously mentioned debt issuance. Our ending cash position was $2.91 billion, up $1.07 billion sequentially due to new debt and cash generation, offset by capital returns during the quarter. The resulting net debt was $6.68 billion, and we exited the quarter with a trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA of $3.55 billion. Our ratio of net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of Q2 was 1.9 times, and our 12-month adjusted EBITDA interest coverage was 10 times. Our liquidity is excellent and our balance sheet continues to be very strong. During the second quarter, we repurchased $1.2 billion of our shares and paid $155 million in cash dividends for a total of $1.36 billion of capital return to our owners. Subsequent to the end of the second quarter between July 5 and August 2, we repurchased an additional $1 billion of our shares via our 10b5-1 program, resulting in a total of $3.37 billion returned to our owners year-to-date. Turning to working capital metrics. Days of inventory was 88 days, an increase of 7 days sequentially. Our DIO continues to be below our long-term target of 95 days, and a sequential increase in the quarter was due to an increase in work in process driven by wafer supplies -- wafer supply deliveries to support our Q3 revenue ramp, while finished goods continued to drain to very low levels. We continue to closely manage our distribution channel with inventory in the channel at 1.6 months, flat sequentially and below our long-term targets. Both metrics reflect the continuation of strong customer order rates and a tight supply environment. It will take several quarters before we're able to rebuild on-hand inventory -- on-hand and channel inventories to our long-term target levels. Days receivables were 35 days, up 5 days sequentially and days payable were 92, an increase of 13 days versus the prior quarter as we continue to increase material orders to our suppliers. Taken together, our cash conversion cycle was 31 days, an improvement of 1 day versus the prior quarter, reflecting strong customer demand, solid receivables collections and positioning for customer deliveries in future periods. Cash flow from operations was $636 million and net CapEx was $150 million, resulting in non-GAAP free cash flow of $486 million. Turning to our expectations for the third quarter. As Kurt mentioned, we anticipate Q3 revenue to be $2.85 billion plus or minus $75 million. At the midpoint, this is up 26% year-on-year and 10% sequentially. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be about 56.3% plus or minus 30 basis points. Operating expenses are expected to be about $665 million plus or minus about $10 million, consistent with our long-term model. Taken together, we see non-GAAP operating margin to be about 33% at the midpoint. We estimate non-GAAP financial expense to be about $96 million and anticipate cash tax related to ongoing operations to be about $90 million. Please note, during the second quarter, we indicated that we anticipated full year cash taxes for 2021 to be approximately 9% and then it would be back end loaded into the second half of the year. Non-controlling interest will be about $9 million. And for Q3, we suggest that for modeling purposes, you use an average share count of 271 million shares, which is down about 13% -- sorry, down about 13 million shares from the year ago period as a result of the consistent execution of our communicated capital return policy. Finally, I have a few closing comments I'd like to make. One, demand trends continue to be strong across our target end markets and customer interest in our newest products continues to be robust. We are diligently working with our customers and our suppliers to address order request in a timely manner. Secondly, our third quarter guidance reflects the clear potential of our business model, both in terms of revenue growth as well as the significant profit flow through, which will enable us to drive our non-GAAP gross margin above the midpoint of our gross margin targets. Thirdly, our business continues to generate significant free cash flow. We continue to invest in our internal manufacturing capabilities, increasing CapEx to expand our back end capacity, but also to increase the output capacity of our existing front end wafer factories. We are steadfastly committed to our capital return policy and will return all excess cash free -- all excess free cash flow to our owners so long as our leverage ratio remains at or below 2 times net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. As Kurt mentioned, we believe the demand environment is strong. And notwithstanding the supply constraints, we continue to anticipate robust growth for the remainder of 2021 as well as into 2022. Finally, I'd like to thank all my colleagues for their outstanding work and dedication. We shouldn't forget that we are all still working on the stringent pandemic protocols. I'd like to now turn it back to the operator for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of CJ Muse from Evercore. Your line is open.
CJ Muse: Yes. Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, first question for you, Kurt. I was hoping you could speak more about the current state of the auto industry. I think there is a fear among some investors that the current auto run rate is closer to peak than trough and would love to hear your thoughts, what gives you confidence that strength is sustainable into '22 and beyond?
Kurt Sievers: Yes, hi. Good morning, CJ. We are clearly convinced that we are far away from a peak, especially in the auto end market. The way to look at this is clearly that while the SAR this year probably is going to grow around 10%, that's the latest data point we have from IHS, there is broad consensus that it's going to grow another around 10% next year, and only then it will actually surpass the absolute volumes levels from the pre-pandemic year of 2019. But more importantly, CJ, as we've discussed many times in the past, our content gains, company-specific content gains, and I mentioned a few in my prepared remarks, like radar, eCockpit, zonal processes and the battery management in electrification, really, really drives specific strength and growth for NXP. And from a market perspective, I'd say that the content gains in general maybe are accelerating a little, especially thanks to the accelerated pace to xEVs. So we do see that the number of xEVs as a portion of the total car production is growing faster than anybody had anticipated. So the latest data we see, again, I'm quoting I think IHS here, it was like 12% of the total car production last year dedicated for xEVs. It's going to be more like a quarter next year and then growing fast from there further onwards. Since xEVs have a significantly higher silicon content compared to traditional combustion engine vehicles, this is another strong driver for the auto market. So far away from a peak. And finally, very tactically, because I know everybody wants to speak and wants to hear about that. I mean, trust me, I'm in daily contact with the CEOs of the both the Tier 1 customers of us, which are serving the car companies and the car companies themselves, on a daily level trying to make sure that we can fulfill their most pressing needs, really handholding shipments day in day out. So there is not a single piece of inventory anywhere in the extended supply chain. They want to build more cars. So I have any confidence that this keeps growing.
CJ Muse: That's very helpful. Thank you. I guess, as a follow-up, Peter, gross margins are stellar. I think reading your 10-Q, you talked about the benefit of increased loadings, but that mix was not helpful and that you had higher personnel costs. How are you thinking about I guess COVID-related costs unwinding? What kind of impact that would have on a positive side? And from current levels, how should we be thinking about uplift from here as presumably loadings continue to move higher?
Peter Kelly: I think the -- so first of all on the COVID test in terms -- in the context of our gross margin. To be honest, I think the costs are relatively low. We've been running our factories really much the same way we have in the past. I mean, obviously, you've got the cost of just disinfecting the factory more often. We've been paying for lots of kind of medical support, but I'm not sure it's big enough to really influence the margin. I think in terms of the additional utilization, you're seeing the benefits of that as we go from Q2 to Q3. So our guidance, 56.3% in Q3 really shows our gross margin with our factories running full out. So as we kind of expand our revenue and go into 2022, you won't see increased utilization because we actually have to add capacity. We're running pretty much full out in Q3. So I still think 56% is I think is a great number for us, and we've gotten there quicker than we thought we would do. And I think the answer to your question is still, 57% is still a couple of years away and is more around new product introduction. Mix helped us from Q2 into -- sort of Q1 into Q2, and that's why we did a little bit better in Q2. But the big impact from Q2 to Q3 is really the additional utilization and being able to run our factories, particularly the back end full out.
CJ Muse: Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of the America. Please go ahead.
Vivek Arya: Thank you for taking my questions. On the first one, Kurt, specific to autos, when do you think supply increases enough to meet demand? And importantly, what should investors look to be reassured that the industry supply response will be disciplined? So for example, if we see headlines around any specific foundry increasing microcontroller production significantly, how should we react to that? So I appreciate that you mentioned that you are in daily touch with customers and there isn't any inventory today, but as you also mentioned, the industry is increasing supply. So how should we be assured that the supply response is not going to overwhelm demand at some point?
Kurt Sievers: Yes. Hi, Vivek. Good morning. Of course, we are watching this as always in through every cycle very, very carefully. But again, I want to reassure you, I think we really are quite far away from this, because at this point, and I mean you can read the headlines every day, the industry is still short from a supply perspective. And then you are referring to some foundry statements about 60% increase of microcontroller shipments, there isn't that much. I mean, our -- I think our auto supply or revenue in the first and second quarter taken together is also around 50% up over the last year, and that's also what the industry takes given the record lows of last year. So last year is not a good comparison. I think it's more meaningful to benchmark back to 2019 or even 2018 when the industry was more at peak levels from a car production perspective. So how do we check this? I mean, I would really say most of our product is very application-specific. So we are in extremely close contact. And that is new not only with the Tier 1 suppliers, but also directly with the OEMs where the product is going. So we have a very, very good visibility in the meantime on the true demand much more than ever before in history. And if you think about the portion which goes through distribution, we as always, continue to be super disciplined on the months of inventory with our distributors. And as we've published, we again stayed as a -- on a really low number with 1.6 months. I mean, that's not the same number we had the quarter before, but you know that our target model is more around 2.4, 2.5. So we watch it very carefully. Given the supply situation, I think the transparency has significantly increased, especially in what we are serving, which is very application-specific product. I could imagine that the whole question you are asking is certainly for more commodity like products, more difficult. In our case where it is so crystal clear which product goes where into what application at which car company, we have much less of a concern on this. And given that visibility, I'm very confident that we are still quite a bit away from the situation you're describing.
Vivek Arya: Got it. Very helpful. And then for my follow-up, I'm curious why you're mobile sales, if I heard correctly, would be down sequentially and then also year-on-year, because isn't Q3 supposed to be a seasonally stronger quarter for shipments into that market? And are we to assume that mobile sales will stay subdued even into Q4? So just why are mobile sales not behaving kind of in line with the usual seasonal pattern we see in that industry? Thank you.
Kurt Sievers: Yes. Vivek, I'd say, in general, there isn't much of a seasonal pattern this year anyway given the situation. But here specifically, yes, you're right, we are guiding sequentially and also annually a little bit down. It really has to do with the supply constraints. So we have a supply constraint for some products in the mobile market, which we know we will address later on, so this is just of a temporary nature. But for quarter three, it just hits us that we can ship to the amount which we want to ship. The good news is, it doesn't cost us any market share, so we don't lose any socket with this. We fully keep our momentum going, and it's of a temporary nature. If you do the annual comparison, I also might want to remind you that last year Q3 was a bit of a special quarter in mobile because it was the last quarter before the Huawei ban, which actually benefited quarter three in our mobile business since people had a bit more in Q3 than since it stopped totally in quarter four. So that's the simple background not more.
Vivek Arya: Got it. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line from the line of Stacy Ragson from Bernstein Research. Your line is open.
Stacy Ragson: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. For my first question, I wanted to double-click once again on the content increase in auto. I mean, you've called out EVs specifically. I guess, a couple of things. Can you tell us how much of your auto business is being driven by EV today? I guess, of those content-specific drivers, which one do you think is the biggest driver in the near-term? And how much of the lift in the next quarter do you think is being driven just by end market unit growth versus like content increase because you're selling into higher content vehicles?
Kurt Sievers: Yes. Stacy, in general, our key driver for revenue growth in xEVs is clearly the battery management solutions which have a fantastic exposure. I think in our Investor Teach-In, we told you that we would have 60% CAGR over the next couple of years. And I can absolutely reconfirm here that we are, at least, if not more than on track with that trend in battery management solutions. Now if you take it a little bit wider, it is actually more because a lot of our microcontrollers and other products are also very strongly exposed to the increased content of xEVs. We will actually go in a bit more detail on that particular question, Stacy, in our Investor Day, which Jeff has just highlighted, November 11 to parse it a little bit more in a more detailed way on how this shows up. But overall, just take it for granted that the double silicon content of a xEV versus the conventional drivetrain gives a significant benefit also to NXP. So we are significantly benefiting from a higher rate of xEVs, which is a strong push for our content growth story here.
Stacy Ragson: Got it. Thank you. For my follow-up, I want to ask about the cash returns. So you've bought back a lot of stock. I think as of March, you upped the buyback. You had something like $2.6 billion in authorization and you're through like $2.2 billion right now. So you're almost through the whole authorization, but you're still guiding share counts down. So I guess, do we expect even more? Are you going to return more than 100% this year? And I guess, just given the strength of the buyback as it exists, can you talk a little bit about what that suggests? I suppose it shows that you have -- I guess, it reinforces that confidence you're talking about growth in the next year. But I guess, long picture, why you're buying back so much stock right now? And should we expect even more cash return as we go through the rest of the year since it seems like you're mostly through the buyback to date?
Peter Kelly: So -- maybe I'll take that, Kurt. So I guess, the answer to your second or third question there is, we have a lot of confidence in terms of where the company is going. So clearly, we think buying our stock at the moment is a good investment. In terms of how much, it is really quite simple. We've said all along, we'll keep our net debt to trailing 12 months EBITDA at 2 times level. So we'd buy back to that level all the time, and we'll continue to do that for the foreseeable future. And if that results in us buying -- if that results in us returning more than 100% this year, that's what the result is. But to be honest, it's pretty mathematical. We're just staying at 2 times net debt.
Stacy Ragson: Got it. That's helpful. Thank you, guys.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Ross Seymore: Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. I had one clarification and one question and then a follow-up, if I can be so bold. But have you guys shipped the $90 million in shortages out of Texas? Did you catch up on all of that in automotive or where have you? That's the clarification. And then I guess the longer term question maybe for Kurt on the auto side is, are you seeing the customers change their behavior at all? The just-in-time practices that that sector has adopted seemingly have backfired on them a bit with the velocity of demand recently. Are you -- any of the conversations you're having highlighting structural changes or is this all basically just short-term reactive movement and you don't think anything is really going to change a couple of years down the road for the industry as far as just-in-time?
Kurt Sievers: Yes. Thanks, Ross. On the first one, we talked indeed about $100 million, I think I remember which we lost for the second quarter revenue given the winter storm in our two Texas facilities, that is correct. What I can tell you is indeed that both factories are up and running completely. So we are up to the pre-storm and higher output levels in both factories, so firing on all cylinders again. And with that, we have the output which we would have wished to have already in the first place. So that is good news, both from a revenue perspective going forward, because it is steady. I mean, this is not a one-time effect, but it's steady output. But it's also good news from a supply perspective since old factories had a significant exposure, as we discussed earlier to automotive and the comms infrastructure market which were badly waiting for these products. So we are glad and thankful to our employees who have restored operations in record time. On the other half of your question, Ross, I see signs of a structural change in the behavior of the auto, especially also of the auto and customers. And I think there are two pieces to this. The one is going to be indeed realizing that a just-in-time system is not totally compatible with the three to six months manufacturing cycle time in semiconductors if you don't have some sort of a buffer in between which is dealing with it. So some more inventory in the extended supply chain I think is going to be a result of this. Now when you ask me, is this being implemented? My answer is no, but it's just because the supply is not there. I mean, at this point in time, people are planning for this at some point, but they can't implement it yet. But I think this is going to be eventually a structural change. The other one is actually the -- first the transparency which we get directly from the car companies. As I mentioned earlier, we've never had so much clarity about what product in which application in which model year will run at what volume. So this is becoming much, much better than it has ever been because structurally we are just moving much closer in a collaboration with the car companies. And I think with that also the binding forecasts, so not only providing that forecast, but also making it more binding on a mid to long-term basis is going to be a structural change, and that's a significant one because that wasn't the case in the past. So a more binding forecast will also help to foresee and plan with the right capacities on our end.
Ross Seymore: Thanks for that color, Kurt. One quickly for you Peter. You gave great color on the gross margin side of things. Another target you guys have given historically is the OpEx intensity, and I think it ranges anywhere between 20% to 24% as of your last Analyst Meeting, and I know you might be updating that later this year. But can you talk just a little bit about the leverage potential there? I think this year it looks like you're running kind of within that target range, but at the higher end kind of 23%, 23.5%. Do you foresee some leverage getting to the lower end of that range or just generally how should we think of OpEx relative to revenue growth?
Peter Kelly: Certainly for the moment, I'd think of 23% of revenue, 16% for R&D and 7% for SG&A. There's probably some leverage in the SG&A number because although we typically increased sales and marketing, G&A, we'd more likely to hold flattened dollars. But I think certainly for the moment, 23% is a good number to plan on.
Ross Seymore: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
John Pitzer: Yes. Good morning, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Congratulations on the solid results. Kurt, I wanted to ask a little bit about your comm infrastructure business which came in much better than guide for the June quarter and it's going to grow nicely in the September quarter. I know that pre the Huawei ban, you were very excited by some design wins you've had won there, but clearly had the kind of temper expectations with the ban, but it seems like you guys might be more levered to the 5G cycle than some of us think. Can you just walk through kind of what you think is driving that growth, especially given how good the margin could be in that business?
Kurt Sievers: Yes. So John, indeed, we did talk last year about significant design win traction around the large Chinese customer which did fall apart. So indeed, this is still not there. I just want to be clear, the business which is now performing and which we guide for the next quarter is not related to this design win which we had talked about last year. The outperformance in the second quarter is actually across the segment. It does include some of the 5G build-outs, but it's just across all of the product sub-segments which are in this revenue segment. So it is not only 5G, but it does include 5G. Now if you think about the nice guidance for the third quarter in comms infra, then I'd say, yes indeed. As we had anticipated and actually I think discussed on a number of the last calls, we do see, I'd say, two trends around 5G which are letting us grow. We see the anticipated ramps for these multi-technology modules in the U.S. So multi-technology means LDMOS and gallium nitride, our new -- from our new gallium nitride both technology products and facility in Arizona, but it's also that we are nicely included in the China tenders, which are those macro base stations for the rural areas, which are actually in the frequency range sub 2.1 gigahertz. So somewhere between I think 700 megahertz and 2.1 gigahertz which is just perfect fit to our LDMOS capability and leadership. So it is those two, John, from a go-forward basis when you think about Q3 and beyond, which are indeed driving nicely our growth. The U.S. multi-technology modules for 5G and those CP3 tenders in China.
John Pitzer: That's really good color, Kurt. And then, Peter, in your prepared comments you talked about the high class problem of needing to expect both front end and back end capacity. Is that mostly being done with outsourced partners, so it's more of a working capital hit than a CapEx hit or how do we think about CapEx over the next several quarters as you continue to try to make supply catch up to demand?
Peter Kelly: CapEx will be about 7% this year. So yes, it will step up a bit in Q3 and Q4. Mainly, there's a lot of assembly and tests going in there, but also some bottleneck busting in our actual fabs. So CapEx will be up. I don't see working capital going up any time really. I mean, it's -- we definitely like more inventory if we could get it. But as fast as we get it, we tend to build, which is the comments I had around finished goods being at an all-time low. We do have a bit more raw material and work in progress from shipments from the foundries towards the end of the quarter that we received. So I guess, stepping back, we're definitely investing more in internal capacity and that will have a positive impact on us next year, and we continue to work very hard with our other suppliers just to get additional supply from them. But as fast as we get it, we build it and ship it to customers. So I don't really see our inventory levels getting anything back to anything like normal anytime soon.
John Pitzer: Perfect. Thanks, guys, and congratulations.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of William Stein from Truist Securities. Your line is open.
William Stein: Great. Thanks for taking my questions, and I'll add my congratulations especially on the guide, very strong. I'm wondering if you can remind us as sort of a clarification, the breakout within the comm infrastructure business. I think we tend to think about this as largely or all RF power amplifiers, but I know there is digital networking and I think there's still some ID card business in there as well. Can you remind us of the split and maybe how you expect the three of those pieces to grow over time?
Kurt Sievers: So hi, Will. Thanks for your congrats on the guidance. The subset is indeed as you said, the RF power for infrastructure, it is about digital networking and there is some secure card business also in there. We will not break out the details between them, Will. But what I can say, and I think I mentioned it earlier, the outperformance in the second quarter was across all of them. So it wasn't limited to one of these sub-segments, but it was actually across all of them. When you think about the guide and the growth into the third quarter, it is probably less by the 5G-related comms infra RF power.
William Stein: Thanks for that. And one more if I can there, sort of product question. I forget when, one or two years ago, perhaps, you started talking about the ultra wideband products and the growth that you anticipated seeing in handsets and automotive. And I'm wondering if you can provide some update in terms of your revenue traction in those two end markets for this product category and the outlooks for them today? Thank you.
Kurt Sievers: Yes. Happy to do so, Will. This because it's really nicely on track, just to remind everybody that it's not just about product, this is a complete ecosystem play. There indeed, we offer the radio, the secure element and software for solutions across automotive, mobile and IoT. We are very much on track, Will, with I think what we said at the Teach-In to have some $300 million to $400 million revenue across those segments in '23. So in only two years from now. As of today, I'd say, mobile is actually happening as we speak. If you think about the Android world, I'd have to say, with all the major Android phone companies, we are working very closely. Automotive is now closely following, and that was just a function of mobile because obviously the automotive use case of using your mobile as a car key needs the phones to be in place firstly, this is now happening. So the first cars will be out in the market in the second half of this year and next year. And there, I'd dare to say with a relatively high degree of certainty that any car company which is working in and on an ultra wideband implementation is working with NXP. So we are highly and very positively exposed here. Finally, we also see a good traction with first IoT implementations. One of the early examples are those techs which help you to find stuff, which you might have lost. But it also -- we also see nice design wins in door locks for home properties, for example. There you would then use your mobile phone to open your front door and unlock it. So very much on track, Will. Again, the numbers which we had given were $300 million to $400 million revenue size for NXP in two years from now, and we think the market for this is growing at some 40% over the next couple of years.
William Stein: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of the Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Toshiya Hari: Hi, good morning. Thanks so much for taking the question. I just had one for Kurt or Peter. I wanted -- I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit on the LTSAs that you've already signed with foundry partners or perhaps you're looking to sign going forward? We read about price increases from the foundries going forward. How should we think about the balance between cost inflation for you guys versus your ability to price higher as well going forward? And my guess is the 57% number that Peter you alluded to embeds some of those dynamics, but wanted to clarify that as well? Thank you.
Kurt Sievers: I'll let Peter answer, but I really want to make one upfront statement because that's -- this is -- it is important. Yes, input cost is rising. And yes, we pass on the cost increases. But this is not a tool for us to artificially increase margins. We are in a large application-specific and very trustful relationship with our customers for years to come. So we do pass on the input cost increases, but that's more the mechanism here to structurally increase margins. Peter, you might want to give more color.
Peter Kelly: I think you just answered the question really, Kurt. Yes, it's -- we are not a commodity company, we don't raise prices when times are tight and reduce them when times are not tight. What's been very interesting about this whole change is there's really been two big factors. One, Kurt was talking about before, which is, it's enabling us to build deeper relationships with our customers and understand their requirements and their supply chains a lot better than we have in the past. And in terms of our suppliers, you can -- without kind of going into a lots of detail, you can actually find out who are your true partners and who will support you in the years to come and who are the guys who are a little bit more predatory. But ours is a market and supply chain where it's really built on long-term relationships and long-term sources of supply both for our customers and for ourselves and for a predictable level of pricing and profitability.
Toshiya Hari: Thank you, and congrats.
Peter Kelly: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Caso from Raymond James. Your line is open.
Chris Caso: Yes, thank you. Good morning. A question on the capacity additions and the CapEx that you said was stepping up here in the second half of the year. How -- for how long do you expect that to continue? I imagine that the equipment lead times are extended also. So you have to be giving your equipment suppliers some visibility on this. I guess the question is, how long will you -- do you need into continue adding capacity in order to get caught up with the level of demand right now?
Kurt Sievers: Well, I guess, the very simple answer is we will continue to need capacity for the foreseeable future because we believe there is a really healthy cycle going on in terms of our product. So one thing that's really come out in the last six months is that for those people outside the semiconductor industry, they've really begun to understood -- understand that semis are a core part of everything we do. So to the extent that GDP grows over the next few years, you will see semiconductors grow at probably a faster rate. I think the thing to remember with us, about 70% -- just 70% to 80% of our assembly and test capacity is internal. So that will continue to be a kind of healthy source of capital requirements, and I think about 57%, 58% of our wafer supply is external. We're not likely to have built a new fab, but we're constantly updating the equipment we have there to keep them current. So I think in the past we've said, through the cycle we will spend 5% to 7% on CapEx. Last year it was below 5%. This year it will be at 7%. We'll probably update a more longer term view at the Analyst Day in November.
Chris Caso: [Technical Difficulty]
Kurt Sievers: I'm sorry, you're breaking up.
Chris Caso: [Technical Difficulty]
Peter Kelly: I apologize. I don't know if it was me, but I couldn't hear anything there. I don't know, Kurt, you could hear what he said.
Kurt Sievers: I had the same problem. But I guess, you were asking about something of the cost of increased inventory?
Chris Caso: Yes, I'm sorry. I'm not sure what happened. The question is, as the inventory -- as the automakers ask for more security supplies, more inventory, who bears the cost of that? Will that be inventory that the automakers will take possession of and pay for in advance? Will it be some combination of just more inventory on the hub? Who basically pays the cost of that?
Kurt Sievers: Well, first, let me point out again, it's not something which happens to any extent today because the capability is not there. Once it will happen, it won't be us. I mean, it needs to be part of their business model. So it will have to be somewhere between Tier 1 suppliers, auto companies and maybe some distributors in some cases, but not on our end.
Chris Caso: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Your line is open.
Blayne Curtis: Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. I just wanted to revisit on the supply side, just the cadence that you're bringing it on. So when you -- the growth you're seeing in September, will you -- will inventory -- will you have to ship out inventories or are you able to match that with supply? Just trying to understand the cadence you're bringing it in. And then you mentioned mobile, you're kind of re-prioritizing for a quarter. Is that just kind of a one-off or are you -- are there other segments that even with the strong guide in September that you're having to prioritize away from them?
Kurt Sievers: Well, Blayne, we continue to be constrained across the board. And of course, we need to take all the time certain priority decisions, and indeed, mobile is kind of suffering in the third quarter, but everything is relatively sought across the board. The additional supply coming online is really gradual from many different sources. I mean, we talked about it. We have increasing traction with the mid and longer term contracts with our foundry suppliers. We have Texas fully up and running by now. We have, as Peter alluded to, invested both into our internal testing, not only capability, but also looking at some expansions of our internal front end factories. So all of these things across the different technologies and products are happening gradually. So it's not a one-time event. But I would say with the demand being as strong as we continue to foresee it, it will remain tight for a while. But the one really suffering in Q3 is indeed mobile.
Blayne Curtis: Thanks. And then just want to ask you on the auto side. One, source the content gains always new model year that typically make seasonality in auto is kind of a March heavy. It seems like maybe you're seeing '22 model year earlier? Just kind of curious, did you think about that content portion? You're obviously benefiting now from maybe a mix shift to EV, but just kind of auto seasonality, is it different this year? Are you seeing maybe model years earlier? Just kind of walk us through -- obviously, you don't want to guide for some remarks, but just any thoughts on kind of seasonality for the auto business off to September?
Kurt Sievers: Well, Blayne, I think I said for the total business that we expect Q4 in absolute revenue terms to be above Q3. That's one. Secondly, I don't think there is really seasonality in auto at this point in time because dealer inventories are at record lows in the U.S. and in China, and they just can't build as many cars as they would wish to build. So I think it's more a function of supply availability in terms of when they would do what. So at this point in time, it is really supply constrained for them, which I think overwrites any seasonality.
Blayne Curtis: Thank you.
Operator: There are no further questions at this...
Kurt Sievers: At this point, Jeff, I guess we are running against time, right?
Jeff Palmer: Yes. That's correct, Kurt.
Kurt Sievers: Yes. So let me then maybe from my end conclude the call with saying, I hope we could give you a good view and transparency into the continued very strong demand which we are seeing across the board. And at the same time, the news that we are seeing increased supply capability coming online, which drives the strong guidance into the third quarter from a revenue perspective. We also told you that quarter four is going to be yet higher than quarter three, and we continue to see this trend going into the next year. And at the same time, we see that our gross margins are now very much hitting the mark, which we had anticipated for a long time. With that, I thank you for your attendance today. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, all. This concludes our today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-04-27 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Q1 2021 NXP Semiconductors Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Jeff Palmer from NXP.
Jeff Palmer: Thank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the NXP Semiconductors first quarter 2021 earnings call. With me on the call today is Kurt Sievers, NXP's President and CEO; and Peter Kelly, our CFO. The call today is being recorded and will be available for replay from our corporate website. Today's call will include forward-looking statements that include -- involve risks and uncertainties that could cause NXP's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, the macroeconomic impact on the specific end markets in which we operate, the sale of new and existing products and our expectations for the financial results for the second quarter of 2021. Please be reminded that NXP undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements. For a full disclosure of forward-looking statements, please refer to our press release today. Additionally, we'll refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are driven primarily by discrete events and that management does not consider to be directly related to NXP's underlying core operating performance. Pursuant to Regulation G, NXP has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our first quarter 2021 earnings press release, which will be furnished to the SEC on Form 8-K and is available on NXP's website in the Investor Relations section at nxp.com. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Kurt. Kurt, your call.
Kurt Sievers: Yes. Thanks very, very much, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. We really appreciate you joining our call today. Today, I will review our quarter one results and discuss our guidance for Q2. Furthermore, I will provide an updated perspective on how we view the current supply-demand environment, including the recovery of our two Austin-based facilities, which were hit by the severe winter storm in February. And additionally, I will discuss our efforts for sustainability. Now let me get started with quarter one. Our results were better than the midpoint of our guidance, with the contribution from the industrial and the communication infrastructure end markets, both stronger than planned. At the same time, trends in the Mobile and Auto markets were generally in line with our expectations, with Automotive being just slightly impacted by the severe winter storms in Texas. Taken together, NXP delivered quarter one revenue of $2.57 billion, an increase of 27% year-over-year and $17 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. Non-GAAP operating margin in Q1 was a strong 30.9%, 600 basis points better than the year-ago period, and about 50 basis points above the midpoint of guidance, driven both by improved mix and additional revenue. Now let me turn to the specific trends in our focus end markets. In Automotive, quarter one revenue was $1.23 billion, up 24% versus the year-ago period and about $13 million below our guidance. In Industrial & IoT, our quarter one revenue was $571 million, up 52% versus the year-ago period, and about $13 million better than our guidance. In Mobile, quarter one revenue was $346 million, up 40% versus the year-ago period and in line with our guidance. Reconciling for the sale of the voice and audio business, which closed during quarter one 2020, the underlying mobile end market growth was actually up a robust 46% year-over-year. And lastly, in Communication Infrastructure & Other, quarter one revenue was $421 million, up 4% year-on-year and about $17 million better than our guidance. Now, let me move to our outlook. We are guiding quarter two revenue at $2.57 billion, up about 40% versus the second quarter of 2020 within a range of up 38% to up 45% year-over-year. And from a sequential perspective, this is about flat at the midpoint versus the prior quarter. At the midpoint, we anticipate the following trends in our business. Automotive is expected to be up in the upper 80% range versus quarter two 2020 and up in the low single digits versus quarter one 2021. Industrial & IoT is expected to be up in the low 30% range year-over-year and flat versus quarter one 2021. Mobile is expected to be up in the mid-30% range and flat versus quarter one 2021. And finally, Communication Infrastructure & Other is expected to be down in the low-teens percent range versus the same period a year ago and down in the mid-single-digit range on a sequential basis. Now at this point, let me turn to an update on the current supply/demand environment. As I had shared with you on our last earnings call, as many of our customers started to resume full production during Q3 of 2020, we were faced with the challenge to balance a very accelerated rate of customer orders versus a very tight, if not sold out wafer supply situation. While our foundry partners have attempted to address our needs, it really has not been enough, and we were supply constrained in quarter one. This supply trend will continue through quarter two. And our current expectation is we will face a tight supply environment for at least the remainder of 2021. We would also note that in the medium-term, we have seen a significant increase in demand for our products, which is very consistent with our anticipated content gains and our design wins. In that very context, it is really insightful to compare to the pre-pandemic levels of 2019. When we look at total current revenue levels compared to the pre-pandemic levels in 2019, we actually plan to ship nearly 20% more in the first half of 2021 versus the first half of 2019. And more specifically, in automotive, we plan to ship at least 20% more in the first half of 2021 versus the first half of 2019. And this is while IHS suggests a drop of 10% in car production over the very same period. And now going forward, we see our overall revenue in the second half of 2021 being stronger than the first half of this year. And against these trends, we continue to have low channel and low on-hand inventory, which we do not anticipate rebuilding this year. Our customers are responding by placing long-dated, non-cancelable and non-returnable order requests. And we are making long-term strategic supply commitments to our partners in order to assure future supply. Against this challenging supply environment, we also had the very unfortunate and unexpected winter storms in Austin. And I am today pleased to share that our two wafer facilities in Austin are now fully back on line. And I would like to commend our manufacturing, our operations and our facilities teams for their superb effort and dedication to getting these two facilities back online in record time. Truly a job very well done. Notwithstanding the challenging supply environment or the natural disasters we faced, our results and guidance clearly validate the underlying long-term growth and profitability of our business. We acknowledge it has been a long process to deliver on our committed gross margin target. The next objective will be to demonstrate full year performance at the 55% gross margin target. And furthermore, on a positive note of recognition, NXP was added to the S&P 500 Index, which is a strong validation of a lot of hard work the entire NXP team has undertaken to drive growth, improve profitability and enhance free cash flow. Now before I pass the call over to Peter, I would like to take a minute and discuss our sustainability efforts, an area to which NXP has a long demonstrated history of commitment. At a more personal level, I do believe sustainability is a very important journey. We all need to embrace and undertake. And it's not just the finite destination. At NXP, we are dedicated to our long-term sustainability goals, which our employees, our customers, our suppliers and investors all believe are of the utmost importance. All our stakeholders are paying attention to the products we develop to how our company complements the communities we operate within and to how we attempt to lessen the impact our company has on our environment. And hence, we just recently published our annual Corporate Sustainability Report in our annual proxy statement, both of which set forth the progress we have achieved towards previously stated goals and lay out our vision for the future. In support of our continuous commitment to improve our environmental and social responsibility and our corporate governance metrics, there are a few areas I would like to highlight, starting with social responsibility. We have made clear our commitments to workplace diversity, equality, and inclusion. In order to ensure our working environment provides equal access and opportunity, we appointed a Head of Diversity, Equality and Inclusion, reporting directly to me and to our Executive Vice President of Human Resources. We are dedicated to creating an inclusive and diverse work environment where NXP appropriately mirrors to society and communities in which we operate. We have an ongoing commitment to improve and refine our corporate governance. In 2020, we have enhanced our human capital management disclosures, which expanded and detailed workforce demographics. We are committed to improving gender diversity throughout the organization, but especially within the company's leadership teams. Now, turning to environmental impact. In 2020, we met our 10-year goal of reducing our carbon footprint by 30%. We have achieved a 47% water recycling rate and we purchased 27% of our electricity from renewable sources, led by our factory in Nijmegen, which is running 100% on renewable energy. Finally, and certainly not least, our employees. We definitely believe our employees are the lifeblood of innovation and the spirit at NXP. We are dedicated to building a highly engaged workforce who will continuously push the boundaries of innovation. We view a highly engaged workforce as the very best early indicator of potential success for our company in the future. We measure this annually through a global employee survey called the winning culture survey. That survey looks at multiple early indicators of long-term employee engagement. It includes factors as employee views on company strategy, innovation, execution and leadership as well as culture, collaboration and a supportive work environment. And I'm proud to say that in 2020, we had a 90%-plus global participation rate. Now, in summary, we are very, very encouraged by the rapid rebound in demand across our end markets. Based on our customer conversations and order rates, it appears NXP is in the early stages of a longer-term company-specific growth cycle. Our employees are highly engaged to drive our success; we have a robust pipeline of new and innovative products; and customer response engagement, design win momentum all underpin our optimism about the future potential of NXP. I'm extremely proud of all our employees, but today, I would like to especially comment our manufacturing, our operations, and customer-facing teams for their relentless focus and energy while assuring our customer success. Their dedication and hard work in the face of a very challenging supply environment truly make a big difference. And now, I would like to pass the call to Peter for a review of our financial performance. Peter?
Peter Kelly: Thank you, Kurt and good morning to everyone on today's call. As Kurt has already covered the drivers of the revenue during the first quarter and provided our revenue outlook for the second quarter, I'll move on to the financial highlights. Overall, our first quarter financial performance was very good. Revenue was above the midpoint of our guidance range and we drove an improvement of both non-GAAP profit and non-GAAP operating profit. Moving to the details of the first quarter. Total revenue was $2.57 billion, up 27% year-on-year and above the midpoint of our guidance range. We generated $1.39 billion in non-GAAP gross profit and reported a non-GAAP gross margin of 54.2%, up 240 basis points year-on-year and above the high end of our guidance. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $600 million, up $55 million year-on-year and up $37 million from the fourth quarter. This was $10 million above the midpoint of our guidance due to increased variable compensation, driven by an improved first half performance. From a total operating profit perspective, non-GAAP operating profit was $792 million and non-GAAP operating margin was 30.9%, up 600 basis points year-on-year and was at the high end of our guidance. Non-GAAP interest expense was $87 million; cash taxes for ongoing operations were $40 million and non-controlling interest was $11 million; taken together, $13 million better than our guidance. Stock-based comp, which is not included in our non-GAAP earnings, was $91 million. Now I'd like to -- now I'd like to turn to the changes in our cash and debt. Our total debt at the end of the fourth quarter was $7.61 billion, essentially flat versus the fourth quarter. Our ending cash position was $1.84 billion, down $433 million sequentially, mainly due to share repurchases, offset by cash generation during the first quarter. The resulting net debt was $5.77 billion, and we exited the quarter with a trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA of $3.09 billion. Our ratio of net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was at the end -- was at the end of quarter 1 was 1. 9x and our 12-month adjusted EBITDA interest coverage was 8.6x. Our liquidity is excellent and our balance sheet continues to be very strong. During the first quarter, we paid $105 million in cash dividends and repurchased $905 million of our shares for a total of $1 billion of capital return to our owners during the quarter. Turning to working capital metrics, days of inventory was 81 days, an increase of 3 days sequentially and continues to be significantly below our long-term target of 95 days. We continue to closely manage our distribution channel with inventory in the channel at 1.6 months, flat sequentially and below our long-term target. Both metrics reflect the continuation of strong customer order rates and we continue to be in a supply-constrained position. It will take several quarters before we are able to rebuild on-hand and channel inventories to our long-term target levels. Days receivable were 30 days, up 2 days sequentially and days payable was 79 days, an increase of 4 days versus the prior quarter as we continue to increase material orders to our suppliers. Taken together, our cash conversion cycle was 32 days, up 1 day versus the prior quarter, reflecting strong customer demand, solid receivables collections and positioning for customer deliveries in future periods Cash flow from operations was $732 million and net CapEx was $150 million, resulting in non-GAAP free cash flow of $582 million. Turning to our expectations for the second quarter. As Kurt mentioned, we anticipate Q2 revenue to be about $2.57 billion, plus or minus about $70 million. At the midpoint, this is up 41% year-on-year and flat sequentially. We expect non-GAAP gross profit to be about 55.5%, plus or minus 30 basis points. Operating expenses are expected to be about $623 million, plus or minus about $10 million. And taken together, we see non-GAAP operating margin to be about 31.3% to the midpoint. We estimate non-GAAP financial expense to be about $87 million and anticipate cash tax related to ongoing operations to be about $55 million. Non-controlling interest will be about $9 million and for the second quarter, we suggest that for modeling purposes, you use an average share count of 283 million shares. Finally, I have a few closing comments I'd like to make. Firstly, demand trends continue be strong across our target and markets and customer interest in our newest products continues to be robust. We are diligently working with our customers and our suppliers to address order requests in a timely manner. Our second quarter guidance reflects the clear potential of our business model, both in terms of revenue growth as well as the significant fall-through, which will enable us to drive our non-GAAP gross margin target to the 55% level. With the new United States administration in place, the potential increase the cost – sorry, thirdly, with the new US administration in place, the potential increase for corporate income taxes is a large topic of interest. Unfortunately, at this point in time, there are too many variables in play, and it just makes it impossible for any company to forecast. Therefore, it seems pointless to speculate until we can get more clarity. On a more positive note, we do expect our cash taxes to be slightly lower than the originally envisaged for 2021. So 2021 will likely be 9% versus the previously indicated 10%. Fourthly, as we've said in the past, our capital return policy is to return all excess free cash flow to our owners. During the first quarter, the Board approved a $2 billion buyback authorization as well as a 50% increase in our quarterly cash dividend. During the quarter, we returned $1 billion to shareholders and we will continue to execute our stated capital return policy. Fifthly, as Kurt mentioned, we believe the demand environment is strong. And notwithstanding the supply constraints, we believe the second half of 2021 will be greater than the first half of the year. Sixth, and finally, I'd like to thank all my colleagues at NXP for the dedication and the incredible job executing in a truly unbelievable environment. So with that, I'd like to turn it back to the operator for any questions you might have.
Jeff Palmer: Renz, we'll poll for questions.
Operator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of C.J. Muse. Your line is now open.
C.J. Muse: Yes, good morning, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, Kurt, intrigued by your commentary around being in the early ages of long-term growth cycle for NXP. And I think we all -- all of us on the call understand the growth drivers behind the story, but would love to hear what's changed in your view, say, in the last three months? And if you could walk through that, that would be great.
Kurt Sievers: Yes, many thanks, C.J. Yes, absolutely. So, we do see us just being at the beginning of a longer term growth cycle. And I think, in that respect, I also tried to clarify that we do see the second half of the year growing again over the first half of this year. What has changed over the last three months is that the demand environment has, not only continued to be strong, but I would say we started to understand better and better some of the sustainable drivers of the demand environment. Now, with us being 50% exposed to the automotive end market, this is clearly one place where we do understand now how content increases are contributing significantly to this very, very robust demand environment where we absolutely see no reason why that should ease off or should go away. So, what I tried to say here is that our understanding of the demand environment has become better and deeper and with that, we better believe in it. Also, totally ruling out double ordering and any of these possible fears of piling inventories at any place. So, in our key segments and I can say that very explicitly for automotive, for industrial, but also for mobile, we do know and we do see that what we ship out is immediately being built into product and no inventory is being built in any place.
C.J. Muse: Very helpful. If I could follow up, Peter. Obviously, reaching 55%-plus is a great thing, but the next question is always what have you done for me lately? So, curious, does the model hold true going forward, every 5% increase in revenues, you get a 100 bps uptick in gross margins or how should we be thinking about the trajectory from here?
Peter Kelly: No, I wasn't thinking it that way. In 2019 and 2020, we were continually struggling on utilization. We were trying to use that kind of rule of thumb to explain what might happen as we go to full utilization. The good news now is we always said that around about 2.4, we could run 55%. So, we're a little bit above that 2.5 at 55.5%. We're pretty much now internally kind of at the high end of our utilization. So, I feel pretty good about the gross margin numbers where we are. But you'll see in our CapEx number, and for the full year, we'll probably do about 7% CapEx this year. We need to start adding -- or not we need, we are adding capacity, particularly in the back ends to cope with the additional revenue we're seeing. And also, over the last year or two, we've seen the amount of product we buy externally move up from the kind of low 50s to the high 50s percent. So, I think from a gross margin perspective, I'd say, clearly, the challenge, at the moment, is to demonstrate that we can consistently run at 55%, which we feel very, very comfortable about. And then over the next few years the things that will move us up to 57% and not so much revenue, they're more about the new product introductions and improving the cost performance of our products.
Q – C.J. Muse: Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ross Seymore. Your line is now open.
Ross Seymore: Good morning guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question and congrats on the strong results. Peter, I want to dive into the gross margin a little bit more tactically in the near term. Can you just discuss what drove the upside in the first quarter and the second quarter, and second quarter is especially impressive considering it appears that the mix between segments isn't really contributing significantly. So just a little bit of color on how you beat and then raised in the quarter and guide?
Peter Kelly: Yes. So in the first quarter, the biggest move Ross, was mix. We shipped proportionately less auto and more coming for an IoT. And to be honest, $10 million gives you 40 or 50 basis points of margin. So we're not talking about huge numbers. And as we go in from Q1 to Q2, it's really all about utilization. So we're not only able to run; obviously, not Austin, but our other fabs full out. But also, we're getting really great utilization now in our back ends. So there's always a few small things moving in different directions. But I think Q1, it was about utilization that helped us beat – sorry, Q1 was about mix, which helped us beat the guidance. But Q1 to Q2 is really about utilization and that's – now that we've been able to optimize is maybe the wrong word, but certainly utilize things a lot better, that's what gives me confidence on our gross margin going forward, really.
Ross Seymore: Great. I guess as my follow-up, one for Kurt. You talked about the confidence in the demand, the lack of double ordering second half over first half. I guess, if I narrowed it down to your automotive business, historically, we've had a typical delta of content above SAAR. And it sounds like you're confident that, that delta is actually expanding. So I guess, really, what's changed there? You have pretty long design cycles in that sort of business. And so, it's a little surprising to me that you would have something that would arise that -- in the short term that would increase your ability to outgrow SAAR as rapidly as you appear to do right now. So I guess just a little more color on what gives you that confidence would be helpful?
Kurt Sievers: Yes, thanks Ross. It is actually not that much all of a sudden as you would portray it, because we’ve seen this already building through the last year. But obviously, it's been all snowed under by the shutdowns, especially in the first half in the factories.  But if you think about content increases and that's why I made the comparison to 2019, which was more of a normal year, if you will then actually, over that period of time, it doesn't look that crazy at all. So that's one statement. But there is 2 more -- so it's not all of a sudden, but it's really been gradually building already over the period of the last 4 to 6 quarters, but very much disrupted by the by COVID. Now there is two more things which are really important here. The one is, yes, I do believe that especially the electric vehicle production rates are increasing faster than anticipated, which I believe makes it a content richer story than probably the initial forecast would have suggested. So the penetration of electric drivetrains is going faster, especially now, this year, than it was forecasted. Thirdly, and I think actually most importantly, we are now bearing fruit from all of the design wins in the focus areas we've been working on so hard over the past years. So what I'm saying is Ross, that some of this is clearly company specific. If I look at our growth rates in our focused businesses like radar, ADAS, battery management, the digital clusters, then it becomes very obvious that those are really pulling ahead the growth. So there is an underlying stronger momentum on content gains but I think a good part of this is also company-specific, meaning share gains for NXP.
Ross Seymore: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Vivek Arya. Please go ahead.
Vivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. I had two as well. Just one more on gross margin. I'm curious, Peter, what role is pricing playing, if any, in your gross margin? And if let's say, your Q3 and Q4 sales are above your Q2 sales, then all else being equal, can gross margins also exceed 55% in each of those two quarters?
Peter Kelly: In terms of pricing, it's having no impact whatsoever, Vivek. We said on our last call that although some suppliers were being very tactical and trying to take advantage of the situation, that was not our strategy. We said we would definitely pass on any cost increases that we have, and we're able to do that. But we have no intention of trying to improve our profitability through gouging our customers. And there's certainly no impact of anything even remotely like that in Q1 or Q2. In terms of the second half, as I said before to Ross, gross margin from here is not really driven by additional revenue. Yes, could there be some small impacts here? Sure. I think I'd say two things. One is I have a strong confidence that the level of – the level of gross margin we are at the moment. So I think that's a good thing. And I think as we go forward, our focus has to be on how we bring out our new products and new versions of our existing products to improve our profitability. But I think after all of the debate over the past few years on whether we can really run at 55%, I think that's most definitely behind us.
Vivek Arya: Got it. And for my follow-up, Kurt, I'm curious how much of the unfulfilled demand that you are seeing this year can help to extend on the cycle into 2022? So for example, when I look at your automotive customers, and I think you have mentioned that given what the auto industry went through in this cycle, right, they might do things differently. So I was hoping you could talk about what they can do differently that helps to extend your demand cycle and visibility? And then outside of autos, when I look at your deficit on the distribution side, right, that's still close to, I think, 0.8 months, right? So usually 2.4 months and it's 1.6 months right now. So, when can that be addressed? And is it possible that it doesn't get addressed to the next year. So, overall, just how do you conceptually think about the cycle extending into next year? Thank you.
Kurt Sievers: Yes, that's a great question. Let me answer to both elements, Vivek. Let me take the latter one, the difficult one first. So, yes, we indeed stayed at the record low 1.6 months in the first quarter just like we did in Q4. And yes, I mean, if you would just do some chainsaw math, this -- just bringing that back to a more normal level of 2.4 months, which we've historically had, is probably like $400 million. But no, I don't anticipate this -- that we reached that level anytime this year. I just think the sell-through is so strong that we don't get it up from a supply perspective back to that level. And that also gives you an indication for the very strong pull here, which is really a -- which is sell-through. I mean, if we ship more into distribution now, inventory wouldn't go up, but it would be actually selling through right away. On the automotive side, yes, that's -- I think this is indeed a significant discussion, but also exploration, which we are having across the industry. First of all, I'd say most of our products, if not all in automotive, are non-commodity product. So, it is indeed a matter of fact that demand, it just doesn't go away. I mean, if anything, then it's shifted because possibly a car here or there cannot be built and with that, it moves then into the next quarter or eventually into next year, as you say. At the same time, we are working very, very diligently, both with our customers, which is the Tier 1s, but also directly with the car companies on very prudently understanding the future demand patterns. I think one of the biggest learnings out of this current situation is to build much more transparency about the content increases, which are often application and module-specific, and how they map out over not just the next two quarters, which is far too short for us, knowing that we have a manufacturing cycle time of one to two quarters, but actually more over the next eight to 16 quarters in order to understand how that's going to map out. So, that work is underway and I can certainly say we do this with all of the top 10 car OEMs in the world. At the same time, we also work, of course, very hard with our suppliers, with our mainly wafer suppliers, but also back-end extensions, as Peter has mentioned, in order to quickly ramp up our supply capability at the same time. And I mean part of this is the reason why I said earlier that already, in the second half of this year, we will ship at higher revenue levels than we are doing in the first half. So, some of that demand obviously, it doesn't have to move into next year, but we are satisfying it already in the second half of this year. But yes, it's a long term -- it's really a long-term story. A lot of learning out of this situation. But at the bottom of it and I think that's most important, a more and more diligent understanding of a very robust demand environment.
Vivek Arya: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Stacy Rasgon. Please go ahead.
Stacy Rasgon: Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So, my first question, I wanted to ask you about the channel inventory situation only to deal in. I know you said that you're confident that nothing you're shipping across your core margins auto, but also industrial and mobile, you think nothing is going on the shelf, everything is going into an end product, especially in industrial and mobile, how do you know that it's not going on the shelf and going into an end product instead? What gives you that level of confidence? I think in auto, I kind of get it, but in industrial and mobile, how would you know that your customers are not sticking the stuff on the shelf?
Kurt Sievers: It's really the direct customer exposure, which we have there. You would probably say, yes, but how can you have that through distribution? I mean, in mobile, you know that the number of mobile end customers isn't that big. So I mean, there is a very direct and very specific contact. So we exactly know how much they need our product because they would love to have more, I can tell you.  I mean, this is a direct chain. In the industrial space, it is arguably a much larger customer base, which is behind distribution. But also there, there are some big customers who are in very direct and very frequent contact also with me personally, and I know about their demand and build situation. So it's really based on a very personal exposure, I would almost say, what gives me and the team, it's not just about me, but all of our leaders here in NXP, that direct exposure to know that the product is directly fleshing through.
Stacy Rasgon: Got it. So my follow-up, I wanted to drill into a little bit your comment on I guess, the auto trajectory. You said it's up like 20% in the first half of '21 versus the first half of '19, even with units down -- with end units down. Can you give us some view for how much of that 20% increase is actually content versus just an increase like like-for-like in terms of units?
Kurt Sievers: That's actually hard to say. What I was saying is indeed that we will have at least 20%. If you look at the guidance in the Q1 results, you will find it's at least 20% growth over the first half of '19. But if you think about the content, be sure to include that this is 2 years of content increase. I mean, last year, clearly, the car production was very much down, but that doesn't mean that the content was coming to a stop because the content was driven by models which were to be introduced anyway, maybe at lower build rates. So if you compare the '19 to '21, it is 2 years stack of up from a content increase perspective. And I'd say, a 10% content increase per year is maybe realistic before price adjustments and that gives you already a 20% -- a 20% difference over those 2 years.
Stacy Rasgon: Got it. So I guess it's fair to say like like-for-like, like you don't think it's a good burning. So it sounds like it's mostly coming from content, is that the right way to characterize it?
Kurt Sievers: I would certainly say that because the car production itself is down by 10%, if I believe IHS and if you look at the Q1 numbers, then the build rates in the first half of this year are probably almost 10% lower than they were in the first half of 2019. So it must be content and share gains.
Stacy Rasgon: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of John Pitzer. Please go ahead. 
John Pitzer: Yes. Good morning guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Congratulations on the strong result. Kurt, my first set of questions is just around kind of get a little bit more detail around the Austin shutdown and reopening. You talked last quarter about it being about a $100 million impact to Q2. Is that exactly what you saw? And I'd be more curious, at the time it happened, it was hard to figure out if there were incremental costs that bled into the model because of Austin. Were there any? And do you expect to recoup them vis-a-vis business insurance as the year unfolds?
Kurt Sievers: Yes. So let me speak about – let me take the revenue side first, John. So first of all, I really have to say clearly, that was an extremely unfortunate and unexpected event, both for NXP, of course, in the first place, but in consequence also for our customers because the supply interruption as a consequence of this, in that current environment is clearly not something anybody would have wished to have. Now to frame it, all of this did happen on February 15, so mid of February. I think we released our press release on March 11, that we had resumed initial operations. And I can tell you that about eight to nine weeks after the fact or after Feb. 15, we have been fully up and running in both facilities again. So by now, both factories are 100% running again at the pre-storm – pre-winter storm levels, which is great moves and the great achievements in a very, very challenging and difficult situation. Yes, we had talked about $100 million impact on the revenues in Q2. I would still say, John, we – this is the impact which we have on Q2. Now you see that we guided sequentially flat. So obviously, we found other ways and means in other areas, with other products, to make up for that loss from the factory shutdown. Furthermore, we had a tiny little bit of impact already at the very end of the first quarter in automotive. I said this earlier, that a little bit, it's really more like maybe in the $10 million range was already impacting the very end of Q1 from a shipment perspective in automotive. I would further say that we are absolutely confident that the $100 million will be made up in the second half of the year. So again, why we made it up in the second – why we will make it up in the second quarter with other products, we will make up those $100 million which we lost in the first phase in the second half of the year because the factories are running again and we'll be shipping full out. Now Peter, maybe you pick up the part of the question, which was related to the cost impact.
Peter Kelly: Yes. So the good news, John, is our ops team had started closing down the factories before the Texas authorities just with almost no notice of the power. So we didn’t have any fundamental damage to the factory. So obviously, various water pipes and that kind of thing with the cold. We have insurance to essentially cover everything. So the only real impact to our cost was the deductible, which is millions of dollars rather than tens of millions of dollars. So from a cost perspective, it hasn't really have any measurable impact.
John Pitzer: That's really helpful. And then, Kurt, as my follow-up, I really like the way that you've kind of compared first half of this year to first half of 2019 because it helps to kind of take out some of the variability around sort of the 'cycle'. And especially for us that are trying to figure out how much of your growth is coming from cycle versus product-specific. It's a good comp. But I guess to that point, when I look at sort of your long-term growth rate target that you have out there of 5% to 7%, that 2019 to 2021 compare would sort of argue a 12% growth rate trend line, at least over that two-year period. And I don't want to steal thunder from your next Analyst Day. But when you look at the breadth of company-specific drivers out there, how do you think about that 5% to 7% growth rate historically or in the target model versus the 12% you've seen since 2019?
Kurt Sievers: Well, John, as you rightfully said, I mean, we're going to update that model with our next Capital Markets Day. So, at this point, we cannot and will not give a new long-term guidance. And the only one which we have out is the 5% to 7%. However, I clearly said earlier that some of the content drivers are in good shape, certainly in automotive, with the stronger rate of electric vehicles with some of the trends which we have in mobile. We spoke a lot about ultra-wideband kicking in earlier. Things seem to look robust. But let's also not forget, John, that if you think about 2018, 2019, 2020, all three years were really not great years from a market perspective. So, it's always a bit tempting to take just two years, which looked in very good. So, we will have to look at this from a more longer term perspective again. But clearly, I do agree with you what matters for NXP should be increasingly the company-specific drivers from those focus areas where our really strong portfolio, which we've been building over years with organically and inorganically, which is now playing out very nicely.
John Pitzer: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of William Stein.
William Stein: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. First, Kurt or Peter, I wonder if there's a product area or end market in which your ability to deliver lags greatest versus demand. It sounds like it's in the channel. I assume that's IoT and industrial and certainly automotive as well. Is it concentrated in those two? Is it specific products or sub-end markets within those or is it more broad? Any color there would be helpful. And then, I do have a follow-up.
Kurt Sievers: Yes, Will, I would actually say it's quite broad. So, because it is in technology or capacity buckets, which also, in some cases, touch several markets. So, no, we couldn't say it's specific to automotive or specific to distribution end markets. I would just say that certainly, automotive is for maybe good reasons, catching a lot of headlines given the big impact it has on -- from a value leverage to complete cars, which might be impacted. But I said earlier that in large industrial applications, there is also shortages across the industry. So, no, it is not something which is sharply only in automotive or only in distribution markets.
William Stein: Thanks for that. And maybe I'd like to hit on the capacity additions. So, second half revenue greater than first half. Part of that is going to be, I suppose, from the recovery of the $100 million shortfall in Q2 from the Austin fabs. But I assume there are other plans. I wonder if that's sort of incremental yields across the board or if there's anything more sort of step function from a capacity perspective that we should sensitize ourselves to coming online later this year?
Kurt Sievers: Yes. Will, it's really 3 elements. The first one you mentioned, of course, we have the $100 million catch-up from the factory closures, which we had also front-end and back-end capacity. On the front-end side, our foundry partners and I mean, they've been quite loud about this publicly, that they are increasing either allocations for fundamental capacity and yields, which also benefits NXP. So we are seeing increases here from a foundry supply perspective to NXP. And at the same time also within NXP, and Peter talked about the 7% CapEx this year on increased revenue levels, we are expanding our back-end capacity as hard as we can. I mean, whatever we can do in the short time is being done. And these moves, so the $100 million from the closed factories, the better wafer supply from external foundries and the higher throughput through our own back-end and assembly is all helping to increase the Q3 and Q4 revenue levels.
William Stein: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Blayne Curtis. Your line is now open.
Blayne Curtis: Hey thanks for taking my question. Kurt, just two questions. The $100 million, just to John's question, if the initial impact in March was in auto, is that where you primarily saw that $100 million you missed within the auto channel? And then, just in terms of that supply chain, you talked about catching up on your supply would take throughout the year and it sounds like your own inventory is probably well in the next year. Just some comments on the auto OEMs, when do you think that market will catch up?
Kurt Sievers: Yes. So first on the $100 million, Blayne. So we will not decompose it here. The auto impact was earliest because the supply chain was just totally dry already before – while it happened. I mean, that's more a timing reasoning why that hit auto first. There is one other area, which is also being hit by this which is the -- our comms infra business. And that's also the reason why our, and you saw this in the guidance, our Q2 then becomes infra growth is sequentially down. That is just the direct impact from their dependence on these Austin factories. So that's a temporary thing, which we'll leave behind us after Q2. Talking about the auto OEMs, I really can't answer that question, Blayne, because we still don't have that long-term transparency I talked about earlier on the demand side. I can absolutely tell you that the supply is increasing. It does increase already in the second quarter, but it also increases further in the third and fourth quarter. But it's always a function of what does the demand do at the same time. So I would carefully say, I don't think it is completely easing off this year. And it will still continue somewhat into next year. How long? I don't know. But I don't see this being totally eased off by the end of this year.
Blayne Curtis: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Chris Caso. Please go ahead.
Chris Caso: Yes, thank you. Good morning. I guess, the first question is it is getting a little more clarity on the capacity additions. And it sounds like certainly, there's some capacity coming on, both internally at the foundries in the second half of this year. Does more come on in the beginning of next year as well? And a follow-on to that, you talked about the fact that you didn't think that you would be able – your customers would be able to replenish inventory until the end of the year. Is that meant to say that by the end of the year, you think you will be fully meeting your customer demand with the capacity additions in place, perhaps a little more capacity comes next year, which allows you to catch up on inventories. Is that the right way to think about it?
Kurt Sievers: Yes, Chris. So this is – I mean, this is constantly on the work – on the very hard work. So since this whole situation started, say, towards the end of last year, we are working super hard on all levels to increase capacity, and I just mentioned a few of them earlier. So yes, it is going to continue into next year from a capacity increase perspective. Absolutely. Peter talked about the 7% CapEx, I just give you one other number. We – by now, we have already more than $1 billion of firm commitments with long-term supply from our suppliers. So as I said, we are collecting and getting request for non-cancelable and non-returnable orders, long-term orders from our customers, and we enter into the same commitments in order to secure supply for next year with our suppliers. And there is already more than $1 billion out there, is firmly committed. And that is going to help indeed increase supplies into and over next year. But it doesn't stop there, Chris. I mean, this is not – it's not like a onetime thing. It's constant work and we keep moving it up. With that, I think from a timing perspective, Jeff, we probably have to get to the end of this session, right?
Jeff Palmer: Correct. Correct. That was my last question. Would you like to provide some closing remarks, Kurt?
Kurt Sievers: Yes. Thanks much, Jeff. So thank you all for being on the call today. So I trust we could paint a clear perspective on how we see this very continued and very rapid rebound in demand across all of our end markets. We are glad that we brought our Austin factories back online and are now with full capacity again, shipping. We wanted to make sure you hear us loud and clear that half two revenue is going to be above half one. And this is not just a factor of the $100 million catch-up from the closed factories. Actually, that's the smallest part in this. And we are very confident that we can continue to drive consistent growth with improved profitability levels and with that, enhance our free cash flow going forward. I thank you very much for your attention and speak to you next time. Thank you.
Jeff Palmer: Thank you, everybody, for your interest, and that will be the end of the call today.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-02-02 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q4 2020 NXP Semiconductors Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jeff Palmer. Please go ahead, sir.
Jeff Palmer: Great. Thank you, Tiffany. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the NXP Semiconductors' fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. With me on the call today is Kurt Sievers, NXP's President and CEO; and Peter Kelly, our CFO. As Tiffany said, the call is being recorded today and will be available for replay from our corporate website. Today's call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause NXP's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, the macroeconomic impact on the specific end markets in which we operate, the sale of new and existing products and our expectations for the financial results for the first quarter of 2021. Please be reminded that NXP undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements. For a full disclosure on forward-looking statements, please refer to our press release. Additionally, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures today which are driven primarily by discrete events that management does not consider to be directly related to NXP's underlying core operating performance. Pursuant to Regulation G, NXP has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our fourth quarter 2020 earnings press release, which will be furnished to the SEC on Form 8-K and is available on NXP's website in the Investor Relations section at nxp.com. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Kurt.
Kurt Sievers: Yes. Thanks very much, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. We really appreciate you all joining the call this morning. Today, I will review our Q4 and our full-year 2020 performance. I will provide insights on how we view the current supply-demand environment, and I will certainly discuss our guidance for quarter one. Now, let me begin with quarter four. Our results were near the high end of our guidance with the contribution from the Automotive and Mobile markets both meaningfully stronger than planned, and with trends in the Industrial & IoT and communication infrastructure markets in line with our expectations. Taken together, NXP delivered quarter four revenue of $2.5 billion, an increase of 9% year-over-year and $57 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. Our non-GAAP operating margin in quarter four was a strong 30.5%, that is 60 basis points better than the year ago period, and about 80 basis points above the midpoint of our guidance. Our outperformance was thanks to good fall through on strength revenue growth, thanks to early benefits of our improved factory utilization and solid operating expense control. For the full year, revenue was $8.6 billion, a decline of 3% year-over-year. And as 2020 progressed and the initial impacts from the pandemic earlier in the year subsided, our customers began to accelerate orders at a very robust rate which we do anticipate will continue throughout 2021. Our full year non-GAAP operating margin was 25.9%, a 310 basis points decline because of lower revenue reduced factory loadings combined with slightly reduced operating expenses. It is important to note though that throughout the year, we shifted more of our OpEx spend from SG&A towards R&D as we do continue to invest in new and differentiated products, which are definitely in the lifeblood of our long-term growth ambitions. Now, let me turn to the specific trends in our focused end markets. Starting with Automotive. Full year revenue was $3.83 billion, down 9% year-on-year, materially better than overall auto production and the reflection of strong new product traction and content gains in ADAS in digital clusters and in electrification which we have always spoken about in the past. For quarter four, Automotive revenue was $1.2 billion, up 9% versus the year ago period and $20 million better than our guidance. Now, moving to Industrial & IoT. Full year revenue was $1.84 billion, 15% year-on-year up with both the wireless connectivity and our crossover processors supporting the growth. For quarter four, Industrial & IoT revenue was $511 million, 23% versus the year ago period, and with that, in line with our guidance. Now, moving to Mobile. Our full year revenue in Mobile was $1.25 billion, up 5% year-on-year. If we are reconciling this for the sale of our voice and audio business during quarter one last year, the underlying Mobile end market growth was up a robust 19% year-on-year. And during the year, we experienced continued strong adoption of our secure mobile wallet and the early ramps of our ultra wideband solutions, offset by the anticipated discontinuation of some parts of our semi-custom mobile analog interface business. We do estimate the full year attach rate of mobile wallets increased to about 40%, which is in line with our expectations and which is also supportive of our 50% attach rate target exiting 2021. For quarter four, Mobile revenue was $409 million, up 23% versus the year ago period, and with that $40 million better than our guidance. And last but not least, Communication Infrastructure & Other. Full-year revenue was $1.7 billion, down 9% year-over-year. The year-on-year decline was due to reduced sales of RF power products into the cellular base station market relative to the positive trends which we had experienced in the first half of 2019. For quarter four, revenue was $394 billion, down 14% year-on-year and in line with our guidance. Now, before turning to our guidance and expectations for the first quarter, I would like to offer my view on the current demand and supply environment as it pertains to NXP. When our customers began to reopen after the shutdowns in the second quarter, we did see order rates through Q3 and Q4 accelerate at a very rapid rate. This trend has continued and it will likely be the case over several quarters to come. The increased demand has been broad-based across most of our focused end markets, most of our product portfolio and all of our geographies, as well as across our direct and our distribution fulfillment channels. We actually believe that the working from home trends because of the pandemic, which emerged in full force beginning in the first half of the year led to an explosion in demand for high volume consumer compute and mobile type products in the industry. And then, as the auto and industrial markets begin to rebound in the second half of the year, the available foundry capacity was largely sold out. As a result, we and others are experiencing significant increases in lead times, and in certain cases, increased cost from suppliers. Taken that altogether, the setup indicates a really robust demand environment combined with a very challenging supply situation, which we anticipate may continue for several more quarters, and we are working very diligently with both our external suppliers, our internal operations team and our customers to adequately aligned supply with demand. Against this backdrop, now let me come to the quarter one guidance. We are guiding quarter one revenue at $2.55 billion, up about 26% versus the first quarter of 2020 within the range of up 22% to up 30% year-over-year. From a sequential basis, this represents growth of about 2% at the midpoint versus the prior quarter. At the midpoint, we anticipate the following trends in our business. First, Automotive is expected to be up in the mid-20% range versus quarter one 2020, and up in the mid-single digits versus quarter four 2020. Industrial & IoT is expected to be up nearly 50% year-over-year and up high single digits versus quarter four 2020. Mobile is expected to be up 40% year-over-year and down in the mid-teens versus quarter four '20. And finally Communication Infrastructure & Other is expected to be flat versus the same period a year ago and up in the low single digit range on a sequential basis. Now, while we are really encouraged by the rapid rebound in demand, it is important to remember, we are still challenged by the impact of the global pandemic, and we will carefully navigate the improving demand environment focused on meeting our customers' requirements while simultaneously assuring at all times the safety and health of all of our employees, and I am extremely proud of their adaptability, their dedication and their hard work in the face of continued adversity. So in summary, customer engagement levels, our design win momentum and our strategic focus areas continue to be all very positive, and hence we continue to be very optimistic about the future potential of NXP. And with that, I would like to pass the call to you, Peter, for a review of our financial performance.
Peter Kelly: Thank you, Kurt. Good morning to everyone on today's call. As Kurt has already covered the drivers of the revenue during the fourth quarter and provided our revenue outlook for Q1, I'll move on to the financial highlights. Overall, our fourth quarter financial performance was very good. Revenue was near the high end of our guidance range with an improvement of both non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP operating profit. I'll first provide full year highlights and then move on to the fourth quarter results. Full year revenue for 2020 was $8.61 billion, down 3% year-on-year. We generated $4.4 billion in non-GAAP gross profit and reported a non-GAAP gross profit margin of 51.1%, down 240 basis points year-on-year because of the significant deceleration of revenue and the associated lower factory utilization during the year. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $2.17 billion dollars, down $8 million year-on-year. Total non-GAAP operating profit was $2.23 billion and non-GAAP operating margin was 25.9%, down 310 basis points year-on-year. Non-GAAP interest expense was $357 million, cash taxes for ongoing operations were $103 million, and incidental taxes were $45 million with non-controlling interests of $28 million. Stock-based compensation, which is not included in our non-GAAP earnings was $384 million. Full year cash flow highlights include $2.48 billion in cash flow from operations and $388 million in net CapEx investments resulting in $2.09 billion of non-GAAP free cash flow, or a very healthy 24% of revenue. During 2020, we repurchased $627 million of shares and paid cash dividends of $420 million. In total, we returned $1.05 billion to our owners, which was 50% of the total non-GAAP free cash flow generated during the year. Now, moving to the details of the fourth quarter. Total revenue was $2.51 billion, up 9% year-on-year at the high end of our guidance range. We generated $1.3 billion in non-GAAP gross profit and reported a non-GAAP gross margin of 52.9%, down 130 basis points year-on-year, modestly above the midpoint of guidance. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $563 million flat year-on-year and up $13 million from Q3 in line with the midpoint of our guidance. From a total operating profit perspective, non-GAAP operating profit was $764 million and non-GAAP operating margin was 30.5%, up 60 basis points year-on-year and well above the high end of our guidance. Non-GAAP interest expense was $90 million, cash taxes for ongoing operations were $30 million and non-controlling interest was $11 million. Stock-based compensation, which is not included in our non-GAAP earnings was $89 million. So turning to the changes in our cash and debt. Our total debt at the end of Q4 was $7.61 billion, down $1.75 billion sequentially, as we retired early the 2021 $1.35 billion, 4.125%, and the 2022 $400 million, 4.625% notes. We did this on September the 28th, which is the first day of our fourth quarter. Our ending cash position was $2.28 billion and was down $1.29 billion sequentially, mainly due to the previously noted debt repayments, offset by cash generation during the fourth quarter. The resulting net debt was $5.3 billion -- $5.33 billion, and we exited the quarter with a trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA of $2.79 billion. Our ratio of net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of Q4 was 1.9 times and our 12-month adjusted EBITDA interest coverage was 8 times. Our liquidity is excellent and our balance sheet continues to be very strong. During the fourth quarter, we paid $105 million in cash dividends and repurchased $257 million of our shares. Turning to working capital metrics, days of inventory was 78 days, a decrease of six days sequentially significantly below our long-term target. We continue to closely manage our distribution channel with inventory in the channel at 1.6 months also below our long-term targets. Both metrics reflect customer orders accelerating faster than we've anticipated and we find ourselves in a supply constrained position. It will take a number of quarters to rebuild on-hand inventory and channel inventories to our long-term target levels. Days receivables with 28 days, down two sequentially, and days payable was 75, an increase of 20 days versus the prior quarter as we rapidly increased material orders with our suppliers. Taken together, our cash conversion cycle was 31 days, an improvement of 28 days versus the prior quarter, reflecting strong customer demand, solid receivables collections and positioning for customer deliveries in future periods. Cash flow from operations was $1.03 billion in the quarter and net CapEx was $103 million, resulting in a non-GAAP free cash flow of $926 million. Turning to our expectations for the first quarter, as Kurt mentioned, we anticipate Q1 revenue to be about $2.55 billion plus or minus about $75 million. At the midpoint, this is up 26% year-on-year and 2% sequentially. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be about 53.5% plus or minus 30 basis points. Operating expenses are expected to be about $590 million plus or minus about $10 million. Taken together, we see non-GAAP operating margin to be about 30.4% at the midpoint. We estimate non-GAAP financial expense to be about $85 million and anticipated cash tax related to on-going operations to be about $56 million. Non-controlling interest will be about $10 million, and for the first quarter we suggest that for modeling purposes we use an average share count of $284 million shares. Finally, I have a few closing comments I'd like to make. One, clearly demand has come back more rapidly than we could have expected. Our current focus is to look after our customers and ensure we ship as much products to them as possible. It's unfortunate that some of our suppliers are attempting to use the current tight supply environment as a short-term opportunity to raise prices, which we will clearly have to pass on. To be clear though, we do not see this as an opportunity to improve our margin by sacrificing long-term relationships. Additionally, given the tightness in supply and the level of orders, we anticipate shipping for production during Q1. It's unlikely we'll be able to increase our months of supply at distributors or move our DIO target upward towards our long-term targets during the first quarter. Between January the 4th and February the 1st, we bought back an additional $354 million worth of stock, and plan to continue to buy back in line with our capital allocation policy of returning all excess cash to shareholders. Clearly, our operating margin reflects the significant fall through benefit of the additional revenue. Although the current environment creates a new set of challenges, we believe we can still deliver on our margin improvement plan in 2021. In terms of the pandemic, our team continues to perform in a truly outstanding way. And the safety of our team members, as Kurt mentioned, continues to be our primary concern. If anyone experiences any symptoms or in any way exposed to the virus, we ask them to self-isolate for a period. Unfortunately in Q4, we've seen a few more people unexpected in our fab operations requiring to self-isolate, and as a result of the shortage of labor, a small impact in our internal fab output. Although this causes a short-term issue, it's clearly best for our overall performance in both the short and medium-term. We estimate this is impacting us to the tune of 80 basis points of profit in Q1 and 40 basis -- and will impact us 40 basis points in Q2. While this is a short-term headwind, the safety of our employees remains our key consideration and we believe our COVID protocols are appropriate and correct. Finally, I'd like to thank all my colleagues at NXP for a truly amazing 2020. You've done an incredible job in a truly unbelievable environment and set us up for a very bright future. So with that, I'll turn it back to the operator for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore.
C.J. Muse: Yes, good morning, good afternoon, and thank you for taking the question. I guess, first question, on gross margins, Peter, you talked about the 55% still clearly in play. Curious if you can speak to how utilization will play a role in that, how mix assuming comps recovers through the year? And then, I guess, probably most importantly, how to think about rising input costs and your ability to pass on and whether there is a timing difference there?
Peter Kelly: So, great questions. Let's talk about Q4 to Q1, first of all. So, Q1, we go from 52.9% to 53.5%. I think, I said last quarter that utilization -- on the utilization rather would impact us about 150 basis points in Q4. So we'd have that level of benefit in Q1. As it turns out, because of these, the need to self-isolate, and instead of again a 150 basis points of improvement from Q4 into Q1, we've only got about 70 basis points. So that 52.9% to 53.5%, the 60 basis points is really made up of three big things C.J. So we pick up 70 basis points from improved factory performance, 20 basis -- sorry from the utilization, 20 basis points from improved factory performance above and beyond what we were expecting, and at about 30 basis points of headwind because of our annual price reductions. So that's from Q4 to Q1. Then if you say, okay, well in Q4, you did 53.5% why aren't you running -- sorry, from 52.9% to 53.5%, why aren't you running 55%. That 150 basis points is really made up from two things. There's about -- in period there is about 50 basis points of underutilization very roughly and about 100 basis points of mix. And the issue in mix really is one of our comm infra business. So our comm infra business in the first half is relatively weak. And auto and mobile are relatively strong. And then we think as we move through the year that -- and as kind of 5G progresses, we'd see an improvement in -- we'd see an improvement in our mix over time. Did I -- and right your other question was about pricing, right. So pricing is really mixed, okay. So we're seeing some suppliers trying to put up the prices to us. But we'd -- in the same way that we have long-term contracts with our customers, we have similar contracts with many of our suppliers. So it's a bit of a mixed bag really. Having said that, we however seen price increases. And where we have them, we will endeavor to pass those on to our customers. You made an interesting comment actually about how quickly you can do it. So I think what we will actually see is hopefully we'll be able to pass them on pretty quickly, but you could always have a month or two when -- or I guess even a quarter when you can't really pass them on that quickly. So, it's the disturbance rather than a fundamental issue. We would like to say that we don't see the current environment as an opportunity to structurally improve our margins. We are now a commodity business. We don't increase our prices when times are tight and reduce them when times are good, but did I manage to cover everything there? I know there was [indiscernible].
C.J. Muse: Yes, Peter. Yes. No, that was great. And I guess, Kurt, if I could just follow up with a quick question, considering the supply constraints on the auto side and considering your and NXP's focus are really providing complete solutions, curious about what impact kind of the current supply constrained environment is having on your level of engagement with your automotive customers?
Kurt Sievers: Yes. Hi, C.J. So I think actually and that might sound ironic, but that's not what I mean. It actually improves the engagement because I have probably never spend so much time with our customers as of today. And while certainly this is a challenging moment for everybody in the chain, there is a lot we speak about the future in terms of how do we best deal with this on a go forward basis because everybody recognizes the enormous relevance of semiconductors in building cars. So thinking about trends, thinking about aligning forecasts on a more mature basis is definitely a positive result out of this. So, I don't think this is a negative. I think, it is actually something we as an industry altogether are learning from how to avoid these things from happening in the future. And the way to do this is just a much closer collaboration than we've had along the chain. And what I mean is really not only with our Tier 1 customers, but also with the OEMs directly. And that is obviously great for innovation at the same time.
C.J. Muse: Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.
Stacy Rasgon: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So my first question, I wanted to ask about the trajectory for the year. I mean, like normally Q1 is the trough of the year, usually down, well, I don't know, 7% or 8% sequentially from Q4 to Q1, you're obviously up a little bit this time. Given your commentary on sort of like sustained demand through the year, do you still see Q1 potentially is the trough?
Kurt Sievers: Hi, Stacey. First of all, you are hinting to seasonality in a way. I think in the current environment, none of the historic seasonality patterns is really applicable. So certainly this is a very strong Q1, if you did hold it against historic patterns, but let's not forget that we are coming off actually two kind of disturbed and weak years. I mean everybody talks about the impact of the pandemic on 2020, but also 2019 was not a strong year in semiconductors. So from that perspective, I think we are just really coming out of a longer-term down, which indeed hints to what I said on the -- in the prepared remarks earlier, we do see a pretty robust demand environment all through the year also beyond Q1.
Stacy Rasgon: Got it. Thank you. So my follow-up, I want to follow up a little bit on the comment that Peter said. He said, that you still feel confident delivering on your margin improvement plan in 2021. I just wanted to clarify exactly what is that margin improvement plan? Is that the 55% gross margin target or like specifically what do you mean by delivering on margin -- on your margin improvement plan in 2021?
Peter Kelly: 55%.
Stacy Rasgon: Okay. Are there any like -- is that -- it's still at that $2.4 billion sort of threshold revenue level or do you just basically see yourself maintaining it?
Peter Kelly: I think the levels of business we are at the moment, we should be running at about 55%. I mean we think it will get a little bit carried away, because it's not many dollars that moves that 50 basis points either way.
Stacy Rasgon: Yes, I get that. Do you have any idea when in the year you might hit it tough, is that like a second half kind of target or...
Peter Kelly: I think it's definitely second half, Stacy. And one of the single biggest items is our comm infra being a bigger percentage of our overall business than it is today, yes.
Stacy Rasgon: Okay, got it. But without the COVID impact, you would be running over 54% right now in this -- in Q1, correct?
Peter Kelly: Yes, yes. I think so, yes.
Stacy Rasgon: Got it. Okay. Thank you, guys. Appreciate it.
Peter Kelly: Yes. It would be like 54.2% or something like that.
Stacy Rasgon: Yes. Got it, got it. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities.
Vivek Arya: Thank you for taking my question and congratulations on the strong growth and execution. Kurt, I'm curious, what's your baseline view of Automotive unit growth in 2021 as you see that at the start of the year? And also last year, when I look at your auto semiconductor sales, which were down 9, they were like 5, 6, 7 points ahead of auto units. So that's -- that was very impressive content delta. And how should we think about that similar content delta for this year? And I asked those questions, because it seems like the industry is off to a very strong start, but can this kind of strength be maintained? Which is why just some -- just kind of help less align on models on what unit and content market expectation should be this year?
Kurt Sievers: Yes. Sure, Vivek. So, let me start with what IHS is telling us. For this year in units for auto and that would be around 85 million units, which if that comes it's like 14% year-on-year growth in units. This is the IHS number. We've always used that internally. I would tell you from my very, very frequent discussions over the past couple of weeks and also at the ending of last year, I think the sentiment in the auto industry is possibly even above that. So maybe more 85 million to 90 million units in what the car companies thinks to achieve. But a lot of that is obviously based on the assumption of, say, the second half of the year being fully vaccinated, society coming back to more normal lives and that actually being another push for auto production and auto sales. Again, the former number of 85 million units, which would be a 14% growth. But you were hinting to the other half of this discussion, which is actually content, because clearly the fact that we've been 7 points faster than the SAR last year is thanks to content growth and thanks to our specific play in our high growth areas like radar and electrification BMS, digital clusters, which actually did not decline. So our growth businesses, and you know that's about a quarter of our auto business. Those parts of our auto business did not decline last year. They actually had growth even in a year where the SAR was, I think, last year down by something like 16%. And we see the content growth certainly going at the same rate going forward. One really strong element is the CO2 targets, which translates then often in electrification. But this is not just about the -- say the electric engines, there is a lot of other applications, which are coming in tune with electrification, which is overall driving the semi content in the car massively. So, all in all, I would say, I think it is safe to assume the 85 million units for this year, which is a 14% growth for SAR. And definitely our algorithm of outgrowing the SAR as we spoke about it before does stand strong also in this year. Now, one last element on this, which everybody tries to understand currently is about the inventory levels. I think at the moment from anything we can see, the supply chains through the auto world are empty. And I say that because I know that every single product we are shipping is immediately built into a car, so that there is just nothing going on a sideline, it all goes through into production immediately. That's why we also clearly said we are supply constrained for the first quarter. And as a reaction to this, I hear quite a few people in the industry speaking about the desire to actually ask for more inventory along the chain in automotive going forward. There is one large U.S. OEM which actually made even a public statement about how much chip inventory they would like to see at their first-tier customers. So if you model this on top of the content gains and SAR growth, which we just spoke about, then I think there is a good reason to believe there is a multiple quarter growth pattern ahead of us.
Vivek Arya: Got it. Very helpful. And for my follow-up, maybe Peter one for you, you mentioned that the plan is to return all excess free cash flow to investors. Last year you generated over 2 billion or so in free cash flow. And I think the dividend only takes quarter of that. How should we think about buybacks this year. I know you gave a number for the start of the year. Should we assume that based on the expectation of stronger free cash flow that most of it will be devoted to buyback, so we could be back in some of the strength we have seen in some prior years or do you still expect to use some of that to delever the balance sheet further? Thank you.
Peter Kelly: Okay. Vivek, we've been amazingly predictable. Okay. So our stated capital allocation policy is we will return all excess cash to shareholders up to a level of 2 times net debt to trailing 12 months EBITDA. The reason we didn't return even more in 2020 is because for most of the year we were above 2 times net debt to EBITDA with the weak performance in Q2. So depending on what your model is, you should assume that all excess cash up to a level of 2 times net debt that's [ph] returned to shareholders. So, yes, it will be substantially higher in 2021 than it was in 2020. Same way 2019 was substantially higher than 2020, and we definitely would not use it to delever the balance sheet.
Vivek Arya: Got it. And you're already at 1.9. So you are below that range right now?
Peter Kelly: The difference between 1.9 and 2 is not a big number.
Vivek Arya: Understand.
Peter Kelly: But the issue is the EBITDA. So you need to look at how Q2 and Q1 fall off, and Q3 and Q4, which is better come on, which gives us more capacity to buyback stock.
Vivek Arya: Understand. Thanks very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer: Yes. Good morning, Kurt; good morning, Peter. Congratulations on the solid results. Kurt, my first question is on the comms infrastructure business, given how important it is to mix in gross margin leverage as we go throughout the year, what's the visibility in that business? Why do you think it recovers in the back half of the year? Is this a view that the U.S. government's stance on Huawei changes or do you see other design wins with other OEMs that will drive that business throughout the year?
Kurt Sievers: Thanks, John. Let me take away the Huawei thing first of all. We are here conservative and we don't assume any moves on the licensing, et cetera, with Huawei, so that's not part of the plan anyway. What makes us actually optimistic for the second half is mainly our portfolio. I think we talked about our gallium nitride, both product as well as production capability, getting online at the end of last quarter. And I can actually probably say that in the meantime, all the products are qualified, and more importantly, they are qualified at this handful of important customers. And since this is new for us because we haven't had this gallium nitride capability really in the first place, we absolutely see that we will gain share on that basis with the further rollout of the infrastructure in the -- in this coming year. And yes, we believe this is kind of back-loaded more towards the second half of the year versus the first half, but the driver is really the gallium nitride penetration which we are foreseeing.
John Pitzer: That's helpful. Then as my follow-up just in your prepared comments, you pointed out that if you pro forma for the sale of the auto business, the mobile business last year was up significantly, I'm kind of curious as you think about the mobile wallet, the ultra wideband penetration, are you preparing calendar year '21 to be another growth year in mobile? And is there any rule of thumb you can give us on how we should think about your content from 4G to 5G?
Kurt Sievers: Well, I mean we only guide the first quarter here, John. So I will not provide guidance for the full year in mobile. But certainly our focus on further driving penetration with the mobile wallet, where I think I spoke about the -- hitting the 40% attachment rate at the end of last year, and we think we are perfectly on track to get this to a 50% rate through this year. And secondly, we have the emerging ultra wideband, and you've probably followed the most recent announcements of Samsung, who actually brought now another couple of phones out which are carrying ultra wideband, and that is now also spreading into associated ecosystems, which I think makes it even more attractive. I think Samsung spoke about digital car keys for a couple of car companies, and they also spoke about actually their first move now into the IoT world, which is a product which they call the Smart Tag Plus which is like a small finder device, which you can attach to something, and then you will find it with your phone. Now, all of that is going to help with Samsung, but of course also with the other OEMs, drive further and speedy ultra wideband adoption in line with what we did in the Investor Teach-In some time ago. So those two pillars are standing firm, and I'd say, certainly some of the big OEM customers also have good run rates, John, but I would say for us, it continues to be a content growth story. Secure mobile wallet, secure ultra wideband, and then you know, we also had the eUICC which is coming in, so there is a number of very specific content drivers which make us actually quite optimistic in mobile on a continued basis beyond the unit rate.
John Pitzer: And Kurt, do you have enough data yet to think about how your content trends from 4G to 5G? I'm assuming that these new applications are more broadly adopted in 5G firms.
Kurt Sievers: Yes. Sorry, I didn't respond to this in the first place. I think actually in principle this is not dependent or required as an association with 4G or 5G, specifically. Clearly, 5G will be about high-end phones in the first place, where the early adoption of these features might be first. But it is not necessarily something which is dependent on 4G or 5G, so which is good actually. So, we are kind of agnostic to that.
John Pitzer: Perfect. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore: Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. First, Peter, congratulations on your retirement announcement. I know you're going to be with us for another year or so, but congrats nonetheless.
Peter Kelly: Thanks, Ross.
Ross Seymore: I guess, just my first question, overall, everybody knows that there are supply shortages, but I hope to get a little more color on it from a somewhat higher level. Could you size in any way, shape or form the impact on what you couldn't ship, and so what you're revenue impact of the supply constraint was in the fourth quarter, the first quarter. Any color about which end market is more acutely hit as you split your business? And then in the timing wise, when do you think you'll be able to catch up?
Peter Kelly: Kurt, I think you are on mute.
Kurt Sievers: Peter?
Peter Kelly: Okay. Right. I guess, I'd say a couple of things really, Ross. You can look to really big numbers in the fourth quarter and the first quarter, just if you do some change our math [ph] on our months of supply and -- sorry, months of inventory and distribution, but I'm not sure how relevant it is really. So in theory, we could have shipped hundreds of millions of dollars of more, but then I don't know to what extent you be then pulling that out of Q3 and Q4. We're seeing strength across our businesses. Obviously, there's a lot more reporting in the automotive sector, because they are having real supply issues and having to maybe close down factories in certain cases and you talked about people not being able to work for weeks at a time which is maybe different than you see in some of the smaller customers who don't have the same megaphone. But even in those areas, they are seeing problems. So I would say it's pretty general, and I'll go back to one of Kurt's comments, which was 2019, the supply chain really got -- really got empty, demand was very weak. We really forgot about '19 in the context of COVID. And then in the first half of '20, we had absolutely the same issue. So we're looking at pretty empty supply chains across the board. To some extent, it's exacerbated by maybe people moving into the big Taiwanese foundries outside of China buy the -- the fact that people thought maybe they would not be able to buy product out of China. I think trying to pass it to really individual situations is absolutely very difficult. I would say, in theory, we could have shipped a lot more. Effectively, we're sold out for Q1. And we're just spending huge amount of time [indiscernible] customers, making sure that they keep their factories going, which is why Kurt made the comment that we don't think anything we're shipping at the moment is going into inventory. We think it's all going into building products, and we think it's going to be quite some time and we wouldn't speculate exactly when. So when we get to a point that that becomes more balanced and everyone can start to breathe normally.
Ross Seymore: Thanks for that color, Peter. I guess switching gears somewhat completely over to the OpEx side, you gave a lot of details on the gross margin side and the profitability why that's -- where it is and how it can improve. How are you approaching the OpEx side of the equation? Obviously the revenue sounds like it's going to be very strong throughout the year. Will you be spending to that? How should we think about that $590 million level in 1Q trending for the rest of the year?
Peter Kelly: We want to run 16% of R&D and -- 16% of revenue for R&D and 7% for SG&A. In actual fact, the increase in dollars from Q4 to Q1 is essentially -- in fact it's nearly all non-exec variable comp. So it's just incentive. So we're keeping a tight hand on OpEx. We won't spend ahead of revenue really. But we would like to run 16% of R&D and 7% of SG&A. And in the very short-term for Q1, the increases all -- increases in compensation -- in variable comp accruals.
Ross Seymore: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of William Stein of Truist Securities.
William Stein: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I'm wondering if you can discuss the competitive landscape today a little bit, in particular as it relates to pending M&A. You have ADI buying Maxim that consolidates the analog market a little bit. You have Nvidia buying Arm, which is an important supplier of yours. I'm wondering if you can comment as to whether either one of these or any other transaction might have any influence on your competitive positioning and perhaps your own plans from the perspective of consolidation?
Kurt Sievers: Hey, Bill. So I mean, you know, we just don't comment on M&A in these calls. But what is relevant is that as it relates to our strategic focus and our say belief in our power of differentiation, we continue to be super -- really super confident that with the portfolio which we have actually largely achieved, or to a good extent also through M&A achieved, is in a very good position. I mean, let's not forget that these trends in secure edge processing solutions which we have is a result of the free scale acquisition a couple of years back, and then further complemented by the wireless acquisition from Marvell about one year back. We are proud that we've been able to successfully integrate all of this and actually are now in a position to come out with solutions, with products, which are building on the IPs from these different former deals. And from anything I've seen relative to the deals you mentioned, we don't see this as a threat to that competitive decision, which we have. So while I don't want to comment in general on M&A, I would say, it doesn't touch our trust and our confidence with the strategic focus which we have. I continue to believe that full steam execution on what we have is a very, very high value endeavor.
William Stein: Great, appreciate that. And maybe if I can follow up with another question about the supply-demand imbalance, typically when this happens, you have this behavior of over-ordering by some customers that stimulates capacity additions, and sort of there goes the cycle. This behavior is typically what sort of paints the peak of the cycle. I've argued that I think that the lean inventory through the supply chain and really the breadth of demand, what perhaps will make this cycle extend a little bit longer, but I wonder if there's anything else that relates to the insight that you've all shared with us already suggesting that we continue to see this imbalance favoring growth as we go through the year?
Kurt Sievers: Yes. I mean, indeed, well, we've all seen that movie before. I couldn't agree more that there is this element, which is creating a bubble eventually. But I would really highlight, and I said it from very, very hands on practically experience currently, everything we ship goes into production that it isn't piling any inventory at any place. And I can also again emphasize it is broad. I mean, you'll read and see a lot about automotive, as Peter said, because that is very prominent, when it comes to publications. But it is much broader. We have that same surge in demand in our other markets. So that makes me believe that at least at this point in time, this is not about inventory building. Now certainly we will continue to watch this very carefully, because again, we've seen this before, we have our controls, we know what to look after, but now is not the time to be worried about that. So we clearly see this demand continuing for a couple of quarters without building unnecessary inventory. The only -- I wouldn't say exception, but the one thing specific, which I believe could become a growth trend which is then nothing wrong but something to be conscious about is possibly the fact that the auto industry will want to have along the supply chain higher inventory levels than they used to have. Just learning from the current experience and trying to mitigate any future disruptions. That would be then building inventory, but it wouldn't be a bubble, but it would be a very conscious and very say targeted building of inventory. But again from anything we can see with our product, this is -- we are far from this at this point in time, but it could become something which happens maybe later in the year.
William Stein: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays.
Blayne Curtis: Thanks for taking my question. I just want to ask on the Industrial & IoT business, we obviously talked about the auto segment in depth. Obviously in that business, seasonality is typically down. You guided it up. I think have an easy year-over-year compare, but it still seems up pretty robustly. So maybe just talk about the drivers within that segment?
Kurt Sievers: Blayne, did I hear you right? Industrial & IoT? Is that what you asked?
Blayne Curtis: Yes.
Kurt Sievers: Yes. Now, absolutely, I mean we are actually quite proud about our performance in Industrial, since -- even last year, which clearly was a very difficult year for the industry, our industrial business on a full year basis did grow by 15% year-on-year. And as you've seen from the guide, we have the confidence, we continue this. It's really carried by the solution capability made up by the cross-over processors. I mean, it's the whole processing portfolio, but specifically the cross-overs are delivering on the promise coupled with our WiFi capabilities. And you might have seen just in -- in Q4, we launched our first, and what I think is really an industry-leading 2x2 Wi-Fi 6 solution, which is a result of the Marvell acquisition. But getting this altogether into solutions is actually doing what we wanted to see. Now there is one other element with this, which I think is a driver for the growth for NXP particularly in that segment and that is our exposure to China. That's also I think the background for last year's strong performance because China left the pandemic from an industrial performance perspective behind them already in the second quarter. So, if you will, China had three strong quarters last year, and our industrial business has a quite big exposure to China. So we've been benefiting from this and we see this continuing into this year.
Blayne Curtis: Thank you. And maybe as a follow-up to that, could you just talk on the supply side? Is this a segment that you're also being impacted by tightness, and any kind of view on kind of lead times within that segment?
Kurt Sievers: It's across the Board, Blayne. So yes, we are also impacted by the tightness of supply in our Industrial business. I can't really talk about lead times, because it really differ. I mean we have a number of products with very normal lead times, but we also have a couple of products with 52 weeks lead time. So there is not one answer to this question. The only thing I can say is that, yes, Industrial is also impacted by the tightness of supply.
Blayne Curtis: Thank you.
Kurt Sievers: Thank you for the question.
Jeff Palmer: Tiffany, I think that would be our last call, maybe pass it over to Kurt.
Operator: Thank you. And I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Sievers. Please go ahead.
Kurt Sievers: Yes. Thanks very much, operator. Yes, I think, in summary, it is fair to say that if we just for a minute look back to last year, last year has really been a year with two phases; a very grim and very difficult year in the first half, and then a definitely faster than anticipated recovery in the second half. And given all the discussions which we've had about supply and demand, it is fair to say that we believe it's only the start of the recovery. This will continue through the calendar year 2021 and we see that our specific end market focus of NXP with a lot of strength in Automotive, with a lot of very specific strength in the Mobile and in Industrial & IoT gives us actually a very good opportunity to benefit from this continuing recovery into this calendar year. The one segment we've certainly been less happy with is the comms infra segment, as we discussed, but also there, given the new product introductions in gallium nitride, we are optimistic on the second half of the year, which is a strong driver for our mix when you think about our margin targets. And with that, I thank you all for dialing into the call, and most of all, please all stay safe and stay healthy. Thank you very much.
Peter Kelly: Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-10-27 09:56:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the NXP Q3 2020 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jeff Palmer. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir.
Jeff Palmer: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. With me on the call today is Kurt Sievers, NXP's President and CEO; and Peter Kelly, our CFO. The call today is being recorded and will be available for replay from our corporate Web site. Today’s call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause NXP's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, the macroeconomic impact on the specific end markets in which we operate, the sale of new and existing products and our expectations for the financial results for the fourth quarter of 2020. Please be reminded that NXP undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements. For a full disclosure on forward-looking statements, please refer to our press release today. Additionally, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures which are driven primarily by discrete events that management does not consider to be directly related to NXP's underlying core operating performance. Pursuant to Regulation G, NXP has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our third quarter 2020 earnings press release, which will be furnished to the SEC on Form 8-K and is available on NXP's Web site in the Investor Relations section at nxp.com. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Kurt.
Kurt Sievers: Thanks very much, Jeff, and a very good morning and a very good afternoon everyone. We really appreciate you joining our call today.  As most are aware, we did preannounce our quarter three results on October 8 with our revenue growth significantly stronger than the midpoint of our guidance across all of our end markets, but particularly in automotive and mobile. From a channel perspective, we began to see a return to more normal contribution between our direct and distribution sales, especially in the automotive end market. In our auto business, predominantly the U.S. and European car OEMs with Tier 1 suppliers are biased towards direct fulfillment with restart production on a broad basis, resulting in strong sales in the European and American regions as well as continued momentum in China. Only the Japan automotive region appears to be slightly later to rebound, which is primarily fulfilled through our distribution partners. In our mobile business, a combination of new product ramps and market strength anticipated by specific customers ahead of their new platform launches contributed to better than anticipated results. Taken together, NXP delivered total revenue of 2.27 billion, which is 267 million above the midpoint of our original guidance range. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 25.8%, about 360 basis points above the midpoint of our guidance. We experienced good fall-through on the significantly higher revenue with our gross margin also better than guidance. In a minute, Peter will provide more insights into our gross margin in his commentary. We also continued to tightly control operating expenses. So we did increase expenses relative to non-executives incentive compensation. Now, let me turn to the specific trends in our focused end markets. In automotive, revenue was $964 million, down 8% versus the year ago period and showing a 43% sequential increase. This was greater than twice the sequential growth we had contemplated in our guidance. In industrial and IoT, revenue was 514 million, up 21% versus the year ago period and up 18% sequentially, and it was slightly better than our original guidance. In mobile, revenue was 337 million, up 5% versus the year ago period and up 32% sequentially. And I would also note that we did not experience any pull-forwards in mobile because of the shipment ban associated with Huawei. And lastly, communication infrastructure and other, revenue was 452 million, down 4% year-on-year and flat sequentially. This was about 35 million better than our guidance. And of that outperformance relative to our guidance, about half was due to accelerated shipments to Huawei ahead of the ban. Now before we turn to the specifics on our Q4 guidance, I'd like to provide you a quick update on our very recent NXP Connects developer’s conference. In today's completely virtual customer support environments, we were extremely encouraged by the truly high level of customer and partner engagement and participation. We had over 15,000 participants from around the world take part in this first-ever completely virtual event. Now let me discuss a few of the customer-related highlights during that event. First of all, our joint announcement with Samsung mobile underpinning the adoption of our secure ultra wideband and latest enhanced mobile wallet solutions across both the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra and the new Galaxy Fold platforms, marking the first-ever use of ultra wideband in the Android world. While we are in the early days of adoption of ultra wideband, we do expect over the intermediate term to see solid growth also beyond mobile, as the technology permeates into the automotive and IoT markets. Additionally, we continue to drive innovation in our latest mobile wallet solutions with the introduction of eUICC functionality. This allows the mobile wallets to provide similar network provisioning and profile management while simultaneously enabling secure payments and access. Now in the automotive field, we were very, very excited to officially co-announce our battery management efforts with the Volkswagen Group. NXP’s BMS solutions are being adopted across the entire MEB platform of the Volkswagen Group, including the Volkswagen branded ID.3 and ID.4 models and also in the luxury and performance models, Audi e-Tron and Porsche Taycan. Early market acceptance of these cars has been very positive and we are very proud to be a partner in Volkswagen’s success. Now I will be turning to the specifics of our quarter four expectations. Our forward revenue guidance range is again slightly wider than normal, as there continues to be uncertainty how the rebound will play out in the face of continued COVID-19 concerns. However, as we mentioned in our last earnings call, we thought Q4 would be stronger than Q3 and that is what our guidance reflects. We see the improvement in demand which began in Q3 continuing into Q4, both from a broad demand perspective and also from the increased traction of our company specific opportunities. These include automotive growth opportunities like radar, digital clusters and battery management. In the industrial end markets, opportunities include growth of our crossover processors and connectivity solutions while in mobile, momentum continues to build for our secure ultra wideband and secure mobile wallet solutions. We believe the robust second half 2020 results combined with our strong product portfolio and customer engagement will continue to yield positive results and that gives us significant confidence in our growth in 2021. From a channel perspective, we will continue our stringent discipline of our distributor channel inventory and we will maintain our target channel inventory at 2.4 months of supply. With that preamble, we are guiding Q4 revenue at 2.45 billion, up about 6% versus Q4 '19. And from a sequential perspective, this represents an increase of about 8% at the midpoint versus the prior quarter. At the midpoint, we anticipate the following trends in our business. Automotive is expected to be up in the high-single digit range versus Q4 '19 and up in the low 20% range versus Q3 '20, as we see a continued and substantial rebound from our automotive customers. Industrial and IoT is expected to be up in the low 20% range versus Q4 '19 and flattish versus Q3 '20 with strength continued in China and across the end market as a whole. Mobile is expected to be up about 10% versus the year ago period and up sequentially in the high-single digit percentage range versus Q3 with strength in our key customers and despite the ban on Huawei. Communication infrastructure and other is expected to be down in the low-single digit range versus Q4 '19 and versus Q3 '20. The sequential decline is largely due to the restrictions on shipments to Huawei. And additionally, just as an update, very early in Q4, we announced the opening of our innovative gallium nitride factory in Chandler, Arizona, and it will begin revenue shipments later in this quarter but with no material impact on the business during this quarter. We do have significant confidence in our growth in 2021, notwithstanding the ban on Huawei. That ban is a clear disappointment as we have strong design build momentum across the product portfolio. We had originally anticipated Huawei would grow to be a strong high-single digit revenue customer in 2021, which would have been a material increase from the current levels. Let me conclude. In summary, we are laser focused on what we can control in order to optimally navigate the improving trends we are currently experiencing. Our first priority is to assure the health and safety of all of our NXP team members having a continued challenging time given the pandemic. And I want to thank them deeply for their determination and hard work, which allows us to successfully navigate the rebound we are experiencing. Collectively as a team, we are striving to facilitate the best possible business continuity with a customer focus on supply chain and R&D execution. And with that, I would like to pass the call to Peter for a review of our financial performance before we will turn to your questions. Peter?
Peter Kelly: Thank you, Kurt. Good morning to everyone on today's call. As Kurt’s already covered the drivers of the revenue during the quarter and provided our revenue outlook for the fourth quarter, I'll move to the financial highlights. In summary, our third quarter revenue performance was significantly better than planned. Relative to our guidance, we experienced material improvements across all of our end markets. We are pleased that the third quarter has also returned to improved year-on-year revenue performance, providing a solid position to build from going into 2021. Now moving to the details of the third quarter, total revenue was $2.27 billion, flat year-on-year and $267 million above the midpoint of our guidance. We generated $1.14 billion in non-GAAP gross profit and reported a non-GAAP gross margin of 50.1%, down about 360 basis points year-on-year and up 110 basis points above the midpoint of our guidance. Gross margin was better than expected because of the higher revenue, more normal environment given the impact of running our fabs at low utilization levels and a slightly unfavorable mix. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $550 million, up $19 million year-on-year and up by $34 million from Q2. This was $15 million higher than the midpoint of our guidance as we increased expenses associated with non-executive variable compensation. From a total operating profit perspective, non-GAAP operating profit was $586 million and non-GAAP operating margin was 25.8%, down about 450 basis points year-on-year but 360 basis points higher than the guidance due to the increased fall through on higher revenues. Non-GAAP financial expense was $100 million, essentially in line with guidance. Cash taxes for ongoing operations were $29 million and non-controlling interest was $4 million, slightly better on a combined basis than our guidance. Stock-based compensation, which is not included in our non-GAAP earnings, was $83 million. Now, I'd like to turn to the changes in our cash and debt. Our total debt at the end of the third quarter was $9.36 billion, up sequentially and our ending cash position was $3.57 billion, up $300 million due to solid cash generation during the quarter. Net debt was better at 5.79 billion and we exited the quarter with a trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA of $2.71 billion. Our ratio of net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of Q3 was 2.1x and our non-GAAP trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA net interest – sorry, was 2.1x our non-GAAP trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. Net interest coverage was 7.8x. And as previously disclosed and after the close of Q3, we redeemed 1.35 billion, 4.125 notes due 2021 and $400 million, 4.625 due in 2022 for a total consideration of $1.83 billion, including the principal, interest and make-whole [ph] costs. During the third quarter, we paid $105 million in quarterly cash dividends and we continue to have a strong balance sheet and excellent liquidity. Turning to working capital metrics, days of inventory was 84 days, a decline of 36 days sequentially, which is well below our long-term target of 95 days, as revenue rebounded much faster than anticipated and we fulfilled the increased demand from on-hand inventory. We continue to closely manage our distribution channel with inventory in the channel at 2.4 months, which is within our long-term targets. Days receivable were 30 days, up six days sequentially. Days payable with 55, a decrease of 16 days versus the prior quarter because the increased sales were primarily fulfilled from on-hand inventory. Taken together, our cash conversion cycle improved to 59 days, an improvement of 14 days versus the prior quarter. Cash flow from operations was $527 million and net CapEx was 68 million, resulting in non-GAAP free cash flow of $459 million, a testament to the strong cash flow generating capability of the business. Turning to our expectations for the fourth quarter. As Kurt mentioned, we anticipate Q4 revenues to be about $2.45 billion plus or minus about $75 million. Again, a wider than normal range considering the uncertain environment we continue to navigate. At the midpoint, this is up 6% year-on-year and up 8% sequentially. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be about 52.7% plus or minus 30 basis points. Operating expenses are expected to be about $563 million plus or minus about 10 million. And taken together, we see non-GAAP operating margin to be about 29.7% plus or minus about 60 basis points. We estimate non-GAAP financial expense to be about $84 million and anticipated cash tax related to ongoing operations to be about $36 million. Non-controlling interest will be about $9 million. And for non-GAAP modeling purposes, we would advise using about 286 million shares. Finally, I have a few closing comments I'd like to make. Our gross margin guidance for the fourth quarter reflects the continued improvement versus the prior quarter. However, the midpoint is not commensurate with our goal of 55% gross margin and a $2.4 billion revenue run rate. Relative to our Q4 guidance, there is about 150 basis points headwind as a result of the third quarter carry forward, a wafer fab under utilization. There's also about 100 basis points headwind for product mix, which is a combination of lower communication infrastructure revenue and a higher percentage of automotive business to large OEMs to our Tier 1 customers. With a couple of exceptions, our factories will come up to a more normal level of utilization in the current quarter. And you'll see our internal inventories move up progressively to a more normal level of 95 days over the next several quarters. But we will remain inventory at distribution at the 2.4-month level. The past quarter has been more than a little surprising. Our automotive business came back much more quickly than we thought it would do. And we've seen real strength in the industrial and mobile end markets. On the other hand, as Kurt mentioned, and for obvious reasons relating to the current political environment, we've seen significant opportunities in the comm infrastructure end market disappear. Notwithstanding the challenge in communications infrastructure, our fourth quarter guidance still reflects a robust and faster than anticipated rebound in demand. This combined with solid operating margin expansion and the commensurate improvements in cash flow will in turn result in our net debt to trailing 12 months EBITDA leverage ratio being at or below 2x by the end of the quarter. Therefore, I am pleased to announce we will likely resume our share repurchase program during the fourth quarter. And we continue to have sufficient capacity on our existing authorization to do this. Finally, in these very difficult times, Kurt and I would like to thank all of our colleagues around the world for their commitment to NXP and doing the right thing for our customers. The current period is unprecedented and is extremely difficult, but over the long run NXP has the right strategy, is in the right markets and has the right products to continue to win. Now, we'd like to open it up to your questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore: Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a couple of questions and congrats on the strong results. First thing I want to talk about was the automotive side of things, obviously very strong rebound for you and everyone else. But I guess if I look at it as a longer term basis, inclusive of your fourth quarter guidance and beyond, can you just talk about that delta versus SAR? It looks like you guys are going to do the better part of 10 points better than SAR for this year. You talked about robust growth next year. Can you just specify down what's specifically to NXP is occurring in that to allow that outperformance?
Kurt Sievers: Thanks, Ross. Let me take that one. Clearly, automotive disappeared quickly in the second quarter and came back now very hard in the third and continuing in the fourth quarter. Looking at it from the perspective of comparison against SAR is exactly what we do. For this year, I'd agree with you, Ross. It looks like we probably come out with maybe a – I don't know, 9 to 7 – 9 to 10 percentage points decline on the full year while the SAR, according to IHS, probably declines by 18 percentage points. So we will be about 8 percentage points at least better than the SAR. Now that's not totally out of the world, because we continue to see our long-term growth in the auto business to follow the algorithm of SAR plus 3 to 5 percentage points of semi-content growth, and then we want to outgrow that. And if you compare that to how it's going this year, we are on the high end of that but I think that works and we definitely believe with the content increases where we also strongly participate with our growth businesses. Take for example radar or the eCockpit business or the battery management business, we are participating in this. So the algorithm on the long-term stands SAR plus 3 to 5 percentage points content increases what we think the auto semi market is doing and that's what we want to outgrow by a factor of, say, 1.5.
Ross Seymore: Thanks for that color. I guess my follow up just moving over to Peter and into the gross margin side, very helpful color with a couple of headwinds you have in the fourth quarter, even though you've hit the 2.4 billion side of things. How do we see those rolling off going forward? Underutilization charges seem like they disappear. I know mix can change on a quarterly basis. But what does the trajectory look like between now and even if revenue stays 1.4 billion and change and getting to that 55% marker that you're targeting going forward?
Peter Kelly: Yes, sure. In Q4, we're down to 52.7. So let's say we had exactly the same mix going forward and the same level of revenue, you would expect that to improve by 150 basis points pretty much off the bat. We're bringing the fabs that aren’t quite back to normal in fourth quarter, but they're pretty close getting up to the 85% level. So that would take us to, say, the 54.3, 54.5 level. The issue I think we have in probably the first half of next year is the drop off in comm infra and how quickly auto direct has come up. So it feels like that's about 100 basis points of mix impact. So I think there's two things, Ross. One is utilization. I think we can pretty much forget about from Q1 onwards. I think we'll suffer in the first half from this hit if the mix doesn't change. And of course, we have to hit those revenue numbers. You do have a few things that move around in any one quarter. I’d remind you that Q1, we usually have our annual price reductions, particularly in the auto space and that can hit us by about 40 basis points. But I’d say from an underlying perspective, I still feel very confident that we should be running 55% to $2.4 billion of revenue. I've been shocked versus where we were three months ago about the speed at which auto came back and the reduction that we've seen in our overall potential for comm infra. But certainly, utilization shouldn't be an issue after the end of this year.
Ross Seymore: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse of Evercore.
C.J. Muse: Good morning. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question was hoping you could elaborate a bit more on Huawei. What percent customer were they into Q3? And then as part of that question, can you discuss how the embargo there is impacted, if at all your ramp of your new GaN facility?
Kurt Sievers: Hi, C.J. Yes, I think that is an important event for us. So Huawei, just to clarify this very stringently, Huawei is not anymore in our guidance for Q4. So the Q4 guidance which we just gave is completely excluding any revenue to Huawei. Historically, we said Huawei has been and I mean that's never been the same in any given quarter, but say a low-single digit customer for the company. For next year, we had actually a very clear view to get to Huawei being a high-single digit customer and that is actually there it relates to the margin and mix impact, which Peter just spoke about to the question of Ross before. Now the matter of the fact is, of course, that we have applied for licenses with the U.S. government and we have to see what they will be and when granted relative to these license requests for different products we would be shipping into Huawei.
C.J. Muse: And just to follow up on that, does this impact how you think about ramping your new GaN facility? And as part of that, is there a margin headwind associated with simply under utilization of that factory?
Peter Kelly: Let me take that answer. If you look at our two fabs – if you look at our utilization for next year, we have two fabs that are not running at 85% early on. One is our [indiscernible] and the other is our Chandler fab. But in terms of what we plan, because we talked on the last call about how we were kind of a bit behind where we expect it to be. As Kurt has said, we don't expect to see any additional impact from the ramp of the fab.
C.J. Muse: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer: Good morning, guys. Congratulations on the really solid results. Peter, my first question is just on OpEx. This has been anything but a typical year and clearly some of the calendar Q3 upside allowed you to raise OpEx for sort of the non-execs. I'm just kind of curious as you look at the calendar fourth quarter run rate, I'm struck by the fact that revenue is well above seasonal. And if there is a seasonal OpEx to cadence, OpEx is actually slightly below. So are we now looking at the right OpEx level? And as we go into calendar year '21, how should we think about the puts and takes of COVID related expenses both on the plus and the minus?
Peter Kelly: I think you can never really pick one quarter, because we always have a bunch of masks either moving in or moving out. For 2021, I’d go back to our comments from last quarter, John. We think 575 plus or minus 10 million in any one particular quarter is probably pretty close. Clearly, if our revenue was to grow very substantially, we might be talking about a different number. But from what we can see at the moment, we'd say 575 plus or minus 10.
John Pitzer: That's very helpful. And then as my follow up, Kurt, you were very clear in your prepared comments that despite the Huawei headwind, you still feel very good about growth for calendar year '21. I'm wondering if you could just help us understand kind of in order of strength, what gives you that confidence level and specifically with Huawei business that you now can't ship to, is there other opportunities shipped to other comm OEMs or where those very specific Huawei programs?
Kurt Sievers: Yes, John. So certainly, the confidence into next year is a carry forward from the company's specific strengths and the rebound we are experiencing right now. So clearly, with the high impact on the total company from a revenue perspective from automotive, we continue to be very confident into next year that our growth pockets where we have those leadership positions in radar, eCockpit and BMS, they will continue to play out the way we have talked about them in the past. So there is – we have the design wins on the books. We see actually the end consumer demand for these specific systems, be it in ADAS, be it in electrification, we see that absolutely coming through. So I think the automotive side of things does stand very firm on top of the rebounds, which is certainly being forecasted for the SAR. So, I talked about the negative side of things earlier that the SAR probably is going to be down like 18% this year. IHS is currently prognosing something like 14% up with SAR next year. And on top of that, we have the content increase in our market share gains in those leadership positions. Secondly, certainly mobile and as we started to experience now in the third quarter and what continues into the fourth quarter, we see continuous very strong traction with our secure mobile wallet, which is also a function of the pandemic ironically, because the use of contactless payments is something which even in countries which have been a bit shy so far, is now getting much more traction. And secondly, with the kickoff with Samsung which I mentioned the secure ultra wideband, certainly in the mobile space is now also seeing a lot of traction. Now if you speak about industrial IoT, I think we are seeing this year already an amazingly strong year in industrial IoT, which is also a function of China, because we have a large exposure to China. And actually COVID-19 impact in China, if you will, was history already in the second quarter. So we see their continued growth and that said momentum, which rides on our crossovers together with our new connectivity portfolio, they will continue well into next year. So all of these growth elements, John, we really see fully intact into the next year such that we of course, miss that revenue to Huawei, but we don't really think this is a big negative. Now, how much of that could be compensated by other mobile customers? I really don't dare to say, specifically since some part of it was in the infrastructure side of things where there is much less competitors.
John Pitzer: Perfect. Thanks, guys.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley.
Craig Hettenbach: Thank you. You guys continue to do a good job of controlling inventory and in the channel and internally. So, can you just maybe talk about any signals you're getting just from a sell-through perspective and your ability to kind of keep inventory at equilibrium, despite what's a pretty volatile supply chain?
Kurt Sievers: Hi, Craig. On the distributor side, as you have seen and as we – I think both Peter and I reiterated again, we are absolutely disciplined to the target of 2.4 months. Now, if you ask from a lead time perspective, then I would tell you that clearly the current demand – the strong demand which we started to experience in, say, middle of – started middle of Q3 has extended lead times a little from, say, typically 16 weeks to now maybe 20 weeks with a few exceptions above that. But no, I think we feel ourselves in a good position and we also believe given the environment, it is exactly the right policy to stick to the 2.4 months of distribution channel inventory.
Peter Kelly: And can I just add a comment on our internal inventory. Clearly, we came down pretty dramatically in Q3 to 84 days. Given we will be kind of shipping everything we think in Q4, we’ll probably stay at the low 80s in Q4 and it will take us a couple of quarters to get back up to 95. And we think 95 is about the right level for internal inventory.
Craig Hettenbach: Got it. Thanks for that. And then just a follow up on the growth drivers, Kurt, any update? I know you mentioned crossover MCUs, but just curious kind of the type of traction you're seeing for that products, how broad based is it and just anything you're doing versus other competitors that you stand out for that product?
Kurt Sievers: Well, I'm saying now with a cordial smile what really stands out is that we have that product category, Craig, because I continue to not really see any competitive solution which is coming close. So, by the sheer power of heading it and by the sheer power of heading it now in conjunction with the WiFi portfolio, especially now on the WiFi 6 standard, which – and I think we talked about that earlier, which we have now software integrated, so the software development environment for all our customers is actually one now for the crossovers together with the WiFi. We do definitely see continued strong traction. Now, this is on a design build level at this perspective, Craig. So, I should also be clear that the revenue from this is, I don't know, half a year out, a year out, one and a half years out depending on what specific industrial segments we are designing it into. So my measurement point at this stage is clearly the design win traction which we are seeing and that is really good. I should maybe also mention that the strong performance of industrial IoT has also been carried in the past quarter by our general purpose MCUs and by standalone connectivity products. We got that Marvell connectivity portfolio in and of course we also sell it as a standalone solution and also that is seeing good traction.
Craig Hettenbach: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of William Stein of Truist Securities.
William Stein: Thanks for taking my question. Guys, really impressive quarter and guidance both ahead of expectations. There's this cyclical rebound that you're seeing and I understand the practice of guiding one quarter at a time. But during these times when we see these sorts of strong recoveries, sometimes they can be driven by customers’ interest in building a little bit of inventory. And I guess the point I'm trying to make is sometimes we overshoot to the upside. Notwithstanding your comments about confidence in 2021 generally, should we be thinking about Q1 as sort of normal seasonal quarter or do you think because of the dynamics we're seeing in Q3 and Q4 that maybe we should tap that down a little?
Kurt Sievers: Hi, Will. Maybe Peter also wants to say a few words to this. So first of all, we don't guide Q1 at this stage. This is clearly a Q4 guidance. Secondly, I think the language of normal seasonal in the current environment is just not applicable. I wish it was, but I don't think there is anything like a moment seasonality in the current environment. So I think that doesn't really help for Q1.
Peter Kelly: Yes, we were talking in kind of preparation for this, Will, and we thought one of the questions we’d get is kind of how much is inventory restocking versus the market overall? Clearly, Q3 has to have had some impact from inventory restocking. And maybe there's even a little in Q4, but we wouldn't say what our expectation for 2021 assumes that continues to be the case. Q1 is typically a lighter quarter. But it's really, really hard to say what seasonality may or may not be. It's just such – as you pointed out, it's such a weird market. And we're loathe [ph] to try and speculate on what the four quarters of next year might be sitting where we are today. But it definitely feels a lot better than it did three months ago.
William Stein: Fair enough and --
Kurt Sievers: I’m sorry. Let me maybe add on the question of restocking. Of course with ramps and rebound of the industry, there is always a certain level of repriming the supply chains. That's perfectly normal. But given the fact that we have a large exposure to distribution business, I think our continued discipline on the 2.4 months, which we had just discussed, gives you also a strong handle that in that area at least we don't overdo. We stick to this and that makes it a very – that makes it very clean I think. On the direct account side, it's of course in the end for us harder to measure what the stock positions could be. But if we look at the end demand at the constant increase of our product speed in mobile or be in automotive, we think we have a pretty good view on this that this is not really about restocking, but it's true demand which we are seeing.
William Stein: Yes, idiosyncratic rather than cyclical or maybe more than cyclical. One follow up, if I can. You have talked about mobile wallet adoption getting to 50% I think from the last Analyst Day through the end of a three or four-year period. It seems to me that that might be tracking well ahead of expectations. If you can provide any update on that? And then now that we have ultra wideband shipping into handsets, maybe you can comment on the pace of adoption you're expecting there? Is it similar to get to 50% over some number of years or is it a different view?
Kurt Sievers: Yes, that's fair. So, on the mobile wallet, indeed I think the guidance we gave was 50% adoption rate by the end of next year, so calendar year '21. And yes, we are well on track. Let's leave it here with saying this. We will deliver on this promise. On the secure ultra wideband, clearly early days but I think with Samsung, which is very – they are very strong and very – they are very determined in building the ecosystem together with us, I think we have a great kickoff in the Android space now. And certainly we want to see that they will not be the only Android OEM. And that spreads much more broadly quickly. I don't think we are yet in a position to talk about specific adoption percentages by specific times, because it's also not only mobile. The adoption is going to start also in automotive next year. And we are now working with a lot of focus also into IoT, which is adding another wave of volume. But again, it's too early days to put firm percentage numbers behind that.
William Stein: Thanks. Congrats again.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis from Barclays.
Tom O’Malley: Hi, guys. This is Tom O’Malley on for Blayne Curtis. Congrats on the nice results. My first one is about the buyback. You indicated that since the trailing 12 months that EBITDA metric was now a low 2, you guys were going to start buying back. Can you talk about what your mindset is around the framework there? Are you going to continue buying back where you kind of left off before the pandemic or just any sort of framework going forward would be helpful given you’re restarting that?
Peter Kelly: Yes, that’s really straightforward. We'll buy back the level which keeps us from the actual just below 2x net debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA.
Tom O’Malley: Simple enough. I just wanted to walk through a bit more complicated one than that, I guess, but you mentioned a couple moving parts into margin, the gross margin. You said same mix, same revenue, 150 bps off the bat benefit, but you also pointed to 100 basis points potential mix impact and then some annual price reductions in auto. I understand that you're not counting Q1 and totally understandable. But could you describe a scenario in which you saw revenue down in Q1 and gross margins still improved? The reason I ask is just that's a bit unique given your history. Can you walk through if there's any other moving parts in the gross margin we should be aware of?
Peter Kelly: Okay. So I think there's – you have two slightly different questions. So my comment was really about can we hit 55% or 2.4? Okay. And I basically said in the first half, a 2.4 level of revenue with the current mix, we’d probably be more like 54% because of the mix. Okay. So that's one question. A different question is, okay, going forward from Q4, what's likely to move? So, if we do 52.7 in Q4, I'll get 150 basis points straight off just because I won't take the utilization which would take me to 54.2. But that would assume the same mix. The comments I made and I think the thing you have to watch out for is Q1 typically as our annual price reduction, which can be 30, 40 basis points. So our growth – to answer your question, even if revenue was slightly down in Q1 over Q4, we'd probably still see a slightly better margin because we get rid of the underutilization headwind in Q4 of '20. Okay. But that's a pretty unusual situation. But at the moment, we’re just really heavy on the utilization. Does that make sense?
Tom O’Malley: That’s really helpful. Thanks a lot.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Chris Caso from Raymond James.
Chris Caso: Thank you. Good morning. First question is related to auto market and some of what you said in Japan. It sounds like Japan's recovery is lagging a bit. How much of a headwind has that Japanese part of the business been? And presumably, if that normalizes like the rest of auto next year, how much of a benefit would that provide?
Kurt Sievers: Yes. Hi, Chris. My comment was really related to Q3. We see Japan already catching up in the fourth quarter actually. So I'd say when you then think about the full next year, and now I can only look at what IHS is predicting for the SAR, then actually Japan is on the same pace and is quite normalized with the other regions. It was more that this year in the third quarter where we saw all this very sharp return, especially in U.S. and Europe. It started a little later in Japan such that it sits more on the fourth quarter than it was already sitting in the third quarter. But I don't think that there's any reason to extrapolate this into next year.
Chris Caso: Got it. Thank you. As a follow up, I just wanted to dig into the commentary about the potential for some inventory restocking and where that may be. And I guess is it safe to say if that were happening, the industrial market would be the most likely area and obviously that area is harder to get visibility. And I guess follow up from that is, do you suspect that there was any restocking in the automotive area? And I presume there that they were coming off of some pretty low inventory levels earlier in the year when the factory shut down. But again, they're on hubs. So I suppose there's probably better visibility there.
Kurt Sievers: Yes. Let me start with auto. Indeed, we have made sure that inventory levels wouldn't be too big, because we really had a lot of attention this time in the second quarter when things were falling down to not over ship. So even with our direct accounts, we had a lot of one-on-one discussions to make sure that their order pattern would be somehow compliant with the end demand. So I guess I'd agree with you there that probably wasn't too much of inventory sitting there which is exactly why I said earlier, some restocking now is just normal to prime the supply chains for significantly higher production rates. They have to do this. There is nothing strange about it. The industrial side of things is a little harder to tell because a lot of the business goes through distribution for us. There we do control, as explained, the distribution of entry in a very transparent way. We have all the systems and all the discipline in place to do this. But we, of course, do not have the visibility into all of the thousands of end customers behind distribution. So it's less easy to say what they possibly are restocking or not restocking. My early take at this stage is it isn't that much because most of it is anyway in China. And in China it’s not like now suddenly a Q3 or Q4 effect. We have seen growth in China industrial starting with the second quarter. So Q4 is now the third quarter in a row that it’s growing.
Chris Caso: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gary Mobley from Wells Fargo Securities.
Gary Mobley: Hi, everyone. Thanks for sneaking my question in. Most of the questions have been asked, but I do want to ask one about your battery management system. Now your win with Volkswagen sounds very impressive as obviously they're the largest OEM in the world and seem to have the most aggressive EV platform in terms of rollout schedule. So I'm just curious to know where you stand today with BMS sales? If I'm not mistaken, it's somewhere in the tens to millions. You may have maybe 10%, 20% market share. So I'm just wondering if you can give us an assessment of where this business may be in 12 months, 24 months, just given this Volkswagen win. Thank you.
Kurt Sievers: Yes. So, Gary, the best way to think about it is, is think about the 50 million run rate this year roughly. And what we did say is that we will grow this with twice the sum. So we want to grow twice as fast as the markets, which would translate in something like 60% CAGR over the next couple of years; so 50 million this year growing with 60% CAGR over the next couple of years and we think the associated market is growing at about 30%. Now just as a rule of thumb, this Volkswagen win, there of course, there is a high variation of how big it's going to be depending on their success and how quickly they bring the next models and models and models out. But that's maybe half of it, right? So that's why we are super proud of this. I think it's a great testament to the scalability of our system solution to the function and safety of the solution. But this is only 50% of their business going forward, so it's just a part.
Gary Mobley: Thank you. That’s it for me.
Jeff Palmer: Operator, we’ll take one more question today.
Operator: Yes, sir. And your final question comes from the line of Rajvindra Gill from Needham & Company.
Rajvindra Gill: Yes. Thank you for taking my questions. I appreciate it. Congratulations on the auto recovery. On the communications infrastructure side, wondering how you're thinking about that next year given the issue with Huawei, but also kind of your traction? Again, you're a little bit late in GaN product. It seems to me you're kind of catching up in Arizona. How do you think about your GaN portfolio relative to the competition and adoption in calendar '21 and how that would positively affect your comm infrastructure business next year? Thank you.
Kurt Sievers: Yes, we feel very good about our GaN competitiveness. It's only the starting issue, as you rightfully pointed out, that we are coming out a little late and that's actually a consequence of – we thought and we were aligned with our customers that that would only be needed next year and that's also what we are delivering, but then they put in the requirements. The competitiveness of the product in terms of power efficiency looks very, very good. We did announce a few weeks ago that both the factory as well as the product is being released as we speak. We start shipping small volumes in the later part of this fourth quarter and will really ramp up in the first quarter of next year. I am quite optimistic on this for next year because if you think about the main customers for this, so think about Ericsson, think about Samsung, think about Nokia, CTE, we – with all of them we have had historically already very leading positions with our product, be it with LDMOS or be it with massive MIMO. So I think we are in a great position actually once we start shipping to wrap it up with gallium nitride. So yes, a little late but now coming in strong.
Rajvindra Gill: And just for my follow-up question on the ultra wideband kind of moving to other markets outside of mobile, I wanted to see what your thoughts were in terms of what do you think the next kind of biggest market for UWB will be and why do you think that?
Kurt Sievers: Yes, we have good visibility into the automotive side because the design win cycles are pretty lengthy, so we are working and have been working this for quite a while already where we see mid-second half of next year the first OEMs coming out with ultra wideband secure access solutions based on NXP. The IoT world obviously is much more complicated because it's more smaller customers, a lot of opportunities. But I also assume that it is fair to say that through the next year, we will see the first applications being picked up in the IoT space. And think about smart locks, for example, indoor navigation, et cetera, etcetera. So automotive, a lot of visibility but it goes the typical automotive pace starting mid of next year. IoT, somewhat more complicated because of the multitude of opportunities, but also there we believe next year is – we see the first volumes.
Rajvindra Gill: Great. Congrats again and excellent momentum. Thank you.
Kurt Sievers: Thank you.
Jeff Palmer: Thank you everyone for your attendance to the call today. And we'll look forward to speaking to you next quarter. Thank you very much. This concludes our call.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-07-28 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Q2 2020 NXP Semiconductors’ Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jeff Palmer. Thank you, please go ahead, sir.
Jeff Palmer: Thank you, Jerome. And good morning, good afternoon everyone. We hope you are all safe and healthy. Welcome to the NXP Semiconductors second quarter 2020 earnings call. With me on the call today Kurt Sievers, NXP's CEO and President; and Peter Kelly, our CFO.  The call today is being recorded and will be available for replay from our corporate website. The call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause NXP's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, the macroeconomic impact on the specific end markets in which we operate, the sale of new and existing products and our expectations for the financial results for the third quarter of 2020. Please be reminded that NXP undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements. For a full disclosure on forward-looking statements, please refer to our press release. Additionally, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures, which are driven primarily by discrete events that management does not consider to be directly related to NXP's underlying core operating performance. Pursuant to Regulation G, NXP has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our second quarter 2020 earnings press release, which will be furnished to the SEC on Form 8-K and is available on NXP's website in the Investor Relations section at nxp.com. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Kurt.
Kurt Sievers: Thanks very much Jeff and good morning or good afternoon everyone. We really appreciate you joining the call today.  Now let me turn to our results. Our Q2 revenue was modestly better than the midpoint of our original guidance. Our Automotive business was significantly impacted by the COVID-19 caused factory shutdowns of our customers. So we did experience better than anticipated trends, and sequential growth in all of our other end markets. We are encouraged by the positive trends we experienced in China and the sales out of our distribution channel did improve sequentially. Taken together, NXP delivered revenue of $1.82 billion, $17 million above the midpoint of our original guidance range. Non-GAAP operating margin was 20.7%, about 170 basis points above the midpoint of guidance. We experienced slightly higher revenue with a higher proportion of distribution channel sales. We did deliver better gross margin because of a positive product sales mix. And all of this combined with tight control of our operating expenses resulted in better than expected operating profitability. Now turning to the specific trends in our focused end markets. In automotive, revenue was $674 million, down 35% versus the year ago period and showing us 32% sequential decline. In industrial and IoT, revenue was $435 million, up 12% versus the year ago period and up 16% sequentially. In mobile, revenue was $255 million down 14% versus the year ago period, up 3% sequentially. And please note the year-on-year comparison in mobile was impacted by the sale of the voice and audio business. And lastly, communication infrastructure and other revenue was $453 million down 9% year-on-year and up 12% sequentially. Now, before I’m turning to the specifics of our Q3 expectations, I'd like to make a few important comments. Our revenue guidance range for Q3 is again wider than normal. However, we believe the setup is gradually more positive heading into the second half of the year. And this is thanks to customer attraction with NXP specific drivers, including automotive radar, wireless connectivity, our crossover processes, our secure ultra-widebands, just to name a few. And furthermore, we do see an ongoing stabilization of our end markets. However, at the same time, we want to balance our enthusiasm as we continue to view the broader demand environment as fluid given the COVID-19 pandemic. It is too early to make a broad statement regarding a complete return to normalize demand or the specifics of the shape of the recovery. As an example of several of the ultimate end customers of our products, especially the automotive OEM customers in Europe, North America, and Japan are still running production at below pre-pandemic levels. Therefore we view the best course of action is to continue to focus on those aspects of our business, which we can directly control. This certainly includes stringent discipline of our distributor channel inventory to maintain our target channel inventory at 2.4 months of supply. And exactly in that light, we held back about $145 million of shipments to distributors during the past quarter. Additionally, we continue to run our internal factories significantly below normal operating levels, avoiding building excess inventory. And with that preamble, we are guiding Q3 revenue at $2 billion down about 12% versus Q3 2019. And from a sequential perspective this represents an increase of about 10% at the midpoint versus the prior quarter. At the midpoint, we anticipate the following trends in our businesses. Automotive is expected to be down in the low 20% range versus Q3 2019, and up about 20% versus Q2 2020. Industrial and IoT is expected to be up in the mid teens range versus Q3 2019 and is expected to be up in the mid teens range versus Q2 2020. Mobile is expected to be down in the low teens range versus Q3 2019. Again, the year-on-year trends are being impacted by the sale of the voice and audio business. On a sequential basis, mobile is expected to be up about 10% versus Q2 2020. And finally, communication infrastructure and other is expected to be down in the low teens range versus Q3 2019 and down in the upper single digits range versus Q2 2020. Now let me summarize. We will be laser-focused on what we can control and we will continue to navigate an uncertain demand environment. Clearly, our number one priority is to assure the health and safety of all of our NXP team members, while at the same time, facilitating the best possible business continuously with a customer focus on supply chain and R&D execution. We don't have any unique insights as to when this changing period will subside, but we continue to have ample financial liquidity and strength to weather the current environment. And we maintain all the critical investments in areas that will assure NXP's long-term success in its chosen strategy, while we actively and continuously review all areas of discretionary spending.  Our focused investments in leading-edge new products and deep customer engagements in fast-growing segments, such as automotive, ADAS and electrification, secure connected edge processing for the IoT and our secure ultra wide bands are all very, very durable and we do continue to enjoy significant design win traction. We are committed to the consistent execution of our long-term strategy and continue to be deeply engaged and sharply focused on enabling our customers’ success. And now I would like to pass the call to Peter for a review of our financial performance before we turn to all of your questions. So Peter?
Peter Kelly: Thanks, Kurt. And good morning to everyone on today's call. As Kurt has already covered the drivers of the revenue during the quarter and provided our revenue outlook for the third quarter, I'll move to the financial highlights.  In summary, our second quarter revenue performance in total was a little better than planned. Our Industrial & IoT end market along with common infrastructure showed significant strength. Our shipments into the mobile end market were about where we plan and our automotive revenue was significantly weaker than planned as OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers in Europe, North America and Japan closed their factory for extended periods. You'll note a proportionate sales through distribution versus direct were significantly higher reaching a record 58% given the strength in China and the weakness in automotive, which is more of a direct – more a direct business end market. So moving to the details of the second quarter. Total revenue was $1.82 billion, down 18% year-on-year and $17 million above the midpoint of our guidance. We generated $892 million in non-GAAP gross profits and reported a non-GAAP gross margin, 49.1% down 420 basis points year-on-year and 110 basis points above the midpoints of guidance. Gross margins were better than expected because of the mixed swing towards distribution and an overall richer product mix. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $516 million, down $25 million year-on-year and better by $29 million from the first quarter. This was $7 million better than the midpoint of our guidance because of lower payroll expense. From a total operating profit perspective, non-GAAP operating profit was $376 million and non-GAAP operating margin was 20.7% down about 820 basis points year-on-year, but 170 basis points higher than guidance due to better gross margin and lower operating expense. Non got financial expense was $92 million, which was $10 million higher than guidance because of the new $2 billion debt issuance we undertook during the quarter. Cash taxes for ongoing operations were $16 million and non-controlling interests were $5 million, slightly better on a combined basis than our guidance. Stock based compensation, which is not included in our non-GAAP earnings, was $105 million. Now I'd like to turn to the changes in our cash and debt. Our total debt to the end of the second quarter was $9.35 billion, up about $2 billion sequentially and our ending cash position was $3.27 billion, up $2.2 billion because of the debt issuance and cash generation during the quarter. Net debt was slightly better at $6.09 billion and we exited the quarter with a trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA of $2.8 billion. Our ratio of net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of the second quarter was 2.2 times. And our non-GAAP trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA net interest coverage was 8.5 times. We continue to have a strong balance sheet and excellent liquidity. The response to the recent debt issuance was truly phenomenal. The offering was structured in three trenches of a $500 million five-year note, a $500 million seven year note and a $1 billion, 10 year green bond. The offering was 11 times oversubscribed, and we were very excited that we want to have a very small number of tech companies who have successfully made a green offering. During the second quarter, we paid $105 million in cash dividends. And as we noted last quarter, until our leverage returns to our 2 times target, we have temporarily suspended our buybacks. So we will maintain our quarterly dividend. Turning to working capital metrics, days of inventory was 120 days and increase of 7 days sequentially as revenue levels declined. So on a dollar basis, inventory was flat sequentially. We continue to closely manage our distribution channel with inventory in the channel at 2.4 months. Well, within our long-term targets and we held back about $145 million of orders into distribution to assure our channel inventory metrics remained within our target range. I'm very proud of how the team is managed, both owned and channel inventory. Days receivable were 24 days, down four days sequentially, days payable was 71 days a decrease of 12 days versus the prior quarter and taken together our cash conversion cycle with 73 days and increase of 15 days versus the prior quarter. Cash flow from operations was $414 million and net CapEx was $74 million resulting in non-GAAP free cash flow of $340 million, a testament to the strong cash flow generating capability of the business even in a challenging period.  Turning to our expectations for the third quarter. As Kurt mentioned, we anticipate Q3 revenue to be about $2 billion plus or minus about $100 million. Again, a wider range, the normal considering the uncertain environment we are navigating at the midpoint, this is down about 12% year-on-year, while up 10% sequentially. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be about 49% plus or minus 100 basis points. Operating expenses are expected to be about $535 million plus or minus about $10 million, and taken together we see non-GAAP operating margin to be about 22% plus or minus about 180 basis points. We estimate non-GAAP financial expense to be about $98 million and anticipate cash tax related to ongoing operations to be about $34 million. Non-controlling interest will be about $3 million. Finally, I have a few closing comments I'd like to make. Our gross margin guidance for Q3 remains flat on Q2, with revenue of 10% sequentially. We see some benefit from the additional volume, but this is offset by our product mix, which will be less robust than in Q3 as compared to Q2. And secondly, the continued affects of a very low factory utilization as we manage our inventory levels. As the global economy starts to correct itself and our revenue accelerates, we see no reason why we cannot hit our 55% gross margin target at the $2.4 billion of quarterly revenue level. In terms of operating expense, the guidance of 535 is not a new normal. But it's a constrained number reflecting the stringent Xpress controls, expense controls we've imposed on the organization. The actions taken include the elimination of annual merit increases and incentives and effective hiring freeze, including replacements as well as salary cuts for executives. Clearly, although these are the right things to do in the short term, they're not sustainable in the medium term, and you should assume a more normal level of OpEx in 2021 to be about $575 million a quarter, depending on seasonal influences. When our revenue returns to a more normal level, we would expect our operating expenses to reflect our long-term model of 16% R&D and 7% SG&A. Lastly, we are proactively driving down our internal inventory levels. Our long-term target is 95 days and aim to achieve about 100-day level exiting the third quarter. This will clearly impact all factory utilization. Finally, these are very difficult times Kurt and I would like to thank all of our colleagues around the world for the commitment to NXP and for doing the right thing for our customers. The current period is unprecedented. It's extremely difficult. But over the long run NXP has the right strategy is in the right markets and has the right products to continue to win. Now I'd like to turn to our questions. Operator? Hello?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. You may now ask your question?
John Pitzer: Yes, guys. Thanks for, let me ask the questions. Congratulations on the solid results, given the challenging environment. Kurt, I guess, as we look at the company that as you mentioned in your preamble, there's a lot of companies specific drivers. And I guess I want to try to get a better understanding what, when you look at the auto growth you expect in the calendar third quarter, to what extent is that coming from the growth areas of the business versus the more mature parts of the auto business? And a similar question on the industrial IoT. Great sequential growth in the June quarter, you're guiding for that to sustain in the September quarter. I'm just kind of curious to what extent is this the benefit you're getting of taking that Marvell asset and running it through kind of your stronger distribution channel?
Kurt Sievers: Yes. Thanks, John. Good morning. First of all a lot of good questions, but let me maybe stop with saying, because it really holds for both for auto and industrial IoT that indeed it all looks like that Q2 was the trough, and now we are moving up from here. And the moving up is indeed a mix of company-specific growth in both segments, by the way, in auto and in industrial IoT and obviously also a recovery of the market. In industrial and IoT, very, very clearly, the – and I think we did also a press release on this. The WiFi is fixed portfolio from Marvell, which we launched in April is actually helping. We have also now successfully integrated the WiFi portfolio into our microcontroller and applications processor software development kits, which makes it really easy for customers. So yes, we do see early traction from that combination. So it is a factor in the continued very nice growth in industrial IOT. Clearly, industrial IoT has another strong sector, which is China. So the good growth in Q2 in industrial and IoT has been carried largely from a Chinese footprint perspective. And that also continues into Q3. Now in auto, things are a little bit different. In auto, clearly, Q2 was completely abnormal since we had these factory shutdowns, specifically from the OEMs in Europe and the U.S. And as we explained in the last call, we really wanted to make sure that we wouldn't create too much excess inventory at our customers, not only at distribution, but also at the direct customers. And that's actually the reason why the business has decreased more than we would have anticipated, but we just didn't want to follow any excess inventory building. But now this is nicely returning. So we see pretty good momentum in auto actually into Q3. And it is indeed a mix between OEMs and Tier 1s getting back to production. So we assume that by the end of Q3, production levels across the world in automotive should be back to 80% of the pre pandemic period. So that's a pretty solid return through Q3. But it's also that RADAR and our cluster business just gets steam again with new design wins, which are taking traction.
John Pitzer: That's helpful. And then as a quick follow-up for Peter, just on the gross margin line. You're guiding for good sequential growth in the calendar third quarter, but you also mentioned you're trying to keep a cap on inventory build. I'm kind of curious as to what that means for utilization Q2 into Q3? And then just remind us, most of what you make or shipped this quarter you made last quarter. So as the utilization impact, if you get a benefit in Q3, is that really going to show up in Q3 gross margin? Or how do we think about Q4 gross margin?
Peter Kelly: Okay. Several questions there. So first of all, utilization in Q3 is about – on average, about 400 basis points lower than Q2. So clearly, that has an impact. I'm trying to take about to go from 120 days to 130 days, I think it's about, I don't know, $70 million of inventory out of the system. So one of the reasons utilization is down is we're inshipping from inventory to keep it under control. We do have this – so I – sorry, utilization is running about, I think, about 50%, maybe a little bit less. We do have this rule – accounting rule that when – and it's a little bit complicated because we do it by factory, and its six months trailing utilization. But when utilization is below 70%, we accelerate the fixed cost right now. So both Q2 and Q3 suffer from an accelerated fixed cost write-down in that you don't carry it forward through inventory. But on the other hand, assuming Q4 is okay and utilization starts to come up a little bit even if it doesn't get to the 70% level, which you probably won't. We'd expect to see some small benefit. And as time goes on, we'll be able to put more and more of the fixed costs into inventory. So typically, utilization in the current quarter impacts the next quarter. But in the current environment, because utilization is so low, you take a hit, not all of it, but you take most of it in the current quarter.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. You may now ask your question.
Vivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. Kurt, just one follow-up on the auto segment. I think you mentioned at the end of Q3, production levels will be back to 80%, I believe, you said off of their normal trend. But when I look at your automotive sales at the $800 million guidance, I think that will be up to 70% of its prior peak. And I understand these things are not always coincident. But I'm curious, how do you look at the unit and the content recovery from here? Because this year, we all understand it's tough. When I look at some of the IHS forecasts for next year, they are looking at auto units perhaps being up double digit. And I know the visibility is low. But if they are up double digits, what does – can that conceptually say about your orders business, given the trend that you have seen so far play out this year?
Kurt Sievers: Yes. Vivek, let me, first of all, comment to the current quarters, I would say, so the past two quarters and the next quarter. That is actually all pretty much in check. So according to IHS, the car production in Q1 was down year-on-year, 22%. Our business was only down 4%. In Q2, car production according to IHS was down year-on-year, 45%. We were down as at just around 35%. So we've been doing really a lot better in these first two quarters. Now I don't claim this is all market share gains or something, but part of this is indeed some inventory they've been building in the first half, like always, which will come down in the second half. But actually not too much, which is why I think latest mid through end Q3, we should be totally in balance again, such that the 80% car production at the end of Q3 is – I think that has a reasonable hit with our revenues. If you think about the fact that in Q1 and Q2, we've actually grown well, well ahead of the car production. Now a little bit more bigger picture, Vivek. So first of all, yes, I definitely believe the algorithm, which we've spoken about, that the semiconductor auto market should be like 3% to 4% ahead of SAR. We think that absolutely holds, also through this pandemic and out of the pandemic. And our target to outgrow that by 1.5 times also stands. Now I don't know what the car production next year is exactly going to do. IHS actually, I think there's something like, I think, 13% or 14% growth. And yes, with the algorithm, Vivek, we should be then nicely growing ahead of this in our business. So it doesn't work by the quarter, but over a year or year or two, it absolutely stands. And I mean I also haven't – I haven't really seen a lot of massive platform delays or something. So I believe the new wins we have in our growth areas are all-in tax and also come on time. So I have, say, a relatively solid portion of optimism when I think about automotive for the second half of this year, but then certainly going into next year.
Vivek Arya: Got it. Very helpful. And then, Kurt, for my follow-up, comms infrastructure is interestingly now your second largest business after autos. And I imagine one of your more profitable or perhaps the most profitable business, which is why I think your – I think, Peter, you mentioned about that mix effect going into Q3. I'm curious, how do you think about the growth prospects and leverage to 5G? Because when I recall back to the Analyst Day, I think this was supposed to be a segment with kind of more modest growth prospects versus others. So how do you think about the leverage to 5G? When will you start to see those benefits? Because we are seeing very strong global deployment of 5G. So just talk to us about comms infrastructure just because it's now such a large segment for you and obviously an important contributor to your gross margins? Thank you.
Kurt Sievers: So it's certainly a large and important segment, but I mean the relative size to the others, obviously, in this abnormal period. It's really every quarter. So I mean it's kind of – Q2 certainly wasn't a normal quarter from a revenue's perspective. But anyhow, going forward, clearly the 5G deployment is a key factor. But not everything is shiny, Vivek, to be fair. So the one thing is that, clearly, you know there is one large Chinese company, which is a big carrier of the Chinese deployments. And nobody really knows what the export control regulations will do relative to this customer. So I mean, that's at least one factor on the horizon, where we always have to be a bit, say, cautious instead of being overly optimistic. And the other one is that more recently, the – we are working on our gallium nitride product, as you know, which has higher output powers, which is actually very, very attractive across the customer base. The only issue is that we are late relative to the demand. So I wish we had a faster expansion of our capacity. So we have a little bit of a delay here against the demand, which causes us, I'd say, some delay against the opportunity. But overall, I'm absolutely with you. We have a very, very strong position here across LDMOS all the way through gallium nitride to silicon germanium in that space. But the market But the market is bumpy. It has always been bumpy. It remains bumpy for the factors I've just quoted.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. You may now ask your question.
Stacy Rasgon: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the commentary in your, at least with said improve expectations for improved sales trends through the second half of the year, I want available this debt actually imply that you do see Q4 growing sequentially off of Q3. And if so, can you give us some feeling for what end markets might be driving that?
Kurt Sievers: Well typically Stacy good morning. Clearly the only guide the next score and that next quarter is a 10% sequential growth. And yes I made this statement. So what I would say is we see no reason why Q4 should not be growing over three. And the one I would call out, which is probably pulling this the most is going to be automotive.
Stacy Rasgon: Got it. Thank you. For my follow-up, I wanted to ask about the industrial strength. A lot of companies have been seeing relatively strong traction in this market in the wake of the pandemic, but there's also been some concerns around potential customer overbuilt in California. I know you've been trying to be cautious, not just with your district channel, but also with some of your customers. Maybe that was more than audible, maybe also with industrial to try to reduce their own demand forecasts, to try to control that. I guess what are you doing along those lines and how confident are you with the industrial upside that we're seeing right now actually is sustainable versus just being pulled forward?
Kurt Sievers: Yes. Thanks, Stacy. That's a good question, indeed, because I believe, especially in the current environment, this is a – is a very, very important part of the controls, which we can execute on our business. And the distribution inventory is indeed the most relevant factor in our industry and IoT business, because a large portion of that business is actually going through distribution. And as we've spoken about a lot of times we remain super disciplined on the 2.5 months, actually we had a score again of 2.4 months of inventory in the last quarter. And I think I said in my prepared remarks that we could have shipped 145 million more in this, in this last quarter. And a solid part of this would probably have been in Industrial and IoT. And this is our way to make sure that we don't over ship into this market. So my do anything we can see, which I know I say through the distribution controls on the, on the inventory, which we have enhanced, we have a pretty good handle on this. There isn't that much direct business and industrial
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. You may now ask your question.
Craig Hettenbach: Yes. Thank you. Question for Kirk just on ultra wide band. Can you talk about the breadth of design activity and how you see kind of your exposure, the next couple of quarters and autos versus smartphones?
Kurt Sievers: Yes. Thanks, Craig. That's I'm glad you are asking. I definitely believe we are very, very much on track with building the ecosystem in, in neutral wipe, across mobile and auto. And I think we have kind of signposted now for a year already that this year in 2020, we would get started in a more material way in Mobile. And that is indeed one of the factors which is driving our sequential growth in mobile in Q3. And I mean, let me say that much. It's a, it's a flagship product in a, in an Android space company, which is ramping with our ultra-wideband. So from a revenue and unit perspective, clearly Mobile is now outpacing automotive to start with, but that it's been planned that way because we first have to roll out the mobile ecosystem and then the secure car access – mobile secure car access application is going to follow in the next year. We are shipping already a very small amount of ultra-wideband into automotive today, but it's still coming in the more conventional or traditional form factor of a key. So it's a more secure of doing car access. But with android now going out in a larger scale in mobile, we will have – and we'll see this also with auto OEMs next year in car races.
Craig Hettenbach: Got it. Thanks. And just as a follow-up on Industrial, I know the Marvell connectivity business had a lot of industrial exposure. So can you just talk to some of the strength you're seeing in industrial? How much of that is perhaps the legacy NXP business versus the impact of just Marvell starting to kind of ramp with you?
Kurt Sievers: Peter or Jeff, you – I think you can dissect the at least in a very rough way, the Marvell from our original industrial business. But let me first of all say, Craig, it is really the combination, which makes the difference. Because we do leverage our leading position in apps processes and LCUs to pull-through the connectivity; so it becomes more and more difficult actually to talk about the two things in a separate way because they are just getting more and more combined going forward.
Peter Kelly: Yes. Kurt, I guess, I'll take that. So Craig, as you know, we're not going to break out Marvell individually every quarter. But I will say in Q2, the Marvell WiFi business was a not quite a double-digit percentage of the overall industrial business, but it was a very high kind of single, low double-digit percentage of the overall industrial and IoT business. Just within that one end market, but we're not going to break out Marvell in aggregate.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with DB. You may now ask a question.
Ross Seymore: Thanks guys. So, let me ask some questions. Wanted to ask the first one on the inventory side of things. And this might go into the spirit of leaving no good deed on punished, but I just want to think about how you look at inventory strategically and how your customers are considering it. And the real question is some of your competitors are seemingly going the exact opposite way of you running much higher inventory, making sure channel inventory is ready for a rebound, et cetera. So I guess, what are we going to have to see, to get you to let that either 150 million in the first quarter, 145 million in the quarter and bookings actually flow through. And I guess related to that internally, once you hit that a hundred days, is that when the utilization will start to creep up and your inventory burn internally will stop.
Kurt Sievers: Hey Ross, good morning. Let me take the more strategic perspective first, I think competitors who you are quoting, who will tell you the exact opposite, have a different business model. This is more about catalog product companies. They're the majority of our product is really application and or customer deal specific, which means in our case we just don't need to hold more inventory because we have a fairly good visibility into the specific applications at our customers and the associated run rates. So we continue to believe that the 2.5 months of inventory and distribution is about the right number for us and we are very, very sure we will not miss a bear or not miss any uptick by following that strategy. Now, Peter, maybe over to you relative to the hundred or better we are facing in Q3.
Peter Kelly: And just to add a little bit to that, Ross. We'll ship the $150 million when the distributors start shipping their product to their end customers. And at the moment, the reason we don't ship the $150 million is that they order more than they can ship. And we're not willing to let them have more than 2.5 months, because we have pretty sophisticated models by type of product. In terms of the internal inventory, our goal is to go down to 95 days. Utilization will start to increase when revenue starts to increase. So on flat revenue, flat utilized – flat revenue, flat inventory, you'd see utilization be relatively flat. Flat inventory, increasing revenue, you'd see utilization start to increase. So it's pretty straightforward. It's all about the more we ship, the better the utilization gets.
Ross Seymore: Thanks for that. And I guess as my follow-up on the OpEx side, I know there's specific math we can do on the $575 million and what percentage of revenues that would be. But to the extent you have that framework, Peter, about the gross margin being 55 million to $2.4 billion, your commentary about the OpEx getting up to kind of a $575 million level on a quarterly basis, any sort of framework about the relationship on that to your visibility on revenues, your assumptions, et cetera? And how much you might turn that up or down relative to how the revenue trajectory improves or doesn't at that time?
Peter Kelly: Yes, that's a great question Ross. So what – one of the things that Kurt was saying before is we think, Q2 is the weakest revenue number for 2020. We think the second half will be stronger than the first half. And we think 2021 will be better than 2020. So within that context we think we have the right products, we're making the right investments. We're going to win in our market. So we have no plans to reduce our investment. And this year we've taken some short term actions that I mentioned, like reducing – sorry, basically eliminating pay rises and incentive payments and cutting executive salaries. And at least the first two of those are not maintainable as you go into the next year. So it will add to our costs. But our assumption is maybe not completely in the first and second quarter, but we can afford this level of OpEx because of what we think the revenue will do. Now we have there’s a huge second wave or something then maybe we change our view on that. But although we didn't see it a V-shaped recovery from Q2 into Q3, we don't think 2021 is a complete write-off. So is that helpful? Did I give you the context?
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of – comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore. You may now ask your question.
C.J. Muse: Yes, good morning, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess a follow-up question on the gross margin side. So you're effectively telling us that between $2 billion, $2.4 billion, you should see 85% incremental gross margin. So curious should that be ratable as you progress?
Peter Kelly: Do we don't say that. What we do – what we've said is we have a model that we think is reasonable of a 5% change in revenue gives you about 200 basis points of margin. That sort of gives you a 100 basis points of margin, but that's the kind of plus or minus the $2.3 billion level. There's a couple of other things that go on. Our fixed costs at that level are about 35%. So if you do the math, that's about, I don't know, $400 million, maybe a little bit more million dollars a quarter. So at a much lower level of revenue, your fixed costs are higher. So you do get some higher fall throughs at very, very low levels, both directions. But you have to be able to do the calculation that’s certainly not relatable.
C.J. Muse: Okay. And would you expect it to be concurrent with the utilization increase? Or would it be one quarter delayed?
Peter Kelly: Well I mean it’s a great question, okay. So up to 70% we'd expect – until utilization is 70%, any improvement in utilization will kind of benefit is in the current – won't benefit us really in the current quarter. You see a big benefit once you go to 70%, because you start to carry some of the fixed costs forward. But it's still by factory so it's kind of hard to give you a real line when we're operating the way we are at the moment.
C.J. Muse: Okay, that's helpful. And that as my follow-up, in your prepared remarks, you talked about being encouraged by some of your wins, radar, wireless, crossover processors, secure UWB. If you had to really highlight what is driving your conviction on growth in the back half what would it be within that construct clearly with the addition of macro improvements as well?
Peter Kelly: Yes, I'd say if I had to pick two for the second half then it's probably the automotive radar and the wireless connectivity.
C.J. Muse: Great, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of William Stein with SunTrust. You may now ask your question.
William Stein: Great, thanks for taking my questions and good morning, everyone. First Kurt, there's a couple of areas in Automotive that you haven't highlighted, that one of which I think is already ramping and another one is more of a future. But I think we'd love to hear an update on the Battery Management Systems progress? And also the S32G network processor, any design win traction that talk of there? And then I do have a follow-up if I can.
Kurt Sievers: Yes, thanks, Will. Absolutely, and by the way, by not mentioning them, doesn't mean that they don't do what they should do. So the Battery Management is actually very, very nicely on track, especially this year. Since in the meantime, I think, it's fair to say it all looks like that the pandemic as unfortunate as it is, but it seems to further push the share of electrification. So just from a run rate perspective, from a new model launch perspective, it all looks like that electric drive trains are benefiting from the pandemic over the next period of time. And given our very, very strong position with the leading European OEM as you know, and I would say very nicely growing position in – with a lot of different customers in, especially in China, we enjoying that very much. So I'd say very much on track. I was actually surprised you didn't ask one question in that context, which is the combination of ADI and Maxim as a competitor. But let me just mention it here, because it all looks like that our superior value proposition of a system approach, including the micro, is again something which is matched by that deal as it looks to us. So very nicely on track. The other one you mentioned is the S32G. So that's the 16 FinFET-based gateway processor, on track, launching and ramping in production next year. I just have to hold your horses a little bit. Very likely in the next, maybe three or four months, we are going to come out with a press release with a pretty prominent customer which is going to give you then further evidence there and in which model and with which volume this solution is going to ramp. I mean, it's a much broader basis, but there is one very prominent one, which I hope we can actually announce in the coming period.
William Stein: I appreciate that. And if I can get a follow-up perhaps of Peter, a lot of companies raised capital to improve liquidity, in sort of the March, April timeframe, perhaps as NXP did. Some of them have since sort of reverted back and repaid some debt to perhaps consider that maybe that level of liquidity is no longer needed. Is NXP contemplating this, are you planning to run at the elevated liquidity level for awhile? Thank you.
Peter Kelly: Yes, to be honest, irrespective of the COVID crisis, I would have gone out and taken that debt anyway, because it's to pay down the 2021. It's about $1.4 billion note. So in the coming months when we think it's the right time, we'll pay it down. But it was always planned to use it for that and a little bit of the 2022. So that's what we'll use it for, yes. 
William Stein: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. You may now ask your question.
Toshiya Hari: Good morning. And thanks very much for taking the question. I wanted to ask on the mobile business. Obviously, you guys are operating in a fairly challenging environment with smartphone units declining strong double digits. You do seem to be outperforming the market. I guess, if you can speak to what you're seeing from a mobile wallet adoption perspective, that would be very helpful. And if you can speak to your opportunity set as it relates to ultra-wideband going into the second half, and more importantly into 2021, that'd be helpful as well. And I've got a quick follow-up. Thank you.
Kurt Sievers: Yes. Thanks for the question. Great question. Indeed, we also see and believe we are outgrowing. And indeed, this is very much about content and attachment rates rather than mobile unit run rates. The two key drivers for growth going into the third quarter and the second half in Mobile is indeed ultra-wideband, as I briefly mentioned before. But it's also inside the mobile wallet with one of our very leading customers in that space, we have actually a change of the system architecture. And that change impacts the Silicon dollar content, which we are shipping into the solution. It's actually nicely growing with a change. So the growth, the sequential growth, which you are seeing is the new additional of untra-wideband, and it is a higher content of silicon in the mobile wallet. And thirdly, it is the attach rate of mobile wallet per se, which is going up. And that was the other part of your question. So the mobile wallet attach rates are on track to the 50% mark in the next year. And maybe a little bit more anecdotally at this point, but it feels to us that the pandemic is giving also a boost to contactless payments in those countries on the globe, where there has been a much lower attachment rate so far because people haven't really accepted it yet. So it is actually another one which seems to be a little bit early to make that call too firm, but they seem to be also helped by the by the pandemic. So three drivers in mobile, higher silicon content in the solution for the mobile wallet, the attach rate of the wallet going up, and thirdly, ultra wide bands.
Toshiya Hari: Great. And as my follow-up I wanted to ask on the competitive landscape. Kurt, I think, you guys have in the past talked about NXP potentially being a beneficiary of the U.S.-China trade tensions. I realize share gains take a long time, probably take years in your business. But from a customer engagement perspective, are you seeing any change for the better for NXP? Thank you.
Kurt Sievers: It keeps being a door opener very clearly, so we are seen as a European company, we are a European company and in doing business with China. And that is it's definitely a positive lever into engagements. So as you said, I mean, even in fast moving market design wins takes time, but it is clearly a positive for us. Yes.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays. You may ask your question.
Tom O'Malley: Hey guys, this is Tom O'Malley on for Blayne Curtis. I just wanted to ask quickly on competition in UWB. Apple has their own. In Android, do you see anyone entering the market or any increase in competition there, or is this really just a discussion of attach rates going forward?
Kurt Sievers: Hi, Tom, great question. I think ultra-wideband across ecosystems is very, very much of a deep system play. So it is not about this one, RFIC, it is actually about the combination of the RFIC as secure elements. So in all the applications, which we are starting to ship now, it always comes together with a hardware secure element and the associated software. So that's a triangle combination of software, hardware, secure elements and RFIC. That is actually what gives us the differentiation and which, I believe, is also a pretty high hurdle for competitors.  So if you only look at this from an RFIC perspective, it's probably not such a big deal over many years to make a competitive product. But for the whole solution to be shipped, it's a big deal. And that's where we have to lead.
Tom O'Malley: Okay, that's helpful. And then just a broader one following-up on John's question earlier, and really in your prepared marks, you called out China specifically. Obviously, I assume a portion of that is the automotive coming back and some industrial as well. But could you kind of size where that benefit came in? Was it more on the auto side or more on the industrial and IoT side?
Kurt Sievers: Well from a – are you asking for Q2 or for the guidance into Q3?
Tom O'Malley: Both would be helpful. But you made the comment, I think, on Q2 and going into Q3, so whatever you can give on both.
Kurt Sievers: Okay. 
Tom O'Malley: Well I want Q2.
Kurt Sievers: Yes. Yes, clearly on Q2, China was a big factor across the board. And that's simply because the pandemic – I mean, it has had like a phased shift. So China has seen the biggest impact from the pandemic in Q1 already and then a pretty good recovery in Q2, while Europe and the U.S. have been essentially shutdown for the earlier part of Q2. Now, if you go into Q3, it is actually more broad based. So the auto recovery, for example, the 20% quarter-on-quarter, that's not just China. I mean, this is really across the Board. So we do see auto recovery, especially I would say, from a sequential perspective in U.S., in Europe and also starting in Japan, because those are the places where the shutdowns were in Q2.
Tom O'Malley: Thanks a lot.
Jeff Palmer: Operator, we have time for probably one more question today.
Operator: Your last question comes from the line of Chris Caso with Raymond James. You may now ask your question.
Chris Caso: Yes, thank you. Good morning. The question is with regard to the buyback perhaps you could talk about what the plans are there and what would be the criteria for doing some resumption?
Peter Kelly: You want to take that?
Kurt Sievers: No I guess that’s for you.
Peter Kelly: We will restart the buyback when we get to a ratio of two times net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. So we run 2.2. In Q2, we'll be on a 2.3, 2.4 in Q3. So it's going to be a while before we see the buybacks restart again. But it's when our net debt levels will return to two times. 
Chris Caso: Got it. That's clear. Thank you. Just to follow-up with regard to some of the comments you made about production and getting utilization back up and getting to your inventory target, do you have a timeframe in mind when – and obviously this is dependent on demand, but absent a inflection in demand, how long does it take at these utilization rates to get to your inventory targets internally?
Kurt Sievers: Well, we get down to 100 in Q3 trying to get to 95. So it's at these utilization levels, assuming revenue is okay, it's pretty easy at this point to get down to 95.
Chris Caso: Right. So by the end of the year, for sure.
Kurt Sievers: Yes, I would think so, yes.
Chris Caso: Got it. That's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: I would now like to turn the conference back to company.
Jeff Palmer: Great. Thank you, gentlemen. Thank you everyone for your interest and your time today. Not sure Kurt, if you had any last moment remarks you'd like to make before we sign off today.
Kurt Sievers: Yes, thanks Jeff. So let me thank everybody for your attention today. I think it's indeed a good moment now, because it all looks like that Q2 was the trough. We do see growth going forward across our businesses, across the regions. And I feel good about this because it is clearly a mix of recovery of the markets, but at the same time playing out of our company specific drivers, which is most important for us to win market share going forward. At the same time, we still treat this very cautiously which means from a OpEx spend perspective, from an inventory perspective, from all the factors which are under our direct control, we're going to stay very, very vigilant as we've done over the past period. And with that, I thank you all and speak to you next time. Thank you.
Peter Kelly: Thank you all.
Operator: Well, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-04-28 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the NXP Semiconductors First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants’ lines are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your speaker today, Rick Clemmer, CEO. Thank you and please go ahead, sir.
Jeff Palmer: Yeah, thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the NXP Semiconductors first quarter 2020 earnings call. With me on the call today from the far corners of the world is Rick Clemmer, NXP’s CEO; Kurt Sievers, NXP’s President; Peter Kelly, our CFO. We’re all in remote locations today. So if there is any delay in responding to questions, please bear with us. The call today is being recorded and will be available for replay from our corporate website. Today’s call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause NXP’s results to differ materially from management’s current expectations. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, the macroeconomic impact on the specific end-markets in which we operate, the sale of new and existing products, and our expectations for the financial results for the second quarter of 2020. Please be reminded that NXP undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements. For a full disclosure on forward-looking statements, please refer to our press release. Additionally, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are driven primarily by discrete events that management does not consider to be directly related to NXP’s underlying core operating performance. Pursuant to Regulation G, NXP has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our first quarter 2020 earnings press release, which will be furnished to the SEC on Form 8-K and is available on NXP’s website in the Investor Relations section at nxp.com. Now, I’d like to pass it over to Rick Clemmer.
Kurt Sievers: Rick, are you on mute? So there might be a problem with Rick’s connection. So this is Kurt, Kurt Sievers. I will take over from Rick, such that we can get started swiftly. So once again, thanks, Jeff, and good day everybody on the call. The last several months has been one of the most disruptive periods in the semiconductor industry. But throughout this current period of widespread and unprecedented disruption due to the COVID-19 virus, we’ve never been as proud as now as of our entire NXP team. They are collectively demonstrating and living our core values during this challenging time as we continue to work supply our customers and continue to focus on the development of our key programs. We have put a dedicated team in place to focus on the safety of our employees and the management, and how our employees can work effectively, remotely and safely on site when necessary.
Rick Clemmer: Kurt, I’m back on.
Kurt Sievers: All right. So, Rick, will you take over?
Rick Clemmer: Yeah, yes, please.
Kurt Sievers: All right, thanks, Rick.
Rick Clemmer: Thank you. While NXP has long been geographically diverse, we now have over 12,000 of our worldwide team including 90% plus of our indirect employees that are not in manufacturing, working from home or just recently returned from working from home in China and Korea. Daily our employees are taking initiatives, intentionally collaborating and focusing on delighting our customers. I am heartened to see the genuine engaged curiosity, their desire to solve problems and everyone looking to drive positive outcomes in the respective areas of expertise, and through this all displaying a sense of confidence that we will all successfully get through this. NXP is structured to adapt, to respond to unknown challenges and to support its people. As an example, our team members are ensuring that our customers in the healthcare and medical areas have critical MCU and center products to enable the increased production of respirators and other related medical equipment, though this is not a sufficient amount of revenue. Globally, we are donating PPE material, where it is needed and providing laptops to students, NGOs and nursing home patients. Our team members are also independently raising funds and donating back in their local communities to help the less privileged. For an operational perspective, all of our manufacturing facilities are up and running. Although, we did previously have some limited government ordered closures. Our manufacturing plant in China has continued to operate through the entire period. We have not experienced any major virus related supply issues. We have been extremely fortunate that the virus has not materially impacted our broad employee base. We will continue to closely monitor all government orders and take a cautious approach to allowing the employees to return from working from home. The safety of our employees remains our top priority. Therefore, we will not rush to return to the opening, so that we can limit the number of employees on site, allowing for continued social distancing, especially where we have manufacturing and other operations combined on a single site. Turning to how we view the current business environment. This crisis is unlike anything previously experienced by the semiconductor industry with rapid changing characteristics, making it hard to identify true demand indicators. We will continue, as we have always done in the past, to share information openly to enable all of our stakeholders to understand the conditions that we are operating. We currently find ourselves attempting to make accurate projections of true OEM customer demand. This is especially true in global automotive markets, where we have gone to our customers and worked with them to reduce their demand signals to more accurately reflect true auto-OEM requirements. In North America and Europe, automotive OEM and tier 1 suppliers currently have full or partial factory shutdowns and extended supply chains, although, they are beginning to identify plans for reopening. It is easy to completely focus on dramatic and negative impacts of the virus. However, we must also be aware of and [Technical Difficulty].
Kurt Sievers: It seems that Rick’s line is broken again. I will pick up here. It’s easy to completely focus on the dramatic and negative impacts of the virus. However, we must also be aware and ensure that we do not miss possible opportunities. And as a good example, it’s good to see that in the last 2 weeks, data for car sales in China show they are above the same period last year. We also hear reports of people buying their first vehicle, as they do not want to go back to mass transit with the fear overhang from the virus. However, the reopening of the tier 1 and OEM manufacturing plants continues to be uncertain. And it is this significant uncertainty that is making our planning so difficult right now. At the same time, the demand environment in China has clearly improved in the industrial and mobile end-markets. We are encouraged with the increase in distribution sell-through in the recent weeks and we will continue to closely monitor the sustainability of these trends. A big question though is the impact from the economic weakness throughout the rest of the world on consumption, and hence the ultimate impact it may have on demand in China. Considering all of these indicators thus create conflicting signals, we are attempting to maximize our flexibility to ensure that we adequately support our customers’ true demand, while at the same time reducing our manufacturing supply risk and ultimately avoiding excess inventory. Now, more than ever, maintaining close constant communications with our customers is really critical through the balance of our supply chain. We are cautiously optimistic as we see early Q3 demand trends, which indicate a slightly sequential improvement, combined with the benefits from the planned ramp of NXP specific programs. During any economic downturn, investor attention always turns to the sustainability or robustness of the company’s financial performance. For those of you who have followed NXP for some time now, we view one of our inherent stills as keeping as steady hands on the financial and operational levers we can control. We are not unemotional, but in challenging times like this we are the cultural bias towards cost consciousness. We are not making knee-jerk decisions by taking an active review of all areas of discretionary spending, while simultaneously maintaining critical investments in areas that will assure NXP’s long-term success. Our business model is solid, and we continue to have ample financial liquidity and strength to weather the current unpredictable environment. In closing, we are extremely proud of the adaptability of all our teams during this challenging period. And we will continue to succeed and our focus on driving positive results for all of our stakeholders. And at this point, I move on actually to what is my original script here, so that was Rick’s part. And I will start to review the specifics of our quarter 1 results, and at the same time, provide an outlook for quarter 2. We find ourselves navigating a really, really fluid and challenging period due to the COVID-19 virus. As the year began, we had an incrementally positive outlook for 2020, as customer reactions and engagement with our NXP portfolio and product roadmap continue to be really positive. However, as the breadth of COVID-19 virus impact evolved in mid-February, we did find shifting from dealing with what we assumed were temporary supply chain disruptions post Chinese Lunar New Year. And we had to adapt to a much wider, more disruptive broad-base of shutdowns of our customers manufacturing facilities increasingly also outside China. This has had a direct ripple effect throughout supply chains we are exposed to, while this is making our short-term outlook more uncertain. We do continue to execute consistently to our long-term strategy, deeply engaged with the sharp focus on enabling our customer success albeit from a virtual distance. Let me turn to our results. Q1 revenue came in below our original guidance. Many of the automotive OEMs initiated factory shutdowns, combined with order push outs from both industrial and mobile customers. Taken together, NXP delivered revenue of $2.02 billion, about $204 million dollars below the midpoint of our original guidance range. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 24.8%, about 280 basis points below guidance, as a result of lower operating profit flow through on the reduced revenue levels. Let me turn to the specific trends in our focus end markets. Starting with automotive. Revenue in automotive was $994 million, down 4% versus the year ago and showing 9% sequential decline. In industrial & IoT, our revenue was $376 million, up 2% versus the year ago period, and down 9% sequentially. In mobile, revenue was $247 million, up 2% versus the year ago period and down 26% sequentially. And lastly, communication infrastructure and other, our revenue was $404 million, down 10% year-on-year and 12% sequentially. Now before I’m turning to the specifics of our quarter 2 expectations, I’d like to make a few comments. Our revenue guidance range for Q2 is wider than normal, which is a reflection of what we view as an uncertain and highly fluid demand environment. We will provide as much transparency as possible, while we are cognizant that our ability to accurately predict the future is limited. As I said before, many of the ultimate end customers of our products like the automotive OEMs in Europe and North America are still partially closed, but just coming gradually back to work. Therefore, the customer demand signals which we rely on throughout the supply chain need to be recalibrated to true end market demand. We are anticipating this recalibration should occur over the next few months. From a positive viewpoint, the supply chain inventory rationalization trends, we witnessed through 2019 have essentially played out, both with our direct customers and also those served through global distribution. And therefore, once we begin to see demand signals recalibrated to our end customers, we are assuming there should not be a significant lag effect due to any excess supply chain inventory. And we have continued to apply the highest discipline to our distributor channel inventory, as we held back about $150 million of shipments to distributors during the first quarter. And this is in order to maintain our target channel inventory metric of 2.4 months of supply. With that preamble, we are guiding quarter 2 revenue at $1.8 billion, down about 19% versus quarter 2, 2019, within the range of down 14% to 23% year-on-year. From a sequential perspective, this represents a decline of about 11% at the midpoint versus the prior quarter. At the midpoint, we are anticipating the following year-on-year trends in our business. Automotive is expected to be down about 30% versus quarter 2, 2019 and down in the high-20% range versus quarter 1, 2020. Industrial & IoT is expected to be up low-single-digits versus quarter 2, 2019, and up mid-single-digits versus quarter 1, 2020. Mobile is expected to be down at the mid-teens range versus quarter 2, 2019, and up low-single-digits versus quarter 1, 2020. And finally, communication, infrastructure and other is expected to be down in the mid-teens range versus quarter 2, 2019, and up mid-single-digits versus quarter 1, 2020. In summary, this is an unprecedented period of society for our industry, for our customers, and for NXP. Our number 1 priority is to assure the health and the safety of all our NXP team members, while facilitating the best possible business continuity with the customer focus on supply chain and R&D execution. We are extremely proud of the huge engagement and flexibility of all NXP employees. And as I previously mentioned, we do not have any unique insights as to when this challenging period will subside, but we do continue to have ample financial liquidity and strength to weather the current environment. While we are actively reviewing all areas of discretionary spending, we do continue to maintain critical investments in the areas that will assure NXP’s long-term success in our chosen strategy. Our focused investments in leading-edge new products and customer engagements in fast growing segments such as ADAS and automotive electrification, in secure connected edge processing for the IoT, in the secure ultra-wideband, are all very durable and enjoy significant design interaction. Once this pandemic is under control, NXP will emerge strongly and will resume its growth within it strategic focus areas, consistent with our prior long-term expectations. We execute consistently and we are committed to our long-term strategy. And we continue to be deeply engaged with and sharply focused on enabling our customers’ success. And at this point, I would like to pass the call to Peter for review of our financial performance. Peter?
Peter Kelly: Thank you, Kurt, and good morning to everyone on today’s call. As Kurt already covered the drivers of the revenue during the quarter and provided our revenue outlook for the second quarter. I’ll move to the financial highlights. In summary, our Q1 revenue performance was well below what we planned as a result of the COVID virus. As the world struggled to cope with a significant disruption the virus caused, we saw approximately $200 million of our revenue disappear from the quarter. This significant reduction to revenue fell through to non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP operating profit with the fall through on gross margin slightly offset with the operating profit level by reduction in OpEx, a truly stunning turn of events. Now moving to the details of the first quarter, total revenue was $2.02 billion, down 3% year-on-year, and $204 million below the midpoint of our original guidance. We generated $1.05 billion in non-GAAP gross profit and reported a non-GAAP gross margin of 51.8%, down about 90 basis points year-on-year and 140 basis points below the midpoint of our guidance. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $545 million, essentially flat year-on-year and better by $18 million from the fourth quarter. This was $28 million below the midpoint of our guidance. From a total operating profit perspective, non-GAAP operating profit was $502 million and non-GAAP operating margin was 24.8%, down about 190 basis points year-on-year, as a result of the lower revenue. Non-GAAP financial expense was $75 million, cash taxes from ongoing operations were $28 million, and non-controlling interest were $8 million, all slightly better than our guidance. Stock based compensation, which is not included in our non-GAAP earnings, was $107 million. Now I’d like to turn to the changes in our cash and debt. Our total debt at the end of the first quarter was $7.37 billion, flat sequentially and our ending cash position was $1.08 billion, up $34 million. The resulting net debt was $6.29 billion, and we exited the quarter with a trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA of $3.05 billion. Our ratio of net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of Q1 was 2.1 times, and our non-GAAP trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA net interest coverage was 9.6 times. As you all know, I typically say that our balance sheet is very strong and our liquidity is excellent. We are proud to the fact that we’re an investment-grade company. We achieved this by having a business that generates significant cash by having a very large revenue stream and by having strong financial discipline, including not extending ourselves when things look rosy. I’m really pleased to say that this exactly the environment, when having a strong business model and financial discipline pays off. So we continue to have a strong balance sheet and we have excellent liquidity and access the markets that a strong investment-grade company has. During the first quarter, we paid $105 million in cash dividends and repurchased $355 million of our shares. You’ll have noted a small increase in our leverage in Q1 over Q4. This is driven by reduction of trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA, and our leverage will increase again in Q2 to 2.2 times driven by our latest guidance for the quarter. As such, we’ll temporarily suspend our buyback until our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA ratio improved to the level, where we can once again be at the 2 times leverage ratio. We will in the meantime continue to pay our quarterly dividend. Turning to working capital metrics, days of inventory was 113 days, an increase of 11 days sequentially as revenue levels declined. We continue to closely monitor our distribution channel with inventory in the channel of 2.4 months, definitely within our long-term target. As Kurt noted, we held back about $150 million of orders into distribution to ensure our channel inventory metrics remained within our target range. Days receivable were 28 days, up 2 days sequentially. And days payable were 83 days, an increase of 2 days versus the prior quarter. Taken together, our cash conversion cycle was 58 days, an increase of 11 days versus the prior quarter. Cash flow from operations was $512 million and net CapEx was $143 million, resulting in non-GAAP free cash flow of $369 million. Turning to our expectations for the second quarter, as Kurt mentioned, we anticipate second quarter revenue to be about $1.8 billion, plus or minus about $100 million. A wider than normal range considering the uncertain environment we are navigating. At the midpoint, this is down 19% year-on-year and down 11% sequentially. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be about 48%, plus or minus 100 basis points. Operating expenses are expected to be about $523 million, plus or minus about $5 million, and taken together, we see non-GAAP operating margin to be about 19%, plus or minus about 240 basis points. We estimate non-GAAP financial expense to be about $82 million and anticipate cash tax related to ongoing operations to be about $17 million. Non-controlling interest will be about $6 million. Finally, I have a few closing comments I’d like to make. Firstly, our gross margin looks weak for the second quarter. About half of the drop is explained by the reduction in revenue and the other half is a result of the fact that we’ll be running our internal fabs at utilization of approximately 50%. At this level of utilization, we take additional fixed cost charges in quarter, rather than carry them through in inventory to the third quarter. As the global economy starts to correct itself and our revenue reaccelerates, we see no reason why we cannot hit our 55% gross margin target at the $2.4 billion level of quarterly revenue. Secondly, we are closely managing our cash and feel comfortable. We will continue to generate cash even in this extremely low revenue level. As part of this, we’ve taken down the utilization of our internal factories and are working with our external partners to manage our purchases with them. In fact, the bigger part of the reduction in wafers for this quarter has fallen on our internal fabs. Thirdly, we will continue – carefully manage OpEx levels and minimize any variable costs, and in particular incentive payments. Finally, these are very difficult times. And along with Rick and Kurt, I’d like to thank all my colleagues around the world for the commitment to NXP and doing the right thing for our customers. The current period is unprecedented and is extremely difficult. But for the long run, NXP has the right strategy, is in the right markets and has the right products to win. Before we turn to your questions, I’d like to pass the call back to Kurt for a moment.
Kurt Sievers: Yeah, thanks much, Peter. And I can just also notify everybody that Rick is back on the call now. Before we are moving on to Q&A, I still would like to take the opportunity to express my deep gratitude to Rick. And that is both on behalf of NXP, but also very much personally. Rick, this appears to be your last NXP earnings call in your capacity as CEO of the company. You have successfully led NXP since being appointed President and CEO back in 2009. And under your leadership, NXP has transformed into a profitable high-performance mixed-signal leader, definitely with the NXP/Freescale merger as a very remarkable milestone. And I want to thank you for your many years of hard work, and much more importantly, for your personal dedication and commitment building NXP into the industry leader we are today. And since I personally served for the last 10 years as a member of your NXP executive management team, I especially like to thank you for your deep trust and for everything I’ve been privileged to learn from you. In my eyes, in my view, you personally embody the NXP culture of a customer-focused passion to win, and that along with great business acumen and very thoughtful leadership. Given all of that, I am particularly glad and thankful that NXP and I can count on your continued support as a strong and close strategy advisor for the time to come. Thank you once again. And with that, operator, we open the call for questions please.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Your line is now open.
Stacy Rasgon: About the $150 million that you didn’t ship in the quarter, can you give us some feeling for how that splits up by end-market? What you’re expecting to do with channel inventories into Q2? And if you can give us some color maybe on what the sell-in versus sell-out was in the quarter into the channel, that’d be really helpful.
Rick Clemmer: Thanks, Stacy. So the $150 million that we had orders for from our DiSTI partners that we chose not to ship to be sure that we maintained our distribution inventory at the 2.4 months was probably a higher concentration of industrial, but it was across the board in all areas, so I can’t really give you the details. But I would tell you it has a concentration more on the industrial side and probably less on the other areas. Our intent is, is to continue to maintain the 2.4 months of inventory. We learned our lesson several years ago associated with this. And we’re trying to be sure that we maintain that position and control our inventory commitment into the channel. So we’re actively, as we talked about in the script, working with our customers to be sure that they adjust their demand signals, to be sure that we do not increase just the inventory or the work-in-process inventory with our OEM customers either.
Stacy Rasgon: Got it. Thank you. And for my follow-up, I understand the auto decline obvious in the Q2, but what’s driving the sequential increases in the rest of those businesses. It sounds like it’s not – it sounds like you don’t think it’s pull forward, just given your commentary on the channel inventory just now. Let me know if that is correct and if you could give us any color on what’s driving that sequential demand in the other segments that would be super helpful.
Rick Clemmer: Sure. So it clearly is not any pull-forward that we see. It’s based on orders from our customers. On the sequential basis, in Q2, we’re up – or sorry, down 11% in total, but actually down 27% in automotive, while we’re up 6% in industrial & IoT, and 5% in comms and infra, and slightly up in mobile. The industrial is we – as we said in the script, we’ve actually seen some strength in China in the sell-through. Clearly, Europe continues to be fairly weak and the U.S. is also pretty weak, although maybe a little bit of glimmers of improvement in the U.S. But clearly the key indicator on the industrial side for Q2 is in our China sell-through and really what gives us confidence in being able to achieve the 6% sequential growth in the industrial & IoT. And some of that includes some of our new product deployments as well, Stacy.
Stacy Rasgon: Got it. Thank you very much. Good luck, guys.
Rick Clemmer: Thanks. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Your line is now open.
Vivek Arya: Thank you for taking my question, and congrats to Kurt on the new role, and best wishes to Rick on his next adventure. Plus, it has been great to work with you. For my first question, I wanted to just dig into the automotive market. I think for Q2 you mentioned automotive sales potentially down about 30%. That is obviously much better than some of the unit trends over – down over 40% year-on-year. Could you give us some sense of how you are seeing the unit and the content parts of your business played throughout Q2? And importantly, do you think Q2 can mark the trough in your autos business? Because I recall Kurt you saying that Q3 could be up slightly sequentially, so does that imply that Q2 is perhaps the trough in your autos business. So just some more color in auto customer engagements would be very helpful.
Rick Clemmer: Thanks, Vivek. This is Rick. Kurt, I’ll let you take that.
Kurt Sievers: Yes, thanks, Vivek. So, yes, we have a careful view that Q3 should be slightly up over Q2. Now, if you think about automotives specifically, mind you that you can never really track the SAR on the quarterly basis back to our business. There is too much going on in the supply chains and especially these days. So it doesn’t really work that you take the quarter 2 prospective car production, if anybody knows it at all, and hold that back to our revenue. So, our revenue for cars in automotive for the second quarter is really just the result of a very careful alignment with our main customers on mostly very application-specific products. So it’s really just the backlog alignment more than anything else. It’s not really tied to the SAR in that sense. But still what is important in this period of uncertainty, we do absolutely believe that the content increase story holds, so that continues also through this period. Secondly, what we have seen in the reports from IHS is that the premium cars are actually going down a little bit less than the average car, which is possibly good for the mix, given the fact that there is obviously more semiconductors in premium cars. This is a very broad statement. We cannot tie it back to any specific model or any specific product of ours. But that probably is a trend as long as we can see it now. Finally, of the SAR itself, we continue to use IHS as the guideline. They just came out actually on April 27, so very fresh with the latest forecast, which is a 22% decline for the year, where indeed they sharply see the biggest year-on-year decline in the second quarter. So for the car production, I would support what you are saying, but again, you cannot one on one connect this to our revenue.
Vivek Arya: Got it. And then, for my follow-up, maybe, Peter, one on gross margins, so clearly, I think you explained the drivers for Q2, for gross margins to get towards 48% or so. So, sort of a similar question to the first one, do you think if, let’s say all else being equal, if you start to see some revenue rebound in Q3, that have we kind of seen the trough in gross margins? What’s on your dashboard to kind of look at the trajectory of gross margins over the next handful of quarters? Thank you.
Peter Kelly: To be honest, right now when you saw it from the range we gave of revenue, plus or minus $100 million on Q2. It’s difficult to really speculate on where we might be in Q3, Q4. As Rick mentioned in this speech, we think we’ll be up slightly. I would hope this would be the trough on gross margin, but it really depends on how we – right now at these levels, how we load off our fabs. So I think it’s going to be a tough couple of quarters from a gross margin perspective. I think the main thing for me is – and maybe this is where you’re really going is, as we move up more strongly and we get back to the $2.4 billion level, I don’t think anything is changed in terms of the structural part of our business. And I still have great confidence we can get to the 55% level in a more normal market. So as our revenue comes back, yeah, our gross margin will go up.
Vivek Arya: Thank you.
Rick Clemmer: Thanks, Vivek.
Operator: Thank you. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
John Pitzer: Yeah, good morning, guys. Thanks for let me ask the question. First, Rick, I just want to thank you for all the help you’ve given me personally over the last decade. I really appreciate that. Now it’s been an interesting 10 years. But relative to my kind of first question, I’m just kind of curious, you used the term recalibrating of demand signals a couple of times when talking about the June guidance. I’m just kind of curious to what extent is the June guide kind of a top-down view of the world from you versus a bottoms-up view, i.e., are your customer bookings actually still coming in the stronger than you would have expected given the demand destruction that’s likely. And if so, how are you able to kind of undership to what customers want to prevent inventory?
Rick Clemmer: Well, John, first off, thanks for your comment. It’s been fun for the last decade. So on the demand signals, I think, what we’re really trying to communicate is as we look at the Tier 1s, and obviously the car factory is actually being shut down as well as a lot of the Tier 1. The demand signals haven’t been adjusted as much as they should have been. And so we kind of took the lead from the industry viewpoint and going back to our customers, and aggressively working with them to modify their demand signals to really more accurately reflect the production levels that were taking place. So our intent is to be sure that we’ve tried to minimize any inventory or work-in-process inventory builds throughout the process on the OEM side. We’re doing the same thing with our distribution partners. Everyone is struggling to get their hands on what the real demand is with the highly fluid levels of inputs and how things move. But we’ve aggressively worked with our customers, both OEM as well as even with our distribution partners to really modify their demand signals. We talked about we could have shipped another $150 million or more to distribution partners in Q1 based on the orders we had, and we chose not to do that. So we didn’t increase our inventory levels in the distribution channel. So our focus is really ensuring that we maintain the right kind of work-in-process inventory levels as we go through this process, not to build up the historic semiconductor industry levels that has happened frequently in the past in the industry.
John Pitzer: That’s helpful, guys. And just my follow-up, Kurt, I know you guys are only officially guiding 90 days out, but you’re cautiously optimistic commentary around Q3 potentially being up modestly sequentially. Is that mostly an automotive view? Or is that happening across all of your end markets? And in your prepared comments, you talked about kind of company specific drivers behind that in addition to just sort of general industry recovery. Wondering if you could elaborate on those company specific drivers?
Kurt Sievers: Yes, John, I’m happy to do so. So first of all, let me just clarify, indeed, the comment about the Q3 slightly up over Q2 is a comment for the entire company, so integrally for the company. I’d say the main reason, which gives us some confidence to make the statement is product customer combination specific drivers, where we have design wins, which are either starting to ramp or starting to quickly go up, when they had started to ramp a little bit earlier already. So I’d say that’s the main element, which is then across the known applications, which you’re aware of. So clearly in automotive, I continue to emphasize radar and battery management being in here. Clearly, in IoT, industrial, I would say our crossover processes now more and more along with the connectivity. You remember the assets, which we bought from Marvell is playing out nicely together. And in mobile, we have an unbroken continuation of the attach rate or the growth in the attach rates of our mobile wallet. So these are the elements, which actually are behind my comments about the Q3 positively slightly up over quarter 2.
John Pitzer: Perfect. Thanks, guys.
Rick Clemmer: Thanks, John.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Ross Seymore: Thanks, guys. We want to also congratulate, Rick, and thank you for all your help over the many years. So I guess, my first question is in the second quarter itself, the non-automotive side being up. I think, Rick, you mentioned that you’re excited about what was happening initially in China for your industrial and IoT segment. But the other kind of 35% – potentially in that quarter, 45% or 40% of the business in mobile and comm., infrastructure. Can you just talk a little bit about what’s going on in those 2 segments to drive the increase sequentially?
Rick Clemmer: Sure. The – in Q2, our comm. and infra is projected to be up about 5% sequentially, but down 15% year-over-year. So I think, we are still in the process of seeing a little bit of improvement in the 5G deployment associated with primarily in China on base stations. And the thing that’s really fluid with that is, is there are still working the specifications and the requirements associated with it. So it really is evolving rapidly. But we see clearly the combination of the businesses that are there, including a little bit of improvement in our network processor area that contributes to that 5% in Q2. In mobile, remember, Q2 a year ago, we had a very strong quarter as Huawei really took the mobile wallet down across their product portfolio. But even with that, we’ll be up slightly in Q2 in the mobile business. So I think, all of that comes back to the fact that, we see some real improvement in China in POS that’s encouraging. And we just have to see how that continues, Ross, as we go forward.
Ross Seymore: Thanks for that. And then, I guess as my follow-up either for you or Kurt, on the automotive side of things, and maybe aligning to, Kurt, what you said for the third quarter maybe being up a bit sequentially for the entire company? I just wanted to dive into the kind of the symmetry of how the automotive plants are shut down around the world? And then when they turn back on, obviously, true end demand at the end of the day is going to drive how your business grows in there? But I just want to see how aligned do you think you are to those factories being turned on and off, especially given the fact that the data points early as they maybe out of China for automotive, as you mentioned, we are positive. Is the third quarter going to improve sequentially in automotive just because of the factories? Hopefully will all be turned on globally at that point? Or does that have to wait until true end demand gives us a sign of just how turned on, they actually are?
Kurt Sievers: Yeah, Ross. It is clearly face shifted, because, obviously, the biggest auto impact in Q1 was in China, while the European and U.S. factory shutdowns literally only started in the second half of March, so at the very, very end of Q1, and now hitting in Q2. So while, I think, it is fair to have some optimism about the industrial automotive activity in quarter 2 in China. It is really, really hard to say how this is going to play out in Europe and the U.S. I mean, just as an example, we all saw in the press that just this Monday. So yesterday, Volkswagen started to manufacture again. I mean, they just in Germany, they just went back to work. To my understanding, not at full capacity, but this is a gradual increase. And I think, nobody really knows exactly what’s the pace of those reopening and to what capacity level they go under which timeframe during the second quarter. But clearly, it looks like the most significant car production impact in the Western world fits them in the beginning of the second quarter, and you have to see how long it takes into the second quarter. And that gets me back to what I think, I quoted earlier about IHS. Clearly, the second quarter is according to IHS then seeing the biggest decline in car production with quite some improvement in quarter 3 from a car production perspective. Now, what Rick said earlier to one of the questions about us being very careful with understanding the end demand, this is exactly coming to this point, Ross, we try to make sure that what we are shipping to our Tier 1 customers in automotive aligns nicely to the real end demand such that we don’t overship, because we learned that lesson 10 years ago. And with that, we should – if we do that right, and we work hard on it, we should then actually not see a long delay when the car production comes up, because we shouldn’t have overship the supply chain.
Ross Seymore: Thank you.
Rick Clemmer: Thanks, Ross.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of William Stein with SunTrust. Your line is now open.
William Stein: Thank you very much for taking my questions. First, I’m hoping you can linger a little bit on the comment about aligning customers’ forecast or going them to ensure their forecast for up to date. Can you help us understand what portion of customers you deal with to get forecast, whether those are the Tier 1s or the OEMs? What portion of those are open, and having these engagements with – over these largely engagements where you work with customers and have a dialogue today? Or is it more a situation or there’s a big chunk of demand is really much more question, because perhaps they’re not even available to take the call.
Rick Clemmer: So Will, I’ll take a shot at it, and then I’ll let Kurt to add. What we found this is sometimes, it’s a little more difficult to communicate with our customers at the Tier 1 level, but I think everyone is working from home. So ultimately, you have the ability to communicate. I think, what we’re really trying to emphasize is that the demand signals they had not been modified for the plant closings, either at their level are at – as they look at their manufacturing facilities are at the actual automotive company leveled itself. And so, obviously, we’ve been trying to push back and actually told them that we were not going to ship parts, and went out pretty aggressively with some unique requirements on orders to be sure that we got as thorough assessment of demand as possible, because we just felt like it was critical not to be shipping orders as they were indicating and building factory that was ultimately not going to be used. So we’ve been very aggressive about that and worked with them and had good response. And I think the key is, as we go through this period of uncertainty and fluidity. We must really have good communications with customers to really know what’s going on, and I think that’s the key as being sure. And we’re able to do that as they work from home. Kurt, please add anything you’d like.
Kurt Sievers: Yeah. I completely second what you were saying, I would just add, Will, indeed, we have worked this very, very closely with the Tier 1 customers. All our large customers there, we have been sitting together over a number of weeks, virtually sitting together. And work this very hard to come to what we jointly believe is a reasonable forecast, which was not their first input. So it is the Tier 1 switch we’ve done it with. They are operational at this point in time. And I think in the end that was a very positive process, because it also helps them in the way forward.
William Stein: Thanks, Kurt. One follow-up, if I can. I’m wondering if you could comment on your ability to continue the pace of innovation when some of the employees are remote and the same relates to your customers, their ability to sort of engaging in new technology evaluations as it relates to your products in this environment? And before I stop, let me just add, my congrats to both of you in your new roles [with that] [ph].
Kurt Sievers: Yeah, Will, I think, that’s actually working amazingly well. And I say that because I had you asked me 8 weeks ago, would that be possible, I probably, would have been much more cautious. But the matter of the fact is that with all of these key customers for us, we have very longstanding and deep relationships, which actually made it relatively easy now to do this perfectly on the remote virtual basis. So a lot of video conference work, but also internally, Rick spoke about this in the beginning, a lot of our engineers are in a work from home situation. We have almost no drops in productivity, which we could measure so far. So things really work and the same way it also works with our customers. But again, I think, it’s a result of the fact that, this is not a new relationship, which has to be built, but we’ve had these relationships for many years in most cases.
Operator: Thank you.
Rick Clemmer: Operator, we’ll take one more question here this morning. Thank you very much.
Operator: Sure. And our last question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore. Your line is now open.
C.J. Muse: Yeah, good morning. Thank you for squeezing me in. I guess, another question back on auto. Can you speak to, I guess, how you’re seeing trends geographically? It sounds like production positive territory for China, but down double-digits in U.S. and Europe. And we’d love to hear kind of how that plays a role into thinking for your auto business growth or decline in calendar 2020? And, I guess, as part of that, how are you thinking about potential for cash for clunker plans into Q3, Q4? And within that, how are you planning perhaps for what the magnitude of recovery could look like if we do indeed get that type of plan?
Kurt Sievers: Let me take a shot at this. So on the cash for clunker programs, I mean, I know as little or as much as you do. So there is a lot of discussion about this, which we are witnessing, I think both in the U.S. as well as in several countries in Europe. I’m not aware of a specific one which is agreed yet. And at least judging from how it did work in 2009, 2010, then it had indeed a pretty significant positive impact. But again, I don’t know more of anyone that would be agreed yet. What I do know is that China has renewed some of the similar programs for battery electric vehicles, which seems to be working. So there is clearly, as we said, not only the car sales and production in China is moving up, but also the trend for electric vehicle specifically seems to look pretty good in China. From a – I mean, we don’t give a full-year guidance and it’s really hard to say what Europe and the U.S. will do. But I think it is indeed fair to say that China seems to be on a positive path at this point, which we have to follow obviously into Q3 and Q4 if it holds. But the beginning of Q2 looks promising I would say.
C.J. Muse: Very helpful. If I could sneak a last one in, can you provide an update on where we are in terms of UWB deployment? Thank you.
Rick Clemmer: Yeah, Kurt, go ahead and…
Kurt Sievers: Ultra-Wide – oh, sorry – yeah, Ultra-Wideband deployment is on track to what we spoken about earlier. So we have the small amount of revenue already running in the automotive space for a keyless entry solution, which is based on Ultra-Wideband. And we continue to work very hard on seeing a mobile deployment in the second half of the year, which would deliver more significant volumes. Traction overall, both in mobile and automotive and further IoT applications is absolutely on track to our earlier expectations. So Ultra-Wideband I would say continues to be really hot. And NXP continues to be in a great leadership position.
C.J. Muse: Very helpful. Thank you.
Rick Clemmer: Thanks, C.J.
Operator: Thank you. And this concludes today’s question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Rick Clemmer, CEO, for closing remarks.
Rick Clemmer: Thank you very much. So it’s with mixed emotions that I am talking to you guys today after 11.5 years with the opportunity to work with team at NXP, and what I believe to be a true industry transformation, where we’re really focused on shareholder value and a customer-focused passion to win, to drive through product leadership. And, Kurt, I wish you the best of luck and really look forward over the next few quarters to support you in continuing to move forward from an NXP viewpoint, as we move out of the current environment, we’re in. Obviously, the current environment is very fluid and very dynamic and clearly creates a lot of mixed signals. We’re currently focused on the challenges that we see, that we want to make sure that we don’t lose sight of the opportunities and the positive trends, specifically those recent trends that we talked about related to China. We know that NXP’s long-term strategy is correct, as we have a very strong portfolio and we’re focused on what we believe are the best markets for auto, industrial, as well as being able to support the mobile wallet, and comms, and infra. We will keep maniacally focused on key development programs and stay highly engaged with our customers, and ensuring that we drive true product leadership and then focus on taking that forward to solutions levels and driving thought leadership with our customers to be able to deploy more efficient solutions. So with that, my final remarks, I appreciate all your support over the years. And I since I know there is a number of NXP team that are on the call as well, I really appreciate all of your support. And it’s been a real honor to work with you over the last 11.5 years. And we’ll continue to look forward to supporting Kurt and the team as we move forward for the next few quarters. Thank you very much.
Kurt Sievers: Thank you…
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-02-04 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2019 NXP Semiconductors Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants’ lines are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Jeff Palmer. Sir, you may begin.
Jeff Palmer: Thank you, Chrystal. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the NXP Semiconductors’ fourth quarter 2019 earnings call. With me on the call today is Rick Clemmer, NXP’s CEO; Kurt Sievers, NXP’s President; Peter Kelly, our CFO. If you’ve not obtained a copy of our earnings press release, it can be found at our Company website under the Investor Relations section at nxp.com. This call is being recorded and will be available for replay from our corporate website. Our call today will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause NXP’s results to differ materially from management’s current expectations. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the macroeconomic impact on the specific end markets in which we operate, the sale of new and existing products, and our expectations for the financial results for the first quarter 2020. Please be reminded that NXP undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements. For a full disclosure on forward-looking statements, please refer to our press release today. Additionally, during our call today, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the impact of purchase price accounting, restructuring, stock-based compensation, impairment, merger-related costs, and other charges that are driven primarily by discrete events that management does not consider to be directly related to NXP’s underlying core operating performance. Pursuant to Regulation G, NXP has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our fourth quarter 2019 earnings press release, which will be furnished to the SEC on Form 8-K and is available on NXP’s website in the Investor Relations section at nxp.com. Now, I’d like to turn the call over to Rick.
Rick Clemmer: Thanks, Jeff, and welcome everyone to our conference call today. NXP delivered full year revenue of $8.9 billion, a decline of 6% year-on-year, against the very challenging semiconductor industry backdrop throughout the year. Even in lower sales volume, we successfully improved our non-GAAP gross margin by 60 basis points and our non-GAAP operating margin by 30 basis points, clearly better operating performance than in previous market downturns. Our free cash flow conversion was solid at $1.9 billion and we continued to follow through on our capital return strategy, returning nearly 95% of free cash flow generated or $1.8 billion to our owners. As a reminder, we have returned $6.8 billion to our shareholders by share buybacks and cash dividends over the last two years, and have reduced the diluted share count by 60 million shares. Kurt will provide more details on the quarterly trends in a few moments. Notwithstanding the semiconductor market environment during 2019, we continued to invest and execute our strategy within our target markets. We have introduced many new products. We’ve been actively engaged with customers on adopting these solutions which we believe will support our long-term growth targets. If you happened to attend our Investor Open House at the CES trade show, you saw a glimpse of how some of these products will be used in real world applications. These included automotive radar solutions, providing improved driver safety; our family of quad-core i.MX processors, which enable new multi-display digital clusters; and our innovative battery management solutions for hybrid and full electric vehicles. We also demonstrated our latest ultra-wideband solutions for secure access and localization with a mobile device for automotive smart home and smart building solutions. Additionally, we showcased multiple new processor families including the i.MX 8M Plus, the first i.MX family to integrate neural-net processing, offering higher performance per dollar than GPU solutions. The RT crossover family for the secure edge computing market, the quad core i.MX 8 for industrial and high-end home automation applications and the high-performance fully ASIL D compliant, S32G for automotive network domain control. Taken together, the wave of new product introductions across the Company and associated customer engagements is truly impressive, and there is more to come over the coming periods. The NXP product portfolio is in its most competitive and innovative position in many years and it’s just beginning to fully reflect the synergy we envisioned when NXP and Freescale merged in 2016. We are confident that as new products ramp into volume production, they will underpin both our top line growth, our longer term gross margin targets, and will yield significant cash flow. Then, as the end markets begin to rebound, which we are beginning to initially see, especially in our automotive and industrial end markets, we anticipate a healthy improvement in our core business, which will also provide positive tailwinds to growth. In summary, as we begin a new year, the team is invigorated and fully engaged. Our strategy continues to yield positive results and the customer response to new product is very encouraging. We will continue to be laser-focused on our strategic end markets engaging with customers to deliver superior and highly differentiated solutions. I’d like now to pass the call over to Kurt to discuss the results of the full year and the current quarter and provide an outlook for Q1.
Kurt Sievers: Thanks very much, Rick, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining the call today. Today, I want to review both, our quarter four as well as our full year 2019 results. Overall, our Q4 results were above the midpoint of our guidance with the contribution from the mobile, automotive and the industrial IoT markets, all stronger than planned, while demand in the comm’s infrastructure market performed as anticipated. Taken together, NXP delivered revenue of $2.3 billion, about $30 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. We did close the acquisition of the Marvell connectivity assets in early December, which was not included in our guidance. The connectivity assets contributed about $6 million of revenue to our quarter four results. Non-GAAP operating margin was a strong 29.9%, about 30 basis points below guidance as a result of closing the Marvell transaction in early December. Now, let me turn to the specific trends in our focused end markets. Starting with automotive. Full-year revenue was $4.2 billion, down 7% year-over-year as a result of lower industry-wide order production and rationalization of the global auto supply chain. Our growth automotive products group year-on-year, primarily due to the ramp of radar and battery management system solutions. During quarter four, our automotive revenue was $1.09 billion, down 1% versus the year-ago period at a lesser rate of decline than in the previous quarters, and showing 5% sequential growth and better than our guidance by $9 million. Included in our quarter four results in automotive was about $1 million associated with the newly acquired Marvell wireless assets. Turning to our industrial & IoT segment. Full year revenue was $1.59 billion, down 12% year-on-year as global trade concerns impacted demand for broad-based general purpose MCU products. The demand trends for our industrial i.MX application processors were flattish on a year-over-year basis. During quarter four, industrial IoT revenue was $415 million, down 5% versus the year-ago period, down 3% sequentially, and $5 million better than our guidance. Included in our quarter four results for industrial & IoT were about $5 million associated with the newly acquired Marvell wireless assets. Turning to mobile. Full-year revenue was $1.19 billion, up 2% year-on-year. During the year, we experienced continued strong adoption of our secure mobile wallet and transit solutions, which was partially offset by anticipated declines in our semi-custom mobile analog interface business. We do estimate the attach rate of mobile wallets increased to about 35%, in line with our expectations and very supportive of our 50% attach rate targets, exiting 2021. During quarter four, mobile revenue was $332 million, down 3% versus the year-ago period, up 3% sequentially and $15 million better than our guidance. Lastly, turning to our comms infrastructure and other business. Full-year revenue was $1.87 billion, up 5% year-over-year. During the year, we experienced robust growth associated with NXP’s RF power products, due to the adoption of the Company’s massive MIMO solutions for the cellular base station markets as mobile carriers began to increase network densification efforts ahead of future 5G cellular deployments. The strength in the cellular base station market was complemented by stabilization in the Company’s communication processor business. However, these positive trends were offsets by year-on-year declines in the Company’s secure bank cards and e-government businesses. During quarter four, revenue was $457 million, down 5% year-over-year, down 3% sequentially, and in line with our guidance. Now, let me turn to our expectations for quarter one. Our guidance reflects what we view as an improved demand environment that is moderately better than we’ve seen over the last number of quarter. It does appear that the channel rationalization trends we witnessed throughout ‘19 have essentially played out, both with our direct customers and those served through global distribution. We are guiding quarter one revenue at $2.23 billion, up about 6% versus the first quarter of 2019, within the range of up 5% to 8% year-on-year. From a sequential perspective, this represents a decline of about 3% at the midpoint versus the prior quarter. At the midpoint, we anticipate the following year-over-year trends in our business for quarter one. Automotive is expected to be up mid single digits versus Q1 ‘19 and down low single digits versus Q4. Industrial IoT is expected to be up in the 20% range versus quarter one ‘19 and up high single digits versus quarter four ‘19. Mobile is expected to be up in the low double digit percent range versus the period a year-ago and down in the high teens versus Q4 ‘19. Please remember, in 2019, the mobile VAS, voice and audio solutions business was $150 million. And finally, communication infrastructure and other is expected to be down in the high single digit range on a percentage basis, both on a year-on-year as well as on a sequential basis. Lastly, our aggregate quarter one guidance does include about $60 million contribution from the acquired Marvell assets. And at the same time, it excludes the mobile VAS business of which we disclosed the divestiture yesterday. For your reference, the mobile VAS business contributed a $150 million in 2019. In summary, our new product introductions, customer engagement levels, and design win momentum in our strategic focus areas continue to be very positive. And we continue to be very optimistic about the mid to long-term potential of NXP. And now, I’d like to pass the call to Peter for review of our financial performance.
Peter Kelly: Good morning to everyone on today’s call. As Kurt already covered the drivers of the revenue during the quarter and provided a revenue outlook for Q1, I’ll move to the financial highlights. In summary, our fourth quarter revenue performance was above the high end of our guidance range with improved non-GAAP gross profit and in line non-GAAP operating profit. I’ll first provide full year highlights and then move to the fourth quarter results. Full-year revenue for 2019 was $8.88 billion, down 6% year-on-year, of which 140 basis points was the elimination of the MSA in 2019 versus 2018. We generated $4.75 billion in non-GAAP gross profit and reported a non-GAAP gross margin of 53.5%, up 60 basis points year-on-year. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $2.18 billion, down $99 million year-on-year. Total non-GAAP operating profit was $2.57 billion and non-GAAP operating margin was 29%, up 30 basis points year-on-year, despite a $530 million drop in revenue versus 2018. Non-GAAP interest expense was $265 million, cash taxes for ongoing operations were $120 million and incidental taxes were $248 million with non-controlling interest of $29 million. Stock-based compensation, which is not included in our non-GAAP earnings, was $346 million. Full-year cash flow highlights include $2.37 billion in cash flow from operations and $503 million in net CapEx investments, resulting in $1.87 billion of non-GAAP free cash flow. During 2019, we repurchased $1.44 billion of our shares and paid cash dividends of $319 million. In total, we returned $1.76 billion to our owners, which was 94% of the total non-GAAP free cash flow generated during the year. We also spent a similar amount on the acquisition of the Marvell assets. Now, moving to details of the fourth quarter. Total revenue was $2.3 billion, down 4% year-on-year at the high end of our guidance range, of which 110 basis points of the decline was the elimination of the MSA. The quarter included $6 million of revenue associated with the acquisition of the Marvell assets, which closed in early December, and which was not included in our guidance. We generated $1.25 billion in non-GAAP gross profits, and reported a non-GAAP gross margin of 54.2%, up 110 basis points year-on-year and in line with the midpoint of our guidance, despite the small headwind created by the Marvell acquisition. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $563 million, up $20 million year-on-year and up $32 million from the third quarter. This was $18 million above the midpoint of our guidance and about $8 million of this was due to the operating cost associated with the Marvell asset acquisition and the majority of the remainder to greater than anticipated new product introduction expenses. From a total operating profit perspective, non-GAAP operating profit was $687 million and non-GAAP operating margin was 29.9%, down 50 basis points year-on-year, driven by lower revenue. Non-GAAP interest expense was $77 million, cash taxes for ongoing operations were $34 million and non-controlling interest was $9 million. Stock-based comp, which is not included in our non-GAAP earnings, was $89 million. Now, I’d like to turn to the changes in our cash and debt. Our total debt at the end of the fourth quarter was $7.37 billion, down $1.14 billion sequentially as we retired the $1.15 billion convertible notes at maturity in early December. Our ending cash position was $1.05 billion, down $2.49 billion due to a combination of the closure of the Marvell assets and the previously noted debt repayment, offset by cash generation during the fourth quarter. The resulting net debt was $6.32 billion, and we exited the quarter with a trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA of $3.1 billion. Our ratio of net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of the fourth quarter was 2 times, and our non-GAAP interest coverage was 8.9 times. Our liquidity is excellent and our balance sheet continues to be very strong. During the fourth quarter, we paid $105 million in cash dividends and repurchased $74 million of our shares. Our capital return policy continues to be to return all excess cash to shareholders. Turning to working capital metrics. Days of inventory was 102 days, an increase of four days sequentially, which was a result of the Marvell acquisition. We continued to closely manage our distribution channel with inventory in the channel at 2.3 months, within our long-term target, but slightly below the 2.4 months we normally expect to run. Days receivables were 26 days, down 6 days sequentially on improved sales linearity and days payable were 81, an increase of 7 days versus the prior quarter. Taken together, our cash conversion cycle was 47 days, an improvement of 9 days versus the prior quarter. Cash flow from operations was $814 million and net CapEx was $138 million, resulting in a non-GAAP free cash flow of $676 million. Turning to our expectations for the first quarter. As Kurt mentioned, we anticipate Q1 revenue to be about $2.23 billion, plus or minus about $30 million. At the midpoint, this is up 6% year-on-year, down 3% sequentially. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be about 53.2%, plus or minus 30 bps. Operating expenses are expected to be about $573 million, plus or minus about $9 million, and taken together, we see non-GAAP operating margin to be about 27.6%, plus or minus about 20 bps. We estimate non-GAAP financial expense to be about $78 million and anticipate cash tax related to ongoing operations to be about $32 million. Non-controlling interest will be about $6 million. As for Q1, we suggest that for your modeling purposes you use average share count of 284.5 million shares. Finally, I have a few closing comments I’d like to make. As both Rick and Kurt pointed out, we see the beginning of a moderately improving demand environment across our end markets with the exception of the 5G base station market. From a revenue perspective, we are pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter. Our revenue is slightly better than guidance with a contribution for the mobile, auto and industrial markets, all a bit stronger than expected. Our results within the communication infrastructure market were essentially in line with our expectations. Our non GAAP gross margin has steadily improved over the last year, even as we’ve navigated a challenging top line demand environment. Our non-GAAP gross margin improved again in fourth quarter and as we have previously signaled, we expect to see modest gross margin compression in the first quarter, based on annual price agreements and lower revenue. We continue to be laser-focused on achieving our intermediate non-GAAP gross margin target of 55% and we continue to believe this can be achieved with the revenue level in the $2.4 billion range. As previously noted, our Board of Directors has approved an additional share repurchase. And with the closure of the Marvell deal in December, we began to repurchase shares again in early January and have bought 1.76 million shares at a cost of $230 million between January the second and February the third. So, with that, I’d now like to turn it back to the operator for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Your line is open. 
Vivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question, and a great job on the free cash flow generation. I think, it’s a record result. My first question, on the China impact, I’m curious if your Q1 outlook bakes any supply or demand impact from the ongoing coronavirus related shutdowns or do you think there could be perhaps a delayed impact on the industry that affects Q2 instead? And if you could remind us of how we think about seasonality for Q2?
Rick Clemmer: So, thanks Vivek. At this time, the situation on the coronavirus continues to be very-fluid and we are monitoring it very closely. We’ve taken actions on travel to protect our employees and in our manufacturing operations to be sure that we have our employees at the forefront of our mind, and also been trying to support the general containment of any spread. But, as of today, we’ve seen no impact in orders, although we’re just coming out of the lunar New Year holiday. Clearly, the forced closures by some of the additional provinces in China add more to the uncertainty. And to be clear, it’s just impossible for us to speculate on the impact and the implications associated with it. Our guidance today does not contemplate any potential impact from the coronavirus.
Vivek Arya: All right. And so, my follow-up on gross margins, so Peter, thanks for giving us that $2.4 billion or so level. What will it take, is it just revenue that is the main driver to get to your, the middle of your 53% to 57% target gross margin range, or is there anything about product or end markets or manufacturing cost or competition that is influencing it? Because when I look at your largest market in automotive, things like BMS that you’re working on, most of your competitors are on the analog side, and they’re making 60%, 70% gross margin. So, it seems to me, when I look at 5G or BMS and autos that -- from that mix perspective, gross margin should be trending in the right direction.
Peter Kelly: I think, there are few things. First of all, Q1 is obviously a very low number, 53.2; it came off the fourth quarter at 54.2, and the change really is we have the annual price agreements -- contractual agreements, pitches. And that’s roughly 60 basis points. And then, volume from Q4 to Q1 -- the revenue decline is probably another 60 basis points. So, that’s offset by the continuing improvement we have in processing and manufacturing performance. So, to go from 53.2 to 55, I think we just need to grow our revenue up to a run rate of about $2.4 billion a quarter. Now, to go from 55 to 57, which I think takes potentially a number of years, I’ll call it mix, but it really is around -- and you highlighted some of it, Vivek. Our new products are coming into place now, particularly in automotive, but also in our crossover products and the like. I don’t think that we’re the type of company that as a traditional analog company that runs 65% gross margin with no real growth. What we’re targeting is, to run well in excess of the market. And we think our model of -- hope to have 57, I think we said 53 to 57 is more realistic look. So, we get to 55 based on volume, 55 to 57 is probably a couple of years out, but it’s based on the mix and the introduction of our new products.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your line is open.
Stacy Rasgon: I wanted to follow up again on the gross margin. So, you’re still saying 55% on 2.4, even with the impact of Marvell. Can you give us, I guess, a ballpark estimate of how dilutive Marvell is by itself? And is this maybe the additional wireless to or mobile divestiture that’s offsetting some of that? Like, how do we think about Marvell in the context of that gross margin target?
Peter Kelly: From a gross margin perspective, Stacy, it’s a rounding error. It’s -- what we talked about it, it’s not a significant part of our revenue just yet. We’ve always said it runs sort of low to mid-50s, I mean, it’s a rounding. I don’t think that really has an impact on our ability to get to 55 or $2.4 billion.
Stacy Rasgon: And the divested mobile businesses, was that also kind of also closer to corporate average gross margins as well, or was that not? 
Peter Kelly: That’s $150 million of revenue. From memory, it might be a little bit below our regular gross margins, but again, it kind of ends up being a rounding really.
Stacy Rasgon: So, my follow-up, I just wanted to talk a little bit about the demand improvement. So, you said especially auto and industrial IoT are rebounding. Do you think this is like real kind of end-demand, like customer pull, or this just an inventory balance, or would you have any way to tell -- like just what are you seeing in the customer channel?
Rick Clemmer: So, what we’re really seeing, Stacy, is out of China, it’s POS. So, it’s actually shipped through the majority of our business in China is shipped through the distribution -- through our distribution partners. But, this is POS where customers have requested business and taken the business. So, it’s not just orders, as far as replenishment of inventory, it’s not possible for us to track what the orders are actually being used for. But, it’s based on their run rates and increased improvements, primarily again focused in micros for the industrial space as well as our automotive business. I’m not sure what the impact or implications, as we said earlier, will be from the coronavirus. But, through just before the lunar New Year, we continue to see strong POS and strong sell-through.
Stacy Rasgon: Got it. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
John Pitzer: Yes. Good morning, guys. Congratulations on a solid results. Rick, Kurt, it’s nice to see you guys get back to year-over-year growth in the March quarter, even excluding the Marvell acquisition. But, my first question is just on the Marvell acquisition. Rick, when you guys announced the deal, you’d put out some pretty, I wouldn’t say aggressive targets, but targets for significant growth of that asset through your distribution business. I know, you’ve given a specific guidance for the calendar first quarter. But, I wonder if you could just level set everybody on the call as to how you feel about sort of the long-term growth of that Marvell asset and how we should think about the yearly sort of revenue levels to get to that $600 million sort of rev target you talked about when you first announced the deal.
Rick Clemmer: So, I think, we still feel as confident about the business as is good business as we talk about, John. It really is about the fact that 60% of our apps processors have connectivity associated with it. So, as we make those reference designs in place, we can obviously provide our own connectivity solutions, which puts us in a good position. The additional distribution feet on the street that we have with the channel, broad channel base we have, we think also positions us quite well. That means that it’s going to be a ramp that will take place as all of that comes to fruition. So, the $600 million out in time, we’ll clearly be growing at a faster rate at the end of that period than it will be this quarter and next year. We feel good about the business and think all of the feedback from customers had been extremely positive about how important it is. And I’ll let Kurt make some comments.
Kurt Sievers: Yes. Thanks, Rick. And let me just add, John. I mean, for those of you who possibly have seen at our booth at CES in Los Vegas a couple of weeks ago, I think we have turned at light speed the availability of the Marvell connectivity assets into reference design. So, we were able at CES just a couple of weeks, actually after the closing the deal to show a number of reference designs, which did include already the Wi-Fi product from the former Marvell, into our reference designs for both automotive infotainment connectivity as well as industrial and IoT applications. And I would just tell you that the interest level and the engagement with customers on that combined solution is as big as we had anticipated.
John Pitzer: That’s helpful. And then, as my follow-up, just looking at your auto business in the calendar fourth quarter, only down slightly year-over-year, which relative to peers appears to be significant outperformance. Kurt, I wondered if you could just comment about how the core business performed in the calendar fourth quarter versus kind of the growth segment? And as you look out over the next couple of years with some of the product-specific drivers you have, do you think your growth rate as a multiple of SAARs improves from what it’s historically been?
Kurt Sievers: Thanks, John. So, on Q4, yes, I think, our decline rate was only a percentage point has significantly improved over the much higher decline rates in the earlier quarters last year. So, absolutely, yes. And clearly, that is a function of what I would say a continued growth of our growth elements, being radar BMS mainly, and I’d say, a good improvement of the core business, which is very much in line with what we have anticipated, given a careful ending of the rationalization of the supply chain. I mean, that’s what we have said all year along that we would hit that point. And that’s also what carries forward into quarter one, which has been reflected with what Rick just said, solid POS trends, especially in China, where that core product is a key part of our revenue. Going forward, John, we totally stick to our model of clearly outgrowing the SAAR, based on the content gains of semis. We gave that guidance of 7% to 10%, based on a 1% to 2% SAAR. So, if the SAAR is flattish, well, maybe then we are at 5%, 6%, 7% or so. And I’d say, the ratio between core and growth initially stays the same. Over time, when the growth portion is getting bigger from a relative perspective, it might still slightly towards higher growth on the toll. But, in principal, we are just seeing now what we have anticipated, which is that the core is more getting back to normal, given the SAAR coming from a minus 6% environment last year into a probably flattish environment this year.
Rick Clemmer: John, one thing, if I could just add to that, if you go back and look at the [indiscernible] we had in our automotive business, which was kind of mid to high single digit earlier in the year, our top tier customers in automotive were actually flat. And where we really saw the significant decline was in the mass market and our distribution partners in automotive. So, that’s where we’re beginning to see the rebound associated with that, where we had such a negative decline in those, and then beginning to see the rest of the business come together. So, it really has to do with that combination. But I thought it’s important to point out that our top tier customers in automotive didn’t really see a significant decline but were actually flat during this period of time.
Operator: Our next question comes from William Stein from SunTrust. Your line is open.
William Stein: Hey, great. Thanks for taking my questions, two. First, Rick, I think at some conferences in last quarter or so, you’ve talked about repurchasing $2 billion plus of shares in the coming year. Can you maybe frame that up relative to your expectations for free cash flow in the coming year, your appetite for raising additional debt in order to keep the net leverage at 2 times, and maybe any appetite on the horizon for similar tuck-in acquisitions like Marvell?
Peter Kelly: Hey Will, it’s Peter. I think, I’d describe it as follows: First of all, the Board’s authorized $2 billion. So, technically, that wasn’t a forecast of how much we spend in the full year, but we just spent $230 million in basically the first six weeks of this quarter. So, once we get started on these things, we don’t tease. What we have said is we will return all excess cash to shareholders, and we will manage our net debt up 2 times trailing 12 months EBITDA. So, depending on your forecast that require us to take on a little bit of extra debt to maintain the leverage. And I won’t give you an absolute number for the full year because it really depends on what you want to forecast for us. But, I think we’re an exciting company. I think, once the market comes back, we’ll see significant growth from us that will drive very, very significant cash flow generation, which will return to our shareholders.
Rick Clemmer: And relative to the other M&A that you asked about, Will, I think the important thing to realize is, we’ve been talking about connectivity being a critical element for us for some time. We actually talked about it going into the Qualcomm transaction. And when the Qualcomm transaction broke, we actually were quite open about the fact that the missing element we had would be connectivity. Clearly, the assets from Marvell put us in a position to have leadership connectivity, which was really the missing element for us. So, yes, I think we’ll do relatively small tuck-in acquisitions for technology, but nothing at the scope and size of Marvell. And clearly, we’ll be focused on how we return cash to our shareholders during this period of time.
William Stein: That’s really helpful. Thank you. If I can have one follow-up, in automotive, I’m hoping you can frame up the timing of the various -- more growthy opportunities. For 2020 and maybe looking into 2021, should we expect the growth to be driven more by the emerging radar solutions, the battery management stuff or the new network domain controllers? Thanks so much.
Kurt Sievers: This is Kurt. Let me try to stage this a little. From a size perspective, it is less by radar, being about 10% of the total auto segment revenue. And we continue to absolutely see our midterm growth here with 25% to 30% compound annual revenue growth. So, that’s the biggest and fastest growing from those. The next one, about the similar size, digital cluster business. So, that follows the trends of multi-screen environments in the passenger cabin of the modern cars, where we see a growth in the mid teens. And then, you have a number of smaller ones, and they are smaller because they are much earlier in the growth cycle. You did mention battery management solutions. This is high-growth, but significantly smaller than the others. But, it does contribute already into the 2020 and 2021 growth. And what you also mentioned is the S32G, which we think had a great show up at CES, which is our new fully ASIL D compliant network processor for the car. That is actually really launching into the market only in 2021. So, from a growth contribution into 2021, I’d say it’s at the late end kicking in. But, we are sampling now and we are getting traction now.
Rick Clemmer: And ultra-wideband will begin to kick in as well in the second half.
Kurt Sievers: Yes. Rick, thanks for the reminder. Ultra-wideband is our, say in between mobile and auto, which is why I didn’t put it now fully into auto, but indeed we are already shipping small amount now into auto. Second half of this year, we’re going to see the first more material lift in revenues from ultra-wideband in the mobile segment and then extending into auto through the next few years. So again, summary is, the two large ones, radar and digital clusters, both about 10% of the total order revenue, radar 25% to 30% growth; digital clusters, mid-teens.
William Stein: Thanks for those reminders. Congrats again.
Rick Clemmer: Thank you, Will.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Craig Hettenbach: Yes. Thank you. I just want to follow up on ultra-wideband comments and just how you think about kind of the ecosystem, where NXP kind of fits in, and the different applications, as you see them ramping.
Kurt Sievers: Yes. Thanks, Craig. I think, I continue to see us as one of the initiators and leaders of the ecosystem, which really stems from our formal leadership in the security and mobile wallet applications, including software on the mobile side as well as the keyless entry applications on the auto side. And as we talked about earlier, the first major use case, which we see coming up now is actually using ultra-wideband for mobile-based secure car access, which is a perfect, I’d say, hybrid and convergence between these two leadership positions, which we have had historically. Now, the competitive dynamics, I’d say judging from the traffic around this at CES, ultra-wideband has now really hit everybody’s attention relative to a very precise localization technology, a technology which allows mobile access, secure mobile access ahead of any other possible technologies. So, it’s really in the spot light now. We continue to see very, very good traction with our solution portfolio actually in this conversion space initially between mobile and auto. But now, we also start to see more traction, I would say, for further IoT application use cases going into ‘21, ‘22 probably revenue range, when it comes to from the property access solutions and indoor navigation.
Rick Clemmer: One of the key things that really differentiates our solution is our secure element technology and the software that we provide and the ability to leverage that with ultra-wideband. So, we’re really in a unique position to bring that installed base that we have in the mobile wallet and leveraging that for ultra-wideband as Kurt talked about.
Craig Hettenbach: Got it. Thanks for that. And then, just as a follow-up I think, one of the common themes through this earnings season has been the pause in 5G infrastructure. And so, Rick, could just give us a sense in terms of what you’re seeing, kind of what you’re hearing out there and if there is any different trends by geography?
Rick Clemmer: The 5G infrastructure, the expectations of real strong growth comes from China. And clearly, there is a churn going on in China right now, not only with the suppliers, but also with the different standards and the different combination of carriers and their technology. So, we’ve talked about for a quarter or so, a pause. We really saw the strength last year from the deployment of the massive MIMO that will ultimately be used for 5G. But, we actually got through a lot of that, so that it was in the pipeline, if you will. And then, we haven’t seen a resumption of the 5G growth yet. And it looks like it’ll still be a couple of quarters out before we’ll see strong growth in 5G deployment. We clearly see that it’s coming. Just don’t see it in the near term.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Ross Seymore: Hi, guys. Congrats on turning the cyclical corner. I just wanted to ask a question about the industrial and IoT business. That one has been very volatile. I know, it’s a very disty heavy business and has its own share of China exposure. But, can you just talk about the return to 20% growth. How much of that is organic? Are you putting Marvell in there as well in the quarter? And from a cycle to cycle perspective, how do you think that business is shaping up heading into 2020 versus I think the volatile 2019?
Rick Clemmer: So, Ross, one thing that you should be clear, we talked about that Marvell will be about $60 million in Q1. So, it’s nearly half of the growth of the industrial and IoT in that 22% year-over-year. We’d probably be more like 12% or so without Marvell in. But that being said, 12% year-over-year growth is a long ways from where we’ve been for the last four or five quarters and feels really good. And again, what we see from that it’s really POS and the ship through primarily in China. We don’t see real strength in the Europe or in the U.S. but really, it’s POS and ship through in China in industrial and IoT. Now, the other thing, it is -- a key factor for us is the deployment of some of this company-specific design wins that will contribute to that and be a factor associated with it. But basically, on a standalone basis, we’d probably be more like 12 than the 22% and probably be flat on a sequential basis versus the 9% that we are -- when you include Marvell. Kurt, anything else?
Kurt Sievers: Yes. I’d say, clearly, we see full support of our 8% to 11% growth target going forward. So, that’s maybe then the perspective, you should look at this in hopefully what is somewhat more normal quarters in the near and midterm future. On the specific design wins, I mean, clearly the Marvell synergy, which we talked about earlier in the reference designs is a very helpful element. Secondly, we see continued great traction on the crossover products. So, we think about a 60 million run rate from last year, which we have more confident that it should double this year. So, that’s on track with how we talked about it earlier. And finally, I’m personally really excited and proud about the i.MX 8M Plus product, which we showed first time in Las Vegas. That’s a 14 nanometer neural-net processor, actually the first neural-net processor, which NXP has ever launched. We got silicon back from the factory just before Christmas. And the team has done a superb job to get it running on a demo at CES and Vegas, which really gets I would say AI performance at the edge on a much, much higher value to dollar than you would get from what people have done so far on GPUs. So, I really think that’s a breakthrough product from a performance cost combination perspective into what I would call the secure edge and IoT. So, it’s of course early. I mean, I cannot yet say there is a -- that number of design wins because we just showed the product now. But, from the interested gains and from the promise it delivers for secure edge processing, very, very exciting.
Ross Seymore: Thanks for all those details. And for my follow-up, I just wanted to head over onto the OpEx side, and one for Peter. You’re really helpful on the gross margin side with the revenue levels and the levers to get to the 55 and eventually to 57. I want to see if you could put some sort of framework around the operating margin or maybe the OpEx intensity. I think, in the past, you’ve talked about targets of roughly 23% of sales is your OpEx intensity. Can you just talk about the puts and takes especially with the acquisition of Marvell coming in and the divestiture of that mobile business going out, how should we think about OpEx and/or operating margin going forward?
Peter Kelly: Yes. I think, one way to think about it is, we disclosed that in the fourth quarter, Marvell’s revenues -- revenue from Marvell was about 6. I think the OpEx was about 8, which was just less than a full month. So, that gives you an idea of what quarterly run rate would be. And from a income perspective, I think in the fourth quarter, it was a hit of about $8 million. So, as we go forward, you would add in Marvell into the first quarter. So, that’s a big chunk of additional costs. You’ve got a IP. The OpEx associated with being relatively small, I want to say -- I don’t know maybe $6 million or $7 million. I mean, it’s not a huge amount of money that pops out for the Company. I think, the more important part of your question Ross is, where are we planning to be. And our goal is still to run 16% R&D and 7% SG&A. I kind of hate to admit it, but I think, it has to be in a more normal market and maybe we’re getting back where you see some growth in -- a normal growth in revenue. But, we’re retargeting it very hard and we plan to get this. So, it’s a question of how quickly we get that. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from C.J. Muse from Evercore. Your line is open.
C.J. Muse: I guess, a follow-up to Ross’s question, on the OpEx side. So, it sounds like for the March quarter, you’re including Marvell excluding the divested mobile biz. As we push forward beyond the March quarter, how should we think of the trajectory of OpEx?
Rick Clemmer: I think, you should think about it that as we -- our revenue gets back to a more of a normalized basis, we’ll be still targeting for the 16% R&D and the 7% SG&A that Peter talked about. We won’t be there for the next couple of quarters because of the revenue trough that we’ve been in. But, as we work our way through that growth, I think we clearly have the objective to be able to achieve that and feel comfortable about the actions we have in place to be sure we can achieve it.
Peter Kelly: Yes. I mean, I don’t want to say it’s totally linked to revenue. But, I think we were in the fourth quarter 2.3, we were, 16 and 16.5 something like that, and just over 7.5 on SG&A. So, I think once we get to kind of $2.4 billion level, we’re getting pretty close to the OpEx numbers we want to hit.
C.J. Muse: Excellent. And I guess, as my follow-up, again, I guess two-part here. On the free cash flow margin side, I think you’ve talked about a near-term target of 25%, yet you did a great job and hit 28% to 29% in the second half of the year, though that was a little bit helped by working cap. So, curious, thinking into ‘20 and ‘21, where is your goal there and then, just as a quick kind of follow-up, any update in terms of the S&P 500 inclusion? Thank you.
Peter Kelly: Well, let me talk to the S&P inclusion at the moment. So, as you know and as we said in the past, it’s just an incredibly opaque process. We believe we qualify. And we believe that probably waiting for our K to be filed, which will be our first significant document, quickly followed by our proxy. So, to be honest, you probably know as so much as we do, we’ve been using our friends and family to try and help us get a better understanding and plan to push S&P. But, they are pretty -- as I said, they’re pretty opaque, despite the best efforts of us on our bankers. But, we believe we qualify. So, it ought to be just a question of time.
Rick Clemmer: But, please feel free to reach out to them and ask them directly.
Jeff Palmer: And C.J., it’s Jeff. We really don’t have a free cash flow margin target stated. What we have said is that we will pay out 25% of cash flow from operations in dividend. That’s our target long-term. And then, more holistically what we said is, we will return all excess free cash flow to our shareholders via buybacks and dividend. So, there is no stated corporate free cash flow margin target.
C.J. Muse: Thank you.
Jeff Palmer: Operator, one last question here today, please?
Operator: Thank you, sir. And we’ll take our final question from Chris Caso from Raymond James. Your line is open.
Chris Caso: Yes. Thank you. Good morning. The question is on mobile. First, from a short-term perspective, it looks like the guidance is roughly seasonal. Is that how you characterize the environment there? And then, as we look out through the year, your mobile wallet was a big driver of mobile segment revenue last year. You talked about increasing attach rate. Is that something still to be expected this year? And with some of the growth last year, I guess is there any concern of lingering inventory issues in mobile? Thank you.
Kurt Sievers: Chris, let me go through the mobile attach rate first, mobile wallet. Yes, we are on track to our earlier stated target of an attach rate 50% exiting ‘21. I think, the interim mark from last year is probably about 35%, which we consider on track. So, the answer to your question is, yes. There is continued attach rate increase. We are in the middle of the game, and there is more to come towards ‘21. And then, beyond that, as I talked about in one of the earlier questions, ultra-wideband, which is a similar technology but totally complementary to mobile wallet. It’s going to come in on top of this, again, very strongly driving content in mobile, independent of run rate, actually. Now, on the inventory question, no. I’d say, we have no visibility of anything particularly concerning on the mobile side. And seasonality, I think, in the current environment, I really wouldn’t want to go into any discussion about seasonality. And so, it’s really hard to say when the industry goes through a cycle as it currently does. In general, it is however important to note that our mobile business is not as it used to be a single customer game. So, we have broadened our business into especially a number of Chinese players, which makes it probably different to what you would have expected from the past in terms of seasonality anyway.
Chris Caso: Thank you. And as a follow-up, maybe I can ask a little more on what you said on ultra-wideband. And you mentioned a number of applications for that and a number of areas for which it’ll have exposure, Perhaps, we look at it in the short term and the longer term, which areas do you think are expected to be your most impactful as we look out in the next year? Is it more on the mobile side or the IoT side, more on the auto side and when do you think the longer -- where’s the most opportunity over longer term?
Kurt Sievers: Well, so, first of all, there is a very small baseline, which is actually small in size, but it’s significant from giving evidence of the strength of the technology, which is in auto. So, we are shipping as we speak ultra-wideband into key fobs. So, that’s not about mobile access. It’s the classic key fob form factor, but it is ultra-wideband technology, which is being picked up and used for more secure applications against relay station attack. So, that is running as we speak. But, it’s really small. And then, the first meaningful lift in the second half of 2020 is going to be in mobile. But, the use case is very strongly focused on mobile car access. So, the revenue goes into mobile, and of course on the counter side in auto but mobile is going to have the higher volumes for the use case of car access. That’s what we see kicking in second half 2020. And all these other nice applications I mentioned earlier, especially in IoT, area then layers into the coming years.
Rick Clemmer: Great. So, let me just take this opportunity to thank all of our investors for their support through this difficult semiconductor cycle we’ve been through in 2019. We’re encouraged that we see some of the initial near-term improvements, specifically in China in sell-through and more of a stabilization in some of the other regions, which puts us in a good position to get back on strong growth going forward from the Company-specific design wins and the portfolio that we’ve been able to put in place. We think that that will bode well for us and give us the opportunity to significantly outgrow the market. And as we get to the kind of margin level that we’d like to be at, clearly generate a significant amount of cash that we plan on focusing on returning to our shareholders. So, we’re excited about the future and the opportunity associated with it, albeit somewhat concerned about the impact of the coronavirus, which clearly we have not reflected and don’t know what that really will be yet, but are clearly excited about the opportunities going into 2020 and returning to more of a normal semiconductor market, combined with the company-specific design wins that will be ramping for us in 2020 that will allow us to continue to grow at a significant rate. So, thank you very much.
Jeff Palmer: Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-10-29 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the NXP Semiconductors Third Quarter 2019 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions].
 I would now like to hand the call over to your speaker today, Jeff Palmer. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir. 
Jeff Palmer: Thank you, Daniel, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the NXP Semiconductors 2019 earnings call. With me on the call today is Rick Clemmer, NXP's CEO; Kurt Sievers, NXP's President; Peter Kelly, our CFO. 
 If you've not obtained a copy of our earnings press release, it can be found at our company website under the Investor Relations section. This call is being recorded and will be available for a replay from our corporate website. 
 Our call today will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause NXP's results to differ materially than management's current expectations. These risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to statements regarding the macroeconomic impacts on specific end markets in which we operate, the sale of new and existing products and our expectations for the financial results for the fourth quarter 2019. Please be reminded that NXP undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements. For a full disclosure on forward-looking statements, please refer to our press release. 
 Additionally, during our call today, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the impact of purchase price accounting, restructuring, stock-based compensation, impairment, merger-related costs and other charges that are driven primarily by discrete events that management does not consider to be directly related to NXP's underlying core operating performance. 
 Pursuant to Regulation G, NXP has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our third quarter 2019 press release, which will be furnished to the SEC on Form 8-K and is available on NXP's website at the Investor Relations section. 
 I'd now like to now turn the call over to Rick. 
Richard Clemmer: Thanks, Jeff, for those informative details. And welcome everyone to our conference call today. NXP delivered revenue of $2.3 billion for the third quarter. Our sales were near the high end of our guidance. We demonstrate good expense control, and we successfully delivered improved operating profitability, above the high end of our guidance range. Taken together, this resulted in $631 million of free cash flow generation. Kurt and Peter will provide specific detail later. 
 Looking forward, we continue to be optimistic that our product portfolio investments are addressing our customers' long-term requirements. We see initial signs of the demand environment from our customers appear to have somewhat stabilized. We believe the worst of the year-on-year declines in our strategic automotive and industrial markets are behind us. Specifically, our Q4 guidance for automotive points to low single-digit decline year-on-year versus the high single-digit decline we've experienced year to date. Additionally, our guidance for industrial business points to a mid-single digit decline versus the mid-teens decline seen year to date. While we are encouraged by the recent stabilization, and in some cases, improved demand, the shape and timing of any significant market reacceleration is clearly uncertain. What we continue to do is manage our cost and expenses and believe as a company, we are well positioned for a resumption in consistent demand. 
 Regardless of the current demand environment, our focus is on delivering unique and differentiated solutions, while enabling our customers to be successful in their target markets. We measure our success by attaining high RMS, or relative market share positions, in our target markets to drive true leadership, which should result in defensible long-term franchises based on truly innovative and competitive solutions. As we were successful in this regard, we are rewarded with lasting customer relationships, and we gain valuable insight into long-term requirements, which enable to us optimize our R&D decisions and investments. 
 Ultimately, this creates a virtuous cycle of product and customer alignment that will enable us to continue to deliver solid results to our shareholders.
 Over the course of the last year, we have reviewed with you several new product initiatives that reflect and underpin our strategic investment process. 
 As an example, in automotive, we've discussed our goals for our level 2 and level 3 ADAS business. Specifically, in RADAR, we continued to see our order rates rising and increasing customer engagements, which reinforce our projected 25% to 30% compounded annual growth over the next several years. 
 Additionally, in Q4, we will begin to ramp our RFCMOS 77 gigahertz front-end transceiver to a leading North American solution supplier. Along with our market-leading RADAR processors, connectivity and software in a complete system solution. This is a great validation of investments and customer commitments we made over the last several years. The success we have seen with our multiple chip -- our multichip RADAR solution sets the stage for the investments and the integration of the RADAR transceiver and processor into a single-chip solution, which we've already begun to undertake. 
 Additionally, a few years ago, we invested in vehicle to everything, our secure V2X solutions based on DSRC WiFi technology, another offering in our ADAS portfolio. It's taken longer than we had anticipated to see material transaction of this technology and use case. However, we are pleased that Volkswagen has announced the new 2020 Golf, their highest selling vehicle in Europe, which will come standardly equipped with NXP RoadLINK secure V2X solution. Currently, European roads are being equipped with DSRC based V2X technology with 5,000 kilometers planned through the end of 2019. 
 While V2X is not yet material in terms of revenue generation, it is another clear proof point that our automotive customers view NXT as a thought leader, which is making the right long-term investments to enable their success and to reduce the number of accidents and save lives. 
 In addition to RADAR and V2X, the other new automotive product initiatives we have shared with you include BMS, as witnessed by our success with the Volkswagen MEB platform, digital clusters and ultra-wideband are all progressing as we have anticipated. This reinforces our belief that our automotive growth subset can grow 25% to 30% compounded growth rate in total even in a more challenging global production environment. 
 In the industrial and IoT market, our crossover processors are continuing to see solid traction with revenue run rate tracking at a -- nearly a $60 million per year run rate. Very nice performance for an innovative new product, and we are in the early days of the design to revenue cycle with multiple customers, which should result in the doubling of our crossover business in 2020 and several following years. 
 Within the mobile end market interest in our new ultra-wideband products, which really enables an intersection of the mobile and auto access market, continues. Both BMW and Volkswagen announce support for the NXP-based solutions during the most recent quarter for the secure access, theft protection and other use cases. In the increased attach rate of our secure mobile, while it continues as the customer's base continues to broaden. 
 Now the one area that we've not spent a lot of time on, about our efforts in the communication infrastructure end market and specifically around the transition towards 5G networks. We have several opportunities in the buildout of 5G networks. The first is in radio frequency power solutions. These are subsystems which are installed in the remote radio head unit up on the cellular towers. Our products take analog signals and amplify the signals in radio frequency domain, enabling communications between cell towers and mobile handsets. 
 In the 4G generation of base stations, we offered high-power LDMOS power amplifiers for 1 to 4 transmitter radio systems. 
 To provide our customers with increased bandwidth in a fixed frequency spectrum, we have developed a wide range of low-power highly integrated products for massive MIMO RF Power systems. This can be thought of as a rays of amplifiers in nearly the same physical footprint as 4G remote radio heads, but with up to 32 or 64 instinct transmit paths, providing upwards of 10x the data rate versus the 4G systems. As the industry transitions towards the 5G standard with higher frequency bands, we have developed solutions across the complete sub-6 gigahertz spectrum, leveraging either our market leading LDMOS or GaN-based massive MIMO solutions. Interestingly, we have innovated our LDMOS process technology to be able to operate up to about 3.5 gigahertz, roughly 30% higher frequency versus the 4G generation, while still delivering the required output power and efficiency. 
 Furthermore, with our proprietary SiGe process technology, we have developed millimeter wave or ray-based solutions, supporting frequencies greater than 24 gigahertz for dense urban environments that we don't anticipate broad-based global millimeter wave buildouts to begin in earnest until late 2020 or early 2021. Taken together, NXP has the broadest, most innovative footprint of RF Power amplifiers for base station applications across the entire 5G frequency spectrum. 
 From a market perspective, our analysis points to a serviceable market for RF Power systems for cellular base stations, growing to about $2.5 billion by 2024 or a 13% 5-year compounded annual growth rate. With NXP holding the #1 position in this market with a relative market share position of 1.8x the #2 player. 
 Additionally, we have other opportunities in the 5G buildout for NXP. Our Digital Networking team has been awarded designs with a few OEMs to deploy CPE and also repeater equipment, which will complement and leverage the buildout of last-mile solutions in dense urban areas. These solutions leverage our innovative 64-bit ARM multicore Layerscape processors, which embed our unique and proprietary Vespa programmable baseband engines. This is a market which we bring unique programmable hardware and software capabilities, developed over many years focusing on the service provider market. These are purpose-built and optimized solutions, which result in high performance and low power consumption. It's also a market with few focused competitors, and we believe our solutions offer NXP solid differentiation. 
 From a market's perspective, the deployments are tied to the buildout of 5G macro base station for last-mile solutions, which we estimate will begin broad-based rollout global volume production in late 2020 or early 2021. Our analysis points to a serviceable market for these last-mile solutions, growing at a 30% to 35% basis on a 5-year compounded annual growth rate. We believe NXP has an opportunity to capitalize on the rollout of these last-mile solutions and further highlights customer belief in our fundamental IP and product development. 
 In summary, our strategy continues to yield positive results, we will continue to drive focus in our strategic end markets, engaging with customers to deliver superior, highly differentiated products, regardless of the short-term fluctuations in demand. 
 I'd like to now pass the call over to Kurt to discuss the results of the current quarter. 
Kurt Sievers: Thanks very much, Rick, and good morning, everyone. We really appreciate you joining our call this morning. 
 Overall, our Q3 results were above the midpoint of our guidance. With the contribution from the mobile and the industrial IoT markets stronger than planned, while demand in the communication infrastructure markets was slightly weaker and our automotive business performed just as anticipated. 
 Taken together, NXP delivered revenue of $2.3 billion, which combined with gross margin improvements and good expense control, enabled us to successfully deliver operating profitability above the higher end of our guidance range. 
 Let me turn to the specific trends in Q3 in our focus end markets. Starting with automotive. Revenue was $1.05 billion, down 7% year-on-year, in line with our guidance. 
 During the quarter, our automotive revenue declined 7% versus the year ago period, as anticipated, at a lesser rate of decline than in the previous quarter and showing 2% sequential growth. Our core automotive product lines declined year-on-year, a reflection of lower auto production and the appreciated supply chain rationalization. However, revenue from the subset of our automotive growth product lines grew in the high single-digit range year-on-year during the quarter. 
 Moving to industrial and IoT. Revenue was $426 million, down 14% year-on-year and up 9% sequentially, slightly better than our expectations. 
 During the quarter, the primary source of weakness in industrial and IoT continued to be our general purpose microcontroller products. Remember, our industrial and IoT business is primarily serviced through our global distribution partners and it is heavily indexed to customers in the Asian markets, which appear to be particularly affected by the continued U.S.-China trade tensions. 
 Turning to mobile. Revenue was $321 million, up 2% year-on-year, and up 8% sequentially above the high end of our guidance. 
 During Q3, despite reduced order rates at the largest Chinese handset customers, we did see robust seasonal ordering patterns from both other Chinese handset OEMs as well as our premium handset customer. Both trends taken together underpin our view that growth in our mobile business will continue to be driven by increasing attach rates of our secure mobile technology associated with new use cases like transit ticketing amongst others. 
 Lastly, communication infrastructure and other, revenue was $470 million, down 2% year-on-year, and down 6% sequentially below our guidance. From a product line trend perspective, we continued to see robust year-on-year growth trends associated with our RF Power solutions. So just a little than our plans. The Digital Networking business came in line with expectations, while the secure card business was a little below our expectations. 
 Let me highlight here several notable trends in the communications infrastructure market, which we do believe are truly benefiting NXP. These include the continued shift towards massive MIMO solutions, leveraging both LDMOS as well as gallium nitride based products. We also see early traction with our millimeter wave engagements for dense urban areas. The positive tailwinds for our communication infrastructure business are robust. 
 Now let me turn to our expectations for quarter 4. Our guidance reflects the ongoing stabilization in demand, mentioned earlier in our prepared remarks by Rick. We do believe the outlook appears to have stopped getting worse on a seasonal basis. So it is still not reflective of a return to growth. 
 We are guiding quarter 4 revenue at $2.27 billion, flat sequentially on the third quarter, within the range of down 1% to up 2%. From a year-over-year perspective, this represents a decline of about 6% versus the same period a year ago, of which about 120 basis points is the elimination of the MSA versus the year ago period. 
 At the midpoint, we are anticipating the following sequential trends in our 4 businesses. Automotive is expected to be up mid-single digits versus Q3. Industrial and IoT is expected to be down in the mid-single-digit range on a percentage basis. Mobile is expected to be slightly down in the low single digits on a percentage basis. And finally, communication infrastructure and other is expected to be down in the low single digits on a percentage basis. 
 In summary, our new product introductions, customer engagement levels and design win momentum in our strategic focus areas continue to be very, very positive. And we do continue to be very optimistic about the mid- to long-term potential of NXP. 
 Now I would like to pass the call to Peter for a review of our financial performance. Peter, over to you. 
Peter Kelly: Thank you, Kurt, and good morning to everyone on today's call. As Kurt has already covered the drivers of the revenue during the quarter and provided our revenue outlook for the fourth quarter, I'll move to the financial highlights. 
 In summary, our third quarter revenue performance was near the high end of our guidance range, which combined with good expense control, resulted in very strong non-GAAP operating profit. 
 But focusing on the details of the third quarter, total revenue was $2.27 billion, down 7% year-on-year, of which 120 basis points was the elimination of the MSA versus the year ago period. 
 We generated $1.2 billion in non-GAAP gross profit and reported a non-GAAP gross margin of 53.7%, up 70 basis points year-on-year and in line with the midpoint of our guidance. 
 Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $531 million, down $32 million year-on-year and down $10 million from Q2.  This was $5 million better than the midpoint of our guidance. 
 From a total operating profit perspective, non-GAAP operating profit was $687 million and non-GAAP operating margin was 30.3%, up 30 basis points year-on-year, despite a $180 million drop in revenue over the same period. Non-GAAP interest expense was $66 million, cash tax for ongoing operations were $39 million and noncontrolling interest was $10 million, with cash tax and interest expense modestly better than the midpoint of guidance. Stock-based compensation, which is not included in our non-GAAP earnings, was $84 million. 
 Now I'd like to turn to the changes in our cash and debt. Our total debt at the end of Q3 was $8.51 billion, down $33 million sequentially as we retired the remaining [ stood ] portion of our June 2021 debt. Cash was $3.54 billion, a net debt of $4.97 billion, a decline sequentially because of solid cash generation during the third quarter. 
 We exited the quarter with a trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA of $3.13 billion, and our ratio of net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of the third quarter was 1.59x. And our non-GAAP interest coverage was 10.4x. Our liquidity is excellent, and our balance sheet continues to be very strong. 
 During the third quarter, we paid $70 million in cash dividends and announced a 50% increase in the annual dividend rate. Our capital return policy continues to be -- to return all excess cash to shareholders. I would remind you that since July 2018, we have returned $6.6 billion to our shareholders, including buying back 18% of the diluted share count.
 Turning to working capital metrics. Days of inventory was 98 days, a decrease of 2 days sequentially, a quarter-on-quarter decline of $10 million. We continue to aggressively manage our distribution channel. And inventory in the channel is very healthy, 2.3 months; and within our long-term targets, though, slightly below the 2.4 months we normally expect to run. 
 Days receivable were 32 days, flat sequentially. And days payable were 74 days, an increase of 7 days versus the prior quarter. Taken together, our cash conversion cycle was 56 days, an improvement of 9 days versus the prior quarter. 
 Cash flow from operations was $746 million. Our net CapEx was $115 million, resulting in free cash flow of $631 million. 
 Turning to our expectations for the fourth quarter. As Kurt mentioned, we anticipate fourth quarter revenue to be about $2.27 billion, plus or minus $30 million; and at the midpoint, this is flat sequentially. We expect non-GAAP gross margins to be about 54.2%, plus or minus 30 basis points. 
 Operating expenses are expected to be about $545 million, plus or minus about $7 million. And taken together, we see non-GAAP operating margin to be about 30.2%, plus or minus about 30 basis points. 
 We estimate non-GAAP interest expense to be around $69 million, and anticipate cash tax related to ongoing operations to be about $39 million. 
 Noncontrolling interest will be about $9 million. And for the fourth quarter, we suggest that for modeling purposes, we use an average share count of about 285 million shares. 
 Finally, I have a few closing comments that I'd like to make. One, we currently have $3.5 billion of cash on our balance sheet. On December 1, we plan to use $1.1 billion of this cash to pay down our convertible debt. And we anticipate using $1.76 billion to close our transaction for the Marvell asset, although, we're still waiting for the final regulatory approval from Taiwan. 
 As Kurt pointed out, we're pleased with our performance in the third quarter. Our revenue was slightly better than guidance with the contribution from the mobile and industrial IoT markets, both a bit stronger than expected, while the automotive market was in line with our expectations and the comm infrastructure market was slightly weaker. The challenge at this stage is to predict when a positive inflection in demand will occur. Until we see a decidedly improve demand environment, we'll keep -- continue to keep a tight control on those items which are under our control, including gross margin, operating expenses and working capital, aiming to maximize the performance of the company. 
 Our non-GAAP gross margin has steadily improved over the last year, even as we navigate to the challenging top line demand environment. Our non-GAAP gross margin improved again in the third quarter, and we anticipate further improvements into the fourth quarter. However, as our guidance reflects, given our top line visibility, we do not believe we will achieve the 55% goal in Q4. This is a significant disappointment driven by a lack of volume and the resulting under-recovery it drives to our costs. However, I continue to have confidence in our ability to manage the cost which are under our control. 
 So further, I would like to reiterate Kurt and Rick's comments: the market continues to be uncertain, and although we've certainly seen some positive signs, we're not ready yet to declare victory. In fact, after 5 quarters of year-on-year declines, achieving a flat year-on-year revenue for the first quarter of 2020 would feel like a positive move in an uncertain market environment. Equally, I would remind you all that our operating expenses generally increase from Q4 to Q1 as we feel the impact the annual bonuses and fringe benefit resets. 
 So with that, I'd like to now turn it back to the operator and answer any questions you may have. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. 
Ross Seymore: I wanted to focus on the automotive side first. It's is good to see that, that's up subsequently in the quarter. So can you just talk about what's driving that up in the fourth quarter? And then for the full year, you did very well getting closer to SAAR. How are you thinking about what NXP's growth rate in auto can be relative to SAAR conceptually in 2020 as you have inventory versus share gains and a bunch of potentially offsetting vectors? 
Kurt Sievers: This is Kurt. Let me take that question. Let me maybe start with saying what our latest market insights are. So IHS just published their latest SAAR numbers for this year and the forecast for next year, where they are saying they see a 6% decline for the SAAR for 2019 annually over '18. And they estimate about flat for next year. That's the latest impact we have. So unfortunately, that indeed indicates that it has further deteriorated this year. So we had earlier in the year, minus 4%, minus 5%, and now they end up at minus 6% decline for '19. 
 We have always said that on a quarterly basis, you cannot really benchmark our revenue performance against the SAAR, given all the supply chain effects in-between. At the same time, we do continue to clearly say that we have all reason to believe that our business is outgrowing the SAAR synced to the electronic content increase per car. 
 And I think we are now at a point going into Q4 where it appears that the supply chain should become more or less clean. So our growth, which you see in our business, it becomes more reflective of the true automotive demand from the OEMs. And that is indeed then leading to a annual, and that's how we look at it, annual growth rate in Q4, which is only minus 2% verses much higher declines in the earlier quarters, like minus 7% and minus 10% in Q3 and Q2. 
 We don't really guide for next year, Ross. And yet, I would say that once the supply chain is clear, we should expect that our growth by content should be reflected again in our numbers, against the SAAR. So there is some optimism here that with a more clean supply chain going forward, we should return to growth based on a flat SAAR. 
Ross Seymore: And then from my follow-up question, just wanted to hit on margins, one for Peter. I think overall, people understand the gross margin side, you guys are doing a good job in a tough revenue comp. I was a little surprised the OpEx is going up as much as it is in the fourth quarter, given the discretionary tightness you guys have done so well to control throughout the year. Can you just talk about a little bit about why that's going up, and does the increase in the fourth quarter diminish the size of the increase that we otherwise would have seen in the first quarter sequentially? 
Peter Kelly: Yes. The single biggest item is actually a positive thing. We have a really significant number, I think it's actually just a bit over $10 million of tape-outs in excess of what we saw in the third quarter. And that's the single biggest item, Ross. So we have... 
Richard Clemmer: So it's a good thing. 
Peter Kelly: It's a good thing, but... 
Richard Clemmer: We're getting some of our MPIs out and shipping those to customers. And so there's a cost, obviously, as we take those and put those -- move those towards engagement with customers, Ross. 
Operator: Our next question comes from William Stein with SunTrust. 
William Stein: Great. Just following up on that a little bit. Peter, can you help us understand, I think we know -- or we're expecting margins to deteriorate a little bit in Q1 as you give price to customers in automotive and you have to incur some incremental accruals on the OpEx side. Any quantification that will help us modeling sequentially as we think out to Q1? And then how that might abate as we -- that effect might abate as we go through the year? 
Peter Kelly: I -- I mean, clearly, I don't want to guide Q1 at this stage. I think you're right, Will, in the sense that from a gross margin perspective, you have the single biggest item is the annual price increases. And from OpEx, you have a reset on bonus. So as an example, this year, we didn't hit our targets, so the bonus accrual is relatively small and you're probably talking about maybe an average of $10 million a quarter. Whereas in 2020, if we were to assume our full bonus, we haven't kind of set all of our targets yet for 2020, you'd be talking more like $35 million a quarter. You'd see an $8 million increase roughly for fringe benefits. But we should -- I don't think [ MATs ] cost will be as high as Q1 as they were in Q4. So I'm not sure I'd forecast OpEx lower in Q1 than Q4. But I'm not ready yet to give you an absolute number. 
William Stein: It's still really helpful. One follow up if I can. The mobile strength in Q3, it sounds like that was more of a unit's thing than a content thing, relative to your expectations at the start of the quarter. Is that fair? And is the demand -- it sounds like it's a bit more dispersed than concentrated. Maybe you could just provide a little color. 
Richard Clemmer: I guess the units comes from the content, so they're directly linked. So you can't really separate the 2. I think the good point was, if you recall in Q2, we had our largest Chinese OEM that had a strong uptake as they broaden the deployment of the mobile wallet into more of their portfolio. And in Q3, clearly, we had a broader base as well as the -- our Tier 1 customer increased volumes as well. But all the other Chinese customers showed strength in Q3 also. So yes, we had a really strong quarter in Q3. And I think it does continue to bode well for the continued deployment associated with the mobile wallet and the uptake associated with it as we project it going into the next couple of years where we think it can be 50% of all the smartphones. 
Operator: Our next question comes from John Pitzer with Crédit Suisse. 
John Pitzer: Rick, I wanted to ask you a little bit -- given you have sort of a unique vantage point on the whole China-U.S. trade issues. I'm kind of curious how you think that, that is impacting your business.  There has been some concern in the investment community that perhaps Chinese customers are pulling forward inventory; there's been other sort of checks that would suggest they're trying to keep inventory lean. Clearly, you're not suffering from any bans, but it'd be -- I'd be kind of curious to think whether or not there's a second derivative effect on bans on your revenue as well and how you might think business will trend, if there is a trade resolution? 
Richard Clemmer: Well, I think if there's trade resolution, it would be very positive. So I don't think is there is any doubt about that. I think though that, we don't see a lot of inventory being put in place. In Q2, as we talked about it, the largest Chinese handset, they clearly were ramping their supply chain as they broaden the portfolio associated with it. But we didn't see a lot of inventory, it was really associated with their supply chain. There has been comments that I've heard about other technologies like FPGAs where some of the Chinese guys were concerned about having adequate supply and put inventory in place. But we don't see really a lot of that in the areas that we serve at all, John. And we think it continues to bode well. Clearly, I think our relationship with the Chinese customers has been positive and will continue to be positive for us going forward. 
John Pitzer: That's helpful. And then Rick, just to follow up on some of your prepared comments about 5G and the comm  infrastructure space. You guys have kind of put out a 3-year CAGR target for revenue in that space of somewhere between 0% to up 2%. Is it fair to say that what you talked about today on the RF Power side and sub-6 is contemplated in that? But as we go to millimeter wave, it's not? And if that's the case, how might millimeter wave and your opportunity there impact that kind of CAGR that you have out there as a target? 
Richard Clemmer: Well, so John, when we set those targets, we were coming out of a period of several years of declines in both the RF Power and Digital Networking business. Clearly, with the Digital Networking business going from around $800 million at the time we did the merger with Freescale down to in more like the $500 million range. So we did set those conservatively. I think what we're talking about, clearly, with the 5G opportunity should increase that growth rate. But it -- we don't think it'll change the total because it really just gives us room to cover the downturn that we've been through in automotive and industrial and still have the confidence in achieving our 5% to 7% compounded growth rate going forward. 
 I do think that there is a real opportunity, as we talked about, for low teens growth rate in RF Power business with 5G deployment over the next few years, and with our leadership position, puts in a good position. And we're just making some early investments in the last mile with some of the customer engagements that could bode very well as well and end up with a couple hundred million dollars a year of revenue in the not too distant future. So all of that's positive, but we're just kind of leaving our growth rates that we set a year and a half or so ago intact and not really changing those by piece at this point, John. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. 
Blayne Curtis: I just wanted to go back on the auto segment. You mentioned, I think, the growth rate is growing teens. Just kind of curious with the -- you also mentioned the stabilization. And with improving SAAR next year, the growth that you're seeing or the better than seasonal, I guess, in December you're seeing -- are you seeing any restocking of kind of the core components? Or is the outperformance led by the growth areas? 
Kurt Sievers: Blayne, this is Kurt. I -- first of all, let me slightly correct what you just said. I think I didn't say that IHS talked about an improvement in SAAR next year; they see a flat SAAR on the low level which was achieved at the end of this year. I think it's a minor but maybe important detail. When you think about us, indeed, I'd say that the improvements you are seeing is probably not restocking, but it's just that the consumption reflects more the end demand. Where earlier, at least in our business with smaller accounts and through distribution, it was marked by building down inventories. And that appears to possibly be over now, which means we just see the real demand coming back again. I would be careful to say that's already restocking, probably not. 
Richard Clemmer: Yes. If I could just add something, I think one of the things if you look at it, Blayne, and look at IHS projections, first half of '20 will be slightly up from second half of '19. So that says we've kind of gotten to a minimum run rate based on their projections now. And then they'll see a resumption of growth in the second half of '20. So -- but I do think that when you look at some of our customers in China and other places that we serve through distribution, we are beginning to see a little more of an uptick, which I think means that they've kind of worked their way through their inventory basis and we're beginning to see a little more of a positive perspective associated with it. 
Blayne Curtis: And I just want to ask on the WiFi transition -- or transaction. You had targeted Q1 close, but thought might you could do a little earlier. It sounds like you're waiting for Taiwan. Just curious if you expect to close that in December, and if anything is in the guidance from that. 
Richard Clemmer: Nothing is in the guidance. 
Peter Kelly: Nothing is in the guidance. 
Richard Clemmer: Nothing is in the guidance, and we would anticipate closing it sooner than first quarter. But given the fact that there is a process in Taiwan that we really don't have clear insight into how long it will take, it would be inappropriate for us to really second-guess the actual timing. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. 
Stacy Rasgon: I wanted to talk about, first, just the language in the release, it is a little bit improved. This is the first time I heard you talk about short-term demand environment stabilizing... 
Richard Clemmer: Stacy, you're kind of cutting out. We can't really hear you. 
Stacy Rasgon: I'm sorry, can you hear me now? 
Richard Clemmer: Yes, perfect. 
Stacy Rasgon: Let's try that again. So the language in the release has obviously a little bit improved this time. I haven't heard you talk about short-term demand environment stabilizing for a while. At the same time, we're hearing a fair amount about sort of the distie challenges bottoming. Is this statement just purely a channel statement that things have sort of bottomed in terms of the inventory flush, and we're just more representative now of end-to-end? Or are you actually seeing, to the extent that you have any visibility, actual improvement in customer end demand at this point? 
Richard Clemmer: So I think, Stacy, what we're seeing is, we've seen things stabilize, and we've seen some pockets of improvement or increased orders. But really what we're trying to point to is the fact that if you look at it in our industrial and IoT segment, we were mid-teens year-over-year decline through the first 3 quarters of this year. And if you look at the midpoint of our projection, we'll be kind of mid-single digit. So that's definitely a significant improvement. And if you look at automotive, it's been kind of high single-digit decline year-over-year through the first 3 quarters. And what we're -- at the midpoint, we're kind of at a 2% decline. 
 So I think that's really what we're trying to talk about. That's the basic indicator that we have that things are improving is based on the run rates that we have from our customers and their demands, we see that improving. Now you also have to look at our mobile and communications and infrastructure to get to the total. And in total, we've been -- if you adjust for the MSA that we changed in the accounting, we've been kind of mid-single digit with the exception of Q2 where we were a little less than that. And we'll be kind of -- we'll have a couple points improvement in the total even with a little bit of down take in the communications and mobile in Q4. But -- so I think we clearly have seen a stabilization in some pockets of improved demand, in increased demand, but not anything that would lead us to really talk about a robust recovery underway at this point. 
Stacy Rasgon: And maybe to follow up on that on the longer term. Are you still holding to your longer-term growth, what was it, 5% to 7% [indiscernible]... 
Peter Kelly: We lost you again, Stacy. 
Stacy Rasgon: Okay. Can you hear me now? This is very strange. 
Richard Clemmer: Yes. 
Stacy Rasgon: Very strange. To follow up on that. Your long-term growth target is still being articulated, 5% to 7%, you're holding to it. Now that was originally put forth as a CAGR, it was 2018 to 2021 and obviously we've got a -- it's -- we've got a decline in 2019. So what is the right way to think about this growth model given the new starting point? is it 5% to 7% off of the base we've seen in 2019? Or do you still think that we can get something closer to that 3-year CAGR off the 2018, which would imply more growth in 2020 and 2021? And I guess if that's the case, what would be the drivers of that? Like how do we think about that long-term growth model in the context of where we're starting from? 
Richard Clemmer: So, Stacy, I think what we're committed to is the 5% to 7% growth rate. We said the categories may be different than what we talked about 1.5 years ago, as we look at that. We may not be able to quite achieve what we had laid out at the high end of automotive or the high end of industrial based on the fact that we've gone through this downturn. The positive thing is, mobile is growing quite nicely with the increased mobile wallet deployment as well as now ultra-wideband beginning to be shipping next year and in 2021. And clearly, the 5G deployment gives us some upside. I mean that could drive that 0% to 2% to kind of high single-digit growth potentially. But in total, we still are committed to the 5% to 7% growth rate. And I think the key is, is that we have different knobs to turn to be sure that we can achieve that and accomplish that. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. 
Craig Hettenbach: Just a question, Kurt. Any update on BMS and in particular, things that you would highlight versus some of the incumbents that you think you're doing just from a future set perspective? 
Kurt Sievers: Yes. Thanks, Craig. Well, the update is that we are on track, which is definitely good news. And I think we have all seen in Q3 a very large European OEM making a major announcement about their commitments, relative to new electric vehicles coming out. And as we have kind of signposted earlier, we are quite a bit involved in this, not in one model, but actually across the board. So if you will, this is a very clear evidence on our success over incumbents with one of the most, I would say, bullish commitments from a car company into building electric vehicles. And that starts shipping as we speak. So I mean this is not just somewhere in the future, but actually the first models out of that whole fleet across the couple of brands of that OEM are shipping as we speak. 
 So what that means below the line is, we are on track to our BMS rollout, as we have discussed earlier, with pretty high growth rate into the next few years. Let me just highlight, Craig, that we -- while we speak a lot about this one OEM and since the public announcement, that's very convenient for us to speak about it, we have a significantly broader base of design wins, too. Differentiators against incumbents remain to be ASIL-D functional safety performance on a system level as well as the scalability, given our approach with microcontrollers and analog high-precision front ends. 
Richard Clemmer: And I guess the only thing I would add to that, Craig, is we follow -- I follow, personally, the announcement by some of the incumbents and always track that. And every time we go back and look at it, we still think that we have a superior performance and a better product than some of the announcements that they're making. 
Craig Hettenbach: Got it. And just a follow-up for Peter. Understanding there's still some headwinds from the revenue on the gross margin line. Can you talk about just some of the levers you've been pulling to improve gross margin, and also maybe some benefits of mix over the next 12 to 18 months? 
Peter Kelly: Yes. I think they're the same things. I think in the long term, so over the next few years, our mix definitely helps us. As we look at kind of the MPIs that are coming out, you're not going to suddenly see us jump, but you'll see gradual improvements in gross margin in the long term. 
 In the short term, it's all about blocking and tackling, making sure our partners give us the right pricing, making sure we're managing yields, test times, all that good stuff. To be honest, the issue I have at the moment is, we have a long-term model of 55% to 57%. I'd really like to get to 55% for full year 2020. But with the current market environment and the -- I'd say, the lack of visibility rather than visibility we have, it's hard to see how we do that really. And you saw that in Q4. So I do need -- I hate to admit it, but I do need a pickup in volume to be able to get to the 55% level. And I'm surprised you didn't ask the question, one of the questions we were anticipating from you guys is, given revenue was towards the higher end of the guidance in Q3, why didn't gross margin improve a little bit above the guidance of 53.7%? And the answer to that is our assembly and test -- internal assembly and test utilization was weaker than we thought in Q3. Now to be honest, 30 basis points is $6 million. So it's not that big a number anyway. But on the current environment, running the levels of revenue we have, it makes it really, really tough to get the revenue up, but I believe after-market does come back, we'll be able to get there. 
Richard Clemmer: Craig, just to be specific, I think our long-term target is 53% to 57%.  We talked about 55% in the near term, but... 
Peter Kelly: Oh, did I say 55%? 
Richard Clemmer: You said 55%. Just a point to clarify. 
Peter Kelly: Yes. Sorry, 53% to 57%, 55% the midpoint. Yes. 
Richard Clemmer: But utilization will be key to that as well. And I think that's an important element of our continued gross margin improvement. 
Peter Kelly: And that's an impact of just revenue and managing our inventory and all that good stuff. 
Operator: Our next question comes from C.J Muse with Evercore. 
Christopher Muse: I guess first question, one of the more encouraging, I guess, data points coming out of your 10-Q, is that your OEM sales were flat year-on-year, while distie sales down 10%. So I guess 2-part question there. One, are you comfortable with where we are from a distie inventory perspective? And then two, as you see a recovery at least standing here today, do you think it'll be distie or OEM-led? 
Richard Clemmer: Well, I think your point is -- it's a great observation, that most of the weakness that we have comes out of distribution. If you look at what we've done on the distribution inventory, we've significantly reduced the inventory over the last few quarters to be able to maintain that 2.4 months and actually down at 2.3 months in the Q3 time frame, which we would anticipate would go back to the 2.4 months in Q4. We actually had some late shipments out on POS, late in the quarter that actually allowed our inventory to go down to the 2.3 months. I think that we'll see a -- we will see an uptick in distribution. I think it has tended, as you pointed out, to be more volatile than the OEM side. And I think it will be more relevant towards the uptick associated with it. But as far as inventories, I think we're in good shape. And I don't think there is any issue associated with that, but I would anticipate that, that will be one of the early points where we'll see a real improvement in the total revenue. 
Christopher Muse: Very helpful. As my follow-up, and I know -- don't want to guide to Q1, so not asking near term. But as you think about just, generally, for 2020 and you look at your mobile business and the increased attach rate of secure mobile wallet, how are you thinking about and what does your visibility look like today into the growth vector into 2020? 
Jeff Palmer: Kurt, you want to take that? 
Kurt Sievers: I would say we are confident that the attach rate increase -- which is actually what is driving our mobile growth, attach rate increase of mobile wallets and [ other shaded ] applications does continue. I mean, there could always be quarterly fluctuations, mobile has a lot of seasonality. But from a year-over-year perspective, we are very well on track with what we said in our Analyst Day last year that we see the attach rate growing from, I think we said 30% to 50% over the next 3 years. And we actually did a check earlier, how are we on that journey. And it looks like we can be confident that we are very well on track on the journey, and that would indicate that the growth should reasonably continue. 
Richard Clemmer: I think, C.J., one of the things that will be really interesting in the second half next year is -- as we begin to ship ultra-wideband, it just solidifies that position in mobile and solidifies our position with the mobile wallet. So I think that will be a significant contributing factor for us and continue to demonstrate our leadership as well as solidifying our overall position. 
Operator: Our final question comes from Chris Caso with Raymond James. 
Christopher Caso: Just a follow-up question on the gross margin. And Peter, last quarter, you talked about getting to -- the potential of getting to a 55% quarterly run rate on about flat year-on-year revenue, would suggest around the $2.4 billion level. Is that still the right way to think about it going forward kind of once we kind of get to that revenue level, that's when we get that on a quarterly basis and obviously, the full year falls [indiscernible]? 
Peter Kelly: Yes, yes. [indiscernible]. Okay. Sorry, I said, yes. 
Christopher Caso: That's all right. Quick answer. Just... 
Peter Kelly: It was kind of a rhetorical question, really. Yes. 
Christopher Caso: Right. Okay. The follow on from that is, there's been some talk with some of the trade tensions that some of the Chinese customers perhaps are tending to favor some of the non-U.S. solutions, given some of the trade situations and security of supply and such. Is that something you're tending to see in your business now? And going forward, do you think that provides you with somewhat of an advantage being domiciled outside the U.S.? 
Richard Clemmer: Yes. No, seriously, I think in -- with discussions with our customers, I think they appreciate the complexities of dealing with different-sourced technology. And I think they have a lot of discussions about trying to move some of their production to us as well as other non-U.S. sourced IP providers. So we think that could be positive.  Obviously, that doesn't happen overnight or immediately, but it takes a period of time associated with it. 
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now like to turn the call back over to Rick Clemmer for any closing remarks. 
Richard Clemmer: Thank you very much, operator. So thanks for joining us today. Obviously, we feel better than we did in previous quarters with the stability we see and are encouraged about the fact that year-over-year decline is significantly reduced with our guidance in Q4 and puts us in a solid position to get ready to move into 2020 with a ramp up of new products that will continue to differentiate NXP and show our leadership in deploying technology to be able to drive solutions for our customers. So thank you very much for your support, and have a good day. 
Jeff Palmer: Great. Thank you, everyone. Thank you, Daniel. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-07-30 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2019 NXP Semiconductors Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jeff Palmer, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.
Jeff Palmer: Thanks, Sonya. And good morning, everyone. Welcome to the NXP Semiconductors second quarter 2019 earnings call. With me on the call today is Rick Clemmer, NXP's CEO; Kurt Sievers, NXP's President; and Peter Kelly, our CFO. If you've not obtained a copy of our earnings press release, it can be found at our company website under the Investor Relations section at nxp.com. This call is being recorded and will be available for replay from our corporate website. Our call today will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause NXP's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the macroeconomic impact on the specific end markets in which we operate, the sale of new and existing products, and our expectations for the financial results for the third quarter of 2019. Please be reminded NXP undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements. For a full disclosure on forward-looking statements, please refer to our press release today. Additionally, during our call today, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the impact of purchase price accounting, restructuring, stock-based compensation, impairment, merger-related costs, and other charges that are driven primarily by discrete events that management does not consider to be directly related to NXP's underlying core operating performance of the company. Pursuant to Regulation G, NXP has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our second quarter 2019 earnings press release, which will be furnished to the SEC on a Form 6-K and is available on NXP's website in the Investor Relations section at nxp.com. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Rick.
Richard Clemmer: Thanks, Jeff. And welcome everyone to our conference call today. Today, I'll start with and provide some mid-and long-term strategic commentary. Then Kurt Sievers, our president, will review the end market revenue details of Q2 and provide revenue guidance for Q3. And finally, Peter Kelly will review the financial details of the quarter and expectations for third quarter. As most of you remember, last quarter, we discussed company-specific design wins in our focused end markets of automotive and industrial and IOT. Today, I'd like to provide additional details and share some exciting new engagements which reflect the momentum we have in our target markets. Within our automotive market, we discussed that one of our key focus areas is radar solutions for level 2 and level 3 ADAS vehicles. Initially, radar will facilitate automatic emergency braking which is being mandated by multiple regulatory groups, like NCAP in Europe. Eventually, new use cases will be adaptive cruise control, lane change assistance, cross traffic alerts and blind spot detection. These features are all dependent on radar as the key enabling function and, ultimately, radar solutions will become standard equipment regardless of the car, tier or OEM brand, making all of our driving safer. For NXP, we have emerged as the number one supplier for the complete radar subsystem, with radar representing almost 10% of our auto revenues in 2018. To date, our success on the processor side has been broad-based, while the transceiver shipments have been largely driven by a single large European tier 1, who represents about 30% of the overall radar market and services several major OEMs globally. We're excited that shipments from our design win momentum will expand based on the initial ramp up of one of the most innovative North American tier 1 suppliers who we ultimately expect to have about 20% of the overall radar market. We are now aligned with the tier 1 market leaders which service a dozen of the largest global auto OEMs. Our success in the ecosystem is due to the market-leading performance, product integration and complete end-to-end solutions supported by the industry's broadest portfolio and roadmap of multi-generation processors and printing transceivers, both 77 GHz SiGe and RFCMOS. and we have additional tier 1 design wins and engagements ongoing and we'll continue to invest in the area to expand our market and thought leadership. These engagements continue to underpin our confidence that NXP will outgrow the overall auto radar market with our planned growth of 25% to 30% compounded annually over the next two years. Now, I'd like to turn to a very exciting new solution, ultra-wideband or UWB. UWB is a technology that enables secure relative location and distance measurement with a very high degree of precision and low latency. This is an area we have been investing for several years in a stealth mode and believe NXP has a unique first mover advantage, which yields category leadership. We see clear interest from participants in the automotive, industrial, IOT, smart home, smart retail and mobile markets. One of the first use case applications will be to revolutionize the next generation of secure car access solutions. We have a system-level solution that leverages foundation IP at the intersection of two existing NXP application areas – automotive secure car access and secure mobile payments, both areas where NXP is the undisputed true market leader with relative market share of 2.9x and 7.9x the number two player respectively. The overall solution leverages NXP's market leadership in connectivity, embedded secure element and digital credential management technology. As announced by the leading German newspaper and mentioned by Forbes, UWB today adds a new level of security to the car key fab – fobs that can prevent relay station attacks by distinguishing the authentic signal from the related or spook signal. UWB is the most precise, secure and real time ranging technology that allows coexistence with existing radio technologies. This will give various applications the ability to process contextual information such as the position of a UWB anchor, its movements and the distance to other devices with an unprecedented precision to within a few centimeters, which enables decision-making and management of these devices to take place with high granularity. As an example, a consumer could remotely share secure access to home or building from their phone where the doorlock identifies the new person through localization and secure credentials before opening the door. In addition to the secure door access, our customers have envisioned applications such as indoor location-based services, highly immersive virtual gaming systems and many more use cases. This is clearly not a science project looking for a problem to solve. We've developed products and are very actively engaged with leading customers in various target segments in a complete ecosystem. We have won key designs with several customers across the mobile and automotive end markets with volume production to start in 2020. We see the market opportunity developing to approximately $900 million by 2024. We believe our market share will be equivalent with our first mover advantage, unique IP, system knowledge and high RMS foundational positions. This is an exciting new and incremental opportunity for NXP. Now turning to the industrial and IOT market. On May 29, we announced the intent to acquire Marvell's connectivity assets. We expect the business to add about $600 million of incremental revenue by 2022, roughly two times its current run rate. This was not an acquisition we executed in the spur of the moment. We spent nearly a year looking at all the connectivity assets in the market. Our conclusion was that the Marvel team provides NXP with an industry-leading connectivity engineering team, a strong complementary product portfolio and a successful history of fundamental IP development. The product set and especially the disruptive Wi-Fi 6 portfolio will immediately complement our key, processing, security and connectivity offerings in our strategic end markets of industrial and IOT as well as automotive. As a point of reference, looking at the recent history of all applications in crossover processor design wins, we have been awarded in the industrial and IOT market, nearly two-thirds have included a connectivity solution which had to be sourced from other vendors. Connectivity is clearly becoming a must-have functional capability for IOT solutions. We believe our leading processor product offering, our broad go-to-market channel and the market inflection by Wi-Fi 6 will all directly underpin the strong growth we have highlighted. We are very excited about the transaction and look forward to welcoming the team to NXP. Lastly, a quick comment on our efforts in the mobile market. As you will remember from our Analyst Day, our focus on the mobile markets is primarily aimed at the evolution and adoption of the mobile wallet and associated services like transit ticketing. We said our growth in the mobile market would be a function of increased attach rate, not the fundamental handset unit growth. We believe the mobile wallet attach rate in 2018 was about 30% of all phones and we are targeting this to expand to about 50% by 2021. I'd like to report that a large Chinese handset OEM has aggressively deployed our mobile wallet solution now across its entire portfolio, whereas in the past the adoption had been only deployed on limited premium models. This customer is strategically focused on increasing its market share in both the domestic, China and global handset market, and as a result has significantly increased its 2019 launch and build plans. As a proof point, NXP experienced a significant ramp in demand during Q2, and this is a great example of how customers are perceiving the value of NXP's mobile wallet, especially in the domestic Chinese market for mass transit access. Kurt will review the specific details in a moment. In summary, our strategy continues to yield positive results. We will continue to drive focus in our strategic end markets, engaging with customers to deliver superior, highly differentiated products regardless of the short-term fluctuations in demand. I'd like to now pass the call over to Kurt to discuss the results of the current quarter.
Kurt Sievers: Thanks, Rich. And good morning, everyone. I'm really glad to be able to speak with you all today. Overall, our Q2 results were about the midpoint of our guidance, with the contribution from the mobile markets somewhat strong than planned, while the demand in the auto markets was slightly weaker. Taken together, NXP delivered revenue of $2.22 billion, which combined with good expense control enabled us to successfully deliver operating profitability above the higher end of our guidance range. Let me turn to the specific trends in Q2 in our focused end markets. Automotive revenue was $1.03 billion, down 10% year-on-year, in line with our guidance. Based on the most recently available IHS data, year-on-year global car production trends continue to be revised down, especially in China and Europe, the two largest auto manufacturing markets, while the North American market slowed modestly. This had the effect of slightly weaker-than-anticipated shipment in Q2 for NXP. Revenue in all our major product categories declined versus the year-ago period as anticipated, except for revenue from ADAS, especially radar, which was up double-digits, a continued reflection of NXP's differentiated product offerings and our strong customer traction, very much in line with how Rick laid it out just a minute ago. In industrial and IOT, revenue was $390 million, down 14% year-on-year, in line with our expectations as the demand for general purpose MCU products in the broad based China market continues to be very weak. However, we saw the expected double-digit year-on-year growth of our cross-over processor products, albeit from a small overall base today. Remember, our industrial and IOT business is primarily serviced through our global distribution partners and relies on tens of thousands of smaller customers, which appear to be particularly effective by the continued US-China trade tension. Let me turn to mobile. Revenue was $297 million, up 25% year-on-year, better than our expectations. As Rick just mentioned, we continue to see the attach rate of our mobile transaction solutions grow with a broader set of customers and moving from premium to volume and all the way to feature phones. Specifically, in Q2, we saw a large Chinese handset customer who is focused on increasing his market share globally and locally and ramped orders on us, a touch more than what we had anticipated. Lastly, our communication and infrastructure segment, revenue was $499 million, up 19% year-on-year, in line with our guidance. All associated product lines grew during Q2 with RF power solutions continuing to drive strong double-digit growth versus the year-ago period. And consistent with last quarter, we experienced strong annual growth in our shipments for both our massive MIMO and high-powered, single-channel RF power amplifiers, with the increased demand spread across nearly all the global base station OEMs. Now, turning to our expectations for quarter three. In the auto and industrial and IOT markets, our guidance reflects ongoing subdued ordering trends due to macro uncertainty, combined with the anticipated pause in the communications infrastructure market after the blistering pace of growth over the last quarters. And better than our Q3 mobile guidance is what we would consider normal sequential order rates from our largest premium handset customer offset by a sequential step down from the Chinese handset customer we previously discussed. Taken together, this is [indiscernible] what some analysts would consider seasonality of our mobile business into Q3 of this year. We currently anticipate total revenue will be in a range of flat to up 2% sequentially. At the midpoint of our range, this is an increase of 1% sequentially or $2.24 billion. From a year-over-year perspective, this represents a decline of about 8% versus the same period a year ago, which 120 basis points is the elimination of the MSA versus the year-ago period. At the midpoint, we do anticipate the following sequential trends in our business. Automotive is expected to be up low-single digits versus Q2. Industrial and IOT is expected to be up in the upper single-digit range on a percentage basis. Mobile is expected to be down in the low-single digits on a percentage basis. And, finally, Communications Infrastructure and Other is expected to be down in the low-single digits on a percentage basis. We believe the short-term demand environment continues to be challenging and has incrementally weakened versus our prior view. And yet, we do still anticipate the second half of the year to be greater than the first half, so at a lesser rate than assumed earlier this year. In summary, our new product introductions, customer engagement levels and design win momentum in our strategic focus areas continue to be very positive. And we continue to be very optimistic about the long-term potential of NXP. And with that, I would like to pass the call to you, Peter, for a review of our financial performance.
Peter Kelly: Thank you, Kurt. And good morning to everyone on today's call. As Kurt has already covered the drivers of the revenue during the quarter and provided our revenue outlook for Q3, I'll move to the financial highlights. In summary, our Q2 revenue performance was just above the midpoint of guidance, which combined with good expense control resulted in a very strong non-GAAP operating profit. Focusing on the detail for Q3, total revenue was $2.22 billion, down 3% year-on-year, of which 160 basis points was the elimination of the MSA versus the year-ago period. We generated $1.2 billion in non-GAAP gross profit and reported a non-GAAP gross margin of 53.3%, up 50 basis points year-on-year and in line with the midpoint of our guidance. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $541 million, down $50 million year-on-year and down $6 million from Q1. This was $12 million better than the midpoint of our guidance. From a total operating profit perspective, non-GAAP operating profit was $640 million and non-GAAP operating margin was 28.9%, up 190 basis points year-on-year despite a $73 million drop in revenue over the same period. Interest expense was $61 million. Cash taxes for ongoing operations were $30 million. And non-controlling interests were $5 million, all modestly better than the midpoint of our guidance. Stock-based compensation, which is not included in our non-GAAP earnings, was $87 million. Now, I'd like to turn to the changes in the cash and debt. Our total debt at the end of Q2 was $8.54 billion, up $1.2 billion sequentially as we issued $1.75 billion of new debt and retired $600 million of existing debt. Cash was $3.03 billion. Net debt was $5.51 billion, slightly up on Q1. We exited the quarter with a trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA of $3.15 billion. And our ratio of net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of Q2 was 1.75 times. And our non-GAAP interest coverage was 10.5 times. Our liquidity is excellent and our balance sheet continues to be very strong. During Q2, we returned $716 million to shareholders as we bought about 6.6 million shares for $645 million and paid $71 million in cash dividends. Turning to working capital metrics, days of inventory was 100 days, a decrease of 13 days sequentially and a quarter-on-quarter decline of $97 million. We continue to aggressively manage our distribution channel. And inventory in the channel was very healthy at 2.4 months within our long-term targets. Days receivable were 32 days, a decrease of 3 days sequentially. And days payable was 67, a decrease of 7 days versus the prior quarter. Taken together, our conversion cycle was 65 days, an improvement of nine days versus the prior quarter. Cash flow from operations was $517 million and net CapEx was $106 million, resulting in free cash flow of $411 million. Turning to our expectations for the third quarter, as Kurt mentioned, we anticipate third quarter revenue to be about $2.24 billion, plus or minus $30 million. At the midpoint, this is up 1% sequentially. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be about 53.7%, plus or minus 30 basis points. Operating expenses are expected to be about $536 million, plus or minus about $10 million. And taken together, we see non-GAAP operating margin to be about 29.7%, plus or minus about 20 basis points. We estimate interest expense to be about $69 million and anticipate cash tax related to ongoing operations to be about $41 million. Non-controlling interest will be about $10 million, reflecting improved loadings at SSMC. I'd like to provide an update on our share repurchase program. As previously mentioned during the second quarter, we've brought back approximately 6.6 million shares at a cost of $645 million. Since the beginning of Q3 2018, we have repurchased just over 69 million shares for a total $6.33 billion. Combined with our quarterly cash dividend, we've returned $6.55 billion to our owners over this period. Our capital strategy continues to be to return all excess cash to our owners while maintaining a target leverage ratio of 2 times net debt to trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA. During the second quarter, we announced the acquisition of Marvel connectivity assets for $1.76 billion. And as we build cash to pay for this asset, we will likely pause our share repurchase program for the balance of 2019. So, for the third quarter, we suggest that, for modeling purposes, you use an average share count of 284 million shares. Finally, I have some closing comments I'd like to make. Firstly, as previously , the NXP board of directors has decided that NXP will become a US domestic filer as of August 2019, but we will continue to be a Dutch domicile company. As a result, in October, we will our first quarterly 10-Q financial statements and we will submit our annual 10-K in February of 2020. We believe this will ultimately lead to NXP being included in the various broad-based US equity indexes. Secondly, as Rick highlighted, we're very positive about the acquisition of the Marvel connectivity assets and we've now submitted all the required regulatory pre-merger notifications. We've received an early termination clearance from the US Federal Trade Commission on July 11 and continue to expect that all regulatory approvals will be complete by the first quarter of 2020, with a possibility that the remaining approvals could be obtained earlier. As Kurt pointed out, we are pleased with our performance in Q2. Our revenue was slightly better than guidance and with the contribution from the mobile markets a bit stronger-than-expected, while the automotive market was slightly weaker. Our expectations are that revenue in the second half of the year will be greater than in the first half of the year. However, the absolute performance is likely to be weaker than we originally anticipated at the beginning of the year – or for that matter, at the end of last quarter. Our non-GAAP margin improved again in Q2 and we anticipate further improvements in to Q3 as we continue to work towards our intermediate target of 55% exiting Q4 2019 on flat year-on-year revenue. I continue to have confidence in our ability to deliver the improvements under our control, particularly as regards to cost control. However, given the current environment, it's difficult to predict what the final revenue for the fourth quarter and its impact on gross margin might be. So, with that, I'd now like to turn the call back over to the operator for your questions.
Jeff Palmer: Sonya, we'll now poll for questions please.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Craig Hettenbach of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Craig Hettenbach: Great. Thank you. First question. Just, Rick, talk about the current environment. Like you said, things have still gotten a bit worse here from a macro perspective. But just curious to see how you're seeing distributors act during this period of time. I think last quarter you mentioned you could've shipped 40 more into distribution than you did and you kind of held back. So, how you managed it this quarter and as you look into Q3?
Richard Clemmer: Yeah, thanks. I think the market environment hasn't changed significantly. We have anticipated that we would see some improvements in the second half of the year. And clearly, that's been pushed out. We do see a little bit of improvement in China, I would say. And I think that comes down to just the fact that their inventory levels are down – where now when they have orders, they have to order product to be able to supply those.0 However, at the same time, we've seen Europe weaken and we've seen the US weaken. When you look at our distributor partners, they are clearly not having the same performance levels they were as you look at their announcement of their results, with even one of them doing a preannouncement associated with it. So, I think the environment continues to stay quite uncertain. The improvements that we had anticipated have definitely been moved out, although we still are improving slightly as we show from the base. Clearly, automotive is improving. We've been fortunate that we had the strength of our infrastructure and 5G deployment over the last couple of quarters. And clearly, the large mobile customer, they deployed on more broadly based in Q2. It then requires a little bit of adjustment in Q3 after they filled up their supply chain. So, all of that comes together to kind of create a little bit of an uncertain environment, I would say, on a continuous basis and not the uptick that we have anticipated for Q3 and going forward at this point yet.
Craig Hettenbach: Okay. Appreciate the context there, Rick. And just a follow-up for Kurt on the automotive side, particularly for BMS, just kind of how you're feeling about from a design perspective, what you're seeing in the market for new designs around BMS?
Kurt Sievers: Yeah. Thanks, Craig. Now, clearly, we do see continued strong traction on the design side since BMS is 100% function of the traction and penetration of all levels of electric vehicles, all the way from mild hybrids over hybrids to fully electric vehicles. Our traction on the design win side is good. And we do see now in the second half of this year, the first more significant shipments going. I think we talked earlier about the fact that a large European OEM is going into full production in the second half of this year with a fully-electric vehicle, which we serve 100%. So, from that perspective, we are very much on track, Craig, with what we have expected on the BMS side. I might want to give you a little bit more detail on the different levels and the different silicon levels – content silicon levels in the different sorts of vehicles. So, we are especially focused now and have a very high success rate in the low and mid-voltage electric vehicles. This contains mild hybrid and full-hybrid vehicles. In those vehicles, we do see silicon content from NXP in the range of $50 to $90 per car. That contains the microcontroller and it contains all the analog front-end chips on each of the battery cells. Obviously, the larger the batteries, the more cells, the more analog front-ends and the higher the silicon content. That's why I give you this range of $50 to $90. For those particular vehicles, our design win rates continues to be in a range of, I would say, 80% hit rate. So, from all the visibility we have into open design win funnel, we continue to win about 80%, which is truly high. This is next to the fully electric vehicles. I just quoted to you that, with this large European OEM, we are going into production as we speak. Those cars, we call high-voltage BMS system. So, they typically go all the way up to 800 volts. They have a somewhat higher silicon content. Here we can cover between $80 and $160 per vehicle. And also, there, our traction is good, but not as high as the 80%, which I quoted for the low-to-mid voltage cars. So, Craig, I know that went a little bit deeper than you might have expected, but since this is such an area of high interest, I felt it was appropriate to give you a bit more granularity here.
Craig Hettenbach: Appreciate that. Thank you.
Jeff Palmer: Operator, we'll take the next caller please.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from John Pitzer, Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
John Pitzer: Yes. Good morning, guys. Congratulations on the solid results. My first question, just one inventory management, you guys did a really good job in the June quarter both with channel inventory and inventory on your own balance sheet. Peter, I'm kind of curious if you can give us some sort of guidance looking into September of how you think your own inventory days will trend? And I guess, importantly, as part of your gross margin target of 55% again in the year, were there any utilization actions that you've taken that that were a headwind that started to become a tailwind as you thought about managing inventory?
Peter Kelly: As always, really good questions, John. First of all, on distribution, we talked in the past that we just managed the distribution inventory really, really tightly and don't ship in until they're more or less proven they've shipped out. In terms of internal inventory, it's been a challenge the last 3 or 4 quarters to show an improvement in inventory as the revenues kind of suffered from the kind of lighter demand in the marketplace, but we finally caught up this quarter. My internal target is 95 days. I'm not sure I can kind of get there in this coming quarter, but I would not expect our inventory to go up in terms of days. So, it should be somewhere between 98 and 100 days. We have been hit by some utilization issues as you were suggesting in Q1, Q2 and Q3 and we'll see some of the relief from that in Q4. So, yes, there you go.
Richard Clemmer: I think it's probably particularly worthwhile to point out, John, as you can tell from our inventory, we've been very cautious with our manufacturing operation. So, we would not try to load them up to put product in inventory as we understand some of our competitors have.
John Pitzer: That's helpful. And, Rick, maybe as my follow-up, I wonder if you can just comment a little about the US-China trade issues and whether or not either directly or indirectly the Huawei ban impacted either your June quarter or September quarter either on the mobile or the infrastructure side?
Richard Clemmer: Yeah. So, I think the trade issues between the US and China, they continue to be quite unclear. We really are not the most knowledgeable source of information. Relative to Huawei specifically, we continue to follow the US guidelines and trade policies. We have been shipping and will ship again in Q3. There are some limited product areas where we have US sourced technology that we've not been able to ship to Huawei at the current time, but it's a pretty de minimis impact, not really a significant financial impact for NXP.
John Pitzer: Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.
Jeff Palmer: Thanks, John.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from William Stein of SunTrust. Your line is now open.
William Stein: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I'm hoping you can comment on margins or, said another way, OpEx. I think you've provided sort of goal posts to get to 23.5% of revs spent on OpEx by Q4. I assume that's pushed out a little bit owing to the slightly slower demand you highlighted, but any update there would be helpful. Thank you.
Peter Kelly: We continue to manage OpEx pretty tightly. We're going full out to get to 16% on R&D and 7.5% for SG&A. You've seen in – both on our Q2 actual and our Q3 guidance, we do have some flexibility on what we can do. And I think Rick talked in the past that we've not been replacing attrition as we go forward and certainly any hiring we do for new positions is very, very limited. So, that's helped us. We do have some flexibility with our incentive compensation. So, reflecting the lack of growth in the businesses has had an impact on our incentive compensation. But, on the other hand, we continue to invest aggressively in the programs that we think will drive the future success of our company. So, you see mask charges in particular are usually a big item and can move cost around from quarter to quarter. Absolutely, we've not given up on the 16% and 7.5%, Will, and we'll either get there or get very close, I think, this year and talk about that for future years as well.
Richard Clemmer: Yeah. Will, it's probably worthwhile to add that we've also taken out low performers, several hundreds of low performers as we tried to manage our cost base in addition to the attrition non-replacement that Peter had talked about. So, we continue to be very tight relative to our investments and go through a lot of review of the strategic investments we are making to ensure that the timing is absolutely required, but yet we want to be sure that we're not putting any of the growth plans in any of our customer relationships in any kind of risk or jeopardy at all.
William Stein: That's great. Very helpful. I appreciate it. If I can follow up, on the handset growth and subsequent sort of fall off in the coming quarter, I thought that, either last quarter or inter-quarter, you had highlighted at least one other region where there were strengths outside of China. Are you seeing a broader than anticipated adoption of mobile wallet and did you see that in the quarter? Am I correct that they were – there's more than just this one vendor of China you referred to?
Richard Clemmer: There definitely is. We've been very successful in India, as we mentioned, where the mobile wallet has actually been deployed on phones as low as $25 phone. Now, in the current quarters, they've already built up their supply chain and they're kind of trying to absorb that and achieve their deployment to the market. So, it's not nearly as significant an impact in Q2 or even the Q3 outlook as it has been earlier, but it definitely represents another significant proof point. But this customer in China, the encouraging thing was, we've been very successful with him on their high end smart phone deployments. And because of the success we've had with China Transit and the ease of use of passengers getting on transit systems in a much more effective manner, they've now deployed this across their entire portfolio. And they are very aggressive in their intent and goals and increasing their position in the mobile market, and so we're encouraged about being able to support them. But in Q2 specifically, they ramped up. As they made their decision to go across the entire portfolio, we had to ramp up their supply chain and then we go through a normalization process in future quarters. So, the Q2 did have a ramp associated with that that didn't fall us off in Q3 for that specific customer in China.
William Stein: It's very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein Research. Your line is now open.
Stacy Rasgon: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask a little about the three-year model. That model was, I guess, starting in 2019 and going forward for a few years. But 2019 obviously is going to be weaker than anticipated. How does the weakness in 2019 affect that through your model at all? And where does the – I guess, additional growth would have to come in the last two years to make up for the weakness in the first two, where does that growth comes from?
Richard Clemmer: So, Stacy, it was actually 2018 through 2021. So, the base year was 2018. Really, we don't see that being a material impact. I think what we could see is some of the categories, the areas that we have, changing somewhat, but we believe that, in total, we're still on track. But we have to go through the process and it depends obviously on how long this slowdown in industry were to continue. But, really, the key for this is the design wins and the company specific ramp in revenue that we have associated with that where we continue to be very encouraged in the growth areas of automotive that we talked about, specifically in radar in the near term for level 2 and 3. The crossover processors that continue to be a strong contributor and will continue to add more and more as we go forward in the future quarters with the increased revenue associated with that. And clearly, 5G representing an opportunity above what we actually had in the growth guidelines at that time. So, I think we're still in the ballpark associated with it, but we clearly have to do some work and understand how long it takes us to get through this industry slowdown to actually be able to confirm that, Stacy.
Stacy Rasgon: Got it. Thanks. And, I guess, to follow-up on that around auto, so the auto business for the first three quarters of the year with the guidance down, call it, like mid to high single digits and with the strength in radar and BMS and some of the others that are growing quite a bit, it implies sort of the more traditional part of the portfolio is even worse than that. So, obviously, SAAR is down this year, but it's not going to be down I don't think that much. Is this just inventory correction? And if that's the case, is it reasonable to expect that to rebound as the inventories sort of flush out as we drive into next year? Would it be reasonable to assume that we could do better than normal next year coming off of this?
Kurt Sievers: Stacy, this is Kurt. Let me try and answer that. So, first of all, yes, the latest SAAR forecast – and you know that we typically use IHS – has deteriorated unfortunately again. So, I think a quarter ago, we talked about a 3% SAAR decline this year. The latest IHS forecast we got just 10 days ago was minus 4%. So, 4% decline. And actually, if you look through the report from the big tier 1s, so like Continental, Aaptiv, Bosch and others, they estimate more like 5%. Now, our model still sits on IHS, which is from third party source, but indeed it has deteriorated. Obviously, somewhere in the minus 4% to minus 5% area. Now, coming back to your question, yes, this inventory effect is something we've seen through the past cycles too, which means that the auto semi market declines stronger going into this and bouncing back stronger going out of it. The question is obviously when is the moment of change of direction, which I don't dare to forecast. The only thing I would tell you is that, if you look on an annual growth basis into our quarters, then in quarter two, we did a report a minus 10% decline in automotive. And the quarter 3 guide which we just gave you is now minus 7%. So, we see at least from Q2 – against Q2 comparison perspective annually, it's getting slightly better. If this is the indication of things really moving out, I don't know, but at least also the SAAR is reported by IHS in the second half to get slightly better led by China because China seasonally always has a much better second half than the first half. And IHS is thinking about a 14% second half over first half growth in other production in China. I don't know if that is true, but certainly directionally it should be right that this is changing now second half to first half.
Stacy Rasgon: Got it. Thank you.
Jeff Palmer: Right. Thanks Stacy.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Ross Seymore: Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask you question. I want to focus on the industrial and IOT side of things. I know the crossover processors are a great source of growth and you guys have been in line with your guidance in the last quarter and seem to be accelerating seasonally in the third quarter. But, overall, it's still down about 15% year-over-year. Can you talk a little bit about what's weighing on that? Is it just the inventory burn in the channel or is there anything else? And how do you expect that growth to resume? Somewhat similar to the last question, once that inventory burn is done, is there kind of a super-sized reacceleration as the channel starts to refill.
Richard Clemmer: So, Ross, I think you're absolutely right. If you look at it, our industrial and IoT for the last couple of quarters had been down around 14% year-over-year. And our guidance, while up 8% in Q3, would still be down around that same level year-over-year. I don't think that we can be specific on the inventory levels. You've got to remember that on industrial and IoT, probably 80% of that goes to the distribution channel. And so, we're really kind of at the mercy, if you will, of our distribution partners to understand what's happening with the customers. There's not any perception of ongoing inventory. It's really this quagmire. What I said last quarter, the market is kind of frozen, specifically in China, with the fear about what's going to happen in the trade tensions and we don't see a significant improvement overall, although I do think we see a little bit of improvement in China, but at the same time we've seen a weakening in Europe, in the US that kind of offsets that. So in total, we're kind of in the same position in industrial and IoT. Now, at the same point, as you look at the new design wins that we have in the crossover areas as those begin to ramp, we should see a revenue contribution from that, but that's going to be at a slow rate and it'll be a positive contribution, but it won't move the needle significantly on any individual quarter. It's more of the cumulative impact of those design wins and how they get deployed in the market, which clearly should put us in a better position as we go out a few quarters.
Ross Seymore: That's helpful. And for my follow-up, I just want to switch over to the com infrastructure and other segment. You talked about the 5G side pausing a bit. Can you just walk through how you see that rolling out for the different stages of 5G and maybe remind us what percentage roughly of that kind of 21%, 22% of your total revenues in that segment the com infrastructure side truly represents?
Richard Clemmer: Yeah. On a percentage of that, it's…
Kurt Sievers: Probably, two-thirds between the RF power and digital networking business.
Richard Clemmer: Yeah. If you include digital networking associated, it was two-thirds. It's probably about a half for the RF power or just slightly under half based on the growth we've seen. But, really, the growth that we've seen, Ross, has been in the massive MIMO deployment where they're expanding the capacity associated with their installed infrastructure. And now, in the future, when they move to 5G deployments, they can upgrade that with a software deployment to be able to facilitate 5G. So, really, what we're seeing that's creating a significant increase in revenue has been the massive MIMO deployment and not 5G per se. We've seen some 5G impact, but it's really been much more significantly weighted towards massive MIMO. And we basically have a pauses, as we've been saying that we would anticipate a pause after our customers are ramping up their supply chain. We still see very positive scenario in what's going on and, clearly, continue deployment through the rest of this year and next year in massive MIMO and believe our successes is quite positive in that area. And then, we would anticipate seeing the 5G ramp itself happening much more strongly in 2020. And it kind of depends on when it gets rolled out in China. We've seen some pull in of the rollout of 5G base stations in China as they appear to want to accelerate their 5G deployment.
Ross Seymore: Thank you.
Jeff Palmer: Thanks Ross.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You're line is now open.
Vivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. I had two as well. First on gross margins, I believe, Peter, you mentioned that you're still kind of targeting 55% exiting Q4. So, that would be about 130 basis points or so of sequential improvement. I'm curious, what are the puts and takes around that? What kind of revenue or mix assumptions underlie that? Because usually your Q4, that has been up. Some years, it's been down. Some years – if I assume it's flat, that would signal some year-on-year sales decline. So, I'm just curious to understand what is the sensitivity of gross margins to that kind of revenue profile.
Peter Kelly: Well, what I've talked about in the past, I've said based on flat revenue from Q4 2018 to Q4 2019, we would move up from 53% to 55%. And I talked about – we saw some normal headwinds from price, so ASP, and they would be offset by mix. So, we had about 230 basis points of self-help and I think just over half of that was in supply pricing or maybe just less than half. So, where am I at the moment? So, at the moment, I'm really, really confident on the self-help part. So, I think that's in the bag and we started to see some of the impacts of that from Q1 into Q2 and Q2 into Q3. At the moment, I really don't know where we'll end up on revenue. As we said in our comments, although the situation hasn't gotten worse, versus where we were 90 days ago, if it hasn't strengthened, then we feel a little bit more uncomfortable than we did then. So, flat revenue, I would say 55% is in the bag. If revenue is not flat of Q4, then previously we've said – and it's a very, very rough guideline, a 5% drop in revenue is about 100 basis points of impact to gross margin. But it really depends on what the mix of the change is and is it internal or external. So, it's not an absolute serving. I guess in terms of things I have under our control, very, very confident, incrementally more confident than I was three months ago. But we'll need to wait and see how the revenue plays out for Q4. Definitely I think we've done the right thing structurally and it will put us in good shape for when things come back.
Vivek Arya: Thanks. And for my follow-up, I'm curious about the 30% of your business in automotive tied to ADAS and electrification where you – I think breaking the past, set at 25%, 30% growth target, how did that do in Q2 and what are the trends in the second half? Do you think the macro environment is impacting that growth part of the autos business or there is a secular aspect to it and that is still continuing for your original targets? Thank you.
Rick Clemmer: I'll make a couple of comments and I'll let Kurt talk. I think the fact that – the thing is, as we see clearly a softness in auto demand, it does have some impact on those growth areas as well. They're not ramping up quite as fast. They still are growing very significantly, but not quite as fast as we would have been anticipated originally. So, it does have some impact, but clearly we see a strong growth associated with those areas and specifically radar.
Kurt Sievers: Yeah, Rick. So, clearly, we do confirm double-digit growth. We did achieve that in Q2 as expected. But with the SAAR being maybe then more in the minus 5% area versus a zero or plus 2%, obviously, there is some impact. But this is nothing of any relevance for the mid to longer term because the rents are still very much dependent on penetration of the functionality, as Rick had laid out for radar in his prepared remarks. So, over and above, we are very confident to continue to expect 25% to 30% revenue growth over the next three years in that portion of the auto business. And I just want to remind you again that it's mainly ADAS radar, digital clusters and somewhat later, because it comes today from a smaller base, the battery management business.
Craig Hettenbach: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Blayne Curtis of Barclays. You're line is now open.
Blayne Curtis: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. Just one, just on the OpEx side, I noticed you moved about $80 million to assets held for sale. I know it's fairly small. Just wondering if you could comment on that. Or if you can't, just maybe – just strategically, any comments on that kind of initiative. And then, you mentioned UWB, maybe sounds like that'll get maybe some adoption on the mobile side this year in the market. I'm just kind of curious for you, when you see that ramping, anyway you can kind of size that market? Thanks.
Kurt Sievers: So, the asset held for sale, we can't tell you specifically what it is, but we're doing due diligence to dispose of a very small part of our business at the moment and hopefully we will wrap that up before the end of the year. So, we've moved that asset to held for sale.
Richard Clemmer: And it's non-strategic in a business that we just felt like was better off being in somebody else's hands than ours. On ultra-wideband, it really won't start shipping till 2020, not this year. And we're extremely excited about the opportunity there. In fact, I'm going to let Kurt make some comments on that as well.
Kurt Sievers: Yeah. So, it's really an equal system place which leverages, is an excellent way, our strong foothold from a technology end market perspective and secure cars as well as mobile transactions and security. Revenue impact, we will start to see by middle of next year, ramping. We think this will be a market which is almost a billion in 2024. And as Rick explained earlier, with our first mover advantage, with our strong foothold and creation of the ecosystem itself, we do think we will have a leading market share in that field.
Richard Clemmer: So, very exciting, Blayne.
Blayne Curtis: Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. And our question comes from Matt Ramsay of Cowen. Your line is now open.
Matthew Ramsay: Thank you very much. Good morning. I just wanted to follow-up to the last question there on UWB. Kurt, maybe you could talk a little bit about what other standards are out there that are competing with UWB? And then, on the flip side, are there other ecosystem partners and potentially other chipmakers that are involved such that this could be an industrywide standard as it rolls out? Thanks.
Kurt Sievers: Yeah. So, on the standard side, there is an IEEE initiative underway for a very first standardization of the physical layer hardware protocol to make sure that it means different vendors can ship compatible product. That has been underway for a while. It is supported by all the key companies through the whole value chain. So, clearly, any ingredient from our experience, which is needed for a successful connectivity standard is fully in place. Relative to competing technologies of standard, the only one which directionally comes somewhere in the proximity, but really doesn't get there really is Bluetooth low energy, which has some ranging capability, but it lacks by far the precision of ultra-wideband. So, I just want to reiterate, the key feature of ultrawideband is it measures time of flight and through that it can detect exactly where the communicating objects are relative to each other. So, it's all about precision in distance measurement. Bluetooth low energy can do a little bit of that, but it's far from it from a precision perspective. That's why our key partners along the value chain have clearly decided for ultrawideband. It's a very, very clear and definitive choice in that field. The other one which maybe didn't come across clearly, a lot of this has to do with security. So, we always play in door access or car access applications which we are seeing here, together with our secure element. So, it is the combination of the secure element and the ultrawideband connectivity technology which makes the use case fly. And that combination, I dare to say, is pretty unique.
Craig Hettenbach: Got you. Thanks for that color. Just as a quick follow-up, I continue to get the question from investors, so I'll just bring it up again, the visibility towards doubling the Marvel revenue run rate of the business you're acquiring. If you guys have any more color on design win pipeline visibility or I guess a focus on Wi-Fi 6? It's just a question that keeps coming up, so I'm just relaying it along. Thanks very much.
Richard Clemmer: Sure. I think our confidence comes from the combination of the portfolio. They're leading technology and Wi-Fi 6, our broad-based distribution channel that's much more broad based than Marvel – while Marvel has a fine distribution channel, our position in distribution clearly puts us in a better basis. And the fact is, as we talk about our processing customers, two-thirds of our design wins have had Wi-Fi connectivity associated with it. And being able to supply a Wi-Fi 6 solution in combination with our processing puts us in a really unique position to be able to grow that business much faster. So, I think all of those things are the combination that really gives us the ability to project doubling that business in a relatively short period of time. And the reason why it was so critical to us to be able to meet our customers' requirements. We're very fortunate to have the funds available from the Qualcomm breakup fee to be able to put connectivity in place, and so we're looking forward to closing the transaction, so we can offer a complete solution for our customers.
Kurt Sievers: So, let me maybe just add that, now we are in some way into this process, although with customers. Clearly, the customer reactions are very positive and very reconfirming on the fit of the portfolio complementary nature of Wi-Fi 6 with our [indiscernible]. So, what was theory in the first place, obviously, we get now more specific feedback from customers, and that's both for industrial as well as for auto. It's very reconfirming to the numbers which we have put out.
Operator: Thank you.
Jeff Palmer: Sonya, we'll take one last question this morning please.
Operator: And our last question comes from Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Toshiya Hari: Hey, guys. Thanks very much for squeezing me in. I just had one on capital allocation. After the Marvell acquisition, assuming it closed in line with schedule, how should we think about the balance between M&A and dividends and buybacks? Would it be fair to assume that you feel like your technology and IP portfolio is somewhat complete post Marvell or would M&A continue to play a critical role in your strategy? Thank you.
Richard Clemmer: Yeah. Thanks. I think we have most of the critical components that we really feel like we need going forward. I'm sure that we'll always have some tuck-in acquisitions that we need to do to either strengthen a technical position or with some other pieces that happen, but the Marvell acquisition on the connectivity side is clearly one that was significant and one that we were getting a lot of demand from our customers. So, I think that really builds out most of the requirement. I think as we look at analog attach, we are trying to see what we can do to improve that. That's a focus area for us. Fortunately, we have a lot of internal capability associated with that, specifically in the [indiscernible] that we ship alongside of our processing capability to drive a complete solution. But I think you're absolutely right, most of our focus on the cash return post the Marvell transaction will be focused on share repurchase and our dividend as we move forward. And we've talked about that we would anticipate or plan to increase our dividend on an annual basis moving it up to more in line with our normal semiconductor industry peers.
Toshiya Hari: Thank you.
Richard Clemmer: So thanks everyone for joining us this morning. We clearly felt like that we had good performance in Q2. And while we see improvements up that Q2 base continuing, they're not at the same rate we would have anticipated 90 days ago as we have seen a little bit of a reset in the marketplace based on the continued trade friction and the uncertainty that's now beginning to have an impact in other regions of the world as well. But we're encouraged about our design wins and the portfolio we have and continuing to be in a position to outgrow the market going forward and create and continue to increase significant shareholder value. Thank you very much.
A - Kurt Sievers: Thank you, everyone. Appreciate your attendance today. Have a good day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all disconnect.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-04-30 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q1 2019 NXP Semiconductors Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today’s conference Mr. Jeff Palmer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Jeff Palmer: Thanks, Meteras, and good morning everyone. Welcome to the NXP Semiconductors first quarter 2019 earnings call. With me on the call today is Rick Clemmer, NXP's CEO; Kurt Sievers, NXP's President; and Peter Kelly, our CFO. If you've not obtained a copy of our earnings press release, it can be found at our company website under the Investor Relations section at nxp.com. This call is being recorded and will be available for replay from our corporate website. Our call today will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause NXP's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the macroeconomic impact on the specific end markets in which we operate, the sale of new and existing products, and our expectations for financial results for the second quarter of 2019. Please be reminded NXP undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements. For a full disclosure on forward-looking statements, please refer to our press release. Additionally, during our call today, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the impact of purchase price accounting, restructuring, stock-based compensation, impairment, merger-related costs, and other charges that are primarily by discrete events that management does not consider to be directly related to NXP's underlying core operating performance. Pursuant to Regulation G, NXP has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our first quarter 2019 earnings press release, which will be furnished to the SEC on Form 6-K and is available on NXP's website in the Investor Relations section at nxp.com. Now I would like to turn the call over to Rick.
Rick Clemmer: Thanks, Jeff, for that enlightening opening. And welcome everyone to our conference call today. Today we are going to take a new approach to our prepared remarks. I'll start off and provide some longer term strategic commentary, then Kurt Sievers, who is the President of the company will review the end market revenue details of Q1 and provide some revenue guidance for Q2. And finally, Peter Kelly will review the financial details of the quarter and expectations for Q2. Now for all of those - that have followed the company for a while, no we spend a lot of our efforts assuring that our product portfolio is aligned to the long-term customer needs in our chosen application segments. We believe if we consistently make the right product development decisions this will result in very sticky high relative market share positions and true leadership, which should allow us to outgrow the market by 1.5 times. If we look at a few of the major themes from our September 2018 Analyst Day and the progress we've achieved they clearly reflect the positive traction. First, our automotive sales was just over $4.5 billion in 2018. And we continue to be the number one ranked global automotive semiconductor supplier. We have gained share in the strategic areas of auto processing, ADAS radar solutions and digital clusters. According to the strategic strategy analytics, NXP is the leading supplier of both automotive processing and infotainment applications processors. 30% of our auto business is focused on high growth sectors like ADAS and electrification which has grown at nearly 40% in compounded growth rate since 2015 and which we expect to continue to grow at 20% - 25% to 30% compounded growth rate as the businesses becomes more material in size. The other 70% of our automotive business represents a very large and entrenched core business with hot barriers to entry. We anticipate our core business will grow at a modest premium to the overall auto semiconductor market. Our deep customer relationships with both Tier 1 suppliers, as well as the OEMs enable us to gain long-term insights into the requirements. It is these relationships, combined with our world class IP which has allowed us to expand in new high growth application solutions. As an example, our ADAS business which currently represents about 10% of our total automotive revenue has grown at over 50% compounded annual growth rate since 2015. In a few short years, we have emerged as the number one supplier for the complete radar subsystem, including the 77 gigahertz front-end transceivers, the ISO D [ph] compliant vacuum processing engine, power management and the high speed interconnect, all tied together with our software. Based on design wins, we are - that we are currently shipping and designs we have been awarded with major OEMs, we see the business continuing to grow in the high 20% range through 2021 and beyond. We believe this growth rate is about 1.4 times faster than the overall ADAS radar market, which is still in its relative infancy. Another new auto business we are very excited about is our Battery Management System, our BMS products for electric power trains, which we have learned from customers, particularly the actual battery manufacturers is the need to increase the efficiency and resulting range of the battery subsystem. To be able to achieve that requires the ability to monitor and take real time action on the health of the battery on a cell by cell basis. What is required is the combination of precision analog capability ISOD functional and safety expertise and deep automotive process know-how. Our team has developed a truly unique solution which combines these capabilities. While the business is relatively small today at about $50 million dollars on an annualized run rate basis, it has doubled over the last year, as more global auto and OEMs expand their electric vehicle offerings we are actively engaged winning designs and anticipate emerging in a leadership position versus current existing suppliers. We think the BMS market is a subset of the overall power control market. We expand about $800 million in 2021 at about a 30% compounded growth rate. If we expand the designs we have been awarded and are beginning to ship, we think this business could easily be several hundred million dollars of revenue in 2021. Now looking at our industrial and IoT business, which is about $1.8 billion in 2018, it is primarily made up of our broad microcontrollers in application processor portfolios, along with some analog attach. This is a business which is levered to the secular trends of the increased processing and security requirements of the edge in IoT market. NXP is in a unique position to address the market demands for higher performance microcontrollers which are combined with functional audio visual capabilities and features normally found in applications processors. We term this the crossover processing market. We see the addressable market for crossover processors growing about - from about $270 million in 2018 to just under $1.5 billion by 2023, our 40% five year compounded growth rate. We are already seeing great traction for this class of products which range from our RT, ULP and M scale LP families the processors. End application span from the secure AI powered factory automation and building control in the industrial space to home audio solutions enabling full Dolby Atmos support, down to high volumes, smart home in ultra low power wearable type devices. To be specific, we just received our Dolby 1.6 Atmos certification last week based on a multi-core crossover processor, as opposed to the previous solutions based on multi DSPs. We're seeing very good early traction on these families of processors and anticipate our crossover business will grow into a multi $100 million business by 2022. These are just three exciting product areas that we believe will differentiate NXP in the coming years. Clearly our strategy is yielding positive results, enabled us to aggressively return capital. Since the termination of the Qualcomm transaction through our report today, we've aggressively reduced the total number of shares outstanding by approximately 65 million shares or about 19% of the float and returned over $6 billion to our shareholders. A testament to the strong free cash flow of our business - that our business creates, based on our long-term strategic decisions. I'd like now to pass the call over to Kurt to discuss the results of the current quarter.
Kurt Sievers: Thanks, Rick. And I am blessed to be able to talk to all of you today. Overall Q1 results were just above the midpoint of our guidance, as NXP delivered revenue of $2.1 billion. However, due to a richer sales mix, combined with good expense control, we successfully delivered profitability towards the higher end of our guidance range. Looking forward, our second quarter guidance reflects the successful design win momentum and traction which we have achieved with our customers. However, while we continue to believe the demand environment in the second half of 2019 should improve versus the first half, the macroeconomic environment is still uncertain, especially in China. Let me turn to the Q1 trends in the end markets. Automotive. Revenue was $1.04 billion, down 8% year-on-year, in line with our guidance. It was a challenging quarter given the macro environment, especially in China. All major product categories declined as expected, except for revenue from our ADAS solutions which were up double-digits versus the same period from a year ago. That continued reflection of the strong customer attraction of our solutions in that space. In industrial and IoT revenue was $368 million, down 14% year-on-year. This was below our expectations as the demand for general purpose microcontroller products in the broad based China market continues to be very weak. Remember this portion of our business is very dependent on thousands of smaller customers, service through distribution who appear to be particularly affected by the U.S. China trade tensions. Let me turn to Mobile. Revenue was $241 million, down 9% year-on-year better than our expectations. Overall, we experienced normal seasonality in this market. Yes, as we predicted at our Analyst Day in September 2018, we are beginning to see the attach rate of mobile transaction solutions with a broader set of customers accelerate. In the premium smartphone market we did see reduced demand for custom interface products. Lastly, communications infrastructure and other revenue was $449 million, up 10% year-on-year with RF Power Solutions up a strong double-digit versus the year ago period. We are currently seeing strong order rates for both our massive MIMO and high power single channel RF power amplifiers. That demand is broad based across the spectrum of global base station OEMs. Based on our customer conversations most believe 2020 will be the big year for the 5G base station infrastructure build outs, especially in China. From a profit perspective, we think this translates into a phase to build out approach with sub 6 gigahertz products driving the early portion of the 5G cycle and then in 2021 and 2022 we will see carriers begin to deploy high frequency millimeter wave product. In digital networking, we continue to see stabilization and design interaction for the landscape family of multi-core ARM processors which is positive, so revenue contribution is just beginning. Now turning to our expectations for quarter two. We currently do anticipate total revenue will increase in the range of up 3% to 7% sequentially, reflecting improved order rates associated with companies specific drivers. At the midpoint of our range, this is an increase of 5% sequentially or $2.2 billion. From a year-over-year perspective, this represents a decline of 4% versus the same period a year ago of which 2% is the elimination of the MSA versus the year ago period. At the midpoint, we anticipate the following sequential trends in our businesses. Automotive is expected to be essentially flat. Industrial and IoT is expected to be up in the mid single digit range on a percentage basis. Mobile is expected to be up in the low teens range on a percentage basis. And lastly, communication infrastructure and other is expected to be up about 10%. Now, I would like to pass the call to Peter for a review of our financial performance. Peter?
Peter Kelly: Thank you, Kurt. And good morning to everyone on todays call. As Kurt has already covered the drivers of the revenue during the quarter and provided our revenue outlook for Q2, I’ll move to the financial highlights. In summary, our first quarter revenue performance was just above the midpoint of guidance and combined with richer sales mix and good expense control, we delivered better than anticipated non-GAAP operating profit. Focusing on the details of Q1. Total revenue was $2.09 billion, down 8% year-on-year of which 2% was the elimination of the MSA versus the year ago period. We generated $1.1 billion in non-GAAP gross profit and reported a non-GAAP gross margin of 52.7%, down 20 basis points year-on-year, but 40 basis points above the midpoint of guidance given the better mix. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $547 million, down $37 million year-on-year and of $4 million from the fourth quarter due to bonus expenses. This was $3 million below the midpoint of our guidance. From a total operating and profit perspective, non-GAAP operating profit was $559 million and non-GAAP operating margin was 26.7%, down 50 basis points year-on-year despite the $175 million drop in revenue over the same period. Interest expense was $61 million. Non-controlling interest was $5 million and cash taxes for ongoing operations was $17 million, modestly better than the midpoint of guidance. Stock based compensation which is not included in our non-GAAP earnings was $86 million. Now, I'd like to turn to the changes in our cash and debt. Our total debts at the end of Q1 was $7.34 billion, essentially flat sequentially. Cash was $2.19 billion and net debt was $5.15 billion. We exited the quarter with a trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA of $3.1 [ph] billion and our ratio of net debt to trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA at the end of Q1 was $1.65 times and our non-GAAP interest coverage was nine times. Our liquidity is excellent and our balance sheet continues to be very strong. During the first quarter, we returned $788 million to shareholders as we bought about 8.5 million for $715 million and paid $73 million in cash dividends. Turning to working capital metrics, days of inventory was 113 days, an increase of 11 days sequentially, although inventory on a dollar basis declined $38 million. We continued to aggressively manage our distribution channel and inventory in the channel continues to be a very healthy 2.4 months in line with our long-term targets. Days receivable were 35 days, an increase of 5 days sequentially and days payable were 74, a decrease of 6 days versus the prior quarter. Taken together, our cash conversion cycle was 74 days, a deterioration of 22 days versus the prior quarter due to lower sales. Cash flow from operations was $296 million and net CapEx was $144 million resulting in free cash flow of $152 million. Turning to our expectations for the second quarter. As Kurt mentioned, we anticipate Q2 revenue to be about $2.2 billion, plus or minus $50 million. At the midpoint this is up 5% sequentially and we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be about 53.3% plus or minus 50 basis points. Operating expenses are expected to be about - are expected to be about $553 million plus or minus about $10 million. And taken together, we see non-GAAP operating margin to be about 28% plus or minus about 60 basis points. We estimate interest expense to be about $64 million and anticipate cash tax related to ongoing operations to be about $38 million. Non-controlling interest will be about $6 million, a reflection of our reduced loadings in SSMC. I would like to provide an update on our share repurchase program. As previously mentioned, during the first quarter we bought back approximately 8.5 million shares at a cost of $715 million. Since March 31, we have repurchased an additional 2.5 million shares at a cost of about $252 million under our 10b5 program. We suggest that for modeling purposes you use an average share count for Q2 of $287 million. Finally, I have some closing comments I'd like to make. As Rick highlighted, NXP has multiple unique drivers of growth which will play out over the coming years. We see our product portfolio as ideally positioned to address multiple secular market trends from the evolution of next generation automobiles, all the way to securely connected edge and IoT devices. As Kurt pointed out our revenue for the first quarter was slightly better than guidance with a richer sales mix combined with good expense control, taken together resulted in a better than guided non-GAAP operating margin. And while our gross margin improved in Q1 and we anticipate an improvement in Q2, we still have work to do to achieve our long-term targets. But we continue to anticipate achieving our intermediate target of 55% exiting the fourth quarter of 2019. We continue to believe our cash tax rate related to ongoing operations for 2019 should be about 5%. We continue to be committed to returning all excess free – all excess free cash flow to our owners and we currently have approximately 3.7 million shares remaining under the current authorization. So with that, I'd like now to turn it back to the operator for any questions you might have.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. You may proceed.
John Pitzer: Yeah, guys. Thanks. Let me ask the question in pursuit all the team. So I wanted to ask a little bit about the industrial IoT sentiment and the expectations for the calendar second quarter. You're coming off a Q1 where you modestly missed your expectations, but you aren't guiding it up sort of single digits. I am wondering if you could help sort of understand from bottoms up perspective just given all the macro uncertainty why the confidence level of sequential growth and as you answer that question could this remind us what normal seasonality is for that business in Q2?
Peter Kelly: Well, we're not really going to guide the second half of the year, John. First of all, in terms of Q2 as always our revenue is based on our backlog and what we believe will - I will book and certainly the industrial market particularly in China has been difficult in Q1 and Q2. But I guess your third question hidden in there was, what's normal seasonality? I would 'd say, you know, 2019 you throw normal seasonality out the window really, it's really hard to say what might happen, certainly as we thought Q2 is a strong - Q2 is stronger than Q1 and the second half we think we'll likely be stronger than the first half. But beyond that, I don't know Rick would you say much more beyond that.
Rick Clemmer: So I think the key John is the specific design wins we have that will drive our revenue increase, its not about an expectation of a rebound in the marketplace, but more of kind of a stabilization. And frankly, you know, China continues to be which is clearly a large market for us from an industrial perspective continues to be somewhat frozen. You know, our distributors or partners are becoming somewhat encouraged, but the end customers are still quite reticent based on the trade uncertainty and the general environment about what's going to take place. But what's really give me – us the confidence in the outlook that we have is the specific customer design wins with a ramp up of those new designs that will allow us to outperform the general market.
Kurt Sievers: The one thing that was interesting John is just going to Rick's comment there on the - what our distribution partners are thinking, we probably could have shipped about another $42 million worth of product at the end of - at the end of the quarter in terms of what distribution is asking for. But we were not seeing them ship it out to their end customers. So we we've not allowed them to take that product yet. So it is interesting that, but we see a little bit of strength in POA, but we haven't seen the additional or more importantly the strength in POS yet.
John Pitzer: That's helpful. And then maybe for my follow on, lot of conversation about China U.S. trade relations. I'm wondering relative to autos if you can talk about U.S., Europe and what's going on around potential tariffs around mission. And as you look at your guidance for Q2 kind of flat revenue growth Q-on-Q How are you thinking about sort of overall industry production versus company specific drive NXP like to rate some?
Kurt Sievers: Let me take this. We - when we think about the car production, we really look at the forecasts of IHS mainly, which had deteriorated a little bit since our last call. I think we talked about like minus 0.4 for the global reduction in 2019 over ‘18. by now the IHS forecast was minus 0.9%, so almost minus 1% which clearly did not have a great start in China. So the China Q1 production number in 2019 was actually minus 13%. Now if you look at the forecast for the full year being minus 0.9% only in quotes that means IHS obviously does project a rebound in both Europe and China in the second half of the year. And that's largely what we take as the basis for our forecast. So with that we also believe our business is going to be stronger in the second half of the year relative to the first half of the year. And yes, you were rightfully pointing to that part of our business, which is largely independent of that, most prominent factor, certainly the radar business. We did say it in the prepared notes earlier, we are on track here in Q1 and we see this also for Q2 and the rest of the year to be in the high 20% range in year-on-year growth, so Europe 25% to 30% growth in radar, which is a perfect continuation of the trends which we've also seen over the past years already.
John Pitzer: Thanks, guys.
Rick Clemmer: Thanks, John.
Operator: And our next question comes from William Stein with SunTrust. You may proceed.
William Stein: Hey. Thanks for taking my questions. Also too on the demand side. I think with regard to your Q2 guidance, I think both your infrastructure and handset business look like they're being guided above seasonality. Can you dig a little bit into the trends, especially in - well in each of them, really? Thank you.
Rick Clemmer: Well, I think the key on the communications side is really the some of the early deployment of 5G which we clearly being a near-term acceleration. And then we think that we'll go through it a little bit of a lull for a period where we won't see that continued growth. But clearly very positive for us in Q2 and a positive contribution. In Mobile it really comes down to the continued deployment of the mobile wallet, in the applications that we've been referring to in the past. We're beginning to see that come to fruition with developing countries and new customers really offering opportunities to drive the growth rates that we're talking about for Q2.
A - Kurt Sievers: Yes, so that's let me ask you this. This really falls in line with the longer term trends which we called it earlier. So from a tax rate of about 2% last year, we see the mobile wallet of tax rate going to 50% in 2021 and that's well on track and that's actually behind the growth forecast for you do in mobile.
William Stein: If I could just dig into one of those first sec Rick, I think you mentioned something about DN getting new design wins, that business has been challenged for some time, is this sort of a turnaround we should expect here with growth going forward and sort of reacceleration business?
Rick Clemmer: Well, we didn't try to say that, what we did say was the decline we think is under control. I think we had been getting design wins to be fair through this period of time. It's just that the revenue ramp associated with those had been delayed. And what we are now beginning to see is some of the revenue increases from those new design wins growing faster than the declines of the older legacy business, which created so much pressure over the last few years as you're well aware. We are encouraged about our DN in business and the design wins we have though and the full engagement and the opportunity to participate in a number of new areas where we really operate differentiated technology with some of our software defined radio technology that gets our customers the ability to expand into different networking innovative networking applications.
William Stein: Thanks for the detail.
Rick Clemmer: Thanks, Will.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. You may proceed.
Stacy Rasgon: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So the first one, wanted to hit on, on margins, I know you said you're still holding to the exit rate of 55%. Can you just talk a little bit about gross margin drivers? I guess in Q2 and then through the rest of the year that's going to get you there, as well as your thoughts on OpEx and operating margins as we go through the rest of the year?
Peter Kelly: Well, on gross margin, I'll just go back to exactly what I said to last year because – last quarter because I think that best illustrates where we are on flat volume from a flat revenue from Q4 ’18 to Q4 ‘19. It's basically 200 basis points of sale-held and it's not any one single individual item you know, we've got a bunch of things going on in test to - test times and yields and there's a bunch of I guess the largest part of it is savings that we have tied up with our supplier pricing. So that - that really hasn't changed at all. And in terms of OpEx, what we said to you, you should think whatever your number is for the full year take 16% of that we're in our annual R&D number and 7.5% for SG&A number and I guess given now that we've given you the Q2 number, a portion of difference over Q3 and Q4 based on how you think revenue is happening. Within OpEx you know, the big changes you see from quarter-to-quarter, typically more around what we're doing from a max [ph] perspective than anything else. Right now we're not really - we're not really hiring, you know, clearly there are some critical replacements we put in place. But we're trying to keep a cap on our costs and I think - I think what you saw in Q2 is we're able to manage our expense pretty well actually.
Rick Clemmer: I think that's really important, Stacy, you know, as we look at it with the current environment we see, we're keeping our expenses completely under control and keeping them fairly constrained. We clearly will have investments that we need to ramp up when we see a robust return to the marketplace. But clearly that's not something that we're - that's in the line of sight that we have today. As we talked about the ramp up, we see in revenue as more customer specific and design wins specific than the general market improvement.
Stacy Rasgon: Got it. Thank you. My follow up, I want to ask about the distribution channel, so I'm glad to see that you guys are monitoring tightly, but I don't understand, you said that this channel could have taken an additional $42 million in revenue that you chose not to shift. But how do I reconcile that with your comments on the general uncertainty in cautioning the market, why would the channel be looking to take additional inventory if the environment is so uncertain. Unless that has some implications for other truly seeing, how they're truly viewing the outlook through the second half, just…
Rick Clemmer: I don't – Stacy, I don't think you should read too much into that. I think the point is we had the orders from distis [ph] that they had the confidence, that they will need the requirements that would have driven a $40 million additional revenue for us. But without seeing the pickup in actual shipments out from the distributors, we chose not to ship that in because that would have obviously increased our months of inventory and we're very focused on maintaining that around the 2.4 range. I think you know, the distributors are more encouraged than I've seen them in a - in a few months, but it's not really materializing into shipments out to their customers in a significant fashion. So I think it's more of a general indicator, but it's clearly hasn't resulted in improved business yet.
Stacy Rasgon: I guess, what I'm asking is, what do you think is driving that sort of improved outlook from - with that improved confidence from them. Because you don't seem to be seeing it in most other places don't seem to be seeing it just yet. Or is it just a whole fun in general like that this second half better or what?
Rick Clemmer: I think it's just their business planning, as they go through it and look at what their plans are, they've placed orders that would have driven and further increase in our shipments into distribution, which obviously we chose not to do based on the impact that would have had on inventory levels.
Peter Kelly: But to be clear, it wasn't one order from one distributor, right. It was across the distribution.
Stacy Rasgon: Got it. Okay. Thank you, guys. Appreciate it.
Rick Clemmer: Thanks, Stacy.
Operator: And our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may proceed.
Vivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. The first one for Rick or Kurt, the Q2 sales outlook is among the best that we have seen in your peer group who were all complaining about the China weakness which is kind of surprising because my sense is that the NXP is perhaps you know, relatively more exposed to that market. So maybe could you give us some sense of trends you're seeing. I think you mentioned China is kind of frozen. So the trend you're seeing in Q2 is that you know, a measure of your own company specific design win activity or are you just seeing better trends outside of China. Can you just give us some quantification of what you are seeing in and outside of China?
Rick Clemmer: Yes. So I think it's really important to understand that our guidance is based on company specific design wins that we have with customers that give us the confidence about our Q2 revenue outlook. If you look at the market, the market in China continues to be pretty frozen and we don't see a robust recovery coming yet. There's still a great deal of concern relative to the trade activities and the uncertainty associated with it. I think if you look at Europe, Europe has been kind of okay, but you know, it's actually maybe even softened a little bit recently. It's not clearly a robust improvement. And US continues to operate quite fine. So I think all of that comes together, but clearly our revenue increase is based on company specific design wins which we've been working on for a long period of time and we're now beginning to see the results of that design activity that we've had.
Vivek Arya: And so my follow up, on the automotive business the revenues on a quarterly basis have been in this $1 billion, $1.1 billion range for the last two years now. I'm curious at what point do you think all the new activities you mentioned whether it's an ADAS or radar or BMS can help your overall automotive business get back into a target growth rate which I think you had at a 7% to 10% CAGR on a longer term perspective? Thank you.
Peter Kelly: Well, I would say they do have right now, because it's about 30% of the total revenue which - which is way above average in terms of growth. So once the other 70% based on the SAAR comes back to a normal growth rate you will see this striking through for the total. So - and obviously with these above average growth engines, like radar or BMS, or the digital clusters of course, gaining share against the total this will become more and more material all the time. This is today a 30% period since it grows far above average the 30% percent of course they'll take a higher share in the coming in years.
Rick Clemmer: I think the real clear thing is the reason we haven't seen our total growth is because of the general automotive market and the declines in production. So the fact is we've been able to hold that level on our shipments based on those new product areas. And as the general automotive market production levels come back to more of a normal basis, clearly it will kick in and drive revenue growth for us as a company.
Vivek Arya: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.
Ross Seymore: Hey, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I want to stick on the automotive side of things, and between the first quarter report and your second quarter guide it looks like you're down in auto 8%, 10% year-over-year and I understand it's a tough market for all the reasons you've given in answering prior questions. But if we think about that relative to SAAR, the last couple of years you guys have outperformed SAAR. You have the 30% driver et cetera. and then you outgrow it even in the 70%, but it doesn't seem like that's happening in the first half of the year. Can you talk about some of those drivers, is it simply the inventory burn in the first half, is your expectation still to be able to outgrow the SAAR side of things and even the automotive semi peers as we get through 2019 and beyond?
Kurt Sievers: So yes, clearly the expectation is to continue to outgrow the auto SAAR. It just doesn't work on a on a quarter-by-quarter basis. I mean, you have to look at a little bit longer time. We started this also historically, its just swinging and one single quarter doesn't really - doesn't really work. But yes, clearly we will continue to outgrow the overall auto SAAR by say 5% to 7%. That has been the basis and continues to be the basis for mid and long term forecast which is like 7% to 10% which was based on a 2% percent SAAR. Now if the SAAR in a couple of quarters returns to more normal rates like zero to 2% we are also back to that growth rate. Relative to peers, I mean, I don't know what peers will print all that time, but clearly in our chosen fields of focus which we also mentioned at the beginning of the call very clearly, be it's a battery management for the electric power train or be it radar within the ADAS space, we have outgrown and we believe continue to outgrow also our peers very clearly.
Ross Seymore: Thanks for that Kurt. And my follow up is one of the cast returns, probably for Peter. I know you have a couple million shares left to buy in the currently approved authorization. Can you just talk about the logistics to expand that and how you're planning to return cash and the balance between share repurchase and the dividend as we think going forward beyond this share repurchase program that's about to expire?
Peter Kelly: Yeah, we can - actually we can buyback about another 3.7 million shares between now and our annual general meeting which is in June. So in June we'll request the authorization for our shareholders to have a general buyback capability of - I think it's 20%. That doesn't mean we’re - at that point saying we're going to buy about 3% of the stock. But normally a Dutch company runs with this 20% allowance in its back pocket. But no one ever spends it as Rick mentioned before we basically just spent in the last six months which is kind of unusual. So in June we'll get that topped up. But more generally our commitment is to return all excess cash flow to our shareholders. We have a history of living to that commitment and we'll continue to - we'll continue to do it. And we will continue to have a dividend and you know and we'll get that chance as we go forward to possibly potentially increase that dividend next year.
Ross Seymore: Thanks, Peter
Operator: And our next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. You may proceed.
Blayne Curtis: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to revisit the RF segment. It looks like it's re-acerbating in June, just kind of curious your perspective on that trajectory this year and the next. There's been some talk about maybe customers positioning ahead of Chinese tenders, so maybe you get a little front loading, just kind of curious your view there and then any perspective on your GaN [ph] product would be helpful? Thanks.
Rick Clemmer: Yeah. So I don't think we see a lot of pre-ordering associated with that. What we really are seeing is a ramp up of deployment of our massive MIMO solutions which we've had quite a success in the marketplace and frankly we're limited by our manufacturing capability right now. So I think that's really kind of the contributing factor for us. It's not about - I think the term you used was pre-orders associated with Chinese. We don't see that as being a significant factor in our Q2 guidance. But instead the massive MIMO results. Our GaN solutions continue to be well-received in the market. We continue to win design wins and frankly it's a challenge to be able to supply all the customer requirements associated with it. And we do have our internal manufacturing facility to be ramping later this year associated with GaN. So I think we're in - we believe quite reasonable shape in GaN and I think we can continue to take our leadership position in the base section RF market even as the market converts more to GaN. But the timing of the transition to GaN has clearly changed over the last few years and frankly the massive MIMO opportunity represents a much more significant growth we believe that in the next number of quarters a year and a half or so then really the opportunities specifically associated with GaN. and the LD Moss [ph] technology has clearly moved up and been able to move into higher performance than what people would have anticipated several years ago.
Blayne Curtis: Thanks. And then just want to follow up on the comments you know on BMS, you talked about several $100 million potential in 2021, as you wrap any color in terms of view geographic in any sort of between now and 2021. Is there anything else that has to happen in terms of that design program? Thanks.
Rick Clemmer: Well, the focus from a positive perspective is really the battery companies. So we do work not that much with the classic automotive Tier 1 companies but with the battery companies and they tend to be by definition more in Asia and in Europe or in the U.S. So I would say from a from a geographic design in perspective a single box China, Korea, even Japan not that doesn't mean that that has to do with the local consumption there. It's just that they are the leaders globally in battery technology and lithium ion battery technology, but they do ship and we do have some transparency into this in which we have a programs are ramping that's absolutely global. I mean, I wouldn't make any differentiation there between the European, U.S. or Asian car programs.
Kurt Sievers: And the initial production is quite exciting platform.
Rick Clemmer: Yeah. So I mean, I I'm still trying to say it because it is just about to launch, but actually it's a lot a very, very large German car OEM which is which has its empire electric power train battery platform based on our solution. And the first cars which are very nice high end sports cars which I think we'd love to have while they are sold out by the way for the next two years as far as I know, they will launch in late summer this year. But again that that's a platform win which is then going to - actually go and spread out into all of the electric vehicles will step out off that car company. So again that happens to be a German company, but that doesn't mean that the rest of the battery work has been done with a German battery company which doesn't exist but actually all in Asia. So it's a very global business. I think we stand very strong based on the combination of all of our analog position of our [indiscernible] function as if you know how in the microcontrollers which we have, so that system approach continues to give us a unique position in that market.
Blayne Curtis: Helpful, thanks.
Operator: And our next question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.
Craig Hettenbach: Yes, thank you. I have a question on industrial IoT, if you can just talk about kind of a attach rate with connectivity with core microcontroller and then the update on some of the trends you're seeing along those lines?
Rick Clemmer: Yeah, I think we've talked about you know, that the connectivity requirements for low power Wi-Fi associated with industrial and IoT market, we announced some partnerships in the previous - in the most recent quarter that one of those in specifically was an announcement with Murata and Cypress associated with a solution that we're offering, but we continue to see high demand from our customers looking for a complete solution with the connectivity to go with our processing capability to be able to facilitate their solutions and what they're trying to accomplish.
Craig Hettenbach: All right. And then just to follow up, appreciate the calling on the channel and inventory. Any updates on just kind of how lead times are. And then just you know the comments around kind of overall the market's stable just kind of how things were through the quarter you know is it still kind of choppy intra quarter or anything along those lines on the order front?
Rick Clemmer: So I guess on the order front you know as we talk a little bit about you know, we've actually seen an improvement in orders, so we don't see the sell-through from our distribution partners picking up specifically in China. So I think while we've seen that increased order activity we're a little bit reluctant to expect that to really fall through to the customers in the near term or in Q2 timeframe and thus we're relying on the specific design wins that we have to be able to achieve the revenue increase that we have and I'm sorry I forgot your first.
Kurt Sievers: We basically maintain our lead times. We don't…
Rick Clemmer: OEMs…
Kurt Sievers: Times around like maybe some of the – some of the new guys.
Rick Clemmer: Yeah, we we're pretty religious about our lead times, if someone wants to place an order within the lead times, we actually evidence we charge him a premium associate with being able to meet those requirements.
Craig Hettenbach: Got it. Thanks.
Rick Clemmer: Thanks.
Operator: And our next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore. You may proceed.
C.J. Muse: Yeah. Good morning. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess, first question NXPI specific design when momentum is clearly a key theme on this call, so curious as you look at your second half outlook for continued recovery is that NXPI specific again. Or is that something cyclically structurally that where you see improvements?
Rick Clemmer: Like you know, we're not - we're not talking about the second half as far as projections associated with it beyond, what we said that Q2, I mean, second half will be about the first half. The confidence we have is clearly associated with the design wins we have and that being able to facilitate that. Although you know, there should be some nominal pick up in market even if there's not a robust recovery in the second half.
C.J. Muse: Helpful. Well, then I guess as a follow up. The mobile upload teams in June, I guess a bit surprising seasonally, curious how we should interpret that in terms of impact and what the run rate will look like into the second half of 2019?
Rick Clemmer: That's a design wins that we talked about in the improved acceptance of our mobile wallet. So it's kind of continues down that same path and we expect that to continue as Kurt talked about from the - from the you know 30% to 50% by 2021. So we're kind of on course to be able to maintain that and see a wider acceptance with more customers in different applications to continue to increase our confidence in it. You know, we're a niche player in the mobile market. We're not a mainline player in the mobile market and don't ever plan to be a mainline player, but instead can take unique technology to drive applications for customers. They just happen to be deployed in the mobile market.
C.J. Muse: Thanks, Rick.
Operator: And our next question comes from Matt Ramsay with Cohen. You may proceed.
Matt Ramsay: Thank you very much. Kurt, I wanted to ask a question just on the automotive semi's macro just as more of a clarification than anything, the ADAS business that you have 30% your business obviously has really strong growth. The other 70% that's been commented a few times is tied to SAAR. But I wanted to make sure we made the distinction between SAAR growth and semiconductor growth within the SAAR. Maybe you could sort of remind us what you guys are forecasting for market growth for the semiconductor macro within this SAAR? Thanks.
Kurt Sievers: Well, let me first to try and clarify when we say the 70% are tied to the SAAR, we still outgrow the SAAR. So there is still content growth obviously it should be at least 5% ahead of the SAAR, also in that 70% portion of our business. When we say type to SAAR, what that really means is since it is closer to the SAAR it swings more with the SAAR, where in Radar maybe grows say 30% year on year, I mean the SAAR with the 2%, 3% change actually doesn't matter. I mean, that was the commentary we made about association on long association with the SAAR. So that's why I would say the semi auto market should continue, thanks to the content increase across the board should continue to be I don't know 4% or 5% ahead of SAAR through the cycle and through the year. The more crucial question is actually what the SAAR is going to be. And I mentioned earlier on the call that some that Q1 wasn't a particularly great start. So IHS was reporting Europe minus 8% year on year in Q1 in car production and China minus 13%. And those are two pretty significant factors, while IHS still forecast for the year that this gets better in the second half which results in minus 1% for the full year which should indicate a positive or semiconductor market for the full year.
Rick Clemmer: Yeah, it's really important to think about the mix of that SAAR as well. If you look at it China is like double the size of the U.S. market and Europe is larger than the U.S. market. So in fact the two largest regions for SAAR production were quite weak in the first quarter.
Matt Ramsay: Got it. Thank you very much for the clarification. Just one quick follow up on BMD because its been brought up a few times. Maybe just curious as to your focus or strategy for the charging side of the battery equation whether that's supercharger or infrastructure et cetera. If you're doing any work there? Thank you.
Rick Clemmer: No we don't.
Kurt Sievers: On the automotive side, we do have charging mobile for mobile device.
Matt Ramsay: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed.
Toshiya Hari: Thanks very much for squeezing me in. Peter, I had a follow up question on gross margins. You talked about richer product mix driving your profitability in Q2. Can you talk to some of the product areas that drove the upside there. And related to that, Rick you talked extensively about ADAS and BMS as long term drivers. Can you speak to profitability for those two segments as they continue grow as a percentage of sales going forward?
Peter Kelly: So we don't disclose profitability by segments either the gross margin or the operating margin level. So it was you know - there's just lots of moving parts as I've said previously. You have the big groups do have slightly different margin profiles, but within the groups you have different product sets which have different margin profiles as well. And that turned out pretty nicely for us this quarter.
Rick Clemmer: I mean, it maybe we're a little bit conservative going into the.
Peter Kelly: Yeah, the mix comment was really more focused on Q1 helping facilitate that. And then I guess the only thing that we could say ADAS and BMS margins are quite nice.
Toshiya Hari: Okay. That's helpful. And then as a quick follow the comps [ph] in another segment I believe the long term growth rate from your Analyst Day is flat top 2%. Given the recent developments there and given your commentary on the call is that a pretty conservative kind of guide at this point and could there be potential upside or do you think that near-term strength could be a one off in nature if you will? Thank you.
Peter Kelly: Well, you know there there's always gives and takes associated with it. So I don't think we're going back and changing our long term guidance at all. Clearly in the near-term it's a positive contributor and helps us kind of offset the general market weakness that we see. But clearly we were pretty conservative on that segment and we said that at the time that we said the growth guidance. So there could be opportunity for upside, but it's always some gives and takes and we're not really changing any of our long term guidance at all.
Toshiya Hari: Thank you.
Jeff Palmer: Operator we'll take one more call.
Operator: And our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. You may proceed.
Harlan Sur: Morning. Thanks for taking my question. On the industrial and IoT segment in the June quarter you talked about companies specific design wins, is a pretty broad based segment you've got [indiscernible] high performance analog, wireless connectivity can just help us understand given the strong design win pipeline what are the specific applications or products or platforms that are driving the sequential growth is this and is it biased more towards things like building automation or factory automation or connected home any insights would be helpful?
Rick Clemmer: So it's more on the crossover segment is I think the key where we anticipate seeing the significant growth contribution, its the crossover segment where we're kind of uniquely positioned and as far as driving the growth it's a lot more on the on fitness track, the wearables segment than anything else. So I think over the intermediate term there is a lot like the immersive sound solutions that we have to be able to differentiate on the Dolby Atmos capability, a lot of factory automation that are spread among many thousands of customers.
Kurt Sievers: And maybe adding voice assist. So it's really four areas the variables which you mentioned Rick industrial automation, which is an analog detection and that kind of stuff. Voice assist into a lot of home solutions and industrial and finally the sound bars where I think you regularly spoke about the [indiscernible] certification.  I'd say it's those four very different segments but they all use all the crossover technology.
Harlan Sur: Yeah. Thanks for the insights there and insights into the RT [ph] crossover platform.
Rick Clemmer: Specific Harlan, it's not just RT, our crossover family processors is a combination of RT, ULP and M scale [ph] So it's a combination of those not just RT.
Kurt Sievers: It's actually a broad - broadening category which is very good - which I would almost say we are creating between the micros and the application process. So while that started really with a soft focus on the arty I think we are broadening this because we have so much direction that we become put more into it.
Rick Clemmer: Basically bringing some of the function specific functionality that you could normally only get in a in a very costly apps processor down to a more reasonable cost point for a broader array of implementations.
Harlan Sur: And that's a good segway into my next question which is that, when we think about your full blown process and family [indiscernible] NX family which we typically associate with auto, I don't MX actually you know continues to have actually I think strong traction in the industrial and IoT edge markets, for example like your i.MX eight each family that's actually 14 nanometer technology. Can you guys just help us understand the contribution and design win traction of the i.MX in industrial and IoT markets?
Rick Clemmer: It's significant. You know, I don't – Kurt, talked about these specific applications that we see in the broad base associated with that and we continue to have good traction but it's a broad array of customers and not any individual single solution.
Harlan Sur: Great. Thanks for the insights.
Rick Clemmer: Thanks, Harlan.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this now concludes our Q&A portion of of today’s conference. I would now like to turn the call back over to Jeff Palmer for any closing remarks.
Jeff Palmer: Maybe I'll make a few closing remarks as opposed to Jeff. But you know, I think we were very pleased with our quarterly results in Q1 and encouraged about the customer acceptance that we have that allows us to have the guidance for Q2. That opportunity continue to gain traction with the design wins and make a difference for our customers is really about our long term strategy and how we're focused on customer focused Passion to Win to be able to drive our solutions to be able to make a difference with our customers and we're encouraged about being able to demonstrate the comprehensive results associated with that. So thanks a lot for your support and we appreciate it.
Rick Clemmer: Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for attending today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.+

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-02-07 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2018 NXP Semiconductors Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the call over to Mr. Jeff Palmer, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.
Jeff Palmer: Thank you, Amanda, and good morning everyone. Welcome to the NXP Semiconductors fourth quarter and full-year 2018 earnings call. With me on the call today is Rick Clemmer, NXP's CEO; Kurt Sievers, NXP's President; and Peter Kelly, our CFO. If you've not obtained a copy of our earnings press release, it can be found at our company Web site under the Investor Relations section at nxp.com. This call is being recorded and will be available for replay from our corporate Web site. On our call today, we will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause NXP's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the macroeconomic impact on the specific end markets in which we operate, the sale of new and existing products, and our expectations for financial results for the first quarter of 2019. Please be reminded that NXP undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements. For a full disclosure on our forward-looking statements, please refer to our press release. Additionally, during our call today, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the impact of purchase price accounting, restructuring, stock-based compensation, impairment, merger-related costs, and other charges that are driven primarily by discrete events that management does not consider to be directly related to NXP's underlying core operating performance. Pursuant to Regulation G, NXP has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our fourth quarter earnings press release, which will be furnished to the SEC on Form 6-K and be available on NXP's Web site in the Investor Relations section. Before we begin the call today, I would like to remind you that beginning January 1st we have shifted our revenue reporting to an end market view from an operating segment approach. We believe this change over time will enhance the insight into the drivers of our business relative to the markets in which we operate. The current and historical end market information is available from our Investor Relations Web site in the historical financial model, which we post every quarter. And now I would like to turn the call over to Rick.
Rick Clemmer: Thanks, Jeff, and welcome everyone to our conference call. On today's call, I would like to cover three major themes: our full-year financial performance, our view of the market environment in which we operate, and then the specifics around our fourth quarter performance. Overall, looking at 2018, our revenue was $9.4 billion, an increase of 2% year-on-year. The drivers of the full-year growth were the automotive and industrial end markets with flattish trends in mobile, following a strong 2017, offset by weaker trends in the communication infrastructure and other end market relating to a decline in our digital networking business. Turning to the details of the full-year, automotive revenue was $4.51 billion, up 6% year-on-year. Highlights include double-digit growth of both our radar transceivers and processing solutions for ADAS applications and the growth of i.MX processors used in auto display cluster applications. For the full-year, ADAS products were just under 10% of overall automotive revenue, and the expectation is for continued strong growth as automatic braking and other safety features become more widely deployed and mandated. Industrial and IoT revenue was $1.81 billion, up 6% year-on-year, including high single-digit growth in general purpose MCUs. Within the portfolio, growth of our 32-bit ARM MCU products were up in the high-teens, driven by the breadth of our power optimized portfolio, and 25,000-plus customer base served through our distribution partners across industrial and IoT applications. We also continue to see the acceleration of design wins for our RT crossover processor family announced last year. Mobile revenue in total was $1.16 billion, essentially flat year-on-year, with sales of mobile transaction products up mid single-digits in 2018. In mobile transactions, we continue to be focused on moving the attach rates of mobile wallets down into the future phone market, and adding new used cases, including transit and access solutions. Communication infrastructure and other revenue was $1.79 billion, down 4% year-on-year, with increases from early 5G trials during the second-half of 2018, more than offset by the continued declines in digital networking. Before we review Q4, we would like to offer our views on the current demand environment. As we communicated on our third quarter call, we believe the demand environment was cloudy at best. As we progressed into the later part of Q4, we began to see accelerating deterioration in the China market and industrial -- in the China automotive and industrial markets. With respect to automotive, we see weakening domestic demand in China clearly impacting the demand from global OEMs and tier 1 suppliers. Within the broad China industrial market serviced by our distribution partners, we saw an increased reluctance to place orders due to weak demands from their end customers, which we believe is due to the uncertainty created by the ongoing trade dispute. In this broad market, it is extremely difficult to point to one specific set of customers or submarket that is causing the reduced demand. In the European automotive market, the WLTP emissions testing bottlenecks we have added last quarter continues to create headwinds to demand. We did not see the testing bottlenecks clearing before the end of Q1. In addition, the lack of progress to how the U.K. would exit the EU has created additional levels of uncertainties in the auto market. Within the mobile market, we anticipate worse than seasonal trends into the fourth quarter, primarily due to weaker trends in the premium smartphone market and the continued absorption of shipments after the strong launch in India by Reliance in the second-half of 2017. Overall, we do not see the historical leading indicators of an overheated supply chain including unusual backlog cancellations or outright program cancellations. Our distribution channel continues to be in good shape with channel inventory consistently at 2.4 months in line with our long-term targets. Unfortunately, we do not have any unique insights to forecast the duration our depth of the slowdown. However, our order rates would indicate that Q2 revenue will be higher than Q1 and with most third-party economist continuing to forecast global GDP. At a range just under 3%, you would have to believe the second-half of 2019 will be stronger than the first-half for the semiconductor markets. Now I'd like to turn to the specifics of Q4. Total revenue was $2.4 billion, a decline of 2% year-over-year. Our results were modestly better than our guidance for the quarter. From an in-market perspective, automotive Q4 revenue with $1.11 billion up 1% year-on-year with ADAS and i.MX both up double-digits. And industrial IoT revenue was $435 million, down 7% year-on-year, primarily reflecting the weaker distribution trends in China, as previously mentioned. And mobile revenue was $344 million down 8% year-on-year primarily due to a tough comparison with the ramp up of reliance in the second-half of 2017. However, we did see seasonally strong sequential demand for mobile transaction products in the premium smartphone market. Finally, communications infrastructure and other revenue were $493 million, up 3% year-on-year with RF power solutions up a very strong double-digit offset by declines in digital networking. Now, I like the pass the call to Peter for a review of our financial performance.
Peter Kelly: Thank you, Rick, and good morning to everyone on today's call. As Rick has already covered the drivers of the revenue during the quarter, I'll move to the financial highlights. In summary, our Q4 overall revenue performance was modestly better than the midpoint of guidance and as it's all year-end I'll review the full-year financial trends and then we want the results for the fourth quarter. For the full-year, revenue was $9.41 billion of 2% year-on-year. Non-GAAP gross profit was $4.98 billion or 52.9% of revenue. Non-GAAP operating income was $2.7 billion or 28.7% of revenue, essentially flat year-on-year on dollar basis as we stepped up R&D investments over the course of the year. While we managed SG&A expenses out. We generated $3.76 billion in free cash flow, which included the one-time termination fee from Qualcomm and we return $5.08 billion to our owners that have a combination of share buybacks and cash dividends and we reduced our diluted share account by 15% versus the same period a year ago. Focusing on the details of fourth quarter, total revenue was $2.4 billion down 2% year-on-year down modestly above the midpoint of guidance. We generated $1.8 billion in non-GAAP gross profit and reported a non-GAAP gross margin of 53.1% down 110 basis points year-on-year. Total non-GAAP operating expense -- expenses were $543 million, down $25 million year-on-year and a reduction of $20 million from the third quarter. This was $8 million better than the midpoint of our guidance. From a total operating profit perspective, non-GAAP operating profit was $731 million and non-GAAP operating margin was 13.4% down 17 basis points year-on-year reflecting the previously mentioned items. Interest expense was $60 million, non-controlling interest was $13 million and cash taxes for ongoing operations were $29 million. Stock-based compensation, which is not included in our non-GAAP earnings were $93 million. Now I'd now I like to turn to the changes in our cash and debt. Our total debt at the end of fourth quarter was $7.35 billion, an increase of $1 billion sequentially as we issued $2 billion of our first investment-grade bonds, and simultaneously repaid the $1 billion bridge loan facility. Cash was $2.79 billion and net debt was 4.57 billion. We exited the quarter with a trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA of approximately 3.5 billion. Our ratio of net debt to trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA at the end of the fourth quarter was 1.45 times and our non-GAAP interest coverage was 12 times. Our liquidity is excellent and balance sheet is very strong. During the month of October, we returned approximately $500 million to shareholders as we bought 5 million for $424 million and paid $74 million in cash dividends. During the quarter we paid deemed dividend tax of $142 million and as a reminder this payment does not go through the P&L. Turning to working capital metrics, days of inventory was 102 days and increase of 2 days sequentially though slightly down on an absolute dollar basis. Days receivable were 30 days decrease of two days sequentially and days payable were 80 and increase of six days versus the prior quarter. Taken together our cash conversion cycle was 52 days, an improvement of six days versus the prior quarter. Cash flow from operations was $731 million our net CapEx was 170 million resulting in free cash flow of $561 million. Turning now to our expectations for the first quarter, we currently anticipate total revenue will decline in a range of 16% to 10% sequentially reflecting the weaker demand environment we have discussed. At the midpoint of range this is a decline of approximately 13% sequentially and 8% versus the same period a year ago or $2.09 billion. As a reminder beginning January 1, we made a shift towards reporting our total revenue on an end market approach. We have posted the historic data on our Web site and our guidance today will follow the end market definitions. At the midpoint we anticipate the following sequential trends in the business. Automotive is expected to be down about in the mid-single-digit range. Industrial and IoT is expected to be down in the low double-digit range on a percentage basis. And mobile is expected to be down in the low 30% range. And finally, communication infrastructure is expected to be down in the upper single-digit range. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be about 52.3% plus or minus 70 basis points. Operating expenses are expected to be about $550 million plus or minus 12 million or so and taken together we see non-GAAP operating margin to be about 26% plus or minus a 100 basis points. We anticipate cash tax related to ongoing operations to be about $24 million and we estimate interest expense to be about $62 million because of the additional debt we are at last quarter. Non-controlling interest will be about $7 million down about $6 million below our usual number reflecting our joint venture partners reduce loadings and SSMC. I would like to provide an update on our share repurchase program. As previously mentioned in October of 2018 we bought back 5 million shares at a cost of 424 million. Since December 31, so in 2019 we have repurchased an additional 5.9 million shares at cost of about $481 million under 10-B5 program. We suggest that for modeling purposes we use an average share count for the first quarter of 290 million shares. Finally, I have several housekeeping comments, I'd like to address. Given our new end market reporting I would recommend you all review the data we posted, but going forward and beginning in Q1 we will not include revenue from our manufacturing services agreements, which is related to the divestment of assets such as standard products -- a couple of years ago. And as an example, the NSA revenue in the first quarter of '18 was $39 million. And what you will now see in our Q1 guidance is zero, which creates, obviously, about 160 basis points of headwind to our product revenue growth. As Rick pointed out, most economists continue to predict global GDP growing 3% in 2019. So, at this point we would see no reason to not believe well market can't grow 3% to 5% compound annually over the next three years, and that our business reflecting this growth would grow 5% to 7% compound over the same period. Clearly, our gross margins are challenged in Q1, but we still plan to exit fourth quarter 2019 at 55%. Interest costs for 2019 are anticipated to be about $270 million. And that reflects the new debt. We continue to believe our cash tax rate related to ongoing operations for 2019 should be about 5%, and we expect CapEx for 2019 to be in the range of 6% to 7%. I'd like now to turn it back to the operator for questions for Rick and I, and of course Kurt.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
John Pitzer: Yes, good morning guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Rick, I guess my first question is just can you talk a little bit about the expected inventory trends as you go through the March quarter, both on your own balance sheet, but I guess more importantly in distribution. When you look at your rev guide for Q1 do you think that that represents kind of under-shipping end demand? And is there any meaningful difference on what's going on with inventory by geo?
Rick Clemmer: Well, I think, John, as we've talked about, if you look at our automotive business, the bulk of that that's outside of China is actually on a vendor-managed inventory, so we actually only ship it to the customer when they're actually using it in production. In the case of China, it's not quite as refined yet, so most of the shipments we have for the automotive market in China do go through our distribution partners. As we talked about, our total distribution inventory is at 2.4 months, and our target is to maintain that at around two-and-a-half months plus or minus a half. So, clearly the guidance we have would be dependent upon our anticipation of what we believe the POS to be for Q1 with the reduced inventories that would go associate with that. I think we're in a very unusual environment where the U.S. is okay. Europe is basically okay, maybe not quite as robust as it was in Q3, but China is just kind of locked down, it's in a quagmire. Our distribution partners' customers are not placing orders and not taking inventory because of their uncertainty about what's going to happen in the trade war. And so long as we see this uncertainty on the trade war there'll continue to be reluctance by them to place orders and take inventory. Now, if you believe that the full-year's GDP growth is going to be 3% or just under, then clearly that can't continue. So, if that's the case then we'll see a significant rebound in the second-half of the year. And as we said, our orders right now would indicate that Q2 will be higher than Q1. So, I would say that we see an improved environment, but we're still going through the shipments in Q1, and we'll have the distribution inventory reduced associated with those reduced shipments in Q1.
Peter Kelly: And on our internal inventory, John, I think I said last time, I want to get it down to 95 days. And we're putting a lot of pressure on the organization to do that. Clearly Q1 is a difficult quarter to do because it tends to be a low quarter, but I have a lot of confidence we'll get there. we're certainly not going to allow our inventory to grow on a dollar basis.
John Pitzer: That's helpful. And as my follow-up, just on the auto trends in Q1 and then throughout calendar year '19, clear autos is outperforming the midpoint of the overall guidance. Does that, in your view, reflect just kind of you keeping up with the market or are there company-specific drivers that you see kicking in, in Q1, that are helping you outperform the overall market? And how does the company-specific stuff trend throughout calendar year '19?
Rick Clemmer: Well, I think the company-specific -- I'll let Kurt comment on it in just a second, but I think we believe that on the ADAS, specifically in radar, that will continue to ramp through the year. But Q1, we've been shipping, it's just under 10% of automotive revenue for full-year '18, and so we'll continue to see that more robust than the rest of the automotive market. And that will continue to ramp through the year, specifically in automotive.
Kurt Sievers: Yes, Rick, so I -- absolutely, it's on the -- as we had this cost earlier the ADAS being now just below 10% of the total order revenue is a strong content story. And the current environment, we don't see that disturbing that trend. So we clearly see that the, say, 25% to 30% growth rate of that part of the business is fully intact also in the current environment. While other parts of the business, obviously, are much closer tied to the SAAR, which is then more suffering from the Q1 environment. Another one which we, and Rick was speaking about it earlier, which does clearly outgrow from a content perspective is our i.MX applications process of business which goes into the digital clusters. So there is a continued strong trend of adoption of digital-to-cluster solutions, where we have a very strong leading solution with our i.MX applications processes. So, those two, I would say clearly are content driven, also through a weaker market environment.
John Pitzer: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein Research. Your line is open.
Stacy Rasgon: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to ask about the gross margin guide. You're still holding the 55% for the end of the year. What revenue level is required to hit that? And can you give us some idea of the gross margin drivers that drive your trajectory from the Q1 point through Q4 exiting the year to get there?
Peter Kelly: Yes, sure, Stacy. I obviously anticipated that we'd get a lot of questions around this. I think if you go from Q4 '18 to Q4 '19, so flat revenue. To get from 53.1% to 55% there's several things. First of all, we have our annual price reductions, so that gives us about an 80 basis point headwind. Mix has a little bit of a benefit in what we're planning right now, probably about 60 basis points. Operationally, I've got about 200 basis points of performance locked in to get to the 55%, so that's about 130 basis points in input pricing which we've got identified, and about 60 basis points in factory efficiency which we've got identified. Now, to be honest, on that last one in particular, the factory efficiencies, I'd like to see that improve actually. But I said it last time, I don't think we need a volume or a revenue increase off of Q4 '18 to get to 55%. And I think we've got it pretty well identified right now. And if I can do better I'll do better, but there's always things that have the potential to offset some of the other potential goodies we could see. And I'm feeling pretty comfortable about it still.
Stacy Rasgon: Got it, thank you. For my follow-up, I wanted to ask about buybacks. I know you've been buying back more incremental amounts lately. I think you had said that you needed to hold a shareholder meeting to authorize like a further large repurchase amount. Why have we not seen that shareholder meeting? Is it going to happen soon, and how much of the existing authorization on the buyback remains?
Peter Kelly: Well, I can still -- yes, there's a kind of technical thing in the Netherlands where basically you get an authorization to buyback up to 20% of your stock. And typically people don't buy back 20% of their stock. But we're getting close to it. The reason we've not asked for that meeting yet is I can still buyback about -- I think it's about 14 million shares, which is at least, well, one of our current prices $1.5 billion or so. So as soon as I use all that, I'll go and request a meeting, but either way, our next annual general meeting is on the record probably currently is in May or June, and we've got it topped up to 20% of that. But if the simple answer is, I have the capacity to still buy an additional $1.5 billion, so I don't need the approval right now.
Stacy Rasgon: Got it. Thank you so much.
Peter Kelly: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of William Stein of SunTrust. Your line is now open.
William Stein: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just one more quick one on the buyback, Peter, you said I think you've said either at the Analyst Day or the last call that you anticipated spending approximately $3 billion from Q4 '18 through the full-year '19, is that still the plan?
Peter Kelly: Yes, we said we would return and we said this for many years all excess cash to shareholders. So we do the math obviously, yes, we now include our dividend and but yes roughly that number.
William Stein: Okay. And then, I guess I'd like to turn to 5G. Rick, last quarter. I think you expressed some skepticism about the near-term strength in that market owing to your customer's sort of design approach and expressed an expectation that there might be some change in that would accelerate demand. Can you update us on your view in that market in the quarter and as we progress through '19? Thank you.
Rick Clemmer: Yes, so thanks, Will so, I think 5G is still pretty fluid right now. I think one of the major U.S. carriers actually announced that they were going to delay some of their deployment on the CPE with the last mile because they didn't believe the architecture was ready for primetime. A little bit like we talked about on our last earnings call. So I think we kind of confirmed our view associated with that. We anticipate that, there's not really going the 5G availability of a reasonable cost architecture that's not driven by FPGA until late in '19. So we would not see a huge ramp of that, CPE or last mile for 5G until late '19. I think in the meantime, in preparation for 5G mobility. The infrastructure investments are ongoing and we see a very solid demand, a very solid increasing demand that frankly we're struggling a little bit to get in position to be able to fulfill all the requirements, so it is kind of a tale of two pieces when you look at the infrastructure side we do see that really beginning to ramp now but when we see the deployment of more for the last mile we think that that'll be later in the year before really the architecture will be cost-effective to be able to support a significant ramp.
William Stein: In that last comment you're talking about massive MIMO and your power amps. Is that the business you're referring to? 
Rick Clemmer: Yes, that's what we see today is we see for the infrastructure deployment massive MIMO as well as the deployment for the base stations to get prepared for the 5G rollout actually beginning to be receive orders for today.
William Stein: Thank you.
Jeff Palmer: Thanks. Will, sorry. Just before the next question. I need to correct something. Stacy, I have $10 million shares capacity left not $15 million, so I could only buyback for some $1.1 billion, $1.2 billion before I have to go back to the shareholders. But again, I don't think that's an issue and it's an easy thing to do. Should we need it? Operator, we will take the next question.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Vivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. Rick, from a high-level perspective, do you think NXP is more exposed to China versus your peers? So you are perhaps seeing more of this downturn and if there is a great resolution perhaps you also see somewhat better recovery and that's part of that. I think, you mentioned some optimism around Q2 being better. I was hoping you could give us some color on which and markets are starting to stabilize and main week I know it's pretty early and data is limited.
Rick Clemmer: So I guess that relative to China I think, China represents a significant portion of our business if you look at what we see, we see that end market China from the distribution view point for the industrial side is kind of continuing to be somewhat on hold or gray area. I think what we talked about that gives us the confidence for Q2 is the order right that we see for the last few weeks coming in actually really gives us the confidence the Q2 will be in access or larger than Q1. I do think that China is somewhat the contributor, but I think obviously there was a hardship to hard reset by a number of our customers specifically in automotive but also with our industrial novelty customers in China. As we see that taking place so long as the world's GDP continues to be relatively healthy. Then I think we're very confident we'll work our way out of that, but the increased orders that we've seen over the last few weeks really give that ability to have the confidence to be able to say that on this call, and then relative to the second-half the year. It all gets down to what your belief is on the world's GDP. As long as you believe it's going to be close to 3%, then we clearly believe that on the second-half of 2019 will be better than the first-half.
Peter Kelly: I think that our exposure to China is complicating things slightly in the sense and we know what we shipping and the supply chain in China is certainly more opaque than the what you seen in western Europe or the US. So it feels to us like, we do get moved about in terms of what's going on in the supply chain over there, but once we shipped in you don't know where it comes out, we [indiscernible] some of it will be for domestic, some of it global or industrial products we assembled into devices like it shipped all over the world.
Rick Clemmer: Yes, it works both ways actually. It even some of the ship to in Europe and the U.S. ends up in the end market of China. So we don't have a 100% traceability which shipments are really down to the market itself in China. Both outside of China shipments could end up in China, some of that into China shipments could be tied to end market outside of China. So that's why it's really a bit hard to say what exactly that exposure is. Jeff, was our -- do you have our 2018 shipping number? Is it 20…
Jeff Palmer: Just at 20 some odd percent into China.
Rick Clemmer: Yes, 20, high 20.
Jeff Palmer: No, 30%.
Peter Kelly: It was 27%.
Rick Clemmer: 27%, I think 27% to 28% in terms of shipping for 2018.
Q – Vivek Arya: Got it. And for my follow up, back on the automotive business. So it grew about 6% you mentioned full-year. It was going growing at obviously higher phase until Q3. How would you characterize the market share environment in your traditional market? And let's say we are in a situation where the automotive industry has negative units down 3% or 4%? Do you still think your automotive business can grow in that environment that some of the new initiatives, Rick that you mentioned in Battle Management Systems and radar and other areas. Can they grow enough to from a content perspective to help you do better than the unit environment? Thank you.
Kurt Sievers: So let me, this is Kurt, let me let me try and capture the pieces of your question. So firstly on the environment for 2019, we do see external sources forecasting somewhere between plus 1% and minus 1%. So a big data point, which particularly look at this actually HIS which talks about plus 1% SAAR rose for a 2019 but also some people are more negative like minus 1%. So we think it's going to be somewhere in that range. 2018 however was actually a negative SAAR reported at minus 2%. So in that environment we did grow 6% as you said so, obviously the content grow story did play out the way we were speaking about it earlier. And in that regard, yes, we do think that also for 2019 that theme is intact, I talked earlier about ADAS as a large contributor being pretty independent of the SAAR but also the ideal mix cluster applications helping in that respect. So in a SAAR environment which is maybe around the zero unit growth in '19, we do think indeed that our content growth story does help us to outgrow the SAAR continuously.
Jeff Palmer: Hey, Vivek, this is Jeff. I'd just like to also clarify I looked at the wrong number. Our ship two for China is high 30% range, apologies.
Q – Vivek Arya: Okay, no worries. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Ross Seymore: Hi guys, I want to go back to the disty side of things and maybe that's the revenue visibility in a different way. Can you just talk about what you're seeing on the disty side versus the OEM side? And maybe specifically in your first quarter guide is down 13% sequentially, how the OEM versus disty side differs either in aggregate or if the disty side is worse given your commentary in China, is that really localized to the industrial market or any of the various end markets that your new segments define?
Rick Clemmer: Well, clearly Ross, when we talk about the marketing channel in the industrial, a significant chunk of that is somewhere around 3/4s or 80% of that is served through the distribution channel and that's really the area of significant weakness that we see combined with automotive. So in the case of automotive, it's probably somewhere between a fourth and a third of our total business goes through the channel primarily for shipments into China. The rest of it is pulled from vendor managed inventory. We have seen declines, we talked about it in Q4, I mean in our Q4 call for Q3 results that we had seen a decline in auto production in Europe for the CO2 testing and we see that continued through Q1. So there continues to be a impact of that and then you know there's also the uncertainty of Brexit and the auto industry has a lot of parts moving from Europe to the U.K. and vice versa, and so that's created some concern with the lack of clarification of what's going to happen on Brexit as well, but I do think really the key areas that we see the weakness is really China.
Peter Kelly: Yes, and I think Ross, your question was indeed then for China disty versus direct, clearly that weakness in China expresses itself in the distribution channel for us and that's both for industrial as well as automotive.
Ross Seymore: As my follow-up question, Peter, you did a great job of walking us through on your expectations for the full-year on the gross margin side with a lot of helpful detail. I want to switch over to the operating margins side and specifically the OpEx side. Given that revenues are weaker than expected, what's your plan as far as how OpEx spend might trend directionally throughout the year? Are you tightening things down given the revenue level, are you investing more for growth, any sort of changes in your strategy from the last time we spoke?
Peter Kelly: Well, you can see our Q4 actuals are Q1 guide. We're definitely keeping a lid on things at the moment. So we're not taking out any programs, we're managing travel, not replacing all attrition straight away, trying to push out various expenses. So little bit kind of things you normally do. On a more long-term basis so into 2019 and 2020, I go back to our percent of revenue, so we want to run R&D about 16% of revenue, we'd like to run SG&A 7.5% and so going forward we see over the next 3 years R&D round about 16% and ultimately getting SG&A down to about 7%.
Rick Clemmer: It's important to say, Ross, we are definitely taking actions in the near-term to significantly control our cost. We're adjusting people levels relative to that. As Peter said, we're not really stopping any programs but we clearly are not replacing attrition and in some cases…
Peter Kelly: Performance improvement, so we work to actually use this to move low performers eventually out of the company to strengthen the organization. So all of that has the cost levels -- I think you've seen historically from us and I think it was a clear indication in Q3, Q4 and Q1 that we will manage our OpEx and we know how to do that.
Ross Seymore: Got it, thanks, guys.
Rick Clemmer: Thanks, Ross.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay of Cowen. Your line is open.
Matt Ramsay: Thank you very much. I wanted to ask about I guess two of the smaller segments of the business, I think one growing really strongly in the other one on decline, did you guys mentioned that 32 bit MCU programs an aggregate were up on the order of high teens maybe you could give us sort of an update about how big that is in the overall mix and the trends you see there relative to demand and sort of distribution level. And then on the flip side you've been very clear about how you're going to manage the decline sort of directionally of the digital networking business. But if you just talk to us about where that business is run rating now so we can sort of I guess calibrate models going forward? Thanks guys.
Rick Clemmer: Yes sure on the 32-bit ARM we don't talk about the specific associated with it, but it's the biggest chunk of our industrial and IoT business. And so that really gives us the benefits of looking at that from a growth. The one area that we're seeing really strong design wins on is our new crossover product that we announced really about a year ago the so called RT Family, which takes the processing capability of our i.MX family down to a cost of micros on specific applications like visual or error detection, our audio. So that's really a significant factor for us in driving that growth and we continue to see that accelerate with design win. So that puts us in a really unique and positive position for the 2019 outlook and we're kind of uniquely positioned where there's not a lot of competition in that space, most of our competitors in i.MX don't participate in micros and vice versa the same thing with the macros. So we're kind of in the sweet spot where it gives us the ability to really drive that participate in it. On the digital networking business that business is kind of stabilized, it's declined through 2018 and kind of stabilized just over $100 million a quarter or so. There was some opportunities for growth with design wins we won over last year so as we see those finally begin to ramp and the PowerPC legacy business not continuing to decline as much as it has in the past. So I think we've got more of a stable level there and with some of the applications that we see there are some opportunities for growth later in the year in 2020 that we'll see how they materialize.
Matt Ramsay: Thanks very much.
Rick Clemmer: Thanks Matt.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Blayne Curtis of Barclays. Your line is open.
Blayne Curtis: Hey guys, thanks for taking question. So you won an order just try to better understand the trends there you obviously called two segments in double-digit growth. Just curious obviously orders are slower just kind of curious is there are any segments that are providing a headwind above and beyond what we're seeing from just the overall environment. And then in 5G, I wanted to understand that was a big boost it kind of surprise people end of 2018, it seems like you are saying things may take a little bit pause but I just wanted to understand what's your expectations are for the RF business and kind of the first-half of the year?
Rick Clemmer: Yes, let me take the RF business personal, and let Kurt comment on automotive. So RF we are seeing demand ramp for the massive MIMO and 5G infrastructure and we're frankly struggling here on near-term basis and being able to meet all the requirements from our customers. So we are seeing a ramp and that's being a significant contributor, positive contributor versus overall environmental issues that we see in the other businesses. So we think we're in a unique position with our massive MIMO product and have done really very positive feedback from customers and our requirement to be able to actually see we can build more for them then what they had originally anticipated as we are going to the near-term. And let me let Kurt then talk about auto.
Kurt Sievers: Yes, I think in auto it's really differentiated between what is the content growth story versus what is very tightly associated to the SAAR growth. So those product or application segments where we are holding a high share but the penetration itself isn't growing anymore, we are obviously more swinging with the SAAR quarter by quarter. So you could call this especially with the China environment and the WLTP in Europe a headwind, where again at the same time the content growth and I mentioned ADAS radar before, is largely independent of this. So it's the mix of those two which drives our overall growth number. And roughly speaking we think that about 70%-ish of our total business is pretty close associated with the SAAR where another 30% are really benefiting from strong content growth. And in that 30% the largest is obviously the ADAS, which is just under 10% of total run rate.
Rick Clemmer: Yes, Blayne, it's probably worthwhile to talk about -- in the case of automotive, you know, in our last quarter's call we talked about in Q3, we'd really seen weakness in the CO2 testing in Europe, and we actually didn't see a lot of weakness in China in automotive at that time. It was really not until kind of mid to late Q4 where we began to see some weakness in the automotive market in China as all of that basically served through the distribution channel partner. So we saw that weakness really began to materialize at that point…
Kurt Sievers: This is Kurt, indeed. So while many of the Tier 1 companies talked about this already, we didn't see it in our orders nor in our revenue. But I think it was like late Q4 kind of late November, early December that we also saw that hitting us. But again, that only relates to that product, which is in a one-one relation with the car production.
Blayne Curtis: Thank you.
Rick Clemmer: Thank you, Blayne.
Operator: Thank you, our next question is from the line of C.J. Muse of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey guys, this is Matt Fresco [Ph] on for C.J. So outside of GDP forecasts, are there any customer conversations or other factors that are giving you confidence in this second-half recovery and regarding the recent order uptick, do you think any of that's related to ahead of the Chinese new year tariff deadline?
Rick Clemmer: No, there was none of that. It felt like it was full in, with the Chinese new year tariffs. Once again, the U.S. is okay. We really don't see a lot of concern about demand from our customers in the U.S. The general economy even though it's down somewhat is still performing quite well. In Europe, I would say we see things pretty reasonable, but we do see isolated pockets, again, driven primarily by automotive. And we believe the biggest chunk of that is CO2 testing and we'll see how the demand comes out after we get work through that, you know.
Peter Kelly: Some of the Brexit, and then the effects associated with Brexit that we talked about. So in the case of China, that's much more cloudy, much more murky as far as determining what's happening in the [indiscernible] year. I think it does depend on some kind of resolution or confidence in what's going to happen out of the current trade issues that are being discussed. So if you believe that the trade issues were going to continue, you know, then the world's GDP is not going to be close to 3% for the year. And then that's a different factor. But so long as you believe that the world's GDP is going to be just under 3%, so there probably has to be a trade resolution with China to be able to accomplish that. And with that then we think we'll see a very strong growth in the second-half of the year.
Unidentified Analyst: Fair enough, thanks. And then as a follow-up, just a housekeeping item, I think your incidental cash tax forecast increased for 2019 and deferred 2020, could you give us some additional color there?
Peter Kelly: Right, so you are talking about the taxes for the businesses that we sold off, and also the tax on the Qualcomm transaction. You actually have to look at the Q4 Excel. So we were saying previously that we'd spend $295 million in Q4 and we only spent $32 million because we went into quite a long-winded negotiation with the Dutch tax authorities and were able to negotiate that particular transaction, the Qualcomm deal went through the innovation box. So we managed to reduce that a little bit, I guess because of the time, we want to go to and it slipped from Q4 into Q1. So the big move is really just the fact that we move the payment on the Qualcomm breakup fee from the end of December to early January. I think, if you actually do the math on Q4 actual and what we've guided for 2019 and '20. The amount is actually lower and it's a very specific cash flow item. So that's why we pulled that one out separately.
Jeff Palmer: Operator, we will take the next caller, please.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of with Craig Hettenbach of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Craig Hettenbach: Yes, thank you. Just a question for Kurt on the BMS side just curious to get kind of what type of feedback you're hearing from customers given you're taking more of a kind of complete system approach versus some of the existing players and just how you feel about the pipeline of opportunity in BMS?
Kurt Sievers: Thanks, Craig. Yes, we feel actually increasingly stronger because in the whole environment, the one sub segment, which has really pushed is electric cars. So there is a pretty strong drive to really be on time from a car company perspective to do the launches, which we have launched for my '19, so if you think about it short-term, the design win finally which starts to turn into a couple of 10s of millions revenue in '19 is on track that is all firmly designed in, it depends really on the timeliness of the car launches and I unfortunately cannot tell you which cars those are but once they are out, we will tell you and it's pretty prominent nice cars. On the more strategic side, yes, the solution play, which we talked about earlier, is absolutely hitting the mail as much as the ASIL-D capability. So I really want to say it's two things, that is the solution play between micros and the analog front-end and the ASIL-D capability of the whole solution which continues to settle apart from competition.
Craig Hettenbach: Got it. And then just to follow-up on the near-term alignment, on the WLTP issue, do you think once that passes, there should be kind of a catch up or because the overall amount of market is soft right now you wouldn't see any, kind of rebound if you will, in Europe?
Kurt Sievers: Really hard to say, Craig, I'm very careful with that because of course this is also somehow related to the overall demand environment in the end and I'm hearing but I -- we don't have the latest detail that there is a second wave of WLTP plant, so another type of test limits for CO2 emissions. There I'm hearing that the OEMs now start to figure out how they how they can again go ahead with that one. So I -- what we can say at this point is that is the current one is not going to do be here before the end of Q1, if there is a strong rebound from this, I'm a bit careful to say that that this is going to happen there in Q2 not sure.
Craig Hettenbach: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Lipacis of Jefferies. Your line is open
Mark Lipacis: Hi, thanks for taking my question. One for Peter and one for Rick; Peter, just accounting mechanics on the deem dividend, is that embedded in the cash flow statement under shares a repurchased? And then, for Rick a number of microcontroller companies and analog companies have kind of talked about a benign pricing environment and when Peter just walked just through the variance progress marches as we go through this year, I think there's a note of 80 bips of headwind on the pricing side. So I was wondering if you could share with us your thoughts on kind of like just a bigger picture what's going on in the industry with consolidation and how that seems to be helping some of the other microcontroller analog companies but doesn't seem to be benefiting you guys yes, so if you have any thoughts or color on that, that will be greatly appreciated? Thank you.
Peter Kelly: Hi, so first thing, it goes through the cash flow, not through the P&L and if you look on table three. You can see an item their cash paid on behalf of shareholders for tax on repurchase shares $142 million, right at the bottom of the cash flow. So, that's pretty specific. And then, the other thing just say on the comments I made on gross margin on pricing, that's, just our annual price reductions. It's not related to kind of anything that's going on in the market.
Rick Clemmer: Yes, I would say that the general environment on pricing is okay. I don't think that we would say that, it's poor for us at all. I think if anything we're trying to whittle down, when you get to -- go through the annual price negotiations with the OEMs and the Tier-1, it's an arm wrestling that takes place and we try to get down slightly and that's under the contract and we try to reduce it slightly and they try to get a little more, but I don't think there's a significant changing environment that we see associated with that and I'm most of industrial in IoT, you said that price with the design wins. And then you have a built-in reduction that takes place associated with those that we honor contractually, Kurt?
Kurt Sievers: Yes, it's also important to note that a lot of the ASP reduction, you see there is a once in the year element, I mean that happens in Q1 and then it's done for the year. So it's not like this, it repeats all the time. But it's, it's because those are annual contracts. And I clearly support what Rick was saying, I think we actually played it a bit tougher this year, meaning that directionally we gave let's prize away then on the average of the past years.
Mark Lipacis: Thank you. That's helpful.
Rick Clemmer: Yes, it really depends on the product family and so it has different characteristics based on the customer and product family and everything. So it's really hard to draw any conclusion but I wouldn't say that the pricing environment is problematic, it's very healthy right now.
Mark Lipacis: Thank you. Great.
Operator: Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jeff Palmer.
Jeff Palmer: Great. Thank you very much, everyone. Before we go, I think, I'll pass the call over to Rick, if he has any last comments he'd like to make.
Rick Clemmer: Yes, thank you for joining us. I guess the thing that we have to point it out is that we remain in somewhat of a cloudy environment. But the encouraging sign that we see with increased orders over the last few weeks really improves our confidence for the Q2 outlook and that being larger than Q1 and again, then for the second-half of the year, it comes down to your belief on the GDP and whether the trade issues will be resolved, so that we will return to a healthy growth around -- just under 3% as most of the economist are projecting or not, but with that, I think it's important to point out that we are taking the appropriate cost actions to be sure that our costs are under control. And we can deliver on our financial performance to ensure that we continue to focus on improved shareholder value as we go forward. So thank you very much for your support. We appreciate it.
Jeff Palmer: Thank you everyone. This concludes the call.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q3 2018 NXP Semiconductors Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Jeff Palmer, VP of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Jeff Palmer - NXP Semiconductors NV: Thanks, Amani, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the NXP Semiconductors third quarter 2018 earnings call. With me on the call today is Rick Clemmer, our CEO; and Peter Kelly, our CFO. If you've not obtained a copy of our third quarter 2018 earnings press release, it can be found at our company website under the Investor Relations section at nxp.com. Additionally, we have posted on our Investor Relations website, a supplemental earnings summary presentation, and a document of our historical financials to assist you in your modeling efforts. This call is being recorded and will be available for replay from our corporate website. Our call today will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause NXP's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the macroeconomic impact on the specific end markets in which we operate, the sale of new and existing products, and our expectations for financial results for the fourth quarter of 2018. Please be reminded that NXP undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements. For a full disclosure on our forward-looking statements, please refer to our press release today. Additionally, during our call today, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures which exclude the impact of purchase price accounting, restructuring, stock-based compensation, impairment, merger related costs, and other charges that are primarily driven by discrete events that management does not consider to be directly related to NXP's underlying core operating performance. Pursuant to Regulation G, NXP has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our third quarter 2018 press release, which will be furnished to the SEC on Form 6-K and be available on NXP's website in the Investor Relations section. Like to now turn the call over to Rick.
Richard Lynn Clemmer - NXP Semiconductors NV: Thanks, Jeff, and welcome everyone to our conference call today. Overall, our revenue growth in the third quarter was good and our results were better than our guidance. We resumed our buyback program and as of yesterday, we have now returned just under $5 billion to our owners, and also initiated a $0.25 per share cash dividend. Our outlook for fourth quarter reflects a wider than normal top line revenue range due to the cloudy demand environment. Our top line revenue expectations are driven by content gains which, combined with improved operating expense control and lower share count, should result in earnings above analyst expectations. Before we discuss the details of the third quarter, we'd like to make a few comments on the trends we are seeing in our business. We do not have any unique insight into the macroeconomic environment. We can only speak to what our customers and supply chain partners are telling us, and what in turn is reflected in our order books. We realize there's a significant amount of investor angst about the next couple of quarters in the semiconductor market. What we have seen in the automotive market is a modest slowdown primarily due to the WLTP testing bottlenecks in Europe and lower car sales in China. As it pertains to the industrial MCU market, we've seen a slight sequential weakening of order rates through distribution in China which we believe reflects the heightened sense of caution by our customers on placing orders given the shifting and the uncertain landscape in global trade and tariffs. To be clear, we have not experienced any weakness in the typical leading indicators including unusual backlog cancellations or any program cancellations. It is also not clear to us that there is any excess NXP inventory in our customer supply chain. In summary, while the environment is uncertain, we feel customer demand is okay and we are making the right product development investments which are aligned with the right customer engagements. Taken together, we are confident that we will successfully achieve our strategic and financial goals as presented at our recent Analyst Day. Now looking at the specifics of the third quarter, total revenue was $2.45 billion, an increase of 2% year-over-year. Our HPMS segment revenue was $2.35 billion, up 3% year-on-year. On an operating segment perspective, Automotive third quarter revenue was $990 million, up 4% year-on-year, with advanced analog and radar contributing to the year-on-year growth, while reduced pulls of automotive MCUs from Tier 1 customers impacted the overall year-on-year growth we had been experiencing. Looking forward, design win momentum continues to be strong in strategic areas like our S32 family of next-generation automotive MCUs, radar transceivers and battery management systems. The design win momentum is just explosive. Within Secure Connected Devices, or SCD, third quarter revenue was $717 million, up 1% year-on-year driven by the continued demand for general purpose multi-market MCUs, which were up high-single digits, somewhat offset by a significant decline in demand for mobile transaction solutions due to a strong new customer ramp during the previous year 2017. We continued to see solid design win momentum with our MCU and application processor portfolio. We recently announced the new i.MX RT600 crossover processor, and the customer interest is very strong. We continue to innovate in the mobile transaction area with our new integrated single-chip secure element and embedded NFC radio which is ramping into high volume on new phones this year. We also extended our thought leadership in mobile security into the IoT security space. We see strong customer activity with our new A71 security family which is aimed at providing end node security for IoT, cloud connected devices like video cameras, smart home gateways and industrial PLC controllers. In Secure Interface & Infrastructure, or SI&I, third quarter revenue was $511 million, up 5% year-on-year due to the early 5G network trial deployments out of North American carriers. Our customers view NXP as having the broadest portfolio of RF technologies for infrastructure applications, spanning LDMOS and GaN high power amplifiers for traditional macro base stations, with massive MIMO and millimeter wave products for the last mile applications. We see 5G as both a content and share gain opportunity. Lastly, in Secure Identification Solutions, or SIS, third quarter revenue was $133 million, down 4% year-on-year due to lower demand for bank card products. Turning to our distribution channel performance, we continue to manage closely the total months of inventory in the distribution channel at 2.4 months. We consistently target to maintain 2.5 months of supply, plus or minus 0.5 month in the channel. Distribution as a percent of total revenue continues to average about 55%, which is split between our mass market channel customers and our fulfillment channel for strategic customers. Given the uncertain environment, we are paying very close attention to the trends in the channel, staying close to our distribution partners. Before I pass the call to Peter, I'd like to announce our decision to shift how we report our revenue. Beginning January 1, 2019, we will report our revenue in terms of four specific end markets: automotive, industrial and IoT, mobile, and communications infrastructure and other. After multiple discussions with investors and sell-side analysts, we believe there are greater insights to be gained by making this shift to end markets. We recommend that all investors review the Analyst Day deck on our website as it provides the market size and growth potential of the addressable end markets, what we see as our unique opportunities to drive revenue in end market. We will post a historical reconciliation of the new end market focus to the existing operating segment structure. Now I'd like to pass the call over to Peter for a review of our financial performance.
Peter Kelly - NXP Semiconductors NV: Thank you, Rick, and good morning to everyone on today's call. As Rick has already covered the drivers of the revenue during the quarter, I'll move to the financial highlights. In summary, overall revenue performance was better than our midpoint guidance, although we did experience some softness in demand primarily from our partners in Greater China, and to a lesser extent, our Tier 1 automotive customers who didn't pull material at the rate originally anticipated. Our non-GAAP operating profit was 30%, and cash flow continues to be strong. Our balance sheet continues to be in excellent condition with a leverage ratio of 1.4 times, which is below our long-term target. Focusing on the details of Q3, total revenue was $2.45 billion, up 2% year-on-year. We generated $1.29 billion in non-GAAP gross profit and reported a non-GAAP gross margin of 53 basis points, down 70 basis points year-on-year due to a slightly weaker product mix. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $563 million, up $14 million year-on-year and slightly above the growth in our revenue. But this was a reduction of $28 million from the second quarter and about two-thirds of this reduction was from lower bonus accruals and a third was from general OpEx management. The lower bonus accrual rate will continue to benefit us in the fourth quarter before returning to a more normal rate in 2019. From a total operating profit perspective, non-GAAP operating profit was $733 million and non-GAAP operating margin was 30%, down 80 basis points year-on-year reflecting the previously mentioned items. Interest expense was $34 million, non-controlling interest was $13 million, and cash taxes for ongoing operations were $33 million. Stock-based compensation, which is not included in our non-GAAP earnings, was $83 million. Now I'd like to turn to the changes in our cash and debt. Our total debt at the end of Q3 was $6.36 billion, an increase of $1 billion due to the bridge loan facility we entered into during the quarter. Cash was $1.94 billion and net debt was $4.41 billion. We exited the quarter with a trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA of approximately $3.18 billion. Our ratio of net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of Q3 was 1.4 and our non-GAAP interest coverage was nearly 22 times. During the quarter we returned $4.6 billion to our shareholders and bought $49 million shares as part of our share repurchase program. We also announced the cash dividend and the initial cash payment of $0.25 per share was paid on October 5. Our balance sheet includes an accrual of $346 million for the payment of a deemed dividend tax on the buybacks we made. As a reminder, this payment does not go through the P&L and is likely to be paid in cash to the Dutch tax authorities in the fourth quarter. Turning to our working capital metrics, days of inventory was 100 days, a reduction of 11 days sequentially. Days receivable was 32 days, an increase of one day sequentially. And days payable were 74, a decline of 16 days versus the prior quarter. Taken together our cash conversion cycle was 58 days, an increase of six days versus the prior quarter. Cash flow from operations was $2.62 billion as we received a $2 billion termination fee in the quarter. And net CapEx was $155 million resulting in a free cash flow of $2.46 billion. Turning now to our expectations for the fourth quarter, we currently anticipate total revenue will be in a range of about down 5% to up 1% sequentially; at the midpoint of our range, about down 2% or $2.39 billion. We anticipate the following trends in the business. Auto is expected to be down mid-single digits sequentially. Secure Connected Devices is expected to be up low-single digits sequentially. Secure Interface & Infrastructure is expected to be down mid-single sequentially. Secure Identification Solutions is expected to be down low-single digits. And we anticipate revenue from Corporate and Other to be approximately $90 million. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be about 53% plus or minus 70 basis points. Operating expenses are expected to be about $551 million dollars plus or minus about $10 million. And taken together, we see non-GAAP operating margin to be about 30% plus or minus 100 basis points. We anticipate cash tax to be about $30 million dollars plus or minus $1 million, and estimate interest expense to be about $57 million as we are considering refinancing our bridge loan and extending our debt maturities if conditions allow it. Non-controlling interest will be about $13 million plus or minus $1 million. I'd like to provide an update on our share repurchase program. As previously mentioned, by the end of Q3, we'd bought back 49 million shares at a cost of $4.6 billion. Since September 30, we've repurchased an additional 5 million shares and have completed the previously announced $5 billion buyback. Additionally, the NXP Board of Directors has approved the company to utilize the remainder of the buyback authorized by shareholders at our General Meeting in June. So we now have the authorization to buy back an additional 15 million shares. As of September 30, our share count was 296 million and we would suggest that for modeling purposes, you use an average share count for the fourth quarter of 295 million shares. Finally, I have several housekeeping issues I'd like to address in follow-up to the Analyst Day. Although markets continue to be difficult to predict, and as Rick described, somewhat murky, we firmly believe we can outgrow the market by 1.5 times in the coming three years and remain comfortable with our three-year compound annual growth rate of 5% to 7% revenue growth. Secondly, we'll return all excess cash to shareholders through buybacks and dividends and expect to run our leverage level of 2 times. Disappointingly, it now looks like the Dutch government will not repeal the deemed dividend tax on buybacks, so we will continue to consider alternatives to minimize these payments. Thirdly, clearly our gross margins are not where we want them to be, but we plan to be at 55% exiting the fourth quarter of 2019 as I described in the Analyst Day. Fourth, I'd like to update you with an improved view of the cash taxes we gave you at the Analyst Day. We currently believe the effective rate on a cash basis will be 5%, 7% and 11% respectively for 2019, 2020 and 2021. Fifth and finally, as we've mentioned previously, we also have to pay incidental cash taxes related to the sale of standard products and the Qualcomm breakup fee, both of which occurred in prior periods and have been recorded in the provisions for income tax in the period they occurred. At this point in time, our revised estimate for these incidental cash payments will be $80 million in 2019 and $40 million in 2020. So with that, I'd like to turn it back to the operator for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Yeah. Good morning, guys. Thanks a lot for letting me asking questions. Congratulations on the solid results given the macro backdrop. Rick, my first question is just on SI&I. It was nice to see the pickup in the quarter and as you mentioned in your prepared comments, you kind of attributed it to a single U.S. carrier early deployment of 5G. I'm wondering if you could just give us a little bit more detail on what you think the 5G opportunity is on SIS – I'm sorry SI&I. You talked about it being both in content and a share story. Can you try to put some numbers around that for us?
Richard Lynn Clemmer - NXP Semiconductors NV: Yeah. It's a little premature to talk about the actual size of it since it's early on in the deployment stage. But I think we talked a little bit at the Analyst Day, John, about the massive MIMO opportunity for kind of the last mile. And clearly, what we saw in Q3 was some of the trial deployments taking place in that area and an opportunity for us really to be able to take what we believe to be a pretty unique technology to that. And we think there's clearly some opportunities. As you know, our expectations for SI&I over the next three years are pretty shallow and that because it's a combination of things. Actually, in the current quarter, our DN product area actually showed some upside as well. But clearly with the legacy roll-off of the network processors in the PowerPC side, we don't plan on that on a sustainable basis. I think we could see some upside in SI&I through a combination of our interface products that we'll sell for attach along with our MTU portfolio. But on the 5G itself, I think it's an opportunity that we see, but we'll be fairly – we'll not get ahead of ourselves relative to the opportunity associated with that. I think we're trying to be sure that we get the technology engagements and we win the design wins. And then when 5G is actually deployed significantly, we'll be able to take advantage of it.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: That's helpful. Then, for my follow-up guys, you gave us good color by your product segments and expectations in the December quarter. I might have missed this, but did you talk about what your expectation is for your distribution channel in Q4 is? Do you expect sell-in to be below sell-through? How do we see, or how do you guys see inventories progressing through the December quarter?
Richard Lynn Clemmer - NXP Semiconductors NV: Well John, we think our distribution inventory's in pretty good shape at 2.4 months. We actively manage that, specifically in this last quarter, as the environment changed as we went through the quarter. We were actively engaged being sure that we had the right level of distribution inventory and we think we'll do the same thing in Q4. I think it's still a very cloudy picture. The economy continues to be good. Production rates continue to be okay in most areas, but the concern over tariffs and the trade war clearly have our customers where they're being cautious in their inventory purchase and their backlog commitments to be sure that they don't get overextended. And I think we're going to go through that for some period of time. And it'll require us to be very well aligned with our distribution partners to be sure we have the right level of inventory in place to take advantage of the market opportunities, but be sure we don't have too much inventory in place.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Your line is now open.
Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Had first a question on gross margin. Came in just maybe a hair light in the quarter; the guide looks a little light. I know you said a weaker product mix, but in the quarter, Secure Interfaces was very strong. I would have thought that would have had higher margins, which might have helped. So if you could give us any maybe further view on other drivers of gross margins beyond product mix; utilization, pricing anything else that may be impacting that. And then around the – as you kind of work towards the 55% exiting 2019, what should that trajectory look like given where we're starting from today?
Peter Kelly - NXP Semiconductors NV: Hey, Stacy. Good to speak to you. Yeah, we were 30 basis points light, which is $7 million on, I don't know, $1.3 billion...
Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Yeah, just a hair. Yeah, yeah.
Peter Kelly - NXP Semiconductors NV: Yeah, so, I mean, to be honest, I don't have that much control over it. There's lots of moving things that go on. Certainly your volume, your yields, your pluses or minuses, you have all sorts of crazy mix kind of things going on. But there was no one big specific thing. We just have lots of pluses and minuses there.
Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: I guess I'm asking you more about Q4, about the guide; guidance for Q4?
Peter Kelly - NXP Semiconductors NV: Just again, we said we'd be at 55% ending next year. As we go from Q3 into Q4, yeah, the mix looks like it could be a bit better, but volumes down a bit, and there's all sorts of things that go on, Stacy. So I can't really give you a simple bridge from Q3 to Q4. And in terms of kind of how we progress to 55% next year, it won't be a kind of a linear track. And at this point, we're not guiding 2019 by quarter.
Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you. That's helpful. For my follow-up, around OpEx, I know you said you'd reduce bonus payments in Q3.
Peter Kelly - NXP Semiconductors NV: Yes.
Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: And that carries into Q4, and then I guess those come back with the new year. I think you usually typically have raises and everything that happen in there. So how should we think about I guess OpEx seasonality into Q4....
Peter Kelly - NXP Semiconductors NV: Yeah.
Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: ... I guess maybe coming off of what would be a suppressed Q4 base?
Peter Kelly - NXP Semiconductors NV: The way I think about it at a kind of simple level is we were roughly $30 million lower from Q2 to Q3, and two-thirds of that, $20 million was bonus and the other $10 million was real cuts we made which we'd expect to maintain. So as we go out of Q4, it's going to increase by at least the $20 million for the bonus. Well, assuming we perform next year and we get paid the bonus. And then as our revenue grows, then you would see our OpEx increase in line with revenue. But the big nut, so to speak, is that $20 million.
Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Got it. But you think you kind of like drift into the model like next year as you grow into it?
Peter Kelly - NXP Semiconductors NV: Sorry. Say that again?
Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: I'm sorry. You have an OpEx model that you're running heavy on right now. You think you kind of drift into the model next year as you grow?
Peter Kelly - NXP Semiconductors NV: Oh yeah, I'll stay in the – what'd we say, 16% on R&D, and ...
Richard Lynn Clemmer - NXP Semiconductors NV: 8% SG&A.
Peter Kelly - NXP Semiconductors NV: ... 8% in SG&A, that will be the – ultimately the worst case. Yeah.
Richard Lynn Clemmer - NXP Semiconductors NV: Yeah, I think that's the right way to think about it, Stacy. As we see the revenue strengthen and get through this cloudy period, we'll get back to the levels that we've talked about associated with OpEx.
Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you, guys.
Peter Kelly - NXP Semiconductors NV: Thanks.
Richard Lynn Clemmer - NXP Semiconductors NV: Thanks, Stacy.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
Vivek Arya - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Thanks for taking my question. I think, Rick, you mentioned that you might have a new reporting structure. I agree, I think that will be a very useful thing to get a sense of the trends. Is it possible to perhaps get a preview and see how your Q3 sales and then importantly Q4 outlook kind of roughly aligns with the new structure?
Richard Lynn Clemmer - NXP Semiconductors NV: We'll come back to that at the start of the year and give you the details. We can't change kind of in mid-stream and we want to do it in an orderly fashion and would provide a bridge to bridge back at the time that we do that implementation.
Vivek Arya - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: I see. Then for my follow-up, when I look, Rick, at the Automotive business, I understand that Q4, you are seeing the deceleration. A lot of your peers are seeing the deceleration, so that's not unexpected. But when I look at Q3, growth rates have come down to kind of the mid-single digit, and I think you mentioned the slower pull of some of your MCU business. This deceleration, is this more units? Is this more content? Because when I look at some of your peers in Q3, they still had pretty decent growth in Automotive. So how are you feeling about the Automotive business overall?
Richard Lynn Clemmer - NXP Semiconductors NV: Yeah, I think the Automotive business is performing quite well. Actually, if you look at it, we had strong growth rate in the analog side as well as in radar solutions. What happened was was we had our OEM customers that reduced their pulls based on what they were seeing, again, created by kind of this fear, uncertainty and doubt about the economic environment. We think that that's relatively short-lived. There was no issue on content whatsoever. It was just on actual volume and pulls from our major customers as they reduced their build plans as they went through the – towards the end of the quarter. And remember, that inventory is vendor-managed inventory. So we only get it as they actually – goes into production. So getting the confirmation of that kind of came in at the end of the quarter.
Jeff Palmer - NXP Semiconductors NV: And Vivek, this is Jeff. I would just add, as we noted at the Analyst Day, content is definitely the tailwind to the Automotive business over the next several years. So we don't see any issues to the content growth story whatsoever. Clearly, we have to ebb and flow with global SAAR, but that was never the key driver to our overall Automotive business.
Richard Lynn Clemmer - NXP Semiconductors NV: And when you talked about it versus our peers, our mix is quite unique in Automotive, being the largest semiconductor supplier into the automotive market. The micro space clearly gets a little more linked in the near-term to actual car production. But the ramp-up associated with new applications that we see and the opportunity to really provide safer driving is going to give us a real tailwind to help drive the growth that we see over the next few years.
Vivek Arya - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from William Stein with SunTrust. Your line is now open.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Great. Thanks for taking my question. First, a couple more on Automotive. Rick, you talked about explosive growth in design wins in the quarter. I'm wondering if you can comment as to the mix of technologies? I think at the Analyst Day and in the past, you've talked about a new opportunity in BMS. Obviously, radar's been something that you've been talking about for a while. There's also V2X. Any, not necessarily specific design wins, but technologies that you could highlight for us? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.
Richard Lynn Clemmer - NXP Semiconductors NV: Yeah, I think you said it well. It's radar, it's battery management systems, and it's also our new S32 platform. Now the S32 platform is one that we're behind on getting out to our customers, so it didn't contribute as many of the design wins in the most recent quarter. But in radar and battery management systems, we continue to see explosive growth with really a unique opportunity to lead where we're designed in at all of the major Tier 1s on radar and being able to drive that at a very rapid growth rate as we see the implementation to actually make driving safer here over the next couple years.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Great. Thank you. And the follow-up relates to margins again. I'm wondering if the company has done any sort of sensitivity analysis as to let's say you don't meet the revenue growth goals in this year, understanding that's a three-year view. But if 2019 winds up being flat or let's say even down 5, would you still be able to get into the range of your targets? And sort of any comment as to what the biggest drivers would be besides just the leverage that you'd see, operating leverage from revenue growth and (32:02)?
Peter Kelly - NXP Semiconductors NV: Yeah, good question, Will. About 35% of our COGS is fixed. So you can do the math on volume. I mean, it's not science, but that gives you a good idea. I think if the revenue was flat, yeah, we'd be able to get into our gross margin range. We went through some of the bridges at the Analyst Day and I think directionally they're right. It's not so much about volume as making sure the manufacturing teams are doing all the things they need to do on cost reduction with our suppliers and yield improvement, making sure the marketing teams are doing the right things on pricing. But for us to see a real issue on gross margin, it has to be just an unbelievable downturn next year with absolute significant drops in revenue because at 35% fixed cost, we have a lot more flexibility now than we ever did in the past.
Richard Lynn Clemmer - NXP Semiconductors NV: You know, one thing I should just go back and add on Auto, when the question was asked about the MCU volume, part of that was related to the WLTP and the testing that was going on in Europe had slowed the implementation. So that clearly was a factor in our results in Q3 that I should've just been more specific about a few minutes ago.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Helps. Thanks, and congrats again.
Richard Lynn Clemmer - NXP Semiconductors NV: Thank you.
Peter Kelly - NXP Semiconductors NV: Thanks, Will.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Ramsay with Cowen. Your line is now open.
Matthew D. Ramsay - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you very much, guys. I just want to step back in a bigger picture and I think Stacy might have asked some questions earlier around OpEx, specifically around getting into the model next year. But one of the questions I get most often from investors on a go-forward basis is – maybe we can talk about the investments you made in the core franchises of the business during that 20-month, 21-month period under the Qualcomm umbrella of the deal. And it occurs to me that your OpEx is actually been managed quite well, but R&D spending is actually up on an absolute basis and as a percentage of revenue. And I guess maybe you guys could talk a little bit about where you focused investments during that period of time, particularly in the Auto business. And I guess the pushback is did you under-invest and is that going to come back on a go-forward basis in revenue? And it occurs to me that I think you didn't, so maybe you could just about that at a high level. Thank you.
Richard Lynn Clemmer - NXP Semiconductors NV: Yeah. I think if anything, we didn't take complete control off of the investments we were making in R&D, but I think we were a little more gentle in cutting back to fit within a budget as we went through that 21-month period of time, and now we get the benefit of it. The investment we made to continue to solidify our position in radar, the ability to take what was some early opportunities in battery management and really invest to see that through to an opportunity are key areas that we think are key for us. And in addition, our S32 micro platform sets us up very well in a unique position that no other competitor has the ability to drive. The ability to drive 16 nanometer FinFET solutions while our competitors are now, at the same time, beginning to introduce 28 nanometer, positions us in a very unique position quite well and will help drive our growth. In R&D investment specifically in Automotive, we've been increasing that in kind of a 15% compounded growth rate based on where we were. In the industrial and IoT space, investing in the crossover IoT, and the ability to continue to solidify our position in the apps processor and the i.MX family and drive some unique platforms that will be able to actually address machine learning and the implementation of artificial intelligence is key areas that we've invested in as well. In addition to that, we implemented the single-chip secure element in NFC radio. So, I think there's no lack of investments that we've done. We have made the right kind of investments. In addition to what I talked about in Automotive, we also have been investing in Ethernet that will position us quite well to continue to strengthen our in-vehicle networking platforms and our leadership position that we've had in the car space and the domain controller opportunity that we see in Auto. So, the opportunities have been there. We've been investing. There is no lack of investment that's been done during that 21-month period of time. In fact, if anything we've probably invested more than we would have if we were on a go-alone basis to try to be sure that everything was set up to move forward. So, I don't think you – you can rest assured to tell investors there wasn't a lack of investment that puts anything in question going forward. But providing that capability of bringing security to the edge and what we see, the opportunity to really create and support the disruption of the cloud from IoT and in Ultralight band are the areas that really position us uniquely going forward and the reason why we feel very comfortable outgrowing the market by at least 50% and still feel comfortable with the kind of 6% to 8% compounded growth rate going forward.
Matthew D. Ramsay - Cowen & Co. LLC: No, Rick thanks for that and that's consistent with my view. I'm just relaying some pushback that I've gotten. Just as a follow-up...
Richard Lynn Clemmer - NXP Semiconductors NV: Keep telling them.
Matthew D. Ramsay - Cowen & Co. LLC: Fair enough. Just a quick follow-up on SI&I given some fairly good upside in Q3, and you've talked about it into Q4. How should we think about calibrating that expectation into what's probably a seasonally down Q1, just so we have the right sort of trajectory into Q1? If there's anything you could add there, that'd be helpful. Thanks guys.
Richard Lynn Clemmer - NXP Semiconductors NV: Yeah, we don't give guidance for Q1. But I do think that we may see some things that will be a little bit abnormal associated with 5G implementation, but it's really too early to say. And we'll come back and talk about that more when we give you our Q1 guidance.
Jeff Palmer - NXP Semiconductors NV: Operator?
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Seymore with the Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question and congrats, especially on the cost and cash return. Wanted to focus on SCD part of the business. Some of the concerns people have in broad-based markets aren't just limited to Auto, but also kind of general purpose controllers, inventory and broad-based analog those sorts of things. So I wondered what you're seeing in that business, especially given that you're guiding it up sequentially in the fourth quarter.
Richard Lynn Clemmer - NXP Semiconductors NV: Well, you know the interesting thing about SCD is it's a mix of products. And so, the mobile wallet combined with the implementation of the mass market, general purpose micros as well as our i.MX family. Clearly in China, we're seeing the FUD factor that we talked about where our customers are actually being somewhat slow in placing orders and being very diligent relative to their inventory levels and that has an impact on the mass market micros. And while we see a slowing on a sequential basis in the growth rate, not a decline, but a slowing growth rate, still see the opportunity for growth year-over-year because of the position that we've had and the strong performance we had early on in the year. So I think for us the opportunity's still there. We still continue to be working with our distribution partners as the majority of that business, clear majority of that business, probably around three-fourths of it goes through the distribution channel. So it's really important that we work closely with our distribution partners to be sure that we get the technology out to customers where it can be implemented. But as we see the opportunities in IoT and the ability to really drive the utilization that the cloud supports in making IoT real, that business is really critical to be able to fulfill that opportunity. And so, I think that's really one of the tempering factors is, is still those designs and the opportunities that we'll have, even with people being a little more reluctant in placing orders in the near term as they're trying to figure out what's going on with the tariffs and trade war and really creating a significant amount of fear, uncertainty and doubt, or FUD, relative to the overall marketplace.
Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. And for my follow-up, I just wanted to go back to the Auto side of things. Rick, you mentioned a couple things. The FUD side for sure and then the WLTP side. For that latter side of the equation, I realize that the former with the macro impact is difficult for you guys to project. But for the latter side, it seems like it's a transitional issue in Europe. Might be a big one, but a transitional one nonetheless would that change in testing standards. How do you view that kind of lull working its way through the system? And when do you think that headwind might abate for NXP?
Richard Lynn Clemmer - NXP Semiconductors NV: Well, I think our customers are working closely to try to address that so that they'll get through that over a relatively short period of time. I don't think that's going to be a prolonged period. I think it'll work through the supply chain here fairly quickly. And I think that it will continue to be a near-term factor as they go through their pools. But we have the impression that it'll get back to kind of a normal ongoing basis here relatively soon. And then it's going to be more dependent on actual car sales. The interesting thing is when people talk about the reduced sales of cars in China, the interesting thing is if you go back and look at over the last four or five years, July is always the lowest car sales month in China. And if you actually look at actual sales in August and September, while they were down from the previous year, they were actually increasing sequentially. And so I think part of it's going to depend on what happens with the Chinese government. When this happened a few years ago with the first time where there was a decline in car sales, they actually changed the tax structure. And car sales in China got back on track very quickly and we'll see that take place. But on the WLTP specifically, we think it's only one- or two-quarter issue.
Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yes, thank you. Rick, 5G looks like a positive development. You noted some of the North America initial activity. As you look into 2019, can you just discuss kind of the visibility you have into additional 5G ramps and how you're thinking about the business?
Richard Lynn Clemmer - NXP Semiconductors NV: Well, I think it's really going to depend on how that gets deployed. I know early on, some of these last mile implementations, they're doing those with FPGAs which are extremely expensive, so I don't see those going to mass market associated with it. So I think they have to be able to get to a commercial solution that they can drive in a cost-effective manner the deployment associated with 5G. And it's not clear to me that that's taking place quite yet. So I think it's an opportunity that clearly was a positive for us in Q3. We're being a little more cautious on the implementation in 2019 because we think they have to get to a cost effective commercial implementation before we'll see the volumes actually begin to ramp on a significant basis.
Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. And then just as a follow-up regarding the overall environment, a couple companies have talked about kind of a downtick in the month of September. Can you just talk about kind of linearity in the quarter and how things progress, and how kind of orders were up until October?
Richard Lynn Clemmer - NXP Semiconductors NV: So, it depends on the business. Each one of the businesses is separate. Clearly, the lion's share of our Automotive business is on vendor managed inventory. So those pulls kind of began to slow. But August was kind of a vacation month as well, so it was down a little bit as well as we went through the vacation months in Europe associated with August. In September, I don't think we saw anything that continued to go down at all. Again, I think it's really important to point out that while we see the growth slowing on a sequential basis, we still see positive growth year-over-year. And we don't see anything continuing to weaken or weaken more significantly from where we were in September. The environment continues to be kind of status quo, although quite cloudy, and still not really able to confirm getting back on the steady growth rate of the first half of the year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Morning. Thank you for taking my question, and great job on the quarterly execution. Just back on the multi-market MCU which was up high-single digits, so this was really good performance. I mean, it bucked the trend of the overall general purpose MCU segment which was – I think it was only up about 1% to 2% in Q3, kind of looking at the SIA data. This is even with some of the weaker demand trends in China. So Rick, if you could just help us understand what are the geographies or applications that are helping to drive the above-market demand for your general purpose MCU business. And within the SIA data, it looks like 32-bit also kind of outperformed year-over-year. Obviously, that's a strong leadership position for you guys, but I'd love to get your thoughts.
Richard Lynn Clemmer - NXP Semiconductors NV: Yeah, so Harlan, I think one of the key things that was a benefit for us in Q3, we brought our lead times back in check on Kinetis. Early in the year we were talking about that we were out at 39-week lead times, which was just unacceptable for our customers, and we're down kind of in the 14-week, 15-week lead time at the current basis. So that transition, obviously as you go through that transition, it creates a little confusion with your distribution customers as well. So we've kind of gone through that in Q3. But clearly, based on the results that you talked about, we would have gained share in Q3 based on the strong portfolio we have. As you point out, we're really focused on 32-bit ARM. We're not focused on 8-bit kind of general marketplace, and I think that played out well for us. We continue to have the broadest platform in place with the high-performance Kinetis and the LPC on the low end as well as in the apps processor on the i.MX and the product that we just announced recently on the first implementation of the crossover from i.MX technology but at a micro cost associated with it. So I think we continue to feel like we've got the broadest portfolio, the best portfolio for our customers really trying to see how they can use the cloud to implement the disruption opportunity that people talk about as IoT. For the last few years, everybody's been talking about IoT but it was really hard to get your hands around what was real. And I think what we see is the clarity of being able to take advantage of the cloud now through the computing at the edge and bringing that secure, and I emphasize the word secure, computing to the edge to be able to give that. But clearly, I think based on the results you talked about, we did gain share in Q3, and hope to be in a position with our portfolio to continue to maintain that going forward and grow it.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yeah, good performance there. Manufacturing utilization trends, 87% in Q3. How is the team positioning utilizations in Q4?
Richard Lynn Clemmer - NXP Semiconductors NV: I think the interesting thing about that is you can't take as much out of that as you used to a couple years ago on the utilization. One of the things that we're going through is is our individual factories have some unique requirements to be able to meet the ramp-up associated with our radar requirements internally as well as some of our others, and we have our capacity limited in some of our analog side of our Automotive business. So as we implement the expanded capacity on that, I think that that creates a little bit of a factor that's not as significant on the utilization itself. We continue to grow our external support as well. So I think today we're kind of a little over ...
Peter Kelly - NXP Semiconductors NV: Just over 50% that's external.
Richard Lynn Clemmer - NXP Semiconductors NV: Yeah, a little over 50% that's external. But the utilization, I don't think you can take as much about that on a quarterly basis. And specifically right now as we go through the transition in trying to expand our capacity in radar as well as some of our unique analog capacity, auto analog capacity, we'll go through a little bit of tempering of utilization to be able to bring up that capacity.
Peter Kelly - NXP Semiconductors NV: Yeah, overall, it'll be about the same in Q4 as it was in Q3.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: All right.
Peter Kelly - NXP Semiconductors NV: So as Rick said, it's kind of a useless indicator these days. And only, what is it, 12.5% of our COGS goes through the internal numbers if you do some (50:26) and then you have to look at it by factory. And so it's kind of interesting as an indicator, but it's kind of not very useful in terms of helping you understand what's going on in the cost.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yeah. Thanks for the insights.
Richard Lynn Clemmer - NXP Semiconductors NV: Yeah, thanks, Harlan.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yeah. Thank you so much. I had a question on Automotive going into 2019. Rick, you talked about the design win momentum in MCUs with your S32 family; you talked about radar. You talked about BMS as well. I know it's kind of early, but from a content growth perspective, how do you see momentum going into 2019?
Richard Lynn Clemmer - NXP Semiconductors NV: What we talk about is over the three-year period of time, and I think 2019 will be a clear indication in implementation associated with that. As we went through it, Kurt talked about it at the Analyst Day that even with 1% or 2% growth in actual car production, which we think still with the growth of the middle class in the developing world, specifically in China, but Southeast Asia as well, we'll see some production increase in cars. But even without that, we'll see the content driving a significant opportunity for us to continue to grow kind of mid to high-single digit through the implementation of radar and level 2 and level 3 capability of the car, which is – we think we're in a very solid position to be able to continue to maintain our leadership position in the overall radar solution. The implementation of Ethernet to be able to process data around the car at a much higher speed that's required for the implementation of ADAS and the changed architecture of the car with the domain controllers and ability for the car companies to really look at a different implementation, which our S32 family of product fits very nicely into. So we feel very comfortable with our position in Automotive and look forward to continuing to expand it and I think that'll take place in 2019 as the first year of the three-year basis that we talked about at the Analyst Day.
Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: So is it fair to assume that you come in within the range of the 7% to 10% growth rate in 2019 as well?
Jeff Palmer - NXP Semiconductors NV: No, Toshiya. I don't think we're going to guide 2019. I think we laid out a three-year target for our businesses, 7% to 10% for the Automotive business, all driven by the different irons we have in the fire as Rick laid out, but we're not going to guide 2019 specifically.
Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Fair enough. And then as a quick follow-up for Peter, on gross margins, again I just wanted to confirm. In a flattish revenue environment in 2019, are you still confident, if that were to be the case, can you still hit that 55% gross margin target exiting the year and if so, what would be some of the drivers? Thank you.
Peter Kelly - NXP Semiconductors NV: Yes. And exactly the same drivers I described in the Analyst Day, because the reality is even if it's flat, you'll see changes in mix and it's all about kind of how we drive our cost reduction and manage our pricing.
Richard Lynn Clemmer - NXP Semiconductors NV: But I think that you got to be realistic. With the economic environment we see, we think it would be hard for the year to be flat based on the economic environment unless something were to weaken significantly in the general economic environment. So, while we're going through this cloudy period, I think you got to be careful about not looking too far in the future associated with that, so long as the robust economic environment is still in place. Clearly, the semiconductor industry is going to drive content gain after we get through this quarter or two of uncertainty associated with what's going on the marketplace.
Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you so much.
Richard Lynn Clemmer - NXP Semiconductors NV: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from C. J. Muse with Evercore. Your line is now open.
C. J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC: Yeah. Good morning. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess Peter, first question, trying to better understand kind of debt financing, interest expense going forward and your means for additional buyback. So, could you tell us what kind of cash you need to run the business, what you're planning in terms of the debt refinancing both the bridge and the cash convertible notes, and how we should think about potential incremental debt on top of that in the coming months?
Peter Kelly - NXP Semiconductors NV: Okay, so we want to run two times net debt to trailing 12 months EBITDA. So, to the extent that the markets cooperate, we would add additional debt. We've mentioned on my call we're kind of looking at that so this quarter, we definitely look to replace the bridge with a bond. The convert, that comes due the end of next year. Same thing; we'd look to replace that with a convert. And I guess very, very roughly. a two times net debt to trailing 12 months EBITDA. That would say between now and the end of next year you could buy back an additional $3 billion very roughly. And then in subsequent years, $2 million-plus per year.
Richard Lynn Clemmer - NXP Semiconductors NV: But as Peter talked about replacing the convert, we probably would not be replacing the convert with a convert at the current equity price.
Peter Kelly - NXP Semiconductors NV: Oh, yeah, yeah. I mean, at current equity prices, it'd absolutely be a bond. Yeah. But that's a year away.
C. J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC: Got you. Great. And I guess, as a follow-up, from a free cash flow margin perspective, I think you're running around 20% the last two years excluding the Qualcomm payment. So curious, can you kind of walk through how you plan to drive that higher? You've talked about gross margin. I imagine that flows right through. Are there other drivers that you're working on?
Peter Kelly - NXP Semiconductors NV: Yeah, yeah. To the extent that EBIT margin increases, cash flow margin would increase. So, at a real simple level, EBIT margin will increase because gross margin will improve and OpEx percent will decline. But our working capital will be kind of about what it is. So, yeah, I mean, it's directly connected with EBIT margins.
Richard Lynn Clemmer - NXP Semiconductors NV: Yeah, I think the one thing that we talked about at the Analyst Day is, is we might invest or we plan to invest a little more in CapEx in the near term really to take advantage of some of the opportunities that we have with some of our unique processes that will be a little bit of a factor above the 5% for a short period of time. But our cash flow position we think is in a very strong position and the growth of the business that we feel very good about over the next three years will continue to generate a huge amount of cash.
C. J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC: Thanks, Rick.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Danely with Citigroup. Your line is now open.
Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey. Thanks, guys. Just a quick question on I guess next year. So, Rick you talked about the murky environment right now. If the environment stays "murky," conceptually what should we be thinking about for Q1 revenue on a sequential basis? Like down 5% to 10% would be something reasonable range?
Peter Kelly - NXP Semiconductors NV: This is Peter Kelly. We don't guide Q1. I mean, clearly, you can go and look at historic seasonality, but we're not guiding Q1.
Richard Lynn Clemmer - NXP Semiconductors NV: Yeah, I think that one thing that you talked about though on the cloudy environment, if the economic environment stays as robust as it is, this cloudy environment cannot continue for a prolonged period of time. So long as production rates continue and the economic growth continues, you have to get back to a steady increase in production. So, we don't anticipate that that's something that's prolonged for an extended period of time unless the economic environment were to worsen because of the FUD factor associated with the tariffs and trade war. So if those don't materialize, we don't think this cloudy environment will continue for a prolonged period of time throughout next year.
Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks a lot, Rick.
Richard Lynn Clemmer - NXP Semiconductors NV: Thanks.
Jeff Palmer - NXP Semiconductors NV: Operator, we'll take one more call, and then we probably have to wrap it up here today.
Operator: You say you'll take one more question?
Jeff Palmer - NXP Semiconductors NV: Yes, ma'am.
Operator: All right. Our last question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Your line is now open.
Tore Egil Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes. Thank you for sneaking me in. First question, Rick, you talked about lead times for the microcontroller business, but can you talk about trends of your lead times for sort of the overall business the last few quarters?
Richard Lynn Clemmer - NXP Semiconductors NV: For the LPC business?
Tore Egil Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: No. So, lead times in general for your business. You talked specifically about microcontrollers earlier.
Richard Lynn Clemmer - NXP Semiconductors NV: Yeah. No. I think in general that's kind of the typical lead time that we have is in that 12- to 16-week period of time across the board. So I don't think there's anything that's different than that. It depends on the actual manufacturing cycle time of some of our unique products, but we're pretty much in that typical lead time and we see it in a very healthy situation right now.
Jeff Palmer - NXP Semiconductors NV: And Tore, you have to remember, most of the Auto business, which is almost 50% of the revenue, runs on a vendor managed inventory model, right, which is kind of theoretically zero lead time business since we consign inventory to different build locations.
Tore Egil Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: That's helpful. And as my follow-up, Peter, do you have a CapEx number for next year, a forecast at this point?
Peter Kelly - NXP Semiconductors NV: At the Analyst Day, we said our normal run rate is 5% but over the next three years, we could spend up to 7% per year.
Tore Egil Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you.
Peter Kelly - NXP Semiconductors NV: You're welcome, Tore.
Richard Lynn Clemmer - NXP Semiconductors NV: Thanks a lot. So once again, thanks for joining us today after our second quarter here following our 21-month quiet period with the Qualcomm transaction. Clearly, as we talked about, we think the near-term period and the cloudiness associated with it we'll be able to work our way through. The key factors is with the overall growth in the economy, we think that this will not be a prolonged period of cloudiness, that we'll work our way through to back to see a steady growth rate over the next few quarters. But clearly, the product position that we have, the design wins that we continue to win, and the cash flow capability of our business is what excites us about the opportunity to create real shareholder value, and look forward to your continued support. Thank you very much.
Jeff Palmer - NXP Semiconductors NV: Thank you very much, everyone.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the NXP Semiconductors' Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode to prevent background noise. [Operator Instructions] We will have a question-and-answer session later, and the instructions will be given at that time. And as a reminder, this conference may be recorded. Now it's my pleasure to turn the call to Mr. Jeff Palmer, VP of Investor Relations. You may begin.
Jeff Palmer: Thank you, Carmen, and good morning everyone. Welcome to the NXP Semiconductors' second quarter 2018 earnings call. We appreciate you joining us on such short notice today. With me on the call today is Rick Clemmer, NXP's President and CEO; and Peter Kelly, our CFO. As it’s been 21 months since our last earnings call, we will extend the Q&A session today to accommodate as many of the analysts questions as possible. If you've not obtained a copy of our second quarter 2018 earnings press release, it can be found on our company website under the Investor Relations section at nxp.com. Additionally, we have posted on our Investor Relations website a supplemental earnings summary presentation and a document of our historical financials to assist in your modeling efforts. This call is being recorded and will be available for replay from our corporate website. Our call today will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause NXP's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. These risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to statements regarding the macroeconomic impact on the specific and markets in which we operate, the sale of new and existing products and our expectations for financial results for the third quarter of 2018. Please be reminded that NXP undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements. For full disclosure on forward-looking statements, please refer to our press release. Additionally, during our call today, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures which exclude the impact of purchase price accounting, restructuring, stock based compensation and impairment merger related cost and other charges that are driven primarily by discrete events that the management does not consider to be directly related to NXP's underlying core operating performance. Pursuant to Regulation G, NXP has provided reconciliation to non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our second quarter 2018 press release which will be furnished to the SEE on Form 6-K and is available on NSP's website in the Investor Relations section. I'd like to turn the call over to Rick.
Rick Clemmer: Thanks Jeff, and welcome everyone to our conference call today. Hopefully, you've all seen announcement that Qualcomm has decided not to extend the purchase agreement and did not move forward with the proposed acquisition of NXP. It is an understatement to say we are all disappointed in the outcome of the regulatory approval process in China. Before we start today, I'd like to acknowledge the Qualcomm team and in particularly, Steve Mollenkopf and all of his executive team in addition to the employees involved in the plan to integration process. The combination of the two companies would have represented the true semiconductor industry powerhouse. The product portfolios for highly complementary including the market leading NXP auto portfolio and the Snapdragon processors and the strong NXP EMC portfolio in Qualcomm connectivity portfolios. However, we do not believe there is any need value to dwell on what could have been. I'll spend any time discussing the events of the last two years. Instead, we're going to look forward and continue to execute to our strategy and focus on what we can do to accelerate and expand our leadership. We realized that it's been 21 months since we were last able to actively communicate with our shareholders and that over the period of visibility in our operations has been limited. Therefore before we turn to the review of our second quarter performance, we would like to share four key messages which we've gotten questions over the last two years. First, I understand we've been asked about the level of commitment of the NXP executive management team. Over the course of the last 21 months, the entire executive team including both Peter and myself have been fully engaged in actively running the business. This also includes the general managers of our security businesses further down in the organization. While the organization has experienced a level of deal fatigue, the core basics of the business have actually strengthened by position in auto and IoT is now stronger than when we announced the transaction 21 months ago. With the decision announced overnight in our recent decisions with the board, the management team including Peter and myself are fully committed to continue to drive the future success of NXP. Secondly, during the transaction we have not provided any insights into the potential future performance of the company. I would like to quickly review the model we have been operating towards in which we believe shareholders should judge our future success. Consistent with our prior approach, we will provide guidance on one quarter basis and reference our three year model targets for longer term discussion. During Peter's remarks, he will provide specific guidance for the third quarter. Our long term model is consistent with what we presented prior to the Qualcomm transaction announcement in October 2016. Specifically, from a revenue perspective, we believe NXP can achieve a three year compounded growth rate of approximately 5% to 7%, which is 50% greater than the growth of our focused addressable market. In other words, our focus TAM, which WTS with memory optimal discrete [ph] removed. We will continue to target our non-GAAP gross margins in the range of 53% to 57% and we will continue to make focused investments which will drive our non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 31% to 34% which is based on an R&D investment level of 14% to 16% of revenue and an SG&A target of 6% to 8%. At our an Analyst Day on September 11, which we are now announcing, we will present a deep dive into how we will achieve our goals including a strategic update on our focused businesses in the unusually strong opportunity we have in those specific markets. Thirdly, since the Qualcomm transaction was announced in October 2016, where we suspended our capital return program. Going forward, our capillary procurement policy will be consistent with prior periods and is aimed at returning all excess free cash flow for shareholders. We just yesterday obtained authorization from our board to initiate a $5 billion share repurchase program. Our current tax position is very strong with nearly $3 billion accumulated on the balance sheet. The amount is even after we retire, $1.25 billion of gross debt in Q2 and does not include the determination fee due from Qualcomm. Our leverage is below our long term target and quarterly free cash flow generation is continues to be very strong. In a few moments, Peter will discuss the funding of the program as well as our target leg breach which remains consistent with our prior plans. Lastly, I would like to reflect on the business trends over the last 21 months. Now look at the result for 2017 that were very good. We grew our each HPMS revenue to $8.75 billion, growing solidly in our focus markets. We successfully completed the Freescale integration and began to see the anticipated revenue synergies. We be and see solution synergies in our automotive business, our general purpose microcontroller business performed very well, did the strong adoption of both i.MX apps processor, high performance apps processor as well as continued adoption in the mass market for the kinetics and LPC MCU products. In terms of challenges, RF power business has recently seen issues of slow growth in the base station market which we again see weakness also in the digital networking business in 2017 and the bottoming of our bank card business came into clearer focus. We are at the halfway mark in 2018. We continue to see some of the same trends. Our auto and microcontroller business continue the positive trajectory seen in 2017. The severity of the transitions within the digital networking became even more apparent in the ebbs and flows of the base station market in China continue to challenge the growth of our RF power business. And after 21 months, we did begin to see some deal related impacts to the business including some of our strategic mobile customers disengaging our new expanded opportunities. However, on balance, we see far more opportunities to excel and lead in our target markets than hurdles in which we need to overcome. Based on direct impact from customers, we have the right products, the right go-to-market strategies and the best talented employees who are held in very high regard of our customers. Quite a winning combination. Our auto business continues to strengthen our unique position where we can lead with the technology to provide safer driving through level three or four on our way to actually moving to timeless driving. We now hear from our auto customers, we have a unique portfolio to also address the electric vehicle market growth, which is an incremental growth driver from what we had talked about previously. Our smarter world are as we like to refer to the LoT is in a good position as we increasingly work through the cloud providers to allow the smart edge processing to facilitate and explain full use of the capabilities of the cloud and to facilitate the connection of everything to make all of our world a more productive and better place to live. Now turning to an overview of our performance in the second quarter. Since we did not give guidance for Q2, my comments be relative to our performance in prior periods in not what analysts have assumed. Overall, our revenue in the quarter was good albeit with a few items which were out of our control creating somewhat modest headwinds. The ban on shipments to ZTE caused a short term disruption to our RF power business and to a lesser degree our digital networking and other businesses. In automotive industry shortages of discrete components caused a modest pause in demand for automotive MCU products. In addition, we continue to have capacity issues in our kinetic family of microcontrollers as their upside design wins has put us behind in ramping our manufacturing capacity to support our upside customer requirements. Looking at the specifics, total revenue in Q2 was $2.29 billion dollars, an increase of 4% year-on-year and our HPMS segment, which really is our focused revenue was $2.19 billion up 5% year-on-year. From an operating segment perspective, within automotive, revenue was a record high at just over $1 billion, up 7% year-on-year with all product categories growing nicely. One of the most encouraging trends we have seen in our auto business has been the increasing cross selling of the entire portfolio. Our engagement with customers have elevated probably to more consultative level in which we propose complete solutions that leverage products from across our entire portfolio. NXP's view by our automotive customers is having the most complete system solutions with a clear expertise and high performance processing, analog, security and functional safety. The view provides opportunity for NXP to be a true partner in the automotive market. As auto OEMs have made the journey towards safer driving and ultimately providing the building blocks for a timeless driving. Within Secure Connected Devices or SCD, revenue with $644 million, up 10% versus the first quarter of 2017. The core growth areas of general purpose microcontrollers and mobile transactions were both up year-on-year. Micros continued to experience long lead times in our kinetic family due to the tightness of wafer supply. Our mobile transaction business continue to benefit from expanding customer adoption with shipments beginning to accelerate to a large OEM in India. Within Secure Interface and Infrastructure or SI&I, revenue was $398 million dollars, down 9% versus the year ago period. While interface products were up high single digit percent with both RF power and digital networking down over 20%. The quarterly performance of the segment was impacted do the U.S. Commerce Department's ban a material shipments to ZTE. The high performance RF power business was materially impacted into a lesser extent the digital networking. Taken together the ZTE ban that cost us about $31 million in the quarter. Lastly within Secure Identification Solutions or SIS, revenue was $143 million, up 7% versus a year ago period with a growth driven by strong trends in mobility and retail market due to good demand for both our UHF tagging and MIFARE access solutions. Both the government and banking revenue were down versus the second quarter of 2017, reflecting the continued lumping project nature of this market. Turning to our distribution channel. The total months of inventory in the distribution channel held steady at 2.4. We consistently target to maintain 2.5 months of supply plus or minus half month in the channel. A range we had stayed within for 34 quarters. Distribution as a percentage of total revenue is just over 50%. We use this channel to address the mass market for products like general purpose MCU which are sold to thousands of end customers. The channel is also leveraged by our strategic customers which require NXP to position material prior to the seasonal peaks. Overall as our business grows, the percentage of business through distribution has also increased at a rate higher than that. Our channel inventory is in good shape and we will continue to target supply 2.5 months plus or minus half month. Before I turn the call over to Peter, I want to thank all of our employees for their dedication, hard work and the laser focus they have shown over the last several years as we completed the Freescale integration and preparing for the Qualcomm integration. We ask a lot of all of our employees and we ask it often. We know the deal fatigue has been an issue for the last few quarters, but now is the time to focus on our short journey and move forward to driver our future strategy which will result in the industry leadership in our focus markets. I am genuinely impressed and grateful and how our employees rose to the task presented to them. I think all of them and I'm proud of the organization and each person has contributed towards success. Now I'd like to pass the call over to Peter for a review of our financial performance.
Peter Kelly: Thank you, Rick. Good morning, everyone. On today’s call, I like to say it’s a great to be able to speak to you all again today and I’m really looking forward to meeting most of you in person in the near future. As Rick as already covered the drivers of the revenue during the quarter, I’ll move to the financial highlights. In summary, revenue and profit in the quarter was adversely impacted by the ZTE ban and auto customers managing their shortages and other components. Non-GAAP operating profit was 29% and cash flow continues to be strong. Our balance sheet is in excellent condition with a leverage ratio of 0.74 times, which is substantially below our long term target. Focusing on the details of Q2, total revenue was $2.9 billion, up 4% year-on-year. We generated $1.21 billion in non-GAAP gross profits and reported a non-GAAP gross margin of 52.8%, down 20 basis points year-on-year. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $591 million, up $50 million year-on-year, reflecting the impact of a strong dollar and investments we’ve made in the business. From a total operating profit perspective, non-GAAP operating profit was $618 million and non-GAAP operating margin was 27%, down 140 basis points year-on-year, reflecting above mentioned items. Interest expense was $31 million, non-controlling interest was $12 million and cash taxes were $56 million. Stock based compensation which is not included in our non-GAAP earnings was $69 million. Now I’d like to turn to the changes in our cash and debt. Total debt at the end of Q2 was $5.34 billion, cash was $2.98 billion, and net debt was $2.36 billion. We exited the quarter with a trailing 12 month EBITDA of approximately $3.18 billion. Our ratio of net debt to trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA at the end of Q2 was 0.74 times, as I said earlier and our non-GAAP interest coverage was nearly 20 times. Turning to working capital metrics. Days of inventory was 111 days, days receivable was 31 days, an increase of 1 day sequentially. And days payable was 90 days, up 7 days versus the prior quarter. Taken together, our cash conversion cycle was 52 days and improvements of 3 days versus the prior quarter. Cash from operations was $403 million and net CapEx was $129 million resulting in non-GAAP free cash flow of $274 million. Turning to our expectations for the third quarter. We currently anticipate total revenue will be up in a range of 3% to 9% sequentially. And at the midpoint of our range, we anticipate the following trends in the business. Also is expected to be flat sequentially. Secure Connected Devices is expected to be up low double digits. Secure Interface and Infrastructure is expected to be up about 20%. And Secure Identification Solutions is expected to be down high-single digits sequentially. We anticipate revenue from corporate and other to be approximately $95 million. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be about 53.3, plus or minus 50 basis points. Operating expenses are expected to be about $588 million, plus or minus about $10 million. Taking together we see non-GAAP operating margin to be about 29.1%, a plus or minus 60 basis point. We anticipate cash tax to be about $37 million, estimated interest expense of about $32 million with non-controlling interest at $13 million. I’m about to comment on our capital structure and announced share repurchase program. Prior to the final transaction, NXP consistently returned all of its excess cash to its owners. We continue to believe this and are supported in this view by our Board of Directors. Given our short term cash requirements, our current leverage and the fact that we believe the current market price significantly in the value of the company, we believe the buyback is an appropriate method to return excess cash to shareholders. To this end, our board authorized a $5 billion repurchase program. And we’ll fund this with a combination of existing cash on the balance sheet, the after tax proceeds from the terminations free, as well as cash flow from operations with the balance from debt. We’ve executed it before the end of the year, we’ll see our leverage at the end of 2018 be about 1.5 times. As a specifics of the new debt in our complete third quarter interest expenses and estimate, please note that any purchase of quantities of stock above approximately 10 million shares will be subject to a deem dividend payable by the company of about 11%. So I’d like now to turn back to the operator for your questions. I think Jeff you mentioned we’re going to have an extended Q&A session.
Jeff Palmer: That’s correct. We get everyone to Q&A today. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question from William Stein with SunTrust. Your line is open.
William Stein: Great. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Nice to engage with you all again. Two questions if I can. First, I am wondering if we can get a further discussion of capital allocation beyond a buyback. In the past you’ve discussed when you were still pre- Qualcomm discussion, there was a sense that you’d start a dividend when you got to the right leverage level I think and there’s also discussion of incremental M&A. Can you update us on that aspect?
Rick Clemmer: Yeah. Sure. On the dividend, we’re actively discussing, certainly we can afford it, our leverage of the end of the year would only be – if we do execute the whole buyback before the end of the year will only to be 1.5 and at the end of next year we will be back to below one. So we’re in discussions with our board and I guess we’ll update you on the Analyst Day so what we’ve decided.
William Stein: Thanks.
Rick Clemmer: There on the dividend. In terms of incremental M&A…
Peter Kelly: Well, I think the bottom line is with the, what we consider to be quite unfair process that we just went through with China. I don’t think you’ll see us trying to do any big merger or equal kind of transactions like what we did with Freescale. I mean clearly the regulatory process has proven to be quite a challenge and I think that’s not something that we perceive as being a priority now in creating value. So clearly small acquisitions that provide some unique product technology or allow us to provide a more complete solution to our customers are within reason but I don’t think that you will see us trying to do any huge transactions like merger of equals.
William Stein: I appreciate that. Thanks for that update. And then one more if I can. The 5% to 7% growth is the more or less the same target that you had prior to the Qualcomm transaction. It looks relative to somewhat weaker SI&I and SIS security markets. I’m wondering if we should read that 5% to 7% to suggest that those two markets will stage a recovery or should we read it as those will be the relatively weaker ones and we should see more outsized growth for example in automotive and the MCU part of Secure Connected Devices? Thank you.
Rick Clemmer: Absolutely. We will definitely. Our plan of the growth rate is balanced with stronger growth in automotive than what we would have had a couple 2.5 years ago with through this as well as in micros. Our portfolio continues to drive a lot of growth in those areas, so the continued weakness in SIS which is a relatively small portion of our total business at this point and certainly we’re working through some of the issues at RF power and digital network business. So I think when you look at it on the growth rate even though it’s the same number, it’s a much more rich fuller growth rate that plays to our strength than what we would have had two and half, three years ago when we set those targets before.
Peter Kelly: The way I figure out Will is versus where we were two years ago. And coming to that it is a similar numbers. There's all of all of our businesses are doing well except for as Rick mentioned, and we started to talk about that. RF tends to be – it's a relatively small business for but tends to be cyclical. So that...
Rick Clemmer: Very profitable. SIS is probably bottomed down, we definitely went through some issues in '16 and '17. So it's certainly different links than we had two years ago. But the thing is that we were really investing you know most of the core of our companies are actually doing from our perspective very well.
William Stein: Great, thanks. I'll leave the floor.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Vivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question and good to talk with you guys again. Rick for my first one, your OpEx was up 8% to 9% in the first half year-on-year. Are there areas in NXP where estimates were perhaps paused and need to be restarted now that you have to go you know on your own or asked in a different way, when do you think you can get to your target model for growth and operating margins?
Rick Clemmer: Yeah, I think those are going to diametrically opposed. I think the growth rate that you are talking about I don't think anything was paused. We were focused on the opportunities and as you saw in our R&D, we've actually invested in some areas where we thought it was critical to invest in that technology to do to continue to drive our leadership with the expanded opportunities we saw. And there's a lot of factors that come into account associated with currency as well as customer funding and grants et cetera. But the bottom line is there's not anything that we need to re-accelerate, we have been making a good level of investment. I think one of the things that we will consider on CapEx is perhaps strengthening that a little bit for the next couple of years to be sure that we can drive our cost reduction opportunities expanding some of our internal capacity and perhaps using a little bit of a break-up to really reinvest in the cost savings for the company. But on the OpEx side I think we do not have to reignite anything, in fact we're making those investments for the future to continue to drive our strength.
Vivek Arya: Alright. And then for my follow-up, just in terms of clarification, are you assuming ZTE gets back in from Q3 onwards? And on the buyback, Peter is there a timeframe in which you plan to complete them? Thank you.
Peter Kelly: So let me do the part. ZTE has started again. So that would be in Q3 and hopefully continue as a normal company going forward. As regards to the buyback, I think you know from our kind of historical activity, we don't announce buybacks and don't them. But we look at the markets on daily basis and to the extent that you know the opportunities that will go out and we would expect to complete the other buyback you know in a timely fashion.
Vivek Arya: Thanks and good luck.
Rick Clemmer: It was an interesting, you know it's pretty interesting because it is clearly important for us from a revenue viewpoint, it was considered to be one of the factors in the discussions with the Chinese relative to the regulatory approval process. And so it's quite surprising that the Chinese made the decision they did not to actually approve the transaction given that ZTE was brought back to life by the U.S. Administration in Congress.
Vivek Arya: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.
Stacy Rasgon: Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Nice to speak with you again. My first question is on gross margin leverage. So it's obviously stopped a little bit and I get to play that was a function of mixes like some of the higher margin businesses kind of had a bit of a headwind. But I am also surprising that you really going forward is revenue is growing and Secure Interfaces Business is growing so much that's where we're still not seeing any gross margin leverage, so what's going on there? I guess what do you need to do to get the margins back up because you're running below your model? And I guess structurally how do we think about the drivers of gross margin going forward? When do you think you get back into kind of more than normalized range of your target model?
Peter Kelly: When you say more than a normalized range…
Stacy Rasgon: What’s the ranges like 54 to 57 whatever it was and so you are running 53 and next 40 you got Secure Interface was up 20% which is some of the really high margin stuff and yet got gross margins kind of flattish to down and revenues going up. So I don't quite understand, is there something wrong with utilization because if you know you your inventories are high or what?
Peter Kelly: First of all we look at the targets on a on an annual basis, we're not going to obsess over the current quarter. And there is all sort of things on and any single quarter that move the gross margin around. Having said that our gross margin right now is not where we'd like it to be and it needs to improve. Probably the biggest single thing that's hitting this year is there's about 80 basis points of kind of pricing increases.
Rick Clemmer: You've had a bunch of people say role length has gone up, frights gone up, but that's certainly causes headwind. We would expect to quickly get into a range. And you know clearly depends on the mix of products and a whole bunch of other things. But I don't like the current quarter, I think we need to do better, but there's nothing structurally no.
Stacy Rasgon: Got it. Thank you. That's helpful. For my follow-up, I guess to that point you talked about some of the cost increases and you've talked about revenue missing you know obviously because capacity is tight and microcontroller. So can you give us a view of how much revenue you're actually missing because of those long lead times and tight capacity when you see those supply constraints even? And I guess just not only the housekeeping question, tax rates for this year and next year, are they still the same as what you gave on your prior model?
Peter Kelly: So let me do tax, so tax we are using cash taxes quarter-by-quarter and we've given you that. We've previously said 2019 would be 12% and I think that's a good one. The impact of tightness in capacity it's a few tens of millions of dollars a quarter. I don't think it's huge.
Rick Clemmer: Yeah, and I guess you know Stacy, when you look at it you know our kinetics family up until maybe a month ago, we were at 26 weekly lead time which is clearly not where we want to be. And when you have those design wins, you have to work with customers to be sure you don't take them lying down even with those extended lead time. So as we get our manufacturing capacity back in time, back in line it should allow us to be in a position where we can drive growth faster than what we've been able to achieve with the capacity limitations. And we'll see that as we approach the end of the year some of that begin to come on line. And you know clearly the thing that we're excited about is the design wins we have and the ability to drive that and we've been able to keep customers where they haven't gone lying down even though we've had limitations and extremely unacceptable long lead times based on what we have to lay out. We've actually reduced those slightly in the last few weeks and we think we'll continue to get those under more of a reasonable basis going forward.
Stacy Rasgon: That it's likely would still be more than 20 weeks so probably?
Peter Kelly: You know Stacy, it's hard to say, we're bringing the past as quickly as we can. And I think over a period of time certainly 20 weeks is not even reasonable lead times associated with micros. So we would anticipate and hope that we'll get down into more of a reasonable range that you know kind of in the teens as opposed to even 20 as we getting into early next year.
Stacy Rasgon: Got it. Thank you, guys.
Peter Kelly: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.
Craig Hettenbach: Yes, thanks. First question just on the inventories been remarkably consistent at 2.3, 2.4 months, so just anything particularly because things are pretty tight now in the channel, anything you are doing differently versus price cycles just to manage the inventories for distribution?
Peter Kelly: I'd say the biggest you know three years ago, we had a problem in one quarter which shook us up pretty badly. And at that time we completely revamped our control systems. But if you like our ability to look into what this have and what shipping out, what's on the shelves. And we just continue to do that manage it really tightly, but we do manage it to that number Craig, it's not coincidence, we make sure it doesn’t go plus or minus about 2.4 months.
Rick Clemmer: The truth is, this is always a tug of war with a big dusty houses, they are focus on their turns and nerds and want to be sure they have less inventory and we’d like to be sure we actually have a little more inventory in the channel to be able to support our customer base and drive the growth that we’re trying to achieve. So that’s always a little bit of arm wrestle to see where it is. We’re still in that range of 2.4 during the quarter, it may go slightly below that but we’re at that range. And frankly I’d prefer it to be more closer to 2.5 than the 2.4.
Steve Owen: Yeah. I’m Steve, I am Head of Sales. They work substantially on the mix of products that’s actually on the shelves. So one of the challenges is how good is the inventory and I think our inventory in this distribution now is as good as it’s ever been in terms of the quality of the product.
Craig Hettenbach: I appreciate the call there. And then just a follow-up for Rick, just has been some time. Can you update us on the progress around kind of radar and ADAS, any kind of anecdotes from a design perspective or how things are playing out for you in that market?
Rick Clemmer: Absolutely. So we have the strongest portfolio in radar products and working broadly with all of the major car customers. And so their exceptions of our technology has been really overwhelming and we’re very pleased with that. The ramping the capacity to be able to support the requirement has been more of a challenge in the design win side. But with the portfolio we have and the ability to bring total solutions together, we continue to grow and get strength in driving more of a complete solution with our automotive customers. And clearly our radar success has been a contributing factor to that. But as we look at safer driving and autonomous driving, radar is only one factor associated with it. Also our vehicle to vehicle communications platform, our entire microcontroller family supporting that as well as the security to be able to drive safer solutions is really some of the key technology that we’re talk more about in our Analyst Day that we think will really allow us to continue to drive growth well above the marketplace.
Craig Hettenbach: Got it. Thank you.
Rick Clemmer: Thanks Craig.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel.
Tore Svanberg: Yes. Hi, thank you. First question I know there’s a bit longer term, but I think the appealing part about the Qualcomm NXP merger was really the positioning in automotive. How should we think about NXP’s long term strategy in automotive? And I’m thinking more in terms obviously NXP has a lot of mix in expertise, Qualcomm probably also more on the digital processing side, so just strategically how should we think about NXP going forward in automotive especially more on the digital side things?
Rick Clemmer: So when you think about automotive and especially moving to autonomous driving, the center fusion you know we will not have that high performance processing capability that we would have had with the combination with Qualcomm. So clearly that something that we have to figure out how we work with our customers and those companies to really be able to partner to provide solutions to be able to fill it. But when you really think about the after the learning process takes place with artificial intelligence, it’s really more about the microcontrollers and the capability to drive that on a consistent basis at an affordable basis for a broader array of cars, is really what drives the improved safety. And frankly, NXP is extremely well positioned to take advantage of that and provide solutions that will really get continue to drive strong growth. So I think we’re in a very solid position. The interesting thing that we’ve really made some progress over the last couple of years on the analog side is we think our portfolio is even more well through the towards the electric vehicle portion of the automotive market that what we bought in 2.5 years ago. So we think that our portfolio will talk more about that in the Analyst Day, will serve roughly 40% of the TAM associated with electric vehicles and really process in a great position. But we’ll continue to see the safer driving moving towards autonomous driving or NXP will be a key leader in driving that technology to facilitate saver driving across the industry.
Tore Svanberg: It’s very helpful. And just as a housekeeping for Peter. Peter, what’s your use for CapEx both for calendar ’18 and calendar ’19 please?
Peter Kelly: We would – I’m just trying to think in the best way to describe this. Normally in the past we’ve talked about 5% CapEx. I think we run in years to take about 6.5. And as Rick mentioned before, probably in and I’m saying this on the fly, in 2019 and 2020, we might let it go up to as high as 7 and we can see a very significant gross margin return given we got the funding of the breakup fee. So we reinvest some of the breakup fee back in the gross margin. So I’d say your model maybe use 7% next year and the year after, this year I think it’s about I think it’s going to be about 6.5 right of the check exactly.
Tore Svanberg: That’s helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer: Good morning, guys and welcome back. Thanks for taking my question. Peter, I think you are kind enough to tell us what the ZTE impact was to the June quarter. Does the September quarter guide embed all that revenue coming back or is that going to take a couple quarters to come back?
Peter Kelly: I’m not sure it’s exactly $31 million that comes back, but the most – we would expect most of it’s a comeback in Q3. But we do think we’ve lost at least a quarter of our revenue in the year. It’s not like let’s say for example we were literally $30 million a quarter. It’s not like Q3 would be $60 million, this is the $30 million seems to disappear into that.
Rick Clemmer: Yeah and we probably wanting to be completely back it at full run rate John in Q3 but we’re getting close and working to do that and working with the new management team at ZTE to be in a position to support them as they really look at how they go addresses this in the market place.
John Pitzer: That’s helpful. And then just turning to the auto business which is kind of the one of the core businesses that you have. Year-over-year growth was about 7.5% which is still really solid but it is below kind of some of your comps are peers out there. I’m just kind of wondering where you – do you think you’re more disproportionately hurt by these discrete shortages? Is there something going on within your exposure? Is this key fobs that they’re under growing? Or help me understand kind of your growth rate relative to peers and how you’re looking at that?
Rick Clemmer: John, our growth rate across the board with still very strong in automotive. The one area that we had a little headwind in the quarter was in auto microcontrollers for some of that is the lack of some of discrete reduce the pool by our customers. I mean it was a little bit surprising because they really didn’t give us as much indication of that early in the quarter. And as you know we have just in time warehouses and all those key customers. But if they went through the pull process towards the end of the quarter, it was a lower levels than what we would have anticipated based on some of their inability to have sufficient discrete products in place. But the rest of the portfolio continues to perform very well and we continue to be very excited about the growth of our automotive business going forward and probably at a higher rate than we were thinking about three years ago.
John Pitzer: That’s helpful. And I am thinking cyclicality Peter, as success, I think you talked about it on the – in the press release an impact on the balance sheet. I just wonder I get a better understanding, are you fully through that transition, what was the impact to revenue and I guess the reason why I asked, I just want to make sure as we look at year-over-year growth rates that we’re sort of counting apples-to-apples?
Peter Kelly: Yeah. My favorite topic, I just think that I can have a mind to run for a second I think it’s one of the most for us one of the most ridiculous things even implementing just like crazy amount of work for not much news. I think this is, in Q2 have an impact of $4 million and from memory I think is a $4 million benefit. But I mean it’s noise level, John.
John Pitzer: Helpful. Thanks, guys.
Peter Kelly: Thanks, John.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore.
C.J. Muse: Hey, good morning. Thank you for taking my question and good to hear and all your voices again. First question on an LTM basis you guys generated 19% free cash flow margin, curious as you start getting closer to your target model, what kind of percentage are you thinking there?
Peter Kelly: That’s about think about that really. Really trying to get a fill numbers you guys asked. But I think it is approximates in the end our EBIT margins. But maybe just give me time to think about that but I think the EBIT margin a very good proxy.
C.J. Muse: Okay. That’s helpful. And then I guess a question on the buyback, you talked about completing in a timely fashion. How should we think about annual share grants as a partial offset each year?
Peter Kelly: What we’ve not only been, we’ve been granting less than well less than 1%. So I think that’s – on a regular basis, I think that’s the way I’d look at all our share grants. On normal annual grants would be – certainly at the moment we kind of looking at some things of what we should do in terms of how do retrain our employees should we provide them with some of additional handcuffs to keep them in the company. I think our normal grant is would be what we go forward with generally.
Rick Clemmer: Actually, I really need going into handcuffs you know we want to keep our employees in survive and I do think that as we go through a reset in a reboot, we’ll see a little bit of additional equity probably as our board gets through that and will you give some more specifics when you get through the Analyst Day here in September.
C.J. Muse: Excellent. If I could speak one last one. And you talked about some of the other segments. Could you speak to your thought process on the growth trajectory for SCD over the next 4 to 6 quarters puts and takes for that line item and what we should kind of be aware of given we haven’t spoken to you for so long? Thank you.
Peter Kelly: So on the three year bases we feel very good about this SCD. I think we the – the lion share of that business is really on the micro side and our growth there is extremely good and it’s actually been limited by capacity that we could bring online. So our customer perspective and perception which is on the micros which is I don’t know 60% or so of SCD, we see extremely strong growth and continuing to be in a solid position. And I think that’s going to continue for the next few years. In Secure Connected Devices, we continue to be in a very strong position there. We have a large OEM in India, that’s ramping, it’s clearly a factor in the near term associated with it. But we continue to be in a very strong position on the mobile wallet basis and continue to move toward very positively.
Peter Kelly: And I think C.J. will provide for you guys kind of individual operating segment growth targets at the Analyst Day. But I think there to support Rick’s comments, this has been one of the real bright spots of the business, the micros and microcontroller business has been very strong and the mobile transactions has been very strong as well.
Rick Clemmer: And if we look at it over the three year basis, the ability to really take that business in drive the processing to the edge as well as the security to be able to provide to ensure that there is not hacking as we go to the world of the Internet of Things, this is really a key area for us and one we think we will contribute significantly to the growth and we’re well positioned with the product portfolio basis to really support customers and solutions and really be able to facilitate realizing the pull value of the cloud and the capability that it offers to all of the users.
C.J. Muse: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.
Toshiya Hari: Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. I wanted to follow-up on your market share in automotive semis broadly. According to guys like Gartner, I think you guys lost a little bit of share in 2017 given what you delivered so far in 2018. I think you might look – you might lose some this year as well. Rick, just given what you’re seeing from a design perspective today at one point should we expect your positioning to improve and revert to the upside?
Rick Clemmer: You our position is very good and very solid. I think as we’ve seen e-vehicles begin to grow contribute to the overall automotive growth. And our portfolio on analog which is well positioned to specifically drive growth in that area particularly in China where we see a lot of e-vehicle growth. I think we’ll see that the growth of those some of those design wins that we’ve been able to achieve over the last few quarters in years, I really begin to kick in associated with it. But I think if anything when you look at it on a customer facing basis in position our share is gaining and we continue to have design wins growing at a much more rapid right than our overall revenues which but in a great position. The automotive business is one where you win designs two to four years before you actually begin to ship. So by look at the design wins, we continue to gain market share and we well positioned for growth going forward.
Toshiya Hari: Okay. Great. And Rick, historically you’ve been very disciplined from a portfolio management perspective and you’ve you shared your views on things like relative market share. Are there any businesses or product groups within NXPI today that you would consider deemphasizing or potentially selling or are you pretty comfortable with what you have today? Thank you.
Rick Clemmer: Well after the two year pause at our portfolio, I think there’s always businesses that you want to step up investments in and try to acquire some technology and businesses that don’t – that are critical or strategic to the portfolio going forward. So I would always say that the case for us and we clearly went through a couple year pause as we went through waiting for the integration associated with Qualcomm. So I do think that there are some things they will think about. It would be premature for us to discuss those. But I think we’ll continue to be in the basis of driving the best portfolio going forward that we can and do support the market opportunities that we perceive a strategic and how we can be best positioned to drive solutions for customers in those areas. Operator?
Toshiya Hari: Thank you.
Rick Clemmer: Thanks, Toshiya.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is from Rajvindra Gill with Needham & Company.
Rajvindra Gill: Yes, thanks. I appreciate it. Just a follow-up again on the auto, anymore color there would be helpful. The growth rate if we take the average year-over-year growth rate in 2017, I believe it was around 11% and it has decelerated to 7% and as you said a lot of that is due to shortages of the discrete components. Wondering if you give us kind of what the specific dynamics that were going on with the shortages? Why did that happen? When you think you can get resolved? Is that affecting other competitors in your view, any clarity there would be helpful?
Rick Clemmer: I think it’s affecting all the competitors in automotive micros. So I don’t anticipate that we are unusual at all. But we clearly are one of the leaders in that space. So as they have discrete shortages that impact their overall basis, it has more of an impact on us because of our position in auto micros. The resolution of that I can’t really address that I think we don’t see that as being an area that’s going to be a prolonged basis. We think the auto companies are going to get back to more of a normalized basis on micros as we move forward.
Peter Kelly: I think we have to be careful about parsing the numbers really. I mean if I look at trailing 12 months Q2, auto grew 10%. If I look at trailing 12 months Q3 at the midpoint it’s probably about of 8.5, 9. If I look at years-to-date, it’s probably about 8.5%. I’ve – you know auto is running 8%-9% especially when to $4 billion business a year is pretty, pretty cool.
Rick Clemmer: And if we look at over the next few years, I think we’re going to see nothing but maybe increased growth associated with based on the designed wins being able to achieve.
Rick Clemmer: So I think we’re in great position in automotive. And you really can’t look at in on quarter-by-quarter as Peter just said you get a look at in a little bit of an annual basis to really reflect what’s going on in the automotive market per se.
Rajvindra Gill: Yeah. That’s helpful. And for my follow-up, significant amount of growth in general purpose microcontrollers, can you maybe drill a bit deeper in terms of what’s driving that. With Freescale you became a one of the largest microcontroller suppliers in the world or the second largest market controlled supplier in the world. Are you seeing the significant demand from IoT devices, IoT now as a market has developed over the last couple of years, can you maybe talk about that as well? Thank you.
Rick Clemmer: I think we are seeing it broad base. So I think we’re in a leadership position. I think that our portfolio plays well. I think when you really look at it in the marketplace, we have the strongest portfolio, the ability to go from the core micros to higher in micros to apps processors and some products that we just announce the kind of crossover between micros and apps processor. There really but it’s in the unique position to drive solution for customers that they really don’t have the opportunity to have that kind of breath of portfolio. And then we can even go to the high end associated with our network processors. So I think the portfolio of processing capability that we have really plays well in the overall market, well it’s not the center fusion capability as a real high end, I think when you look at the applications that drive the high volumes and the capability, we’re really well positioned to take advantage of that. And our portfolio plays extremely well and the team there they are doing a great job of positioning that business to move forward and continue to win market share.
Rajvindra Gill: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Matt Ramsey with Cowen.
Matt Ramsey: Thank you very much. Rick and I wanted to ask a little bit of a strategic question and I sort of echo your sentiments that I assume that the powers that didn’t let the transaction with Qualcomm go through, but given the amount of I guess cross company diligence both of you guys have done against each other’s businesses during this period of time, is there an opportunity you think for your company and for Qualcomm to work together in partnership around some solutions for customers that might be sort of accretive to the long term business and how should we think about that potential if there is any? Thank you.
Rick Clemmer: Yeah. I think that think there clearly is some potential like in NFC where we actually have been working with Qualcomm for the last few years associated with it. I think you have to give us a little bit of time to get through the overhang. I think we and Qualcomm were both working diligently through midnight last night to be able to close the transaction. So I think you have to give us a little time to think about if there’s really any opportunity for us to work together going forward. I wouldn’t rule it out. I think that as we think about the high end processing associated with the automotive market, we clearly are going to have to look at some partnerships to be able to drive a more complete solution for our customers, since we don’t have the capability if you combine with Qualcomm. But I think it’s premature to really talk about that specifically. I think we’re really excited about the growth opportunities we have. We would have loved to have had that leadership connectivity combined with our leadership processing and security that would have been combined into what I believe to be the industry power out, but since the regulators didn’t that take place. We think we’re well positioned in really can drive significantly above market growth and continue to create significant shareholder value going forward.
Matt Ramsey: Thank you for that. Yeah I realize things are happening quick here and things just happened to midnight last night officially, so I appreciate the color. Just as a follow-up, shifting gears a little bit to the sort of IoT, MCU business, how you guys been investing in different air interface technology in the IoT and the like, obviously Qualcomm had a portfolio a big one there that you might have relied on if the merger had taken place and just wondering an update on to how the investment levels have been in the peripheral communications technologies around the IoT business? Thank you.
Rick Clemmer: Yeah. No that’s great question. I think when you look at the IoT business and really moving to the edge, we’re really getting well positioned with the cloud providers and really providing a unique capability associated with it. To be fair, we have actually put a pause on some of our Wi-Fi development capabilities with the planning for the merger with Qualcomm. So we’re back considering those and how we get in a position to really have the connectivity platforms to be able to drive complete solutions for our customers. And we have some technology in our network processing area in the Wi-Fi space. Clearly we’re going to look at how we can position and drive to a broader array of customers through the industrial space. But we’re getting really positive feedback from the big cloud guys about the unique capability we have to really protect the edge and facilitate take the smart edge processing and then be able to move those transactions to the cloud to be able to facilitate that which is when you really build IoT, one of the critical factors to be able to drive that in fact it was a couple a month or six weeks ago maybe they came out with companies with machine learning and artificial intelligence and frankly we were the fourth one mentioned in the semiconductor space which surprised me a little bit as we went through it but then when we peel the onion and understood what they were taking into account relative to our edge processing capability and working with the cloud providers really confirmed the architecture in the opportunity space that we’ve been focused on and where we see some significant growth, but this year, but out over the next few years and where we think we’re well positioned with our technology to really provide a leadership capability.
Matt Ramsey: Thanks very much.
Rick Clemmer: Thanks, Matt.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Romit Shah with Nomura.
Romit Shah: Yes. Thank you. Rick I guess just listening to the conference call, my general takeaway is that after two year pause NXPI basically just needs to reinvest in the portfolio and manufacturing in order to really grow the business, but that sort of puts you at odd with the profitability targets and so we should just be conservative in our assumptions around when you get to your target miles. Do you think that’s a fair way to look at it?
Peter Kelly: No. I think what’s happened is over the last two years, we’ve been continuing to run full out our core businesses and the areas we’re really excited to continue to do well. Yeah, our gross margin is little bit below where we want to be at the moment that would happen whatever happened. The manufacturing capability we have is it’s a really good capability, but we see some let’s say you marginal investments to make. We’re not talking about building new fabs or anything like that it’s all about marginal increases to capacity that could drive an outsized return to was in terms of profitability. I guess I’m not going to get into when are we going to hit the midpoint of the range. I think you’ll find the Analyst Day very, very helpful. But we’ll be pushing very, very hard to move forward as quickly as we can. And I think Rick mentioned earlier on that if any think over the last two years, the only thing that’s been a little bit of a challenge for us is at the margin, you have a slightly different view of the portfolio when you’re going to be part of this huge terminal to powerhouse company than you do as a pretty sizable $10 billion company. But I certainly would not characterize things has been poor or weak, I think we’ve been running full out and things only going to get better.
Rick Clemmer: You know I guess – we talk about manufacturing capacity and really investing in internal capacity to drive our gross margins, one other things that’s even included in our CapEx now is we’re doing a significant expansion in our SSMC joint venture in Singapore where we have a joint venture with theism TSMC and we’re significantly increasing the capacity in that facility and that’s comprehended in the CapEx where we are. What we’re talking about is the potential to continue to expand that and be able to drive some of the unique solutions and unique profits and get the ability that we have to be able to meet our customer requirements. And taking a little bit of our breakup fee driving that investment to really ensure expansion of our gross margins and ability to drive. That’s a key priority for us and one that we think a good return for our shareholders.
Peter Kelly: Yeah, 1% additional CapEx is for $100 million.
Romit Shah: Peter though just one thing that stands out from the numbers in the OpEx. OpEx is up high single digits on basically similar revenues from a year ago. How do we think about the outlook for OpEx and specifically R&D which it’s been several quarters that’s running at about $350 million plus or minus and now it’s creeping closer to $400 million, do you do you expect does R&D start to come down or do you sort of maintain these levels and generate leverage by growing the top line?
Peter Kelly: I things it’s two things, we’re up about $350 million, we’re up about $50 million year-on-year, half of that is currency and half of that is in kind of investment. You can get – again you can get a bit of hung up on the quarters, but if you look at it on an annual basis, what you say is true, our R&D has crept up and it’s really reflects that kind of how we were viewing the portfolio was being part of Qualcomm. But we intend to absolutely get back to within a range and stay within that strategic range and we’ve think we can drive quite a lot of value by doing that. And some years will be close of the top of the range and other years will be maybe more closer to the bottom of the range.
Rick Clemmer: Yeah, I guess it’s we should not let your statement go without at least responding to that you said on flat revenues. Actually the revenue in HPMS is up 5% year-over-year. So our R&D has grown a little faster than revenue with some of the strategic investments we’re making. It’s not like all of that OpEx is based on product revenue. We are up 5% and if we look out in the future we think we’ll continue to outgrow the market. So I don’t – we’ll go through it in the September Analyst Day a lot more detail on our target models and where we are, but we’re not backing off our total target relative to R&D. But we are making the strategic investments to be able to ensure that we solidify the stronger growth going forward in the near term.
Romit Shah: All right. Thanks for the color. Appreciate it.
Peter Kelly: Thanks, Romit.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho.
Vijay Rakesh: Hi, guys. You guys are look like phoenix you are back. Just a couple of questions…
Rick Clemmer: Hopefully we are not raising from the ashes.
Vijay Rakesh: That’s right. On the automotive side, as you talked about some sort of fusion, just wondering are you guys looking at LiDAR also, do you already have in your portfolio, how do you see that building that out?
Rick Clemmer: Yeah. When you think about LiDAR, we are the processing capability for a number of the LiDAR solutions that are in the marketplace. So we play a significant role in providing them the specific LiDAR technology. When you think about safer driving, it’s not about any individual solution, you need to really have a complete solution that includes radar, includes LiDAR potentially depending on how advance LiDAR gets. All have – so has include vision and all of those will provide that we don’t have the sensor capability far built in, we’re making the investments because of the size of those in the uncertainty and some of those technologies will provide the processing capability to be able to facilitate that. And when you look at the solution to really be able to drive safer driving, we provide the backbone for the bulk of that and ability to really be a significant participant in driving those solutions as we go forward.
Vijay Rakesh: Got it. And just on the automotive side, I think you guys mentioned EV, just wondering how much content do you have on the EV side? And also SII has been lumpy, but as you go to 5G what’s the step up in content do you get in 5G versus 4G? Thanks.
Rick Clemmer: So you – I got distracted as you talk about SI&I. Could you just repeat the question just before that again, because I was focused on that to sort time on that 5G, sorry.
Vijay Rakesh: Yeah. Sure. I was also asking on the EV side, electric vehicle side, just wondering if you had content there.
Rick Clemmer: Yeah. So I guess over the last couple of years, we spent a lot of time really looking at the opportunities that we saw in EV. We – if you look at our analog portfolio, we have really a very strong position. We think that we’ll address about 40% of electric vehicle total tamers are served market. And so I think we’re in a really strong position to be able to expand that. That’s much broader much higher percentage than we’re planning on 2.5 to 3 years ago as we talked about that. And specifically, as you look at the growth in e-vehicle, electric vehicles in China, I think we’re really in a good position to be able to support that in and take advantage of that marketplace growth. On the SI&I, 5G, we’re not in the best position to talk about the 5G rollout. I do think that when we look at our portfolio and some of the massive MIMO capability that we have the MIMO it’s kind of an interim step as you’re moving to 5G. We have some solutions that will be a contributing factor to growth. The question is when that will be deployed, whether it’s months or quarters and just how much overall impact it will have, but I think it will be a contributing factor to be able to drive the growth going forward.
Vijay Rakesh: Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Harlan Sur with J.P. Morgan.
Harlan Sur: Good morning and great to hear from the team. Just the follow-up on the 5G question, you guys obviously have a great position with RF power portfolio. How does digital networking portfolio stuck up there as the industry moves to 5G, it’s still a pretty big part of the mix. Is this segment more sort of in cash kind of harvest mode or does the team have some suction here for the 5G interface transition?
Rick Clemmer: So, I think if you look at the DN, DN is we have seeing a pretty significant shift except it especially in the network processing areas. A lot of those customers have moved their fundamental processing capability internally. We still are driving multi-core arm solutions with some limited portion of the portfolio for those customers, but it’s not in the broad base that it was five or six years ago. So that’s one of the reasons that we’re spending quite a bit of time looking our network processing area in DN. And frankly looking at the capability, we are seeing some significant opportunities in automotive for basically taking a network architecture and applying that to the car and some of the technology we have there are really positions to this well to be able to provide a leadership technology in providing that communications hub if you will in the car which is a real opportunity to use our fundamental technology. On 5G per se on the DN, I don’t think that it’s really going to be a significant factor in driving huge growth parts, but we will be a participant. We do have technology that allows us some software upgrades in the network processor that really opens the market opportunities for us but we have to prove the size of those and what is significant – and how significant that will be in our growth in that specific area before.
Harlan Sur: Thanks for the insights there Rick. And then macro dimensions appear quite healthy I mean industrial trends especially industrial production appears to be quite strong, consumer demand appears fairly healthy. Can you guys just talk about the breath of the demand geographically, I know you track ship to trends, but I think even that would be helpful, just trying to get a sense of how diversified the demand profile is?
Rick Clemmer: The demand is broad based industrial across the board. China represents half of our shipments are going to China and the continued strength in China continues to be very solid. But the broad base of our product applications really covers all the areas from consumer goods to through to industrial applications associated with it. And we see strength in all of those areas in for example or micro area where double-digit growth has been very consistent probably would have been even stronger if we would have the manufacturing capacity in place to able to prove it.
Harlan Sur: Thanks, Rick.
Rick Clemmer: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question is from Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.
Mark Lipacis: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Rick, on the kinetics business just to go back that for a second. That really should be a growth engine for you and you’ve been in the last couple quarters of the supply challenges, you said you’re trying to bring some supply on like. Could you give us some more color on that, I’m trying to understand to what extent that’s in your control or are you’re kind of looking to your foundry suppliers to ramp up there or alleviate the pressure? Any color there would be helpful? Thanks.
Rick Clemmer: Yeah, it’s 90 nanometer special process proprietary process that we have outsourced to a foundry partner that has not been able to bring own capacity of the same right to our customer orders have come in. They’ve actually stepped up their capacity now where we think late this year going into early next year will be in a position to basically replenish our inventories that we’ve drained in that area. So it’s been a limiting factor to growth but we still had strong growth in micros even with that. And so our growth would have just been even stronger if we would have that manufacturing capacity with our foundry partner have been able to support all or customer demands. The design wins we have in that area and the capability to continue to drive that we build very positive about.
Mark Lipacis: Thank you. That’s helpful. And Peter a couple of housekeeping things. You mentioned –I think you mentioned your expected leverage ratio on, if you could repeat that and then the net cash you’re going to get after when you receive the breakup fees? Thank you.
Rick Clemmer: So, that will be subject to the full that’s tax rates are 25% so be about $1.5 billion after tax. We’ve already received the funds from Qualcomm, so they’ve wired that to us this morning. Leverage at the end of the year assuming we buy back the $4 billion, $5 billion to be 1.5 and will be back below one at the end of 2019 pretty easily.
Mark Lipacis: Thank you.
Rick Clemmer: Any follow-up, Mark?
Mark Lipacis: No. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And I’m not showing any further questions in the queue. Sorry, there is Dani Farber from Hudson Bay. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, it’s actually Aron [ph] from Hudson Bay. Thanks. Just two quickly follow-up to that most recent question. I believe your slides your references it two times leverage target and assume you talk about this morning at your Analyst Day we turn it side for but can you give us a sense when you think about end of 2019, one times levered with a longer term target is to how are you thinking about your cash structure, are able to incur more debt, would you do additional buybacks through 2019, how quickly do you want to get to the two times leverage? Thanks.
Peter Kelly: It depends upon the opportunities on. I think what it says is we have a really flexible balance sheet the depending on the circumstances, we could – first of all any excess cash, we will return to shareholders, so that we would be buybacks or dividend whatever. But it gives us a lot of flexibility for M&A should that prove to be a lot of opportunity given the comments Rick made before.
Unidentified Analyst: What do you think about minimum cash balances when you think about excess cash?
Peter Kelly: Billion dollars.
Unidentified Analyst: One billion?
Peter Kelly: 250 is of that billion is actually in SSMC, our joint venture with TSMC out there in Singapore. I think one billion.
Unidentified Analyst: Very good. Thanks. I will look forward to September.
Peter Kelly: Yeah. Great. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And this concludes our Q&A for today. I will turn the call back to Rick Clemmer for his final remarks.
Rick Clemmer: Thank you, operator. So thanks a lot for joining us today. It’s frankly good to be back. We look at the opportunities we’ve got going forward and we’re very excited about the opportunity to continue to outgrow the market and drive significant shareholder value. So we look forward to seeing you all on September 11 in New York City for our Analyst Day and be happy to go into more detail of that point time about the significant market opportunities and where our solutions really make a difference for customers and being able to drive growth. Thanks a lot.
Peter Kelly: Thank you, operator. Thank you everyone for joining the call today. Thank care.
Operator: Thank you everyone for participating in today’s conference. This concludes the program and you may now disconnect.

===== 2016 Q3  (2016-10-27 09:00:00) =====
Executives: Jeff Palmer - VP, IR Rick Clemmer - President and CEO Daniel Durn - CFO Peter Kelly - EVP, Strategy, M&A and Integration
Analysts: John Pitzer - Credit Suisse Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank William Stein - SunTrust Stacy Rasgon - Bernstein Research Tore Svanberg - Stifel Nicolaus
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Jeff Palmer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Jeff Palmer: Great thank you, Skyler, and good morning to everyone. Welcome to the NXP Semiconductors' third quarter 2016 earnings call. With me on the call today is Rick Clemmer, NXP's President and CEO, and Dan Durn, our CFO. If you've not obtained a copy of our third quarter 2016 earnings press release, it can be found at our Company Web site under the Investor Relations section at nxp.com. As most of you have likely see the Qualcomm and NXP press release this morning, and we appreciate your patience and waiting for our earnings call to begin. Our earnings call today we’ll keep to our prepared remarks to the key points so we can quickly get to your question. This call is being recorded and will be available for reply from our corporate Web site. Our call today will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause NXP's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. Please be reminded, NXP undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements. For a full disclosure on forward-looking statements, please refer to our press release. Additionally, during the call today, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. Pursuant to Regulation G, NXP has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our third quarter 2016 press release, which will be furnished to the SEC on Form 6-K and is available on the NXP Web site. I'd like to now turn the call over to Rick.
Rick Clemmer: Thanks, Jeff. And welcome everyone to our earnings call today. As Jeff mentioned, we're very excited about the transaction we announced this morning. In lieu of time, we want to provide a summary of our Q3 results and provide you with guidance for Q4. We will keep our comments brief, but we're prepared to address any questions you may have concerning the quarterly performance throughout the day. NXP finished Q3 with very good performance. Revenue was up just over 4% sequentially with all business lines delivering results in line with our guidance. We drove strong non-GAAP operating margins due to a combination of solid execution by the business and operations teams, which drove better than planned non-GAAP gross margin, when combined with strong operating expense control. Taken together, this resulted in very strong non-GAAP free cash flow. Looking at the specifics, revenue in Q3 was $2.47 billion, an increase of just over 4% versus the prior quarter, and up 62% versus the year ago period. Looking at the HPMS segment, revenue was $2.1 billion, an increase of just over 4% from the prior quarter and up 80% from Q3 2015. From an operating segment perspective, the results are as follows. Automotive, revenue was $853 million, down 1% quarter-on-quarter, but up 177% from the year ago period. In terms of product line trends, Auto MCU advanced Analog and Sensors were all slightly better than planned, with infotainment down modestly. In Secure Connected Devices, revenue was $592 million, up 15% sequentially and up 87% year-on-year. With our mobile transaction group, we experienced strong seasonal improvements as a result of both our largest smartphone customer, as well as good traction on new models with Korean and Chinese OEMs. Progress with deploying our mobile mass transit solution in China is going very well. Mobile transit or mass mobile payments, or mass transit is a perfect intersection of secure payments and high throughput mass transit; all delivered on a mobile device. And China’s six out of this ten initial largest cities are up and running with our mobile transit solutions, and eight OEMs have launched this solution. Initial activation rates are very good, and post activation top-offs are showing promising trend. In the MCU group, revenue was up sequentially as we saw very good demand for 32-bit ARM based MCUs and solid demand for our i.MX apps processors that was offset by roll-off of legacy MCUs. Lastly, we experienced solid demand in our mobile audio business as new products have gained solid tractions with Chinese Android handset OEMs. Within SI&I our Interface and Communications Infrastructure Group, revenue was $476 million, up 8% sequentially and up 76% year-on-year. In the Interface Group demand was strong and slightly ahead of plan due to the seasonal handset trends, similar to what we saw in the mobile transactions group. In the RF Power group, revenue declined sequentially as anticipated. At this stage, we believe the wireless base station markets will continue to be relatively soft over the intermediate term. Given the supply chain model in the base station market, we continue to have difficulties determining accurate in-market demand trend. In the Digital Networking market, we experienced flattish demand as anticipated, and believe the business has began to bottom-out. We are somewhat encouraged, as we are seeing composite trends in terms of design win, and particularly in the enterprise wireless access and switching space. Within SIS, revenue was $178 million, down 11% sequentially, and down 34% from year-ago. This was essentially in line with our inline our expectations at the beginning of the quarter. We do not see growth in this business in the near-term, as China banking continues to be weak and there is no incremental benefit to NXP from the U.S. contact EMD market based on the current market and competitive dynamics that we’ve mentioned in the past. At this point in time, the trends within the e-gabbing transit and access in- market with some improvements are not sufficient to offset the decline in the banking revenue. As our fourth quarter guidance reflects, we’re guiding for further stepdown in this business. We think over the intermediate term, revenue will hover around $150 million per quarter, although Q1s are typically seasonally weak, and our Q1 could be this time. Turning now to the Standard Products segment, revenue was $320 million, slightly better than our expectations, reflecting an increase to 6% from the prior quarter and down 2% from the year ago period. Turning to our distribution channel performance. The total months of inventory in the distribution channel held steady at 2.5, with absolute dollars of the inventory, increasing $45 million on a sequential basis. In summary, Q3 was a solid quarter with the strong financial performance, a positive reflection on the progress towards our committed goal. We view the overall stemming market as being next. In certain end market, like auto and SBD business trends are very encouraging. However, the market trends in the SIS, RF Power, digital networking, continued to create headwinds for the overall business. We believe we found a bottom in both SIS and digital networking, the two most challenged business in our portfolio. Now, I'd like to pass the call to Dan for a review of our financial performance. Dan?
Daniel Durn: Thanks, Rick, and good morning to everyone on today's call. To get your questions as quickly as possible, I’m going to read in an abbreviated version of my script today, hitting on what we believe are the key points. We will post the complete script on the IR Web site after the call. We delivered strong financial performance in Q3 with key highlights being: we delivered revenue that was above the midpoint of guidance; our strong operational execution drove non-GAAP gross margins above the plan; we tightly controlled our operating expenses, resulting in better fall-through and stronger non-GAAP operating margin; we generated excellent cash flow in the quarter and deployed over $0.5 billion in share repurchases; specifically, we delivered revenue of $2.47 billion in Q3, up 4% sequentially and the non-GAAP gross margin toward the high-end of our guidance at 50.5%. Total NXP non-GAAP operating margin in Q3 was at the high end of our guidance at 28%, which is up 240 basis-points sequentially, and up 470 basis-points in the last two quarters alone. This strong margin improvement demonstrates great progress in driving synergy capture well ahead of plan. As we have said in the past, the best way to measure our success in capturing merger synergies is to look at the progression of our non-GAAP operating margin. Since the merger closed, we have successfully driven 54 basis-points of non-GAAP operating margin expansion. On a $10 billion revenue run rate, this 540 basis-points of margin improvement, which suggests that we have already exceeded the $500 million synergy run-rate target within the first three quarters post close and more than a full-year ahead of the schedule communicated at the time we announced the merger. In terms of capital allocation, during the quarter, we repurchased 6.5 million shares at a cost of approximately $555 million or $86.3 per share. This brings our total year-to-date share repurchases to just over $1.2 billion, or 14.9 million shares at an average price of $81.62 per share. I would now like to provide our outlook for the fourth quarter. We currently anticipate Q4 revenue will be in the range of $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion. At the midpoint, we expect revenue to be about $2.44 billion in Q4. We expect the following trends in the business during that quarter. Auto is expected to be flat, which is well ahead of normal seasonality and much better than Q4 from the year ago period. Secure Connected Devices is expected to be down modestly in the low single-digit range. Secure Interface & Infrastructure is expected to be down modestly in the low single-digit range. Secure Identification Solutions is expected to be down in the mid-teens percentage range sequentially. Standard Products is expected to be flat sequentially. We anticipate revenue from manufacturing, corporate and other to be approximately $52 million. At the midpoint, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be 50.7% and non-GAAP operating margin to be 28.3%. Lastly, our Q4 guidance contemplates about $12 million of IP license revenue. It is unclear how the pending acquisition will impact our IP revenue pipeline going margin. And finally, I'd like to take a moment to discuss the status of the Standard Products divestiture. We've received all the regulatory approvals associated with the divestiture. The disentanglement process is going very well and we're on track to close the divesture in Q1 of 2017. From a financial model perspective, post the divestiture, NXP will drive top-line growth in the range of 5% to 7% CAGR over the 2016 to 2019 timeframe. Post divestiture, NXP will have a superior profit margin profile with our long-term non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 53% to 57%. We will tightly control our non-GAAP OpEx spend envelope into a range of 14% to 16% for R&D, and 6% to 8% for SG&A. Taken together, we anticipate our long-term non-GAAP operating margin to be in the range of 31% to 34% for NXP. From a timing perspective, as we discussed in our Analyst Day earlier this year, we believe we can enter the lower band of our long-term margin ranges exiting '17. This means total Company non-GAAP gross margin should be about 53%, and non-GAAP operating margin should be about 31% as we exit 2017. To be clear, this is an exit rate, not a full-year 2017 number. Our long-term margin progression guidance assumes we continue strong execution on synergy capture, and we minimize the impact to stranded costs from the divestiture throughout 2017. In terms of the use of proceeds, NXP will net $2.3 billion from the divestitures. We will use the proceeds to reduce our gross debt and achieve our 2-times net leverage target. We plan to redeem three tranches of debt. First, we will redeem the $390 million term loan due in 2017. Second, we will redeem the $500 million, 5.75% senior notes due in 2021. And lastly, we will pay-down approximately $1 billion of the term loans due in 2020. Post redemptions, gross debt will be approximately $7.5 billion with a weighted cost of debt at 3.6%, and an annual interest expense of approximately $275 million. Putting this together with the Q4 cash balance and adjusted EBITDA, that is consistent with Q3 where we saw net leverage of 2-time]. The ultimate amount of pay-down of the 2020 term loans may vary up or down depending on what is required to achieve the 2-times net leverage target. Lastly, we anticipate that our cash taxes in 2017 will be about $30 million to $35 million per quarter. With that, I would now like to turn the call back to the operator for your questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
John Pitzer: I just want to go back to the channel inventory. It looks like it was up sequentially in the September quarter. What do you think drove that? And as you looking cautiously your December quarter guidance. What would you expect channel inventory to look like exiting the December quarter?
Rick Clemmer: So to be clear John, it was up. I think it was $34 million. So it was up in terms of dollar level, but it was still at 2.5 months of inventory. So we’ve still continued to be around that level. To be clear, as we go forward, we’re not planning on it changing significantly, but we want to be opportunistic. There is a lot of interesting things developing in the channel market with one of our competitors and we want to be sure that we’re playing that opportunistically to have an impact from a top-line revenue growth basis.
John Pitzer: And then, Dan, I just want to make sure I understand some of the up margin, you’re taking t about exiting 2017. I guess, first, does that include or exclude the standard product divestiture I apologize if I missed that. And just given the announcement this morning, would there be opportunity to try to sum to accelerate some of the organic synergy gains at NXP ahead of the merger? Or how should we think about that?
Daniel Durn: So, John, a couple of things. First, the guidance we gave just provide clarity, post the divestiture, how the Company will profile. It’s very consistent with what we said at the Analyst Day, and very consistent with what was said at the time we announced the divestiture of Standard Products. Exiting the year, on a run-rate, we’ll be close the low-end of our margin guidelines. It will not be a full-year 2017 number. In terms of pre-close synergy capture opportunities, we have to absolutely clear on this. While we can plan for integration as a Company and strong execution post close is a function of really stay on granular detailed bottoms-up planning. It is just that planning. So there will be no change to the decisions we or Qualcomm made as independent company in the deal pendency period. And we will continue to execute against the plan we just communicated. Post close of the Qualcomm transaction. That is when you'll start to see decision makings reflecting the combination of the two entities, and economic impact associated with it.
Rick Clemmer: And maybe just one thing I'd like to point out, John. We talked about that our Q4 outlook includes $12 of intellectual property revenue. And there could be an impact from decision that we announced this morning associated with that. So, we want to be clear. That's included in our guidance, and we'll have to be sure that we fully understand that as we better understand the implications of the announcement today.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Ross Seymore: I guess, the first question is on the deal with Qualcomm. How in your perspective, either Dan or Rick, do you reconcile the earnings power that the Company described at Analyst Meeting earlier this year, with the price that Qualcomm is paying and you're accepting that price. Any framework in how you view valuation will be helpful?
Rick Clemmer: I think, Ross, it's really important to realize that the pre-rumour price, this represents 34% premium. So for a transaction of this size, it's a pretty sizeable premium. That being said, as we looked at the opportunity that we have on connected devices, we've been talking about this. Ultimately we needed to have a better connectivity portfolio to be able to drive the leadership that we wanted to be able to achieve. Specifically, and autonomous driving it, it's become more obvious to curtain over the last few quarters that we needed increased computing horsepower to be able to do machine learning, and really be able to take advantage of the complete ad hoc solution as opposed to the areas where we had clearly identified the leadership that can drive. So, we think that's very complementary. Although, we have good connectivity platform for our current portfolio as we look out over the next few years. We’ve clearly had to expand our connectivity capability to be in the leadership position we wanted to on the Internet of Things. And as we focus on secure connections for the smarter world. The combination of this brings together pretty nicely, our Board went through this and approved this based on their view associated with the price. I think the other thing that we shouldn't lose sight of is there's a lot of broker lap between the shareholders of both company. And there's clearly an opportunity for both shareholders that view the value creation opportunity as significant as we do for them to participate in that by actually buying Qualcomm shares.
Ross Seymore: And I guess as my follow-up. Dan and Rick, you could answer this too, if you wish. But you did a great job of running us through where the margin structure will be as we think about the next 12 months or so. From the revenue side of the equation, at that same Analyst Meeting earlier this year, you talked about 5% to 7% growth rate over-time. I realize that doesn't imply to any given single year. But how are you thinking about that as you look into 2017 as like automotive are doing better than people feared, and you're growing well on SBD. But area is like SIS and maybe the high power RF might be a little disappointed, or just disappointing versus what you might have expected in May?
Daniel Durn: My answer will probably leave you a little unsatisfied. The revenue CAGR we gave you is exactly that a CAGR over a three year widow. I think we have a portfolio of businesses. And like you point you and like Rick said in his comments, we’ve got some businesses that are performing really-really well. We've got some businesses that are performing in line. And then we’ve got a couple of businesses that are living in a difficult neighborhood right now. And so rather than getting to an extra size with guides, one year out, what we want to do is just stick to the three year CAGR. We understand than markets we participate in. You understand the core franchises we have, the leaderships positions we have, within those respective end markets and the performance profile of those businesses. And that should give me a pretty good idea of how profile next year. But we won’t get into the extra size of guiding the year out.
Rick Clemmer: I think the only thing that we could add is when you look at our outlook for Q4, the guidance that we set, that we talked about 2016 will be a transition for us. And Q4 not being down as you would typically be on a seasonal basis. It’s actually a little better than the environment. So, I think it actually portray an leading indicator relative to it. But as Dan said, we really only guiding. We’ve only established that on a three-years compounded growth rate, but it’s just not in the individual units period.
Operator: And next question comes from the line of William Stein from SunTrust. Your line is now open.
William Stein: Thanks for taking my question. And then I’ll add my congratulations to the deal this morning, I’ve two question if I can. First, Dan, you highlighted that the Company has already achieved its $500 million cost savings run-rate quite a bit earlier than expected. I wonder how much you see as left. Now that you’ve achieved that, do you think there is more to go as the Company progresses?
Daniel Durn: I think I will use the goal post. Where we’re today and where we will exit 2017. And at the time of the announcement, we’ve talked about this being synergy capture window. And I think with those goal post in place and the trajectory implied by those goal posts, I think that you can pretty quickly come up to what that is, rather than go out with a specific number, I think the goal post gets you where you need to be.
William Stein: And the next question is about the seasonally strong growth in autos for Q4, I think seasonally that’s a down quarter, but you’re guiding up. Should we use it’s, it’s uncertainly like a content growth opportunity. Is this the initial ramp of V2X, is that meaningful part of the separation? Or is there something else going on there? And any update on other V2X design winds in general would be much appreciated.
Rick Clemmer: Will, it’s broad based. So I think the key is it’s not V2X. V2X is not a significant revenue contributor in Q4 this year. There is some shipments taking place obviously on the design win that we’ve talked about. But as far as being a significant contributor into revenue, it’s not in V2X. It's pretty broad based, but really focused on MCUs, and beginning to ramp some of the design wins that had been achieved over the last few years as those begin to be realized and shipped into the customer.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your line is now open.
Stacy Rasgon: I want to go back to the deal-stop. I understand I think the need to achieve a better connectivity portfolio, to achieve your goals. But if that’s the case, why is selling for $110 to somebody else absolutely the best way to get that needed connectivity? I mean if I just look at the stocks right now, in the pre-market, Qualcomm is up something like 4% or more. You guys are up barely 2%, which suggested right now shareholders of Qualcomm are happier with the deal than shareholders of NXP. So, why is this the best way to get what you need in order to achieve your growth goal?
Rick Clemmer: So, Stacy I think it's -- obviously, any value is what you negotiate between two parties. And we can't lose sight of the fact that it was a 34% premium to the pre-disclosure, pre-rumour period. And when you think about a transaction of this magnitude, a 34% premium is at least as we've been advised pushing the limit associated with it. I think if we think about the future, the value of bringing the two companies together and bringing the most compelling platform in the industry going forward, it's just too significant of an opportunity to forgo. And so we think that we've gone through this with our Board and our Board feels like that this is a fair price, and a price that's reasonable for our shareholders. And our shareholders frankly have the ability that if they see the opportunity as you do or it sounds like you do and we do, they can participate by buying Qualcomm shares associated with it. So, we think it does represent a fair value. Clearly, being at the 34% premium to the pre-rumour price is a significant factor associated with it. And Peter Kelly -- Stacy, Peter has joined us too here.
Peter Kelly: Stacy, I just want to say I guess one thing. I mean, overall, I do thing this is a terrific deal. You're right in pointing out that Qualcomm shareholders are very pleased. As Rick said, the improvements in our stock price versus and unaffected price is very-very substantial. And I'm not at kind of cope or finance expert, but I think our stock will trade more on discounts to close than anything else in the coming months. But I do think this is a terrific deal.
Stacy Rasgon: And just to follow-up on that though. I mean, why wouldn't you guys be willing to -- put in the work over the next few years to achieve a higher stock price on your own. I mean this thing isn’t going to close for over a year anyways. What makes you think you couldn't get the stock price above a $110 on your own by the end of 2017? It seems like given the margin targets you talked about and the growth goals you talked at the Analyst Day, something that would be or should be achievable with more upside beyond that. So like why wouldn't you try to get it now rather than selling out at $110 today?
Rick Clemmer: So, Stacy I think the key is we're comfortable with the performance we've laid out. We're very comfortable with the portfolio we have. The opportunity to have a more complete ubiquitous platform to be able to address the market opportunities we see, we just thought it was too significant an opportunity for go. We think that it's extremely compelling. We think that our shareholders have the ability to achieve a reasonable value out of this transaction. And again if they believe as strongly as we do in the opportunity they can participate in it through Qualcomm shares. And there's a significant cross-holding between the two companies in any case, Stacy. So, this has nothing to do with us. Not believing in what we've laid out. We still feel very comfortable associated with that. If you look at what we've traded over the last couple of years, we typically have traded at a discount to our peers associated with the industry. And so for us to be able to achieve this with very significant premium for a very large deal is something that we feel like is really as good result and one that we’re very pleased with.
Peter Kelly: And as Rick said, this is about creating a powerhouse. This is just a fantastic opportunity. So just create a powerhouse company.
Stacy Rasgon: Okay, thank you.
Rick Clemmer: Thanks Stacy.
Jeff Palmer: Operator, we’ll take one last call here this morning. We’ve got -- we want to keep this abbreviated today.
Operator: Okay. Our last question comes from line of Tore Svanberg from Stifel. Your line is now open.
Tore Svanberg: Rick, you mentioned the Secure ID business is bottoming. And I think you said that for two quarters now, is expected to be down again sequentially in the double-digits for the December quarter. What are some of the milestone that we should look out for that business finally stabilizing?
Rick Clemmer: That’s a really good question. I think that we shouldn’t lose sight of that that business is really the technology that gives us the ability to provide security on a broad base set of solutions. Now, in addition to that, obviously, we have product shipments that take place associated with it. And clearly, we’ve had the benefit of the stocking of the contact with bank cards in China, which we were kind of that they end up. Now, it’s going to be more of a replenishment cycle associate with it, which is not going to offer the same kind of volumes that we’ve had in the past. And with some of the competitive practices and activities, we see associated with contacts base, we’re actually being very selective in our participation associate with it. And that’s the reason why that business is not performing as we would have liked for it to several years ago. We’re down to a point where we think it's going kind of be stable. But we’ve been at this point in the past. But we did talk about the fact that there is seasonality to that business which is typically down in Q1. So even if we’re at this bottom, we could be that in any individual quarter, they could go below that. But we think we’re at that run-rate. And actually, as a percentage of the total volume, now the trends are ticketing, as well as the e-gab side becomes the larger share of the total. And we do see a number of design-wins there. As we’ve talked about in the past, that tends to be fairly lumpy. And so it’s not really a nice move to progression associated with it. But we do feel good about the business. And again, the key is trying to drive the security technology on a broad base across many applications for the total Company, especially when you begin to think about it on a combined basis.
Tore Svanberg: And as my follow-up, you mentioned the wireless base station market seems to still be soft and will remain soft. What are some of the data-points to support that? And is there any visibility as to when that market potentially start growing again? Thank you.
Peter Kelly: So the data points that support that revenue, which continues to be hard to predict, based on the supply chain that’s not easy to call. I think it's -- when you think about the fundamental assumptions, I think, we’re going to continue to see an expansion of data over wireless network. So, you should see fundamentally the ability for base stations to grow. But it's virtually impossible for us to project when that will take place. We continue to be leader in that space, so that’s very positive opportunity for us. It’s a profitable business. As we see the industry moving to more content associated with across the wireless networks, we do think there is some opportunities for the early implementation of 5G, our massive MIMO. They could play a role in increases in revenue in the upcoming quarters. But it's certainly not going to be a factor in the next few quarters. So, we expect that business to continually really hard to predict, but very nice profitability and one that we continue to be a leader in.
Tore Svanberg: Fair enough. Thank you.
Peter Kelly: Thanks.
Rick Clemmer: Well, everyone, thank you very much for attending our call today. We realized it was abbreviated call. But given the announcement first thing this morning, we want to let you guys get back to our new notes and things. We really appreciate all your support. And with that, we'd like to end the call today. Thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the NXP Semiconductors Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Jeff Palmer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Jeff Palmer - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thank you, Trea, and good morning to everyone. Welcome to the NXP Semiconductors' second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. With me on the call today is Rick Clemmer, NXP's President and CEO, and Dan Durn, our CFO. If you've not obtained a copy of our second quarter 2016 earnings press release, it can be found at our company website under the Investor Relations section at nxp.com. Additionally, we have posted on our Investor Relations website a supplemental earnings summary presentation and a document of our historical financials to assist in your modeling efforts. Included in this supplemental presentation and the historical financial model is additional information providing insight into the combined adjusted revenue for NXP and Freescale. This unaudited non-GAAP information has been prepared for comparative purposes only and provides historical revenue of each of the company's adjusted for divestitures. Please be aware of the disclosures associated and detailed in both documents. This call is being recorded today and will be available for replay from our corporate website. Our call today will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause NXP's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the macroeconomic impact on specific end markets in which we operate, the sale of new and existing products, and our expectations for the financial results for the third quarter of 2016. Please be reminded that NXP undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements. For a full disclosure on forward-looking statements, please refer to our press release today. Additionally, during our call today we will make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures which exclude the impact of purchase price accounting, restructuring, stock based compensation, impairment, merger-related costs and other charges that are driven primarily by discreet events that management does not consider to be directly related to NXP's underlying core operating performance. Pursuant to Regulation G, NXP has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our second quarter 2016 earnings press release, which will be furnished to the SEC on Form 6-K and is available on NXP's website in the Investor Relations section at nxp.com. I'd like to now turn the call over to Rick.
Richard L. Clemmer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director: Thanks, Jeff. And welcome everyone to our earnings call today. NXP finished Q2 with solid performance. Revenue was up 6% sequentially and most business lines delivering better than planned results. We drove strong earnings growth as a result of positive fall through on the incrementally higher revenue and good operating expense control. Looking at the specifics, revenue in Q2 was $2.37 billion, an increase of 57% year on year, an increase of just over 6% versus the prior quarter. This was better than the midpoint of our guidance, as the Secure Connected Devices, Secure Interface & Infrastructure and Auto groups, all delivered better than anticipated results. Looking at the HPMS segment, revenue was $2.01 billion, an increase of 76% year on year and an increase of just over 5% from the prior quarter. From an operating segment perspective, the results are as follows. In Automotive, revenue was $858 million, up $53 million and 7% sequentially, and slightly better than the midpoint of guidance. Growth in the quarter was driven by growth in all product lines, with particularly strong demand for Auto MCU products. During the quarter, demand was driven by a good cross-section of our major tier 1 customers with some notable acceleration in Japan as we continue to make progress with major local customers. Design win momentum in Automotive market was robust during the quarter. We were awarded a major V2X program with a top three leading global OEM. The solution pools products from all the major areas of our portfolio. Additionally during the quarter, HELLA announced its plan to adopt NXP's next generation 77 gigahertz radar solution. We are now designed in with 9 of the top 10 tier 1 suppliers for the complete next generation radar solutions, both RF front end and the back end processing engines where we are already the market leader. And lastly, our infotainment solutions continue to be adopted by major suppliers for next generation programs. We continue to view the global auto market and production rates as generally stable with indications that the global unit production will trend towards 3% in 2016, in line with our growth perspective of 1% to 3% compounded annually through 2019. We see auto demand is stable in all major markets. While we have heard concerns over peaking global SAAR, we reiterate that our growth is primarily a function of content growth. While we cannot ignore the unit production influences on our business, so far we have not seen any material changes. Turning now to Secure Connected Devices. Revenue was $514 million, up $43 million or 9% sequentially, incrementally above the midpoint of our guidance range. Within our mobile transaction group, we experienced strong seasonal improvements as a result of both our largest smartphone customer as well as good traction on new models from Korean and Chinese OEMs. We are continuing to see the mobile transit unit in China gain traction. As an example, Xiaomi launched a consumer awareness program in the Shenzhen subway system referencing its Mi Pay mobile transit payment solution. OEMs are also noting positive activation rates of the mobile transit app in new phones as well as repeated top-up of mobile prepaid solutions. Demand for contactless point of sale reader products was in line with expectations, primarily as OEMs continue to deploy readers in support of contactless rollouts in China. In the remainder of that CD business, MCU revenue was flattish as we saw good demand for 32-bit Kinetis MCU and i.MX application processors. But this was offset by the roll-off of legacy 8-bit micros in the semi-custom mobile sensor hub program. We also saw some seasonal rebound in our mobile audio business. The design win momentum for the i.MX family continues to be very robust, especially in the Automotive market for instrument and infotainment clusters. In mobile transactions, our go-to market strategy of working jointly with Chinese handset OEMs and the transit system operators on mobile transit payment systems continues to progress well, with programs in process across all 10 major cities in China. This effort will take some time but we believe we are enabling a unique capability which is resonating with the consumers. Now turning to SI&I, our Interface and Communications Infrastructure group. Revenue was $442 million, up $19 million or 4% sequentially, slightly above the midpoint of our guidance range, with two of the three product lines experiencing growth in the quarter. In the Interface group, demand was strong and slightly ahead of plan due to seasonal handset trends, similar to what we saw in the mobile transactions group. The excess inventory situation in high-speed interface which impacted the company late last year has been cleaned up and we believe our revenue is well aligned with our customers' production levels. I'd like to reiterate that our largest handset customer, while still very important to NXP, only represents a mid single-digit percentage of the total company revenue. In the RF Power market, revenue increased sequentially but was below plan due to program push-outs in base station markets in China and India. We believe, given the continued unpredictability of the base station supply chain, our visibility more than a quarter out will always be challenged. In the Digital Networking market, we saw weaker than anticipated demand with the revenue from the service provider, enterprise and smart home end markets all declining and revenue from cloud edge and industrial markets were both flat during the quarter. As some of you may have seen in the trade press, during the quarter we took actions to right-size the Digital Networking business to align our R&D investments to what we view as the slower growth in the served end markets. We will continue to focus our efforts on areas where our capabilities are aligned with the customer requirement. This continues to be a very good business with high return on investment, attractive profitability and high barriers to entry. We believe we have found a reasonable base from which we can drive profitable growth over the longer term, both in continuing our PowerPC and investing in our ARM-based multi-core products. Within SIS, demand trends continue to be mixed with revenue coming in at $200 million, down 6% sequentially, in line with our guidance. In the non-China banking card market, much of the unit growth opportunity continues to be low-end contact products. This is an area where our participation has been quite selective given the aggressive pricing and margin pressure our competitor has taken who clearly has a much different profitability requirement. In China, our leadership position in the contactless dual interface space continues to be strong that we have clearly entered the period of card replacement and incremental demand is expected to be driven by smaller tenders at tier 2 and tier 3 banking institutions. In eGov, the tenders we highlighted last quarter provided some sequential growth and we were awarded an extension on the German electronic passport program. While a positive change, the eGovernment market continues to be extremely lumpy and hard to predict with any level of accuracy. Now, turning to Standard Products segment, revenue was $303 million, about $10 million better than the high end of guidance, reflecting an increase of 11% from the prior quarter and a 6% year-on-year decline. We are pleased with the results, especially given our announcement to sell this business that we expect to close in early 2017. Now, turning to our distribution channel performance. The total months of inventory in the distribution channel held steady at 2.5 months with absolute dollars of inventory increasing $43 million on a sequential basis. Our channel inventory is in good shape and we will continue to target supply at 2.5 months plus or minus a half month. Also, I want to update you on our private equity investors who became NXP shareholders as a result of the Freescale acquisition, which have liquidated most of their positions. You may recall, when we closed the Freescale merger, the private equity investors owned approximately 65 million shares or about 18% of the NXP shares outstanding. As a result of the recent sales, the private equity investors now own less than 0.5% of the outstanding shares and we are working with them on cleaning up the remaining shares. In summary, Q2 was a solid quarter with the strong financial performance a positive reflection on the progress towards the goals we laid out at our Analyst Day in April. Given what we view as an end market demand environment which is generally subdued, we will focus on actions we can directly influence and control, including our cost and expense structure. To date, the merger integration continues to make good progress. The operations team are working well together, synergy capture is on track and beginning to accelerate, portfolio and roadmaps are meshing better than we originally planned. Our sales team are focused on realizing the full potential of the solutions offered from our industry-leading portfolio. We'd like to thank all of our employees for their active participation and the hard work in the progress to date. We know we have more work ahead. We remain committed and focused to maximizing shareholder value creation. We continue to believe NXP is ideally positioned over the long term to drive profitable growth in excess of our targeted end markets. Now, I'd like to pass the call to Dan for a review of our financial performance. Dan?
Daniel Durn - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thanks, Rick, and good morning to everyone on today's call. We delivered good performance in Q2 with the key highlights being: we delivered revenue that was above the midpoint of guidance; we continued solid execution on non-GAAP gross margins; we tightly controlled our operating expenses, resulting in better fall through and stronger non-GAAP operating margin; and when taken together, drove non-GAAP EPS towards the high end of our guidance. We generated excellent cash flow in the quarter and deployed just under $0.5 billion in share repurchases and gross debt reduction. Turning to the specifics of the quarter. We delivered revenue of $2.37 billion in Q2, up 6% sequentially, and a non-GAAP gross margin of 50%, the third consecutive quarter of 50% or greater non-GAAP gross margin. Within our HPMS segment, revenue was $2.01 billion, up 5% over the previous quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin for the segment was 53.7% and non-GAAP operating margin for the segment was 27%. Within our Standard Products segment, revenue was $303 million, up 11% versus Q1. Non-GAAP gross margin for the segment was 32.7% and non-GAAP operating margin for the segment was 22.8%. Total NXP non-GAAP operating margin in Q2 was 25.6%, up 230 basis points sequentially and above the midpoint of our guidance. This 230-basis point improvement demonstrates strong progress in driving synergy capture. Interest expense in the quarter was $88 million. Cash paid for income taxes was $18 million and non-controlling interest was $14 million. All of this taken together resulted in total non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.39, or $0.04 better than the midpoint of our guidance. Stock-based compensation, which is not included in our non-GAAP earnings, was $80 million. Now turning to the balance sheet. Total debt at the end of Q2 was $8.9 billion with a cash balance of $1.34 billion results in net debt of $7.6 billion. During the quarter we redeemed $100 million of our 3.5% senior unsecured notes due in September 2016. Additionally, we refinanced $1.75 billion of our existing bonds and term loans with new senior unsecured notes issued in the quarter. We exited the quarter with a trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA of approximately $2.38 billion. A ratio of net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of Q2 was 3.2 times and our non-GAAP interest coverage was 6.9 times. Please note, our net leverage ratio only reflects partial trailing 12-month contribution from Freescale. If we were to assume a full year contribution of Freescale's adjusted EBITDA, the net leverage ratio would have been 2.7 times. During the quarter, we repurchased 4.3 million shares at a cost of approximately $365 million, or $84.39 per share. This brings our total year-to-date share repurchases to $663 million, or 8.5 million shares at an average price of $78.26. Turning to working capital, our days of inventory were 107. Receivables were 42 days and payables were 72 days. Taken together, our cash conversion cycle was 76 days. These non-GAAP measures include the assets and liabilities held for sale, as detailed on our balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $434 million and net CapEx was $71 million, resulting in a non-GAAP free cash flow of $363 million. Before I turn to our expectations for the third quarter, I would like to highlight the press release we issued last night regarding a new debt financing. We are opportunistically taking advantage of an attractive debt market by adding $500 million to our existing 2021 notes. We will use a portion of the net proceeds to repay the remaining $200 million on our 3.5% senior unsecured notes due in September 2016, with the remaining proceeds to be used for general corporate purposes. As you have noticed in our Q2 earnings release, starting with the third quarter of 2016, NXP will limit its forward guidance to the following GAAP financial information: revenue, gross profit, operating income, financial income and expense, non-controlling interest, and net cash paid for income taxes. In addition, NXP will limit the non-GAAP financial measures in its forward guidance and subsequent results to: non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP financial income and expense. These changes are being made to be in compliance with the newly issued recommendations from the SEC concerning the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures. We currently anticipate Q3 revenue will be in a range of $2.415 billion to $2.515 billion. At the midpoint, we expect revenue to be about $2.465 billion in Q3. We expect the following trends in the business. Auto is expected to be flat to slightly down in the low-single-digit range. Secure Connected Devices is expected to be up in the range of mid-teens to about 20%. Secure Interface & Infrastructure is expected to be up in a range of low- to high-single digits. Secure Identification Solutions is expected to be down in the range of high-single to low-double digits. Standard Products is expected to be up in the range of low- to mid-single digits. We anticipate revenue from manufacturing, corporate and other to be approximately $48 million. At the midpoint, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be 50.2% plus or minus 50 basis points. And non-GAAP operating margin to be 27.5% plus or minus 50 basis points. Interest expense will be flat at approximately $88 million. Cash paid for income taxes is expected to be roughly $18 million. Non-controlling interest should be about $15 million. Stock-based compensation should be flat sequentially at about $80 million, which is excluded from our non-GAAP guidance. Lastly, consistent with historical practice to assist you in your modeling efforts, please assume a flat share count. So in summary, we delivered solid execution in Q2, indicative of how quickly the combined teams are aligning and executing. We delivered better revenue, excellent non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP earnings per share ahead of guidance. We continued generating strong free cash flow. Robust cash flow will allow us to continue to fund a consistent and well-balanced capital allocation strategy going forward. In the first half of 2016, we deployed nearly $1 billion in share repurchases and gross debt reduction alone. So continued strong execution in Q2, but the team recognizes there is a significant body of work ahead of us and remains focused on delivering strong execution. With that, I'd now like to turn the call back to the operator for your questions. Operator?
Operator: Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yeah, thanks for letting me ask the question. Rick, I wanted to first go to the Auto business. You talked about in your prepared comments having design wins with 9 of the top 10 OEMs for the complete radar solution. Can you help me better understand what the dollar content that would represent? And I guess more importantly, where are we in the ramp of that? And how is that going to look over the next, call it, 12 to 18 months?
Richard L. Clemmer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director: So, John, I think the key is the design wins. It's a typical Automotive product and the actual ramp of revenue will take place over the next few years. It won't be over the next few quarters. I think the key for us is winning those design wins, ensuring that we offered the best solution. And the architecture of each one of those solutions by each one of the OEMs will be slightly different with some of those having three or four sensors or front ends to go along with the microcontroller. And some of them being as large as double-digit radar sensors to go along with the controller. So the architecture is quite different by each individual customer. The key for us is being in a position where we can continue to lead from a technical view point and be sure that we are the leader in the design wins to be able to really be pre-eminent position as the volume really begins to ramp over the next few years as the auto companies bring this significant safety item on, to be able to drive assisted driving and improving the safety of driving.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): That's helpful. And then, Rick, for my follow-up, just going back to the SIS business, if you look at the guidance for the September quarter, it implies that the business will be down over 30% year over year. Do you guys feel as though this is approaching a trough? If so, why? And you've always been good about allocating capital to the right businesses in your portfolio. Have you taken cost actions as you think about maybe this TAM not being as large as you would have thought maybe 12 to 18 months ago?
Richard L. Clemmer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director: So, John, really, I think the important thing about this is this is the security technology that is fundamental for us to be able to drive a secure connected solutions across the board. So the fundamental technology associated with this, we provide across a broad array of portfolio. Now in addition to that, we have the SIS business itself with the bank cards and the eGovernment side. eGovernment's going to continue to be quite lumpy. We continue to do very well in the China banking card business, but you know that's at a level where it's going to be more of a replacement basis than the growth that we've seen over the last few years associated with it. For the rest of the market, which is really focused today, they're not worried about the convenience of the consumer. They're focused on the lowest cost solution, which is a contact EMV solution, and we have the competitor there that doesn't seem to have the same profit requirements that we do. So we're being extremely selective in our participation in the market and that's having some dampening effect on our solutions. We're, obviously, going to be sure that we align our cost with the expectations associated with that, but at the same time we will project our security capability and technology to be able to fan that out broadly across our entire portfolio as we think that's a significant leadership position that we have in being able to drive solutions on a broader basis.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thank you.
Richard L. Clemmer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director: Thanks, John.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Matt Diamond - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, good morning, guys. This is actually Matt Diamond on Ross' behalf. Nice job on the synergies in 2Q as operating margin-wise. Could you give us an update on where we stand in terms of capturing the synergies right now and what's left to be done going forward?
Daniel Durn - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, thanks for the question. I think what we've always said about synergies is watch the operating margin. We want to be measured on an operating margin roadmap that's reflective of synergy capture, as well as operating a disciplined business. What you noticed in the recent quarter Q2 is a 230 basis point sequential improvement in operating margin on a flat gross margin. And if you look at the midpoint of the guide on an operating margin basis into Q3, 27.5%, you see a 420 basis point uplift in a six-month period, with very little contribution from a gross margin basis. If you roughly think this is a $10 billion business and you're looking at 400 basis points of margin improvement in a two-quarter period, I think it pretty quickly gets you to the map that shows the synergy capture is very, very strongly on track. And we're happy with the profitability uplift that this company's seeing from those efforts.
Matt Diamond - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Excellent. And on the cash return side, could you update us on the approach to cash returns between now and the Standard Product sale? And how do you plan to balance the cash returns after you hit the planned two times leverage?
Daniel Durn - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So I think we'll start with what our capital allocation strategy is. We talked about being very balanced between debt and equity until we get to a two times net leverage position. And so if you think that the proceeds from the sale, just given other debt we have outstanding, needs to be used to primarily repay debt or acquire additional assets to increase the asset base of the company, it pretty much locks us into one side of that equation, addressing the leverage of the company. I would say we will balance that perspective with a heavier focus in the near term on share repurchase so that by the time we are exiting Q2 next year, you'll see a more balanced approach to share repurchase and debt repurchase based on our capital allocation strategy than just the use of proceeds from the sale of the divested assets would suggest.
Richard L. Clemmer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director: Yeah, I guess one thing if I could add to that, I think our confidence in being able to close the Standard Products transaction continues to improve with the regulators. And so that gives us a good comfort level of the cash that will be available to us early next year. And so between now and then, we want to be sure that we're opportunistic in doing what's in the best interest of shareholders.
Matt Diamond - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Excellent. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein Research. Your line is now open.
Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First I wanted to ask about the guide for Secure Connected Devices. It's up mid-teens almost to maybe 20%. I think more than half of this business is actually industrial microcontrollers, as well as the mobile payments and everything is in there. Can you give us some feeling for what's driving the strong guide? How much of it is coming from mobile payments versus the broader industrial microcontroller business versus like the handset audio business?
Richard L. Clemmer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director: So the guide for Q3, Stacy, is strong across the board. It's not really in any particular area. If you look at that that also includes our mobile wallet business which is seasonally strong in Q3 with the rollout of new models associated with it, as well as the momentum that we have with China on the transit side. So that's really the most significant factor associated with the growth is in the mobile wallet side of it. But even on the microcontroller side, we see good strong growth in Q3 as well. And then actually have seen a little bit of pick-up even in the audio side with some of the design wins that we have. So it's pretty much across the board, Stacy. But the most significant contributing factor associated with it is the mobile wallet growth that will take place, more on a seasonal basis than anything else, as well as the success that we're having in China on the transit basis.
Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you. That's helpful. For my follow-up, you bought back more stock in the quarter than I would have thought. Share count was down decently. You bought back even more stock – or for Q2. For going into Q3 you bought back even more stock. I just don't understand why is share count supposed to be flat in Q4; why shouldn't it come down?
Daniel Durn - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. So that's just the standard policy the company has is with respect to guiding share count. Share count in the next quarter is going to be a function of timing of share repurchases in the prior quarter Q2, as well as stock price, dilution calculation and stock option exercising, rather than trying to predict what the share price will be, the number of options that get exercised. It's just a long-standing practice inside of the company to assume share count flat. And then it will be what it'll be based on those un-knowable items next quarter.
Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you. That's helpful. Thank you, guys.
Richard L. Clemmer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director: Thanks, Stacy.
Daniel Durn - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thanks, Stacy.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from William Stein of SunTrust. Your line is now open.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Great. Thanks. Congratulations on the strong results and outlook. I'm hoping you can give us some update in terms of the regulatory and operational timing effects with regard to the Standard Products sale.
Richard L. Clemmer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director: Yeah, I think, Will – I think we feel good about the progress we're making on the regulatory basis on the Standard Products transaction. And we talked about the – we actually put out a press release relative to the FTC side of that. So I think we feel good about the progress on the regulatory side. But the long pole in the tent, as we talked about at the time of the announcement, is actually being able to pull the IT systems apart. We're in the process of combining the IT systems of NXP and Freescale. And now at the same time trying to pull out Standard Products which is the most significant share of the actual quantity of units that we ship. So that's really the thing that will be the gating factor relative to the close. And we still anticipate being able to close in first quarter of 2017. But it's not going to be driven as much by the regulatory basis as it will be with our actual separation of the business.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Helpful. If I can have one follow-up, going back to Automotive for a moment. You spoke before about the success you're having in radar. I'm wondering if the company might have any comment as to traction in Vision and other ADAS solutions.
Richard L. Clemmer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director: So I guess the one thing that I must not have emphasized enough, Will, on the call was that we had a very significant design win on vehicle to vehicle. And we continue to be really the only company that has gotten the technology design wins in vehicle to vehicle that we believe will be a very fundamental element in a complete autonomous driving solution. If you look at the auto industry, there's really four levels of autonomous driving with only the last levels being fully autonomous. If you actually get through level three, which is a lot of safety features that assists the driving, we get about 80% of the revenue associated with it. The significant portions of that will be vehicle to vehicle, will include radar, and will include the processing associated with it. We will be sure that we have the processing capability associated with the Vision side, but we're not going to have the fundamental software logarithms and the capability that one of our competitors does to be able to focus on that, from a Vision side. So we think that it's really critical that you have all of the capability to make driving safer, including the vehicle to vehicle and radar, in addition to Vision and potentially even lidar associated with it. But the real key for us is being the leader in vehicle to vehicle, the leader in radar, and the leader in the processing that brings it all together for a safer driving experience. And will drive a much more significant growth than just the inherent growth of the Automotive market itself.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks, Rick.
Richard L. Clemmer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, guys. Good morning. And congrats on the solid quarter. In your prepared remarks, Rick, you talked a little bit about your traction with the automotive OEMs in Japan. And I was hoping you could elaborate on that comment. Which product groups are you seeing momentum in? And what are some of the factors driving the success?
Richard L. Clemmer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director: Yeah. I think the key thing is really the beginning to ramp the shipments on MCU design wins that were won several years ago. So that really represents a significant portion of the near-term traction that we see with some of our key customers in Japan. In addition to that, we've been now successful on the remote keyless entry so that we have kind of the last significant auto producer that we have the design win associated with as well, although that's not such a significant near-term revenue contributor. So I think we continue to make good progress. On the car infotainment side we basically supply virtually all of the major mid- and high-end car radios already, making good progress on our apps processor on i.MX as well as the automotive microcontrollers.
Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great, thank you. And my follow-up is on the inventory situation. You talked a little bit about the channel and how it's healthy. But how would you characterize your own inventory level today?
Daniel Durn - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, so, inventory on the balance sheet is 107 days. It's down 10 days sequentially. And if you unpack the inventory change in the financials there's two components. You get $236 million that gets reclassified as assets held for sale, which will go with the Standard Products business. On a dollar basis, the other mover is a $49 million reduction on a dollar basis of our own inventory. So we're making great progress to our mid-term target of about 100 days by dropping 10 days sequentially, 117 to 107.
Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Very helpful. Thank you so much.
Richard L. Clemmer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Hettenbach of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yes. Thank you. Just wanted to follow up on the comments of the V2X at a top three OEM. Just as you think about the pipeline of potential business and discussions that you have, how that's progressing and how you see the market opportunity shaping up?
Richard L. Clemmer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director: Well, you know I think the really key thing on V2X is the overall infrastructure requirements associated with it. We also just participated/partnered with the Department of Transportation on the Smart City award where they announced this quarter Columbus as the winner of the Smart City award where they'll get around $50 million of funding from the U.S. government and a related entity, as well as they've raised about $90 million locally. So they'll have $140 million. And one of the key things that they're trying to do is be sure that they have as much safety added to driving municipal vehicles as possible. So V2X I think is something that will develop over the intermediate term. It's not going to be growing overnight. The key for us is to win these significant design wins and this was one that was extremely significant that had been on the docket for some time and for some various reasons had gotten delayed. And so we're very pleased that we actually were the solution of choice for all of the bidders on this key business. And as they won that it gave us a really solid position to be able to drive that over more of the intermediate term. The key for us, obviously, is to be sure that we bring the security that's required to make driving, or the automotive, the car itself a secure and safe vehicle, as well as having the connectivity to be able to improve the driving experience itself. And we've chosen to use 802.11p as the standard associated with that because of the speed of transmission and the reduction of latency that makes it a much more safer communication vehicle than the other types of technology that are available.
Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. And then just as my follow-up on the comments on i.MX in terms of some of the momentum you're seeing. Can you talk about that opportunity set presently and as you go into next year?
Richard L. Clemmer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director: This is a business that Jeff and the team have done a really good job of growing. It's grown at double digit really for the last couple years. And we see the opportunity to continue to drive that growth, based on the design wins they have. We're really – they've done a great job of positioning it well on the car dashboard and cluster side. And being able to bring that in with the rest of our Automotive portfolio really puts us in a unique position to bring more of a complete solution to our customers. So the traction we have, a significant share of the traction, is in the Automotive side, although they are making good progress in a number of different areas as well that are more on the general industrial side for future ramp ups over the intermediate term also.
Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you.
Richard L. Clemmer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from C.J. Muse of Evercore. Your line is now open.
C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI: Yeah. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question, trying to understand seasonality going into Q4. And I guess as part of that, Rick, trying to juxtapose your comments in the prepared press release in terms of subdued macro environment and how we should think about progression for you guys as we go through the year end.
Richard L. Clemmer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director: So it's interesting because this is a new experience for us as well because of the combination of the two companies. It puts us in a different seasonal pattern than what we've been in, in a historic base. If you take the total business and look at it, typically Q4 would have been when you combine the two businesses would actually have been down, where historically it would have been just slightly, for an NXP viewpoint, it gets a little bit more of a decline when we combine it with Freescale. We aren't giving you guidance relative to Q4 and what we would anticipate for Q4, so I want to be very clear with that. But relative to if you look at the last three years, it's the best effect that we have of equating seasonal pattern, you'd be down mid-single digit in Q4 associated with it.
C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI: That's helpful. And then I guess quick question for Dan. I know you don't want to put out operating margin targets or anything like that. But looks like you've taken out about $200 million annualized OpEx. Great job there. Curious if it now gets harder, if you're slicing maybe into a little bit more muscle than fat. And if you can comment on whether the trajectory of cost-down efforts may slow a little bit? Where you're focused? Anything you can share there would be very helpful. Thank you.
Daniel Durn - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure. So the targets we have out on an overall company basis, post the divestiture of our Standard Products business, is a 31% to 34% operating margin target. And we expect to be in that range on a full-year basis in 2018 and exiting 2017 within that range. And so nothing about what we've seen to date causes us to come off of those long-term targets. As we think about the near-term footprints in the sand that walk us into that range and into those targets, you'll see big chunks of ground taken in Q2, as evidenced by the results. You'll see a big chunk of ground taken in Q3, as evidenced by the guide. That 420 basis point progression in those two quarters get us a lot of momentum towards the synergy capture. As you get closer to the target range, clearly you'll walk into that range a bit asymptotically. And so you'll see a bit more in the near term, a bit less on a quarterly basis, the rate of capture at the end second half of 2017 and into 2018. That's just the way these types of things progress. If you look at what we've done, when you compare it to Q1 of 2015 as a starting point, Q2 performance, like you said, suggests about $207 million of synergy capture from an OpEx standpoint on a annualized run rate basis. In Q3, the guide suggests close to $275 million on an annualized basis. And so you can see an incremental $70-ish million being captured into Q3. So we're still taking large chunks of ground. Again, we're focused. We're disciplined. We're driving execution to deliver the synergies, and nothing changes our long-term perspective on those operating margin targets.
Jeff Palmer - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thanks, C.J.
Operator: Thank you.
Jeff Palmer - Vice President-Investor Relations: Operator, we'll take the next question.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Caso of CLSA. Your line is now open.
Christopher Caso - CLSA Americas LLC: Yes. Thank you. Just a follow-up question on the Secure ID segment. And I guess the question is how much of the business in that segment is single mode today? And understand that you're choosing not to participate in that segment, but how much could that be a drag on revenue going forward? And, therefore, how close are we to the bottom in that business segment?
Richard L. Clemmer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director: Well, you kind of have to look at it by regional. You can't really talk about it in total. In China, it's all dual interface. And if you look at rest of the world, it's virtually the majority, very high percentage is contact today. We are making some progress with some of the user experience to actually implement dual interface in the rest of the world. But I think the key thing for us is you heard Dan talk about our lack of growth expectations for the current quarter. And that gives you our basis of what we believe the business is going to do. The fundamental opportunity for us is to take that key capability, the device security, the hardware security, and make that available to a broader array of applications so that we can be able to differentiate our solutions versus anybody else. So while the business itself is – we're going to continue to be very selective to ensure that we maintain the profitability requirements that we have. While they may be different than our competitor in that market, we're going to be selective. And so we'll see how that plays out over a period of time. But we don't – we're not laying out a significant growth opportunity in that business based on the environment we see from a competitive view point. But again, the fundamental core technology is the key element for us in being able to drive that for broader applications across the total company.
Christopher Caso - CLSA Americas LLC: Okay. As a follow-up question, just if you could give some thoughts on potential for further M&A? Just what your appetite would be at the moment, once, and I guess assuming that that would be the case once you hit your net debt to EBITDA targets? And what would be the criteria that you'd be looking for if you did have that appetite?
Richard L. Clemmer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director: Well, the thing that we've been very specific about is is we want to ensure that we complete the integration completely before we really consider anything else. I think the industry is definitely in a consolidating mode that we see. It's interesting to think about what alternatives there might be over the intermediate term. We actually like our portfolio quite well. When we get to the position that we feel comfortable with our debt level, we'll look at the alternatives that really give us the best strategic position to be able to fill out our total applications associated with it. So it's clearly premature to talk about what areas that would be because our focus is really ensuring that we drive the integration of the complete business. But our focus is on maximizing shareholder value. And in whichever form that takes place that will be the key for us is how we can maximize shareholder value.
Christopher Caso - CLSA Americas LLC: Thank you.
Richard L. Clemmer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava of Bank of Montreal. Your line is now open.
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi. Thank you, Rick, I just had one question. Back to the SIS. You've talked about the dynamics which seem to be not typical end markets or competitive environments we have been accustomed to seeing NXP operate in. So I get the current quarter guide. And this business with $1 billion business now is going to be lower than $800 million. But longer term, what's the right way to think about the growth trajectory for this segment? I think you've laid out flat- to low single digit long-term grower. Thank you.
Richard L. Clemmer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director: We did. And so we don't anticipate significant growth in that. It'd be very low single-digit growth based on what we see in the current environment. And that really depends on the competitive environment. If it continues to be as unreasonable as it is, where we have a competitor that doesn't have the same kind of profit expectations, then we'll continue not to participate in some of that market because we don't want to take our profitability down. We feel a responsibility to deliver a reasonable shareholder return for our investors. And if our competition doesn't have that same requirement, then we'll let them do that business and we won't participate in it.
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. So we should expect the same discipline that you have shown over the last several years? Thank you.
Richard L. Clemmer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director: Absolutely.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Blayne Curtis of Barclays. Your line is now open.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Rick, could you just talk about USB Type-C and your visibility into that ramp next year as a driver?
Richard L. Clemmer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director: Yeah. So, Blayne, it's interesting because it really fits in well with our high-speed interface portfolio when you think about the power side as well as the ability to move data at very rapid rate. So we feel very good about the developments associated with it and the engagements we have with customers and the technical solutions that we can offer. It obviously has more work to be done. We're not delivering a lot of revenue today, but we would anticipate that this is a significant opportunity for us next year to be able to continue to maintain our leadership in the high-speed interface area, including Type-C.
Jeff Palmer - Vice President-Investor Relations: Yeah. And Blayne, remember from our Analyst Day that we guided the Secure Interface & Infrastructure group to be up mid to high single digits on a three-year CAGR basis. So we're not moving off of that view. And USB Type-C would be one of those tailwinds that provides some growth there.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. And I just want to circle back on a prior radar question. Can you just talk about – obviously, it's far out, but when it does happen can you just talk about the number of radars, as you're starting to see some early interest in even wins per cars. The content per car I know it's ranged quite a lot. When you do see the initial revenue, will it be just one or are you going to see multiple units per car?
Richard L. Clemmer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director: There's no question we'll see multiple units in most of the architecture that's provided associated with it, whether that's one to three, which is kind of in the level one implementation where it's really low level driver assistance, or level three, which is right at the edge of autonomous driving, is making driving as safe as possible, which would have about three to six radars per vehicle, or completely autonomous driving which could have up to 20 radar sensors per vehicle. So if you look at the value per vehicle, that's anywhere from $15 to $35 on the level one implementation, to be up to $35 to $60 on the level three implementation and $100 to $200 on the full autonomous driving solution. So that's the reason we're so focused on ensuring that we have a disproportionate market share and a true leadership position in radar as this develops and can be able to maintain that overall key contributing factor to providing safer driving.
Jeff Palmer - Vice President-Investor Relations: And maybe if I could just add, Rick. If you remember back on our Analyst Day, Blayne, Kurt and Bob Conrad both also highlighted their view of ADAS as a percentage of overall Automotive revenue over the next couple of years and we said that by 2019, we think ADAS products can make up to 10% of our overall Automotive revenue. Clearly, it's going to be an area of very fast growth inside of that organization.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks, Jeff.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Ramsay of Canaccord Genuity. Your line is now open.
Matthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Thank you very much. Good morning. I wanted to ask another question, I think a longer term one on the Automotive business. It occurs to me that many folks are maybe a bit more focused on the inferencing processor or the application processor in future autonomous driving deployment. And one of the things that's impressed me about the NXP BlueBox platform is both being integrated but also separating the different functions, particularly savings (56:05). Maybe, Rick, you could talk a little bit about the competitive dynamics in that key application processor versus some other areas there that you guys might have less competition and more differentiation? And then second, how is the BlueBox platform designed to integrate processors from maybe other vendors that might have share in that one socket? Thanks.
Richard L. Clemmer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director: So, thanks. The BlueBox for us is an integrated solution to really bring our complete computing horsepower to be able to provide a platform for our Automotive customers to really be able to do the work that's required to improve their autonomous driving experience. We'll take that fundamental capability. And, obviously, as they get to volume production, they will tailor that and we'll have a more focused processing to be able to meet the requirements associated with it. The real advantage for us on the BlueBox is being able to engage with the car companies themselves, show them the fundamental capability, and work with them on driving the autonomous driving experience and continue to provide the computing leadership position that we do today across the overall car. We're not in a position where we want to be focused on big GPU artificial intelligence processing. That's not our niche. That's not what we're going to really provide capability. We want to be focused on the high-volume computing that's really in support of allowing safer driving. Artificial intelligence systems are not what we're focused on and not where we're putting our investment associated with it. And they're a long ways away from being able to be implemented in a car today, provided or implemented in production today.
Operator: Thank you. And our last question will come from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Your line is now open.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes, thank you. Dan, I was hoping you'd elaborate a little bit more on the debt that you just announced last night, the $500 million. Looks like you only need about $200 million here initially. So just wondering why you raised as much as you did, especially considering you'll get some cash from the Standard Product sale here relatively soon.
Daniel Durn - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So it's opportunistically taking advantage of the debt markets, doing a tag on offering to an existing tranche that's out there. You're right. There's $200 million maturity in the near term. But as you think about keeping that cash on the balance sheet and general corporate purposes and how we're focused on managing equity versus debt, the company is going to take a balanced approach. And so it was just taking advantage of an attractive market opportunity and then being smart about how we manage the balance sheet going forward knowing what we know is going to happen in Q1.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. And my follow-up is for Rick. Rick, as related to the RF Power business, you talk about some delays and push-outs in base station wins. So I was just hoping if you could elaborate a little bit on that, if this is a very short-term delay or is this little bit more extensive than that?
Richard L. Clemmer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director: You tell me. I mean, the RF Power business is one that we have tire tracks on our back from trying to misjudge. We had heard feedback from our customers that there were some opportunities in China and India relative to the implementation of next-generation base stations. It looks like those have been pushed out some based on budgetary constraints or implementations, and so we've seen a slowing that's actually taken place associated with that. So we clearly don't have visibility beyond basically the next quarter in that business. The bottom line is it's a nice profitable business but the ability to predict the growth associated with that business is non-existent. And the truth is our customers have the same issue with their base station customers. So it's not like they're doing something unique to make it worse. It's just a bad supply chain and hard to predict. But the bottom line is it does drive a nice profitability. We have a true leadership position and we want to be sure that we can continue to maintain that. We are focused on diversifying it into other areas beyond base stations and making progress in that but it's still relatively small share of the total revenue.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: That's helpful. Thank you, guys.
Richard L. Clemmer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director: Thanks, Tore.
Operator: Thank you. And at this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Rick Clemmer for any closing remarks.
Richard L. Clemmer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director: Thank you very much, operator. Thank you for joining us today. Obviously, we want to ensure that we continue to focus on realizing the full potential of our combination. With the good progress that we've achieved to date, but still a lot more work to do as we focus on maximizing shareholder value resulting from the combination. Thank you very much for your support.
Daniel Durn - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, everyone.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today's conference. This concludes your program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the NXP Semiconductors First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will host a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder to our audience this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. Now, I will hand the floor over to Jeff Palmer. Sir, please proceed.
Jeff Palmer - Vice President-Investor Relations: Great. Thank you, Brian and good morning everyone. Welcome to the NXP Semiconductors' first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. With me on the call today is Rick Clemmer, NXP's President and CEO and Dan Durn, our CFO. If you have not obtained a copy of our first quarter 2016 earnings press release, it can be found at our company website under the Investor Relations section at nxp.com. Additionally, we have posted on our Investor Relations website a supplemental earnings summary presentation and a document of our historical financials to assist you in your modeling efforts. Included in this supplemental presentation and historical financial model is additional information providing insight into the combined adjusted revenue for NXP and Freescale. This unaudited non-GAAP information has been prepared for comparative purposes only provides historical revenue for each company adjusted for divestitures. Please be aware of the disclosures associated and details of both documents. This call this morning is being recorded and will be available for replay from our corporate website. Our call today will include forward-looking statements that include risks and uncertainties that could cause NXP's results to differ materially from management's current expectation. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the macroeconomic impact on specific end markets in which we operate, the sale of new and existing products, and our expectations for financial results for the second quarter of 2016. Please be reminded that NXP undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements. For a full disclosure on forward-looking statements, please refer to our press release. Additionally, during our call today, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures which exclude the impact of purchase price accounting, restructuring, stock-based compensation, impairment, merger-related costs and other charges that are driven primarily by discrete events that management does not consider to be directly related to NXP's underlying core operating performance. Pursuant to Regulation G, NXP has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our first quarter 2016 earnings press release, which will be furnished to the SEC on Form 6-K and is available on NXP's website in the Investor Relations' section at nxp.com. I'd like to now turn the call over to Rick.
Richard Lynn Clemmer - President, CEO & Executive Director: Thanks, Jeff. and welcome to our earnings call today. NXP finished Q1 with strong performance and the merger is continuing to proceed smoothly. We are pleased that we achieved our planned objectives in the first 90 days and we are on track to achieve our cost synergy targets as laid out at the time of the merger announcement. The key accomplishments include the integration of our customer facing teams, clear alignment with our internal product development groups, and very positive progress on the integration of our operations and supply organization. Customer response to the merger continues to be outstanding. We continue to make very good progress on the product integration and are making progress in the product areas we need to refine our strategy to more closely fit our product leadership objectives. Before I turn to Q1 results, I would just like to highlight that my comments today will refer to NXP's as reported revenue. As Jeff mentioned, we have included in our quarterly release and investor presentation, additional historic information on the comparable non-GAAP adjusted revenue of NXP and Freescale, net of the effects of product line divestments. We believe this will allow investors to fully understand and model the underlying revenue performance. Now, turning to the specifics, revenue in Q1 was $2.2 billion, an increase of 52% year-on-year and an increase of 39% versus the prior quarter. This was better than the midpoint of our guidance as the Auto, SCD, SI&I groups all delivered better than anticipated results. Looking at the HPMS segment, revenue was $1.9 billion, an increase of 73% year-on-year and an increase of 46% from the prior quarter. From an operating segment perspective, within Automotive, revenue was $805 million, about $5 million above the midpoint of guidance. Growth in the quarter was primarily due driven by strong demand for Auto MCU products, as well as our advanced automotive analog products which for clarity includes our in-vehicle networking and secure car access products both of which saw good trends in the quarter. We view the market outlook and the global production rates to continue to be stable with demand strength in the quarter coming from European and North American Tier 1 customers. We anticipate global auto unit production will trend towards 3% in 2016 with the real driver of growth for NXP being company-specific content gains in our core and in ADAS areas like radar. Recently, Semicast, an auto industry research group published its market share tables for 2015. The market for global semiconductors was $28.2 billion in 2015, down about 2% versus 2014. We are pleased to confirm NXP is the number one auto semi supplier globally with a 14.5% share, up nearly a full point year-on-year further distancing ourselves from the number two player and expanding our leadership position, a true testament to the attractiveness of our Automotive portfolio. Turning to SCD, revenue was $471 million, up roughly $10 million above the midpoint of our guidance. Within our mobile transactions group we saw seasonal declines exaggerated by continued weakness at our largest smartphone customer. This was modestly offset by ramps of new smartphone platforms addressing both the China and the U.S. markets. Demand for our secured contactless POS reader products was slightly better than planned as OEMs continue to deploy readers in support of contactless rollouts in China, Latin America and to a lesser degree in the U.S. which is still predominantly a contact DMV car market. In our i.MX Applications Processor and general purpose MCU families we experienced good demand, generally in line with our expectations. This included positive demand for i.MX products in the point-of-sale reader market, an area we see the opportunity to create our cross-selling efforts as NXP can now address a larger portion of the Bill of Materials post the merger. Additionally, we saw momentum for the i.MX family within Automotive in head-end infotainment units for visual processing. This is also a good example to highlight the complementary nature of the NXP and Freescale product portfolios. As most investors are aware, NXP is the true global market leader in automotive audio processing products and the i.MX family of visual processors, we can complement our offering addressing both the audio and visual processing requirements of the audio infotainment market. Within SI&I, our interface and communications infrastructure group, revenue was $423 million up roughly $10 million above the midpoint of our guidance. In the RF power market, we experienced a rebound in the base station market, particularly in China supporting China mobile phase IV deployments. We also believe most customers have worked through their inventory corrections which caused significant declines in the second half of 2015. We are encouraged by the improvement in Q1, although the market continues to be quite dynamic. In the digital networking market, we saw modestly better than anticipated demand for value products while demand in the service provider, enterprise and smart home were mixed. We anticipate further declines in legacy portion of the portfolio before such time as the new ARM-based multicore products begin to become a more meaningful portion of the portfolio. In interface, demand was essentially in line with our expectations due to the normal seasonality in the high-end handset and tablet market. Within SIS, demand trends continue to be mixed with revenue coming in at $212 million, slightly below the low end of our range. In the rest of the world banking market, much of the unit growth opportunity continues to be for low-end contact products and the area where our participation has been more selective given the significant ASP and margin pressures. In China, our leadership position in contactless dual-interface space continues to be very strong, so we are nearing the peak of the major bank rollouts. Much of the increased market demand is now driven by Tier 2 and Tier 3 banking institutions combined with replacement cycles. In eGov, we saw several tenders, which have been on hold, finally began early rollouts. These programs include the new eID in Jordan and the new social security card in Italy. While a positive change, the eGov market continues to be extremely lumpy and hard to predict with any accuracy. While some other markets for SIS products have become more challenging, we see our security technology as a cornerstone for our long-term vision and continue to maintain leadership in the market, especially for high-end contactless solutions. We are investing in next generation IP, and have new products coming online in 2016 which will strengthen our leadership position. More importantly, we are leveraging this leadership in security IP into other product lines throughout NXP. Now, the Standard Products segment revenue was $274 million slightly below the midpoint of guidance, a decline of 15% year-on-year and an increase of 1% from the prior quarter. Turning to our distribution channel performance, total sales into distribution were down 4% with sales out of distribution down 3%. The total months of inventory in the distribution channel were 2.5 months with absolute dollars of inventory declining $49 million on a sequential basis. Our channel inventory is in good shape and we will continue to target supply at 2.5 months plus or minus a half month. In summary, while the overall year-on-year revenue trends tend to mirror the generally subdued environment, we have begun to see incrementally positive trends in a number of our businesses. I am very pleased with the significant progress we have made. The integration of the two companies is on track to achieve our stated goals and provide our customers with more complete leadership solutions. We are even more excited about the long-term potential of the new NXP. I continue to be extremely proud of all of our employees and want to thank them for the intense focus, unrelenting hard work and positive mindset. We are creating a company which is superbly positioned in our target markets. Now, I would like to pass the call to Dan for a review of our financial performance.
Daniel Durn - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP: Thanks Rick and good morning to everyone on today's call. We delivered solid performance in Q1, as both revenue and gross margin were above the midpoint and EPS was at the higher end of our guidance. We generated excellent free cash flow during the quarter and deployed about $0.5 billion in share repurchases and gross debt reduction. Before I begin with the specifics of our Q1 financial performance, please remember, the sequential comparisons are impacted by the closing of the Freescale merger in December 2015. Revenue for Q1 was $2.22 billion, up nearly 39% sequentially. We generated $1.11 billion in non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin was 50.0%, at the high end of our guidance. Within our HPMS segment, revenue was $1.91 billion, up 46% over the previous quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was 53.3% and non-GAAP operating margin was 24.4%. Within our Standard Products segment, revenue was $274 million, up 1.1% versus Q4. Non-GAAP gross margin was 32.5% and non-GAAP operating margin was 21.5%. Total non-GAAP operating profit in Q1 was $519 million and represented a 23.3% non-GAAP operating margin, slightly better than our guidance. Interest expense was $93 million, with cash taxes of $14 million and non-controlling interest of $11 million. Taken together, this resulted in total non-GAAP net income of $401 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.14. Stock-based compensation, which is not included in our non-GAAP earnings, was $99 million. Now, turning to the balance sheet. Total debt at the end of Q1 was $9.0 billion with a cash balance of $1.5 billion, resulting in net debt of $7.5 billion. During the quarter, we made a payment of $200 million on our 2016 3.5% senior unsecured notes. We exited the quarter with a trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA of approximately $2.1 billion. Our ratio of net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of Q1 was 3.5 times and our non-GAAP interest coverage was 5.6 times. Please note, both of these ratios reflect only partial contribution of Freescale's adjusted EBITDA. During the quarter, we repurchased 4.1 million shares at a cost of approximately $298 million for a weighted average cost of $71.86 per share. Turning to working capital, our days of inventory were 117, receivable days were at 43, payable days were at 77. Taken together, our cash conversion cycle was 83 days. These non-GAAP measures take into account the effect of purchase price accounting related to the merger on both GAAP COGS and inventory, with the differences detailed in our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation. If you exclude the purchase price accounting associated with the merger in Q4, inventory days in Q1 of 117 were up four days from Q4, and inventory dollars grew by $20 million. We made significant process over the last several months to align our distribution channel, with months of supply now at 2.5 months. Our efforts in this area focused on organizational leadership, management processes, as well as aligning channel inventory to what we view as the current demand environment. Cash flow from operations was $414 million and net CapEx was $88 million, resulting in non-GAAP free cash flow of $326 million. Now looking ahead into the second quarter, as Rick noted in his prepared remarks, the current demand environment continues to be somewhat subdued. Our customers, however, continue be excited about the potential of the new NXP. They recognize the power of the combined portfolio. We are focused on cross-selling efforts in the intermediate term and working with customers on new products based on the combined capability over the longer term. With this as a background, we currently anticipate Q2 revenue will be in the range of $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion. At the midpoint, we expect revenue to be about $2.35 billion in Q2. Auto is expected to be up in the range of mid-to-high single-digits. Secure Identification Solutions is expected to be down in the range of low to mid-single digits. Secure Connected Devices is expected to be up in the range of mid-single to low double-digits. Secure Interface and Infrastructure is expected to be in the range of flat to up mid-single digits. Standard Products is expected to be up in the range of mid-to high single digits. Lastly, we anticipate revenue for manufacturing, corporate and other to be approximately $48 million. At the midpoint, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be 50% plus or minus 50 basis points and non-GAAP operating margin to be 25.3% plus or minus 30 basis points. Interest expense will be approximately $88 million, cash taxes are expected to be roughly $18 million and non-controlling interest should be about $14 million. Stock-based compensation should be about $85 million which is excluded from our guidance. Diluted share count is assumed to be $351 million shares, but could be different depending on share price fluctuations and stock buybacks. Taken together, this translates into non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $1.30 to $1.40, or $1.35 per share at the midpoint of our guidance. So, in summary, we delivered strong execution in Q1, indicative of how quickly the combined teams are aligning and executing. We delivered better revenue, excellent gross margins and earnings per share ahead of guidance. Looking at the margin execution in a bit more detail, we achieved 50% gross margin in a challenging environment which represented excellent execution on the part of our operations and supply chain organizations. Over time, we believe we can drive gross margins in the 51% to 55% range and we'll provide more detail during our upcoming Analyst Day on Thursday. Operating margins are expected to increase 200 basis points sequentially which is evidence of the execution on our planned cost synergies. Over time, we expect to achieve operating margins above 30% and we'll provide more clarity on Thursday. Importantly, we continued generating strong free cash flow which will be a hallmark of the new NXP. The robust cash flow allowed us to fund a well-balanced capital allocation strategy; deploying nearly $500 million in share repurchases and gross debt reduction alone in Q1. We will discuss our capital allocation strategy in more detail during the Analyst Day. So, strong execution in our first quarter as a new company, but the team recognizes there is a significantly more work to do ahead. We look forward to seeing many of you on Thursday. With that, I'd now like to turn it back over to the operator for your questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yeah, good morning, guys and congratulations on strong results, thanks for letting me ask question. I guess, guys, my first question is just around OpEx. And I know that you guys wanted to kind of avoid talking about sort of the quarterly progress to your synergy targets, but when I look at OpEx in the March quarter of about $593 million and compare that to the pro forma number back in September of around $610 million to $615 million, it just seems you've divested businesses and revenues down a lot. OpEx is good, but I'm just trying to get a sense of – now you've always said the cost synergies are going to be more backend loaded, is that still the case and if that is the case, why are the cost synergies this year more backend loaded?
Daniel Durn - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP: Yeah, so a couple of comments on this John. If we take a look at Q1 of 2015 as a baseline predates merger announcement and we combined the as reported numbers for the company, we get a operating margin on a combined basis of about 23.5%. When you net out the divested businesses, RF Power and Bipolar, we know that RF Power was significantly margin accretive on a blended basis. Rough order of magnitude, take about $150 million of revenue out and it improves the operating margin by about 100 basis points – I'm sorry, it takes operating margins down by about 100 basis points. So the baseline against which we think we should be measured is Q1 adjusted 2015 with an OpEx level that's roughly about $629 million and an operating margin of 22.6%. As we think about the 200 basis point sequential improvement in the Q2, you'll see about another 250 basis point improvement into the back half of the year. And we think we will exit 2016 close to 28% operating margin. Then when you think about the transition into 2017, we think we will exit 2017 above 30% operating margin. I think it gives you a pretty clear roadmap of what we expect from a synergy capture standpoint on a go forward basis.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Dan, that's really helpful. And then maybe for my follow-up to Rick just wanted to get a little bit more insights into the SIS business, if you look at sort of the implied guidance for the June quarter, it's a pretty hefty year-on-year decline. That's historically been a lumpy business. In your prepared comments you sort of talked about parts of that market becoming less attractive. It's a significantly smaller piece of the combined entity than it was NXP standalone. But how should we and how do you think about long-term growth in that business and when do we start to return to a year-over-year growth curve in the SIS?
Richard Lynn Clemmer - President, CEO & Executive Director: So, I think it's an area that we will spend quite a bit of time on Thursday, John. I think the key for us is that if you look at the contact banking, the pricing pressures and the margin pressures are pretty intense. And so we're pretty selective, just like we were, for example, in SIM cards a number of years ago where we didn't participate in that even though it was the core technology. But when we think about our SIS business, we're really focused on the core security technology that it gives us to really be able to play in all the other markets to be able to drive a complete hardware solution platform that can give us a competitive advantage on a complete solutions portfolio. But in this business itself, we expect it to regain growth. Our leadership position in high-end contactless banking in China is still just as strong as it has been. But again, we've been a little more selective on the contact banking side and not trying to maintain all the business if some of our competitors choose to give it away with no profit margins associated with it. And I think as we get through, it's going to be continue to be a lumpy business. We did talk about; we have seen some tenders that are now beginning to ramp in eGov which is a positive sign. And we clearly would anticipate that as we roll out some new product in later this year, we would return to a growth rate associated with that business.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks guys.
Daniel Durn - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP: Thanks John.
Richard Lynn Clemmer - President, CEO & Executive Director: Thanks John.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I guess one on your biggest business, Rick, your Automotive business, you mentioned that the end market was stable, without front running Thursday's meeting too much, can you talk a little bit about the content side of the equation and any sort of magnitude that you think that can drive the growth of NXP above and beyond that kind of 2% to 3% unit growth for the market that you discussed?
Richard Lynn Clemmer - President, CEO & Executive Director: Well, John (sic) [Ross], as you know, we're going to cover it in a lot more detail on Thursday. But I guess when we think about that business going forward, even with the combined portfolios, we see SAAR growing – roughly approaching 3% for the year. We see the semiconductor content that goes along with SAAR being kind of 50% faster than that, kind of in the 4%, 5% range. And with the design wins we have, we see the opportunity to participate at a higher rate, high single-digits. And so I guess, we haven't officially come out for the three-year growth rate, again to update that, which we will do on Thursday, but you can anticipate that we will be at a high single-digit level in Automotive and continue to solidify our leadership position there. Really changing some of our focus from some of the areas that have been invested in previously, moving more towards the ADAS and areas where we have a true leadership position and can have a significant impact on saving lives and reducing the number of accidents in the auto industry.
Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And I guess as my follow-up, Dan, one for you on the gross margin side of things, you gave a great answer as to how you guys are working on OpEx to John's question. On the gross margin side of things, you're guiding it relatively flat in the second quarter. Can you just walk through some of the puts and takes that leave that flat?
Daniel Durn - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP: Yeah. So when we take a look at operation of the business, recall that we're about 45% externally sourced, 55% internally sourced and as we grow in various parts of the business, mix obviously affects that equation. And it doesn't necessarily lead to an overall improvement from a utilization standpoint of the overall company. The second thing is, we're positioning ourselves to long-term margin progression on the gross margin line over time. And so we want to make sure that the early pieces that we've put in place are done in a very measured way so that we drive well into the mid-50%s from a gross margin standpoint over time. And then lastly, as we think about pickup going forward in terms of the various end markets we serve, we're incrementally seeing more strength in the mobile market than we've seen over the last couple of quarters and its margin dilutive on a mix basis.
Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good, thank you.
Richard Lynn Clemmer - President, CEO & Executive Director: Thanks Ross.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of William Stein with SunTrust. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Great, thanks. Congratulations on a good quarter and outlook. I'm hoping you can address the path to delevering from here. I think the buyback that you did during the quarter was clearly very well timed given the dislocation of the stock price. But, I think there was some expectation that investors had that the focus would be on debt reduction. And maybe you can talk without front running the Analyst Day too much about the trade-offs you consider in capital allocation between those two and maybe any other priorities?
Daniel Durn - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP: Yeah, thanks Will. So as we think about capital allocation and we think about leverage. I think, first we want to start off by saying there's no change to the target leverage of this company. It's going to be two times net leverage or below. And at the time of the merger we said we would get back to two times leverage within six quarters. So, the target is to, by the end of Q2 2017, to be a two times levered company or below. In the interim, like we said, we are going to take a balanced approach to capital allocation. Dislocation that we see from an equity market value standpoint relative to the intrinsic model we have, means that we're going to be as aggressive as possible within that boundary condition of two times leverage by the end of Q2 2017 to buy as much shares as we can in the open market.
Richard Lynn Clemmer - President, CEO & Executive Director: Yeah. So, Will, you made the comment that you thought our investors were looking for deleverage. I will tell you, based on a wide survey of our largest investors, we have basically a split vote between deleveraging and buying back stock. And so what we're going to try to do is balance that off in the best interest of shareholders moving forward.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: That's very helpful. Thanks. If I can add one follow-up and it's about the broader portfolio – Rick, may be appropriate for you. There has been some incremental speculation about what you might do with the Standard Products business. It's clear to those of us who've been following you for some time that you've stated in the past, this is not core, not strategic, but sort of not demanding a sale either, it's a very good margin, very good cash flow sort of business. So I'm wondering if you can give us any updated consideration on thinking about the portfolio more broadly, both potential sales or potential acquisitions.
Richard Lynn Clemmer - President, CEO & Executive Director: Well, we're not going to comment on any rumors or speculation. I think we can reconfirm as we've said that Standard Products is really not a strategic – not in our strategic portfolio, not a requirement to be able to meet our strategic requirements. But that being said, it's the best-performing business in the Standard Products market and generates a significant amount of cash and a very positive business. So, if someone would come along and offer us what we would deem to be fair value, you know, if it's higher value for them than it is for us, then we clearly would consider our alternatives associated with it. Relative to the overall portfolio, I think it's a work in process in a couple of areas. When we look at it, there's been a changing market environment in some of the markets we participate in. And we're taking a really hard look at a couple of areas to decide how much R&D investment we want to move forward with to really be sure that we can drive our RMS objectives that we have as a company to really be a true industry leader in the businesses where we're investing. So we will be making some adjustments over the next few quarters associated with that. And we'll talk a little bit about that on Thursday, but primarily come back to you after we have that in place over the next few quarters.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks and congrats again.
Richard Lynn Clemmer - President, CEO & Executive Director: Thanks, Will.
Daniel Durn - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you for taking my question. You mentioned distribution inventory is around 2.5 months, it's definitely an improvement versus a few quarters ago. My question is, is this the right number? Is it too high? Is it too low? Is it exactly the right number? How are you making that determination, Rick? And if you were to divest Standard Products, do you think that helps improve the visibility in the distribution channel?
Richard Lynn Clemmer - President, CEO & Executive Director: Well, we'll leave any comments for Standard Products until that time that it might actually happen. I think when you look at inventories in distribution channel, it's always an arm wrestle basically with our distribution channel partners. We'd like for it to be, frankly, as high as it can be because the more product that's there is available for sale associated with it, they would like for it to be as low as it can be to be able to improve their turns and earn (34:38). So it's an arm wrestling. I think 2.5 months is about the right level, plus or minus 0.5. If we saw an increase in demand then we might want to be approaching more like the 2.9 or 3.0 months of inventory getting prepared for that increase in demand. What we wouldn't want to do is see a decrease in demand and see inventory increasing to the 3.0 level. So I think we're kind of okay with where the inventory levels are at 2.5 months. We don't want them to get a lot lower than that frankly. But with where the general economic environment is, which is certainly not off to the races, I think we'd like to maintain the inventory levels roughly around where they are. Now they'll bounce around a little bit on a quarterly basis depending on which disti takes which shipments or whatever. But I think it's in the right ballpark of where it should be, the right zip code, and we want to continue to maintain it there unless we see a pickup in demand, and then we want to be sure that we've got adequate supply in the channel to be able to meet our customer requirements.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. Thank you. And as a follow up, Rick, is it possible that if there is faster adoption of NFC in smartphones that your SCD segment helps to offset the slowdown and maturity that you're seeing in the bank card segment, because it appears that people are more comfortable using a mobile wallet in the phone rather than using a lot more credit cards, and if that is the case what are the puts and takes? I assume your content in a phone is much higher than what it is in a bank card.
Richard Lynn Clemmer - President, CEO & Executive Director: Yes. Seriously, I think you are absolutely dead on. When we look at the opportunity – I think, we've been talking about it for some time. Clearly, it's taken more time to materialize for mobile transactions in emerging countries than what we would have hoped for. Part of that's dependent upon when the fundamental core technology – once Apple had kind of delayed their implementation of Apple Pay in China, it pushed out the timing associated with it. Now, on an interim basis, we've really gone off and tried to work on the transit side in China, and we see some real momentum with our partners in trying to be able to bring a mobile wallet to the transit experience in China. And we think that that may be as much if not more of a stimulus than absolutely Apple Pay's rollout on a worldwide basis, where all of the smartphone companies have to have an equivalent product to be sure that they can be competitive with Apple. But it's absolutely more value associated with it and an opportunity, with the leadership position we have from a technical viewpoint as well as from an overall ecosystem and solutions viewpoint, an opportunity for us to be able to participate in that accelerated growth.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you.
Unknown Speaker: Thanks, Vivek.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Freedman with Sterne Agee CRT. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Doug Freedman - Sterne Agee CRT: Great. Thanks for taking my question guys, and congratulations on the strong beat and raise results. If I could, Rick, if we look at the revenue level that the combined companies were operating at for the first quarters of 2015, it really approximates $2.5 billion plus or minus $50 million. Is there anything that's happening in the portfolio at the present time that makes it compared to that level going forward an unfair comparison once we get the inventory levels straightened up? If you could comment on where you think we are in sort of that overall inventory and a recovery to that sort of a level of revenue would be helpful.
Richard Lynn Clemmer - President, CEO & Executive Director: So, first off, you have to consider the RF Power business, which if you just do a simple add up was (38:31) associated with it, so that's one factor. I do think that with RF Power we have seen – we continue to see a supply chain that is up and down and creates a lot of spikes and uncertainty associated with it. And if you look at, some of the pressure that we've seen in the marketplace in digital networking, we see some pressure associated with the top line from where Freescale was operating a year ago in digital networking. It's quite well known some of the pressures of some of the high-end smartphone companies and the impact that has that we've seen in the second half of the year and have to be able work through and move through that. And then as we talked about, SIS has not been at the level that we would have liked based on some of the pressure that we've seen, the competitive pressure on the contact baking situation. So I think, as we talk about it Thursday, we'll give you more specific comments on the growth going forward. I think when you look at it we have the right portfolio focused on the right markets that will give us the opportunity to outgrow the market going forward. And we'll try to go through that in more detail on Thursday to be able to share with you guys why we feel as comfortable as we do with the ability to outgrow the market – to continue to outgrow the market. But we don't – our confidence in being able to outgrow the market is still just as solid as it has been in the past. Although, clearly, we're going through some pressures in the near-term that I talked about that makes it more difficult on a near-term basis.
Doug Freedman - Sterne Agee CRT: I guess, as my follow-up, if you could maybe give us some insights into what you're presently seeing in the RF market, whether you think that is a market that will recover or come out of its present down cycle?
Richard Lynn Clemmer - President, CEO & Executive Director: So I think that that market is going to continue to be up and down. I don't think that we'll see a consistent basis on it at all. I think what we have seen in Q1 is a very positive environment where China Mobile with their next-generation rollout has actually accelerated things. As we look at that market, we actually over the long-term want to try to be sure that we can participate in other segments associated with it. But I think, the improvement that we've seen in Q1 and the better outlook associated with it is based on the strong leadership position that we have in RF Power and then the opportunity to be able to leverage that into other applications. As we look at some of the emergence of post 4G rollouts an opportunity for us to be able to participate in some of the architecture decisions there, we think that we're quite excited about some of the opportunities that can give us some growth over and above what you might expect on just a normal base station deployment.
Doug Freedman - Sterne Agee CRT: Terrific. Thanks for all the color.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Your line is now. Please go ahead.
Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Bernstein Research: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So it sounds like, I guess, with the higher margin targets and you're talking about strong free cash flow that the story here maybe becomes a little more geared toward a total returning capital allocation. And then in that environment, free cash flow probably becomes more important than it has been in the past. I know some of your competitors with a similar type of story or model actually have fairly well-defined free cash flow targets. I guess along with the margin targets you've given, are you going to be giving free cash flow targets, maybe as a percentage of revenue or something like that out as well? And what sort of free cash flow generation prospects do you see from the combined company over time?
Daniel Durn - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP: Yeah. Thanks Stacy. We definitely will be giving guideposts in terms of how to think about free cash flow going forward. Capital return strategy, I think will be an important part of the story going forward. And if you think about a company that's a – against the 3% to 4% market growth rate, greater than 1.5 times growth, you're thinking maybe a 6%, 7% grower going forward out into the 2019 timeframe at this margin profile. You start getting in the zip code of about $4 billion EBITDA, you're thinking about CapEx at about a 5% run rate going forward. So EBITDA minus CapEx is mid $3 billion a year type number at the far end of that guidance window. I think it gives you a sense of what we'll be saying on Thursday and dimensionalizing the strength of the combined model on a go-forward.
Richard Lynn Clemmer - President, CEO & Executive Director: And I think you can look at our track record, Stacy, we've been very balanced in using our cash that we generate, we've had strong cash generation in the best interest of shareholders. I mean, if you look at it, before we actually did the merger, we had bought back like $1.6 billion over like a four, five quarter period of time. So that's a good indicator relative to our position and our desire to be able to make sure that we act in the best interest of shareholders.
Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Bernstein Research: Got it. Thank you, guys. That's helpful. And for my follow up and again I guess maybe we will hear more about this on Thursday, but do you think that your, I guess, long-term gross margin targets are going to be revenue dependent. Like what kind of revenue levels do you think would take to hit the low end versus the high end of that gross margin guidance?
Daniel Durn - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP: Yeah. So rather than tying a specific revenue level to the low end or high end because it's going to be – part of it is scale and part of it is time based. But as you think about revenue, not heroic levels off of where we sit today and what we posted in 2015, but maybe an $11 billion zip code give and take is the type of scale that will facilitate progression into this – well into the gross margin range.
Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Bernstein Research: Got it. Thank you, guys.
Richard Lynn Clemmer - President, CEO & Executive Director: Probably it's about mix as it is absolute revenue dollars. So I think there are factors associated with it. But I think we'll go through – Dan will go through more details on Thursday associated with our targets and how comfortable – and the reasons why we feel as comfortable as we do associated with it, Stacy.
Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Bernstein Research: Got it. Thank you, guys.
Daniel Durn - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP: Thanks.
Richard Lynn Clemmer - President, CEO & Executive Director: Thanks, Stacy.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs Japan Co., Ltd.: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Rick, you talked a little bit about how you're seeing incremental positive trends in the number of your businesses. Maybe you can elaborate on that and provide a couple of examples, which businesses, which regions? That would be helpful. Thank you.
Richard Lynn Clemmer - President, CEO & Executive Director: Well, I think when you look at it over the last few months, our Automotive business has continued to rebound nicely and is in a very positive environment. So, clearly, we feel very good about the improvements in Automotive business and being able to continue to see that. While there has been some discussion about our inventories, et cetera, we don't see any weakness on a global basis at all in automotive and continue to see very positive. I think one of the things that we are seeing is when we look at what we call our crawl charts on a weekly sales basis, we see some uptick associated with it which is encouraging. Our book to bills are improving and although we don't think book to bills are necessarily a good a representation of what's going on in the semiconductor market as they were a decade ago or so, they are a factor and we do see positive indications associated with that. So I think overall when we look at it, the market in China seems to be pretty stable. I think other than a few exceptions in Europe, which is primarily industrial and automotive, it's looking pretty good. The U.S. market is somewhat anemic based on the environment associated with the political uncertainty and the concern that that touch relative to everyone's investment strategy. Bu, clearly, we're seeing indications in different businesses, in different sectors of improving which gives us the confidence to be able to talk about some indications of an improving economic environment.
Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs Japan Co., Ltd.: Okay. Thank you. That's very helpful. And as a quick follow-up, I have a question regarding your guide for Q2. I'm trying to better understand how your guide for the individual segments compare relative to your history. If you can provide ranges for normal seasonality for the combined business, for each of the segments, that would be helpful. Thank you.
Jeff Palmer - Vice President-Investor Relations: Yeah. Toshiya, it's Jeff.
Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs Japan Co., Ltd.: Hi.
Jeff Palmer - Vice President-Investor Relations: So when we -- yeah, hi. When we get out to a seasonality, what we do is we tend to look backward about three years, take an average and the median. So it's really not – we're not trying to give you any kind of nod-nod, wink-wink into the future, what we're giving you are our thoughts on seasonality. So this is all mathematical and you could go probably through it yourself. But if you think about autos, in aggregate, on a comparable basis, three-year seasonality into Q2 might be low-single digits, kind of low to mid-single digits, if you will. If you think about SCD, that upper-single digits, the 7% kind of range into Q2. SIS is just such a lumpy business. These analysis really doesn't work because it's kind of different every year depending on what tenders are happening. So I'm going to kind of avoid making a comment on that. And then on the Secure Interface and Infrastructure, you usually do see a mid-single digit up into Q2. Now, these are all just on a comparable basis and this takes kind of backward three-year look at our trends.
Richard Lynn Clemmer - President, CEO & Executive Director: But I would tell you, I think that the one thing that's really difficult as you've brought the businesses together is the seasonal basis is much more difficult to try to draw any real conclusions associated with. We'll cover more of the general environment on Thursday as we go through it business by business. And I think you'll get a better feel for what we see with the outlook.
Jeff Palmer - Vice President-Investor Relations: Yeah. And then Toshiya, just for completeness sake, on Standard Products, it's a great business in a odd market, but it's up about 2% low-single digit into the second quarter approximately.
Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs Japan Co., Ltd.: Very helpful. Thank you so much.
Jeff Palmer - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thank you Toshiya for your question.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI: Yeah. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question, going back to your commentary around autos and high single-digit growth, curious what kind of assumptions you're making there in terms of radar entering the fold as well as with CogniVue integration and what kind of uplift from vision you're anticipating this year, or is that greater uplift from those two elements into 2017 and beyond?
Richard Lynn Clemmer - President, CEO & Executive Director: So I would tell you, radar we see as a positive contributor late this year. It's a foundation of the business today. So it's not like it's coming from ground zero, but we see our leadership position in radar continuing to strengthen as we move forward and it will be a contributor. Don't forget we have our initial shipments, vehicle-to-vehicle that will start – that we're doing with Delphi for high-end General Motors which will start for the 2017 model year, which will start shipping later this year, although it won't be material in the overall numbers from an impact viewpoint. And on the vision side, I think that's beyond kind of the near-term. So as we look at it, our focus on investment is moving towards the ADAS side. But remember, that's really more further out in time in automotive, that's not something that's going to impact the next few quarters. The next few quarters are going to be driven by the design wins that we've already won as we begin to ramp those or continue to ramp those, and having a positive impact relative to the overall revenue.
Jeff Palmer - Vice President-Investor Relations: And C.J., if I could just add, I think it's overlooked sometimes the significant market share the new NXP has in radar. We are clearly the market leader in that space. We're considered not only a market leader, but we're a thought leader. Some of the ideas we're seeing from some of the more cutting-edge automakers of building kind of radar cocoons around their cars, they're coming to us to help them with those solutions. That not only pulls forward radar front end, but also pulls forward the processing back end, and then is also driving us to supply in-vehicle networking at higher data rates like in-vehicle Ethernet. So there is really kind of an add-on effect in this market and it goes to show you the complementary nature of this merger and the power we can bring to our Automotive customers.
Richard Lynn Clemmer - President, CEO & Executive Director: And we're going to cover that in a lot more detail on Thursday. But clearly, our focus in Automotive is – on the investment side is moving more towards the ADAS side and how we can continue to drive leadership associated with those new opportunities.
C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI: Very helpful. I guess as a follow-up, I wanted to go back to distribution, and curious if you could share what percentage of your combined revenues flow through distribution. If you can confirm that all of that is recognized on a sell-in basis. And then, I guess, Rick, given your comments around green shoots in parts of your business, do you anticipate into Q2, Q3 timeframe perhaps a reacceleration of demand as inventory there has gotten cleaned up and you start to see a resumption of at least normalized demand patterns?
Richard Lynn Clemmer - President, CEO & Executive Director: Well, we've given you specific guidance for what we think about Q2 so that is probably as far out as we want to go, C.J., on a quarter-by-quarter basis. I do think that we clearly have gone through a pretty significant supply chain adjustment associated with a number of the smartphones – or at least some of the key smartphone manufacturers. I think as we work our way through that, we will see a return to more of a normalcy associated with it. On disti itself, we always said it was around half of the NXP business in the past. I think Freescale had said it was kind of a third or a little bit above. I think in total we're kind of in the 40%, 45% range and it bounces around a little bit based on fulfillment, what customers are doing what in any individual quarter. But we're in that just slightly below half, I would say, and think that that's kind of an optimal place to be in. But relative to the impact that has on a quarterly basis going forward, I think that's all reflected in what we gave you relative to our Q2 guidance. And then we'll talk about the three-year compounded growth rates in more detail on our session on Thursday.
Jeff Palmer - Vice President-Investor Relations: And C.J., just to your other question, we recognize all of our revenue into distribution on a sell-in basis.
C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI: Great. Thanks so much.
Richard Lynn Clemmer - President, CEO & Executive Director: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Just following up on the mobile wallet, and after that high profile win it looks like we're starting to see early signs of finally the Android community for traction. So can you add any anecdotes around that in terms of your design initiatives and how you see that ecosystem evolving as we go through this year?
Richard Lynn Clemmer - President, CEO & Executive Director: Yeah. The key we talked about and we've been trying to update was really on the Android side, the Android Pay really being driven by transit as much as anything else. We actually announced our relationship with Xiaomi and that's a significant contributing factor. But basically, most of the so-called China Inc. smartphone guys are looking at how they move a mobile wallet into their offering. But not as much for the mobile wallet's sake, it's really focused on the transit side and being able to make boarding of the mass transit systems in China in a much more speedy and efficient manner associated with it. So we're really focused on how we deploy that now and drive some of the adoption of mobile wallet through the transit side. Although I still think there's some momentum as Apple begins to roll out Apply Pay in China, all of the high-end smartphone guys have to have something equivalent or when somebody in Sprint is using Apple Pay at a terminal and they've got a brick that doesn't do that, they're going to want to move to something that's equivalent.
Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Thanks. And as my follow-up, on the broad-based MCU business, based on recent market share data that was released, it looks like you guys gained share in 2015 for the fourth straight year. So are there any segments or products from a momentum perspective that you would highlight in terms of that's helping to drive the share gains in MCUs?
Richard Lynn Clemmer - President, CEO & Executive Director: I think it's really our 32-bit ARM leadership, both on frankly the Kinetis platform that Geoff Lees has been driving at Freescale and now combined with the LPC platform from NXP gives us kind of the broadest platform to be able to participate in the market. When you talk about end segments, I think it's pretty ubiquitous across the board. We did make note of one of the strengths in the current quarter was actually on point-of-sale terminals where we have the ability to drive some of that. But I think it's more about just the strength of our portfolio with the growth of 32-bit ARM based positioning, and we think we're in an excellent position to continue to move that forward on a broad array of applications and functions and with the combination of the product portfolio from both companies being able to deliver a more complete bill of materials for a solution.
Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Thanks for the color there.
Jeff Palmer - Vice President-Investor Relations: Operator, we will take one more caller.
Operator: Yes, sir. Our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just, Rick, I think you've answered this, so I just want to clarify, you talked about channel inventory is being lean. Were you under-shipping any in Q1? And then as you look to the guidance in Q2, do you expect those inventory levels to change? And then if you could just talk about on SCD, the wide range of the guide, what are the drivers there?
Richard Lynn Clemmer - President, CEO & Executive Director: Well, first off, on distribution, yeah, we reduced our inventory by $49 million, so we under-shipped into distribution in the most recent quarter. I think, for Q2, we don't give guidance specifically associated with that. Our intent will be is to put the right amount of product in the distribution channel for what we see for Q3 and being able to meet the customer demand requirements for that. But, I would anticipate that we're in the right zip code and where we would want to be. So I would say it'd probably be pretty balanced going into the quarter. But, again, we don't give specific guidance associated with that. And I'm sorry, I forgot what your other question was.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I was asking, the drivers in June (58:24) on SCD, there is a wide range there, what are the puts and takes?
Jeff Palmer - Vice President-Investor Relations: Yeah, Blayne, maybe I'll take that. So you know one of the beauties of the microcontroller and MPU market is its broad-based nature. It's a much more diverse type of business, it's a great business. As one of the earlier questioners asked, I commented on our market share gain, so the concentration in SCD is not what it was at one time. While we're still very pleased and proud of our exposure to the high-end smartphone market, we're much less dependent on the smartphone market today. We're seeing very positive trends in mobile transactions, as Rick commented on, but nowadays the business I think has a much more diverse nature in SCD.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. This is all the time we have for questions today. I'll now turn the call back to Rick Clemmer for closing comments.
Richard Lynn Clemmer - President, CEO & Executive Director: Thank you very much. First off, thank you for joining us today. In closing, I'd like to just highlight a few key points. We delivered a very strong performance in Q1 with revenue, gross margin and EPS all above the midpoint of guidance. We generated excellent cash flow and effectively deployed about $0.5 billion in buybacks and debt reduction. Finally, I'm extremely pleased with the significant progress we've made in the last few months relative to the integration and we continue to execute associated with that and things are going very smoothly, especially on the product synergies and bringing the portfolios together. We look forward to hopefully speaking to all of you at the Analyst Day on Thursday and hopefully, we can share as much information as possible with you to make you as knowledgeable about NXP as possible. Thank you so much.
Jeff Palmer - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thank you everyone. And that concludes our call today.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. You may all disconnect. Everybody have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 NXP Semiconductors Earnings Conference Call. My name is Turia and I'm your operator for today. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. Now, I would like to hand it over to Mr. Jeff Palmer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.
Jeff Palmer - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thank you, Turia. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the NXP Semiconductors' fourth quarter and full year 2015 earnings call. With me on the call today is Rick Clemmer, NXP's President and CEO; and our new CFO, Dan Durn. If you have not obtained a copy of our fourth quarter 2015's earnings press release, it can be found at our company website under the Investor Relations section at nxp.com. Additionally, we have posted on our Investor Relations website a supplemental earnings summary presentation and a document of our historical financials to assist you in your modeling efforts. This call is being recorded and will be available for replay on our corporate website. Our call today will include forward-looking statements that include risks and uncertainties that could cause NXP's results to differ materially from management's current expectation. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the macroeconomic impact on specific end markets in which we operate, the sale of new and existing products, and our expectations for financial results for the first quarter of 2016. Please be reminded that NXP undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements. For a full disclosure on forward-looking statements, please refer to our press release today. Additionally, during our call, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures which exclude the impact of purchase price accounting, restructuring, stock-based compensation, impairment, merger-related costs and other charges that are driven primarily by discrete events that management does not consider to be directly related to NXP's underlying core operating performance. Pursuant to Regulation G, NXP has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our fourth quarter 2015 earnings press release, which will be furnished to the SEC on Form 6-K and is available on NXP's website in the Investor Relations section. Before we begin the call, I have a few updates on our upcoming investor events. On March 1, we will be attending a Morgan Stanley TMT Conference in San Francisco. On March 16, we will be attending Barclays Emerging Payments Conference in New York City. And finally, on April 28, we'll be hosting our Analyst Day in New York City. We'll be opening an online registration site in a few weeks to enable for registration. I'd like to now pass the call to Rick.
Richard Lynn Clemmer - President, CEO & Executive Director: Thanks, Jeff. And welcome, everyone, to our earnings call today, a quite momentous event making a major milestone in our evolution as a company. As this is our fourth quarter and full year report, I will spend a few moments highlighting key aspects of our full-year results before moving on to the details of Q4. The end of 2015 brought to a close a year filled with significant accomplishments and a few challenges for NXP. During Q4, we successfully completed the merger with Freescale. The merger creates a powerhouse and positions NXP as the leader in multiple strategic markets. The company emerges as a clear market leader in the areas of automotive, microcontrollers, and security semiconductor solutions. As was required to achieve regulatory approval of the Freescale merger, we successfully completed the divestments of the legacy NXP-RF Power business. Additionally, we successfully completed creation of WeEn Semiconductors, our second joint venture in China. We continue to see China as an exciting long-term opportunity, and we will continue to take a creative approach about how to best take advantage of this. If we look at what both companies anticipated heading into Q4, we are pleased with the outcome of the quarter and feel positive about the opportunities ahead of us. We were very happy with our profit performance for the quarter. Both companies were in the expected range in revenue with Freescale slightly stronger and NXP slightly weaker from these respective midpoint guidances. However, the year was not without its challenges. During the second half of the year, similar to our peers, NXP faced an uncertain macro demand environment. As a result of the weakened demand environment, we fell short of our absolute full year revenue goals, but we continue to outperform the overall industry on a relative basis. While the overall demand environment in semiconductors is still not clear, we feel positive about the trends and opportunities we see in our combined business. While Dan will go into the specific financial details of 2015 and Q4, I see the following key accomplishments in our full year 2015 performance. First, we delivered strong revenue growth relative to the overall market. Full year 2015 revenue was $6.1 billion, up 8% from 2014, including a month of revenue contribution from Freescale. Within our strategic HPMS segment, revenue was $4.72 billion, up 12% year-on-year. In Secure Connected Devices, revenue was $1.26 billion, up nearly 23% year-on-year. And Auto revenue was $1.34 billion, up just over 17% versus the prior year. In the newly named Secure Interface & Infrastructure, revenue was $1.1 billion, up 10% year-on-year. And lastly, Secure Identification Solutions revenue was $973 million, slightly down year-on-year. Revenue from the Standard Products segment was $1.24 billion, down nearly 3% versus the prior year. Secondly, we continue to improve our overall profitability. On a full year basis, non-GAAP operating profit was approximately $1.68 billion, up about 19% versus the prior year, reflecting disciplined expense management and margin improvement. Even when factoring in the merger-related impacts to interest expense and diluted share count, we delivered strong full year EPS of $5.60, up 18% year-on-year. Lastly, customer reception to the merger has been outstanding. The original vision of being able to deliver broader, more complete solutions to our customers is being well-received. We continue to find areas where we can address a larger portion of our customer electronics system requirement. As just one example, at CES, a month after the merger closed, we introduced a postage stamp-sized radar solution combining NXP's RF CMOS radar front-end and a Freescale ADAS microcontroller. We've gotten very favorable customer feedback on this product, and we feel we are only beginning to scratch the surface of what we see could potentially be accomplished. Turning now to the specifics of Q4, revenue was $1.61 billion, up nearly 5% year-on-year and up just over 5% versus the prior quarter. Looking in our segment performance, HPMS revenue was $1.31 billion, up about 12% from a year ago as well as sequentially. Now, I'd like to review how we report the Freescale product groups within the NXP operating segment structure. Our Auto business will include the Freescale Auto MCU and the majority of Analog & Sensor product groups. Our Secure Connected Devices will include all of the Freescale general purpose MCU product group. We have renamed Secure Interface & Power, Secure Interface & Infrastructure, reflecting the inclusion of the Freescale Digital Networking in RF Power business groups. And there will be basically no change to Secure Identification Solutions. Standard Product segment revenue was $271 million, down 18% from the same period a year ago and just under 17% sequentially. Please note during the quarter, we completed the creation of the Bipolar joint venture and our Q4 results include only one month sales as the final two months were included within the joint venture results. Turning to our distribution channel performance, as we discussed in last quarter's call, we took specific actions to reduce inventory in the channel. In the quarter, our sales into distribution were down 22%. Our sales out of distribution were only down 5%. Corrective actions reduced channel inventory to 2.7 months of inventory. In summary, I believe NXP is ideally positioned at the right markets with the right customers in the leading portfolio of solutions. The merger will result in a significant improved cost structure and broaden our product portfolio which will provide a major catalyst for customer and shareholder value creation. Now, before I pass the call on to Dan, I just wanted to welcome Dan since this is his first earnings call at NXP as Dan joins us from Freescale, and we're really looking forward to his contribution going forward. I'd also like to take just a moment to thank Peter Kelly for all of his contribution to the evolution of NXP and the success that we've achieved today. So, thank you, Peter. Dan?
Daniel Durn - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP: Thank you, Rick, and good morning to everyone on today's call. Before I get into the specifics on Q4 and calendar 2015, I wanted to spend a few minutes highlighting the many accomplishments the NXP team has delivered the past several quarters. Despite the sales challenge in Q4 Rick mentioned, calendar 2015 marked another year of success. We delivered continued margin expansion and improved operating leverage, generating 18% EPS growth for the company. We continue to generate strong cash flow and $475 million of that cash was allocated to buying back shares. And we delivered these results in a macro environment that became more challenging as the year progressed. The year, of course, culminated with the successful completion of the merger with Freescale. The integration work leading up to the merger close was, in my opinion, world-class on the part of both companies. Day one was a major success across the globe, and we're off to a fast start as a new company. Rick, Peter and the rest of the team deserve all the credit for these successes. In particular, Peter's tireless efforts were instrumental in bringing the merger of NXP and Freescale to a successful conclusion. Peter has played a critical role in raising the bar and driving financial success of NXP over the last several years. I've known him for many years. He's been influential on my own personal evolution as the CFO, and I'm very happy he's going to remain with the company to help out our strategy and continue to provide his valuable insight and advice to the management team moving forward. Finally, I would personally like to thank all our stakeholders, our employees, customers and shareholders for their continued confidence in our company as we navigated to the last 12 months. Turning now to our performance in 2015, we delivered full year revenue of $6.1 billion, up 8% versus the prior year and continued to deliver growth above our peers. We managed our operating expenses efficiently, driving full year non-GAAP operating margin of 27.6%, an increase of 260 basis points over 2014. The excellent work and planning that both the NXP and Freescale integration teams delivered over the past year paid off. We have clarity on the key initiatives and are rapidly executing on the planned cost synergies. Lastly, even in light of the influences of the merger on the diluted share count, we delivered very good earnings growth with non-GAAP EPS of $5.60, up 17.6% year-on-year. Moving to the financial highlights for Q4. Please note that our published results today reflect a little less than one month of the financial contribution from Freescale. Given the many moving pieces, we don't plan to break out the individual performance of each company. Revenue in Q4 was $1.61 billion, up 5.5% sequentially. We generated $806 million in non-GAAP gross profit, and reported a non-GAAP gross profit margin of 50.2%. Looking at the operating segments, within the HPMS segment, revenue was $1.31 billion, up 12.2% over the previous quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was 54.6%, 60 basis points above the third quarter due to a richer mix. HPMS non-GAAP operating margin was 29.2%, a decline of 270 basis points sequentially as we saw a 28% sequential increase on a dollar basis of non-GAAP operating expenses due to the merger. Within our Standard Product segment, revenue was $271 million, down 16.6% versus Q3. Non-GAAP gross margin was 35.8%, a 40-basis-point improvement versus the third quarter. Standard Product non-GAAP operating margin was 23.6%, a 100-basis-point sequential decline due to fall through on lower revenue. Operating expenses were essentially flat quarter-on-quarter. Total non-GAAP operating profit in Q4 was $433 million, and represented a 27% non-GAAP operating margin. Interest expense was $56 million, with cash taxes of $19 million, and non-controlling interest was $17 million. Taken together, this resulted in a total non-GAAP net income of $341 million for the company, a 10.3% sequential decline due to the combination of the higher HPMS operating expenses, increased interest expense and cash taxes. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.25, down $0.32 from Q3 due to the previously mentioned items, as well as a higher diluted share count. Stock-based compensation, which is not included in our non-GAAP earnings, was $111 million. Now, I'd like to turn to our balance sheet. Total debt at the end of Q4 was $9.2 billion, with a cash balance of $1.6 billion resulting in net debt of $7.6 billion. During the quarter, we raised capital through the issuance of a $2.7 billion five-year term loan at an interest rate of 3.75%. Additionally, we successfully completed the sale of NXP's legacy RF Power business and the creation of a Bipolar joint venture called WeEn Semiconductor. We used the net proceeds from these actions, plus the combined cash on hand to finance the cash component of the merger and to refinance certain tranches of Freescale's existing debt. We're on a very solid position with respect to our debt loans, with our current weighted average cost of debt of 3.91%. We exited the quarter with a trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.96 billion. Our ratio of net debt-to-trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA at the end of Q4 was 3.88 times, and our non-GAAP interest coverage in the quarter was 7.7 times. Both of these ratios reflect only one month contribution of Freescale profitability. During the quarter, we bought back 1.8 million shares at a cost of approximately $151 million, or a weighted cost of about $83.03 per share. Our total share repurchase during 2015 were approximately 5.3 million shares for a total cost of just over $474 million, or an average cost of $88.93 per share. Turning to our working capital metrics, days of inventory were 101 days, receivables were 37 days, and our payables were 71 days. Taken together, our cash conversion cycle is 67 days. These non-GAAP measures take into account the effect of merger accounting. Cash flow from operations was $271 million and net CapEx was $91 million, resulting in non-GAAP free cash flow of $180 million. Now, I'd like to provide our outlook for Q1. As Rick noted in his prepared remarks, we believe we are operating in an uncertain demand environment, which began to materialize in the second half of 2015. We took specific actions when we provided guidance for Q4, aiming to align our channel inventory to a weaker-than-anticipated demand environment. While we have some more work to do on rationalizing our channel inventory, we are making progress. With this as a background, we currently anticipate Q1 revenue will be in the range of $2.15 billion to $2.27 billion, reflecting the first full quarter combination of the two companies. At the midpoint, we expect revenue to be about $2.21 billion in Q1. Within our HPMS segment, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.84 billion to $1.95 billion. Due to the combination, we will provide high and low revenue estimates for the operating segments. Next quarter we will return to our normal percentage approach to guidance. Auto is expected to be in the range of $790 million to $810 million. Secure Identification Solutions is expected to be in the range of $215 million to $230 million. Secure Connected Devices is expected to be in the range of $440 million to $480 million. Secure Interface and Infrastructure is expected to be in the range of $395 million to $430 million. Standard Products is expected to be in the range of $275 million to $285 million. We anticipate revenue for manufacturing, corporate and other to be approximately $36 million plus or minus $2 million. At the midpoint, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be 49.5%. We expect a slightly more favorable revenue mix though modestly offset by full quarter effect of the merger and the impact of annual price adjustments. At the midpoint, operating expenses are expected to be about $585 million. This translates into a non-GAAP operating margin of 23%, plus or minus 50 basis points. Interest expense will be approximately $95 million with the increase due to the higher gross debt balance. Cash taxes are expected to be roughly $16 million. Non-controlling interest should be about $10 million. Stock-based compensation should be about $92 million which is excluded from our guidance. Diluted share count is assumed to be 354 million but could be different depending on share price fluctuations and stock buybacks. Taken together, this translates into a non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $1.05 to $1.15 or $1.10 per share at the midpoint of our guidance. To assist in part with your full year modeling efforts, we anticipate full year net interest expense to be about $380 million. Full year cash taxes to be about $80 million and a normal quarterly run rate on stock-based comp of just under $85 million per quarter. We will provide an updated financial model at our April 28 Analyst Day. So, in summary, calendar 2015 was a year of solid achievement for NXP. We grew the top line and managed our cost structure to deliver strong earnings growth and cash flow generation. The NXP-Freescale combination brought together two great companies whose best days lie ahead. We become an automotive, MCU, security and networking powerhouse with significant scale and the ability to deliver strong earnings growth in the years ahead. I'm excited to be a part of this team and look forward to communicating with each of you as we work to unleash the potential of this great combination. Now, I'd like to turn it back to the operator for your questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yeah. Good morning, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question and congratulations on the strong full year results. I guess, Rick, my first question is just around your growth rate in the December and March quarter relative to peers. And I understand there's a lot of M&A divestiture messiness which makes apple-to-apple compares difficult. And I've got to make some assumptions here. But as we run through and try to come up with apples-to-apples, it does look like December and March are going to be down both double digits year-over-year for you, which is a little bit worse than the peer groups. To what extent is that just the issue with the distribution channel? And it sounds like you're going to under ship the distribution again in the March quarter or is there other things going on? And I guess importantly, when would you expect your relative growth rate to return to what's been more a normal of outperformance?
Richard Lynn Clemmer - President, CEO & Executive Director: Well, John, I think, first off, I don't think you can look at growth rates on a quarterly basis. I think you really have to look at that over a more sustained basis. If we look at annually, I think it's very clear that NXP continue to outperform our peers in 2015. And we feel confident we'll continue to outperform the industry in 2016. If you look at it quarter by quarter, clearly, Q4 and Q1 are messy as we bring the two companies together. I think we were pretty clear that when we went through the combination that we felt very good about the possibility for Q4 results. I think when you look at our revenue versus the guidance and versus the range that both companies had published last quarter, NXP was probably a little bit light of the midpoint, while Freescale was a little bit stronger than the midpoint. Frankly, it doesn't matter at this point in time. We have one company brought together to be able to address our customer solution requirement. We feel like we'll continue to outperform the industry going forward.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Rick, embedded in your March revenue guide, is it still an assumption that you'll be under-shipping the distribution channel. Sell-in will be down lower than sell-through?
Richard Lynn Clemmer - President, CEO & Executive Director: John, you know in the semiconductor industry, you're doing good just to get close to a range. I'll try to give you the details behind that relative to what goes into disti and what goes otherwise is probably a bridge too far. I think what we have to do is be sure that we manage the distribution and inventory correctly. We think we're down in the range of the level of inventory that we'd like our partners to have because that's recently paid in that margin, is to be sure they have the inventory there to be able to serve the market. At 2.7 months, we feel good about that even though it's a little bit higher than where we would have been on an NXP-RF-Freescale basis from a historic view point. But we actually feel like that's more in line with the range that we need to be in. We clearly have some pockets that are slightly above where we would like for those to be. And one of them that we talked about last time was the aftermarket car radio market primarily in Asia and China. And I talked about that business and I think I talked about it not as clear as I should have, and that business is around a fourth to a third from a buy-in viewpoint of our car infotainment which again was half of the old NXP's Automotive business. And if you look at it from a dollar basis, it was more like high-single digits to low-double digits, but from a volume viewpoint, it's a fourth to a third of the volume associated with it. So, there, clearly, in that case, our inventory, we were able to bring it down some in the Q4 timeframe, but it's still above the level we'd like for it to be. That business, we definitely saw some improvement associated with it, but we have to get back to a steady state run rate basis. But that's all the moving pieces and details that we really can't get in to projecting the details of those, John. It's more about giving you guidance relative to what we see in total and continuing to outperform the industry.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): That's helpful. And then maybe for my follow-up to Dan, Dan, just on the OpEx side, Dan, the compares are difficult because of the M&A, but if I look at it sort of a pro forma revenue and OpEx run rate for these combined NXP-Freescale in the September quarter and then look at what you're guiding to for March, it does seem that that revenue is down a lot more from that compare than the OpEx is. Can you help me understand if there's any period cost that are coming in to OpEx in the March quarter? And I guess, more importantly, can you help me understand the cadence at which you can start to realize some of the M&A synergies that you guys have talked about on the OpEx line as we go throughout 2016?
Daniel Durn - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP: Yeah. Thanks, John. I think I'd just start by saying both of the respective companies that comprise NXP today, I think, have great track records in terms of cost discipline and driving an efficient cost structure. As we take a look at any given quarter, there's going to be lumpiness. For instance, there's going to be mass costs that come into play some quarters and not in others. Transitioning into Q1, we always know there's headwinds as it relates to things like social security tax. So, there's a number of moving pieces that create issues like that. We also know that revenue falls off faster than cost compressed, and so they don't scale linearly with revenue. What I will say is, given the track record both companies have, we are 100% focused on driving efficient cost structure, driving cost discipline into the business. We're making good progress. And from a full year synergy target standpoint, I think we've been clear, we're going to talk about it on full year basis and not get into the details of how it profiles. But we're off to a good start and we're very confident with where going to land this company in 2016 with respect to the $200 million of synergy targets.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a few questions. I guess I wanted to focus on the biggest end market that you have, which is the Automotive side. Lots of concern outside of the semiconductor industry about that peaking from a SAAR perspective. So, in general, can you just talk about what you are seeing from a demand perspective in Automotive? And then if, in fact, SAAR is rolling over, what are the items that you think that NXP has to offset that with content gains?
Richard Lynn Clemmer - President, CEO & Executive Director: Yeah. Thanks, Ross. So, I guess, what we see is we continue to see strong demand in the segment from both the U.S. and Northern European manufacturers. We think that's really fundamental to the growth. The best thing that we can see for 2016 is we still expect a 2% or 3% SAAR growth. So we don't see it going up, clipping up significantly. We don't see it falling off. Demand in Europe continues to be solid. The demand in the U.S. continues to set records as of the recent input. And then in China where we had seen the fall-off kind of in the follow-up last year with some of the government tax incentives, we've seen the smaller car production move back up associated with that. So, I think that's kind of the fundamentals that we see relative to the industry with the discussion about what the implications are if SAARs did not grow. I think the key for us is really our opportunity to focus on the emerging area in ADAS, or assisted driving, because I don't know that it's going to really be pure automated driving near term, but assisted driving, making driving safer and then making it more secure by providing the enhanced security for the car. With the security capability that NXP's had historically, and the real product portfolio that we have on a combined basis, we're really in an excellent position to be able to provide security to the car manufacturers and provide a complete secure car. And we see a lot of interest in that area especially off of the car hacking that took place several months ago with the car industry and all of the car companies much more interested in that. When you look at the opportunity about assisted driving, the position we have and the product we announced at CES with the technology from the combined company, the Freescale microcontroller combined with the legacy NXP-RF CMOS front end – radar front end really puts us in a leadership position to be able to address that with the vehicle-to-vehicle design wins that we've talked about, with the first one ramping later this year for the 2017 model year through Delphi. And we've won a number of other design wins on vehicle-to-vehicle, the strong radar position that Freescale's had historically combined with the new solution that we talked about coming from CES. In addition, products that Freescale had developed in the past that we can take forward, we think, puts us in a leadership position to really be able to address the fastest-growing segment of automotive market which will be in the assisted or automated driving area. So, our position there will clearly put us in a different position than just the typical automotive semiconductor shipments. And when you look at that combined with the security basis, I think that's pretty clear that we should be in a position to outperform just the overall semiconductor automotive market.
Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: That's very helpful. I guess for my follow-up, if I could switch over to Dan. You gave the leverage ratios, but clearly those were with only the stub from the Freescale side. Could you give us an update on kind of an adjusted basis where the leverage ratios are now? And then probably more importantly, looking forward, give us an update on the target to get down to that 2 times leverage ratio? And then after that fact, how much cash does the company plan to hold before returning it to shareholders?
Daniel Durn - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP: Thanks, Ross. So, from a leverage standpoint, you rightfully point out that the numerator includes all of the debt. The denominator includes partial credit from a profitability standpoint. And I think where the expectations were set pre-close from a leverage ratio standpoint. We're very close to that in terms of where we sit today around 2.7 from a net-debt-to-EBITDA perspective. In terms of the long-term targets, I think it'll be premature to get out in front of the Analyst Day. We'll come back with more specific guidance of how we see those ratios trending over time and make smart choices with our capital structure with respect to debt and equity.
Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein Research. Your line is now open.
Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I know you only want to talk about the synergy, I guess, on an annual basis at this point, and you don't want to give a trajectory, but I was wondering if you could give us a little more transparency in terms of how much of the cost synergies are actually embedded in the Q1 guidance, at least to give us a starting point.
Daniel Durn - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP: Yeah. So, I think what you're asking fundamentally at the core of that question is to do what we said we wouldn't do, which is begin to parse out the profile of synergy capture throughout the year. And so, again, I would stick with my comments that we feel confident about where we're going in terms of overall synergy capture for the year. And we feel like we're off to a really good start in that.
Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: I'm not asking you to try to parse anything. I am trying to get a feeling for our starting point because otherwise it's very difficult to do the comparison to actually know what you are capturing and what you are not. So, is it possible you could give us just a little bit more color on just Q1, like how much is in there?
Jeff Palmer - Vice President-Investor Relations: Yeah. Hey, Stacy, it's Jeff. I think as Dan mentioned, I don't think we're going to parse out where the starting point is on the synergies as Dan has prepared – at beginning of his prepared remarks said we feel very good that we've identified these synergies. The teams are off to a fast start monetizing those synergies. But, look, as the company continues to grow and do very well, we will invest in the business. But the synergies are very identified, and we're not going to break them out on a quarter-by-quarter basis. So I understand the question.
Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay, thank you. If I can follow up, I want to ask about your inventory levels, your internal inventories. If I look at the Q4 combined level on the balance sheet, it's about $360 million higher than NXP and Freescale together were in Q3, but your cash flow statement actually shows an inventory decrease. So, is there some accounting or something else going on? What's actually going on with the inventories in Q4? Why did they go up on the balance sheet and what are your plans for your inventories going forward?
Daniel Durn - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP: Yeah. Thanks, Stacy. As you know, in any merger, purchase price accounting has a lot of moving pieces, but I would suggest on this rather than getting into the nuance of the movements one way or another. We take it as an action item to follow up with you, walk you through the full detail from a purchase price accounting standpoint and go into the detail as granular as you'd like with respect to this.
Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Did actual physical inventories go up or down then? Because the cash flow statement shows a decline. Did they go down?
Jeff Palmer - Vice President-Investor Relations: I think, Stacy, what's difficult, as Dan mentioned, is given purchase price accounting, there are a lot of movements. So, what I'd like to do is maybe when you and I have a call back later on today, we go through the details of that.
Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Fine. And if I could just follow up really quickly, which parts of Freescale were stronger than expected and which parts of NXP were weaker?
Jeff Palmer - Vice President-Investor Relations: We're not going to go to that level of granularity. The question is completely obvious. But what Rick said is we're a single company going forward. We're very excited about the two companies together. In the last quarter, NXP was slightly weaker against our guidance, Freescale a little bit better against their guidance, the midpoints, but we're not going to parse them down to the individual level because it's just – it's apples and oranges. Quite honestly, we only had one month stub of Freescale, full quarter of NXP. I don't think we're going to be able to go there for you.
Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: All right. I guess, I'm 0 for 3, then. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vivek Arya of BofA Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you for taking my question. I know that you're still working out the base of cost synergies, but just conceptually do you think there is a way to accelerate them given the demand environment is very different than when you announced the acquisition? So, I think when you announced the acquisition, you mentioned $200 million of synergies in the first year and then $500 million longer term, but the demand environment is very different. So, just conceptually, is there a way to accelerate the cost synergies? And more importantly, given that you are not providing cost synergy on a quarterly basis, what is the right way to measure NXP? Is it an operating margin number that we should be tracking instead of a specific cost synergy?
Daniel Durn - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP: Yes. So a couple points. I want to disaggregate the cost synergies from just driving a disciplined business as the cycle fluctuates up and down. So if we talk about synergies, the company is driving hard to capture the $200 million. Feel very confident that we'll actually probably exceed that. But let's stick with the $200 million target. On the April 28 Analyst Day, we will provide margin guidance to the community which shows progression over time and it'll reflect the capture of those synergies. With respect to how we operate the business, given the fluctuations up and down in the cycle and the discipline with which we do that, they're not related to the synergies. And so, accelerating the synergies because of the ups and down movements of the cycle, we're just going to run a disciplined business and position ourselves for success going forward. I think we have appropriately aggressive targets with respect to synergy capture, and we're going to stay disciplined in terms of executing to the plan we have in place. On top of that, depending on what we see from a macro environment standpoint and a specific industry perspective, we will operate and manage the business in a way to drive value for shareholders.
Richard Lynn Clemmer - President, CEO & Executive Director: Vivek, if I could just add one thing to that. I think if you actually look at the performance of the legacy NXP business and the legacy Freescale business, we both took actions with the environment in the previous few quarters as we saw the pending merger. And so, if you look at the OpEx levels that we had through that period of time, they were really leading edge associated with it. As we move forward, clearly, we're going to invest at appropriate levels to be sure we grow the business, but we'll modulate that based on the environment that we see. So, I think the best way to describe it is we'll come back to you with Analyst Day more on a percent basis because, again, we plan on continuing to invest in growing this business and ensuring that we continue to outgrow the market going forward.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. Thanks, Rick. Dan, very helpful. And as my follow-up, so I think the automotive part of the story is clear. It's very interesting. But traditionally, Rick, you've had other strong secular growth opportunities, whether it was in banking cards and mobile wallet or other areas. Can you just give us just conceptually how those opportunities look going forward, so just something beyond autos that you are excited about as you look at the rest of the year?
Richard Lynn Clemmer - President, CEO & Executive Director: So, we talked about the combination of the two companies really positions us quite well on connected devices, and actually if you're more complete in that connected devices than the infrastructure to support that with connected devices. So, a lot of people called that the Internet of Things and talk about opportunity. You can read all over the place, from 25 billion to 30 billion items by 2020 to as many as 50 billion items by 2020. So, clearly, bringing the strength of both companies together positions us extremely well to be able to participate in that high-growth market between now and 2020. When you think about the overall semiconductor demand outside of automotive, we think that the high-end smartphones business is not going to have the same growth it has historically. We think we're getting to levels that are not going to have the same kind of growth. The interesting thing that we have is, is that the deployment of the mobile wallet in smartphone is still at a relatively low level in total. And with the implementation of Apple Pay, which I understand is going to be implemented in a few months in China, we think that the rest of the market that's supplying the market besides iPhone will have to have an equivalent product to be able to be competitive with the iPhone solutions in China. So, we're very excited about the opportunity there that's moved out over a period of time from what we would've originally anticipated, but we still see the opportunity to be significant. But even above that, what we're really trying to do to accelerate that growth is working with the transit authorities in China. We're working with the 10 largest cities in China, throw out a solution using a smartphone as really the approach for our ticketing to accelerate the boarding of the transit systems and improve the convenience, while maintaining the security associated with it. So, we see that as a significant opportunity. The position that we have with the combined microcontroller business and the ability to drive to i.MX are significant opportunities that we think we're well-positioned to be able to address in the market. And when you look at the near-term, we see some sign of life with the base station market in China actually driving some near-term improvements associated with it, although the sustainability of that over an intermediate period of time is probably questionable based on the logistical approach that we've seen all the base station customers look at. So, we see a number of growth areas in the near-term that will create growth in the new NXP going forward, and are quite excited about the opportunity to participate in those and continue to feel comfortable that we'll exceed the growth of the overall semiconductor industry as we've consistently been able to deliver.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Hettenbach of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yes, thank you. First, just a question on the strength in gross margins in the quarter and outlook, if you could just talk to some of the maybe elements of mix. And then also I know for Freescale there were initiatives to drive gross margins up with new products in manufacturing; if there is any update on that, please.
Daniel Durn - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP: Absolutely. So, in any given quarter, you're going to have puts and takes and you're going to have some businesses performing stronger, others performing weaker. And as we aggregate that performance in Q4, we get the type of margins we're talking about. What I would say, though, is the last 10 months, last year of merger integration planning and being able to get out of the box strong and having the operations team that has a standard set of metrics in place, factories are aligned to a consistent set of goals. Technology roadmaps are integrated and locked in place. We've got a number of pieces in place that allow us to nimbly manage the infrastructure based on the environment we find ourselves in to produce the results that we saw in Q4. So, it's as much a mix as it is the way in which the teams are coming together and aggressively managing in the tough environment. As we roll forward to Q1, again, there's going to be puts and takes. First quarter as a combined company out of the box. We want to be disciplined and appropriate from a guide standpoint. But with Q1, it's typically a difficult quarter because annual price negotiations that we have with our customers start to get layered in, in Q1. And then over the course of the year, we continue to grind out the cost and efficiency of the operating assets to get the gross margin in line. So, typically, Q1 is a little bit of a headwind for us but we're aggressively managing it and looking to mitigate those impacts as much as possible as we deliver Q1 results.
Richard Lynn Clemmer - President, CEO & Executive Director: Craig, we do appreciate that you picked up on the – joining the 50-plus club going forward. We are very pleased with the accomplishment of now moving into the 50-plus category on the gross margin, although we continue to believe the thing that's really important is the operating income level, which is what's going to drive the overall cash flow of the business. But I think the important thing that we have is with the base that we've established already of 50-plus. And as we've talked about, probably roughly 20% of the synergies coming in the form of cost of goods gives us a really good solid basis to be able to continue to see our gross margins expand going forward.
Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Thanks for that. And then just as follow-up, Rick, you talked about positive feedback from customers for the combined company. Specifically within Automotive, what are you hearing just from the product portfolio and breadth? And are there opportunities where you were strong with certain OEMs and you can pull Freescale in and vice versa?
Richard Lynn Clemmer - President, CEO & Executive Director: Yeah. I think the relationship of both companies is being quite strong, although it's different by different customers. I think when you look at it on a combined basis, we cover all of the major Tier 1s associated with strong relationships. As we've met with the leadership of all of those companies, they've been quite pleased and excited about the opportunity. We had a number of customers that actually engaged with both companies in an agreement before the close of the transaction through an improved process so that when you work together on a solution, bringing the technology of legacy Freescale and legacy NXP together to be able to drive a solution which has really been exciting for our customers, when you actually look at – on the car infotainment side where legacy NXP basically owns the audio side of the car radio market, we think there is – the feedback from our customers is that if we can drive the apps processor before we'll bring kind of a complete solution to them, kind of a radio in a box that they can then work on areas where they can work on fidelity and sound quality that's beyond just the electronics itself. They continue to be very excited. So, we had a very successful CES show where we had significant participation and a lot of excitement through the combination of the products and actually saw the Secretary for the Department of Transportation who came to cheer specifically the demos that we have associated with ADAS and assisted driving and the implications that it might have in making driving safer with this concern, specifically in the U.S., but obviously for around the world. So, we think that we can play a significant role in making driving safer and more secure. And we've had nothing but extremely positive feedback from all the customers that we've engaged with.
Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks.
Richard Lynn Clemmer - President, CEO & Executive Director: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi, thank you. Good morning. Rick, I had a question on the distribution and the channel inventory that had built up last quarter, which had led to the disappointment. You had mentioned that you were going to address that and good to see that the levels have come down. But what specific or mechanical actions have you taken to ensure that this kind of disruption does not occur in the future, given that now you're a much bigger company with the combined assets of Freescale?
Richard Lynn Clemmer - President, CEO & Executive Director: Well, we've definitely taken actions relative to legacy NXP basis where we had some of our Asian distis that were providing us information on a monthly basis, considerable weekly basis that we've now corrected and have that information flow in on a weekly basis so we can do a much more complete and thorough analysis of the inventory levels on a more real-time basis than what we're able to do in the past. We also made some organizational changes to be sure that we have the detailed analysis to be able to support that. So, I think we've taken some of the right steps. We have more to do as we go forward to be sure that we drive that, but really the key is shipping a lot less in. So, we reduced the shipments into the distribution channel by 22% in the quarter on a combined basis while the shipments out of distis was only down 5%. So, I think we took proactive measure as we really saw that inventory grow to be able to adjust that on a pretty real-time basis although, clearly, we've got caught in on the quarter end in Q3 where we had to take the actions in Q4 to actually get back to the sustainable level or a level that we felt comfortable with. But I think we've taken the actions. We've taken appropriate actions. It's been a high priority for us in the last few months to be sure that we do that. And Dan's put some people on specifically to be sure that we're looking at it in a different fashion, a more thorough fashion. And we've been able to work with our distribution partners to be sure that we get that information on a more consistent basis as well.
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Very good. And a quick follow-up is last quarter also, and I know it's a smaller piece of the business that aftermarket in China had ballooned up a lot. Has that normalized on a combined basis? I'm sure it's less than 1% now but that was an area that had caused disruption. Thank you.
Richard Lynn Clemmer - President, CEO & Executive Director: So, I think we've talked about that earlier. But if you look at that, we still have inventory levels that are higher than what we would like in the car radio aftermarket. We made some progress in the Q4 levels that we would anticipate not getting down to the absolute level that we'd like to be at for at least another quarter. I think we have seen the market improve somewhat which is good in the car radio aftermarket. And maybe you didn't catch it earlier when we talked about that from last earnings call where we said a fourth to third of the car infotainment market was in the car radio aftermarket, that was really in terms of quantity, not in terms of dollars. When you actually take it into dollars, it's more like high-single to low-double-digit percent of the car infotainment market which would put it at half that from a (53:11) legacy NXP basis and on a combined NXP and Freescale basis at even much more reduced, so it would be roughly a fourth or so of that level. So, it's not really significant or material in the combination of the two companies, but the inventory level is not the level that we'd like for it to be on a consistent basis. And we still have actions underway to get that down to the appropriate level.
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you, Rick, for clarifying again.
Richard Lynn Clemmer - President, CEO & Executive Director: Great. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Blayne Curtis of Barclays. Your line is now open.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. Dan, on the interest guidance it seems flat quarterly. I was just trying to understand the decision. You did buy back some stock in the quarter, just the decision between de-levering or buying back stock. And is that guidance for the year reflective of your thought of what you would do or are you leaving that for when you do it?
Daniel Durn - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP: Yeah. So, a couple of things on that, Blayne. First, we're straight-lining interest expense throughout the year. We'll come back on April 28, talk about long-term capital structure, target ratios, those types of things and still get a little bit more granular in terms of the puts and takes and how that profile is not only for the balance of the year, but looking into subsequent years with respect to near-term decisions on the capital structure. But we're going to make smart choices about how we deploy the strong cash flow profile of this company and do smart things. But on April 28, we'll spend more time talking about what that looks like longer-term.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. And then I just wanted to follow up on a previous comment or a question on gross margin. Obviously, you had upside there. What specific products or segments drove that mix that you referenced to the upside? And then if you could just talk about – a similar other question – as a starting place usually the gross margin synergies happen later. Is it accurate to think this is your starting point and you can add those synergies on top of this?
Daniel Durn - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP: Yeah. So, from a timing standpoint, look, we understand the power in the gross margin. If we really want to invest for future growth in this business, every ounce of efficiency we drive into the operating assets, every ounce of efficiency we drive from an SG&A standpoint, allows us to invest in a way that will drive future growth. So, we understand the importance of the bookends for the R&D line from a synergy standpoint, and we're not wasting any time driving really, really hard and getting a fast start. And I think you see some of the evidence of that in the current quarter, and you'll see that profile over 2016. And I think Rick went into detail on the businesses where we are seeing some signs of strength and certain areas that were showing some signs of weakness. And I would hesitate to go into more granular detail than what he's sort of offered at the highest level now between the different operating segments.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks, Dan.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from C.J. Muse of Evercore. Your line is now open.
C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI: Yeah. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I guess, first question, Rick, in terms of your outlook for SCD, and I know you don't want to go out beyond a quarter, but curious if you can just talk at a high level, given the slowdown we're seeing in premium phones, how UnionPay agreement with Apple will start to flow through and whether or not the confidence you have in terms of growth for that segment this year.
Richard Lynn Clemmer - President, CEO & Executive Director: Well, C.J., thanks. I think the key is basically what I talked about earlier. So, while we believe that Apple Pay deployment in China and not, by the way, just China, but I think they announced four or five countries that they're deploying Apple Pay too in a very near-term basis. I think that's going to change the landscape for all of the China Inc. high-end smartphones where they're going to have to have an equivalent capability to Apple Pay to be able to capture their share of the market. So, I think that's really the important facet, but the thing I also mentioned was that if we've actually taken steps to accelerate that. We're working with the transit authorities in China in the 10 largest cities actually implementing the transit ticketing capability on the smartphones, which is extremely convenient in accelerating the boarding of the mass transit systems and the ability to make it much more convenient as well as secure for the users. So, we see that opportunity being one of the significant contributors to that. We also have in that segment the microcontroller business and we can plan to continue to see strong growth there based on the design wins we have and be a significant contributor as well. So, with the combination of both of those areas that we think gives us the ability to see that growth going forward and allows us to feel comfortable about the opportunity to significantly outgrow the overall market.
C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI: That's very helpful. And then I guess, if I could follow up, Dan, and I know you're hesitant to talk about standalone Freescale. It's now one combined company. But Freescale gross margin uplift was clearly a part of the old story and now a part of the combined story. So, curious how we should think about the uplift there and what are the key milestones we should be looking at?
Daniel Durn - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP: Thanks. I think if we rewind the clock a year and we look at a similar quarter from a year ago and what was communicated in terms of the long-term approach Freescale was going to take to drive gross margins, I don't think anything changes there. What I would say is use that as the starting point. We're very confident in what we laid out a year ago. We still see the same opportunities in front of us. And on April 28 we'll spend a little more time talking about what that means inside of the combined company and how we drive that gross margin profile on a go-forward basis.
Richard Lynn Clemmer - President, CEO & Executive Director: C.J., we still believe that the important thing is the operating income percent and not gross margin percent. But at the same token, we finally have gotten to the point where we can join that 50-plus club and are very pleased with the opportunity to continue to move forward from where we are.
C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI: Very good. Thank you.
Jeff Palmer - Vice President-Investor Relations: Operator, we'll take one last question here today, please?
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Will Stein of SunTrust. Your line is now open.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hi. Thank you for squeezing me in. I have a question about the integration and maybe the cultural aspect of it. When I think about the two companies historically, I think there is two big differences I think of, and one is the very centralized around Austin culture that was in place at Freescale versus the much more decentralized one at NXP. And the other is NXP's historical very clear focus on achieving 1.5 times RMS. It's difficult for Freescale business, especially given the big microcontroller focus. I'm wondering as – and I'm sure you'll elaborate on this at the Analyst Day but initial impressions as to how the cultural integration is working from both of those perspectives would be helpful.
Richard Lynn Clemmer - President, CEO & Executive Director: So, thanks, Will. I think it's really important to understand that we still maintain that true leadership is the only way to managing the semiconductor business. So, you'll see the combined business be very focused on at least the one-and-a-half times RMS on the areas that we're investing in. And we'll clearly drive a focus on our investment to be sure that we're doubling down in those areas where we can do that and we're cutting back in the areas where we don't have that same opportunity. So that is one of the culture fundamentals of the combined company that we believe will be important in contributing shareholder value for us. As far as the management styles, I think you've been a little kind on us. I mean, the historic NXP management style, I would tell you, is more about a nomadic management style, while clearly Greg and the team were very fortunate to primarily be in Austin with kind of a hub-and-spoke management style. So, I think that's clearly an adjustment that we're going through. We've seen nothing but cooperation from the Freescale managers that are joining. I think Dan has already gotten his housing taken care of in Eindhoven. So we'll still be headquartered in the Netherlands associated with it. But our management style requires very much of a nomadic basis. And unfortunately, that's really a burden that we put on our managers, but we think being close to the customers and close to the employees around the world is really the best way to drive the success, and we'll expect to continue to see that going forward. We had seen that be well received on the Freescale side. It requires more discipline relative to communication, so that you have to schedule time for video conferences and conference calls to be able to maintain communication. But it's an approach that we have found to have worked well so far and we see no reason it won't continue to work well going forward.
Daniel Durn - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP: And just to add a little bit to what Rick said, if I may. We made a decision – well, first of all, I'm glad you're asking about culture. Based on my prior experience, culture is one of those key elements to successful integration. And you got to get it right if you want to drive the value from the industrial logic that ultimately created what we're creating here. We made a decision a while ago that as soon as we close this transaction, there's no more us versus them or us and them. It is just we. It drives a philosophical approach to address the issue that you are raising right now. And we've made surprisingly good progress early, early on in melding these two cultures, and getting everybody focused on our customers' requirements and success in the marketplace. I couldn't be happier with the cultural integration progress we're making, but the approach we're taking really at the core of that is a philosophical belief on the importance of mending our – blending these cultures on a go-forward basis. And so, I know there's unsatisfied questions out there on unpacking the results in former Freescale, former NXP, but it really is consistent with our philosophical approach, and the importance we place on blending these cultures that we no longer have them and us, literally day one. And we drive this into our own company on a day-to-day basis. It is we, and that's a bit of what's driving the philosophical approach to some of those questions.
Richard Lynn Clemmer - President, CEO & Executive Director: Will, did you have a follow-up you wanted to address today?
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: I guess I will try an end markets question. I am not sure if this is on or off limits, but it looks – relative to my expectations anyway when I glued the two models together, it looks like the Q1 outlook is quite a bit stronger in Automotive and the Secure Interface and Infrastructure segments. And I'm wondering if you might comment as to whether management feels the same way (65:07) that those two end market groups are doing better. And then perhaps any detail as to product categories one layer below in terms of strengths and weaknesses. It seems like those are the longer cycle end markets, which is encouraging, and I wonder if I have that right.
Richard Lynn Clemmer - President, CEO & Executive Director: I think you're – I mean, that's very observant, Will. I think when you look at it, the Automotive strength in the guidance for Q1 clearly is there and we've seen a real strong uptick from our customers in both legacy sides of the house associated with that. So, it's not any one side or the other. We see a very strong position in Automotive across the board. When you talk about the interface and the infrastructure, a significant share of that comes from – of the outlook comes from an improvement in the RF Power business in the near-term. Now, how sustainable that is over the long-term, I think that we've proven that the logistics capability of our base station customers is not world-class. But the bottom line is for the near term, we see an improvement, we see requirements, and so that definitely contributes to the Q1 outlook that we laid out. And clearly, everyone knows that the smartphone market is much weaker than what it's been and continues to be reflected in our outlook as well.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Great. Thanks and congratulations.
Richard Lynn Clemmer - President, CEO & Executive Director: Thanks a lot, Will. We appreciate it.
Richard Lynn Clemmer - President, CEO & Executive Director: So, in closing, I guess we'd like to share with you four key messages. Integration of the two companies is on track. We see even more opportunity on the product side than we had originally anticipated, and our customer reaction to the combination has been enthusiastic. NXP becomes more diversified in terms of product, customers, end markets and geographic exposure. The merger will substantially enhance our margin profile due to the ongoing operational improvements combined with the cost synergy. Finally, the cash generation capability of the combined company is very significant even in the challenging environment as we demonstrated the capability in our Q4 results and become even more so as we move forward with the benefit from the combination. Thank you very much for your interest and support.
Jeff Palmer - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thank you, everyone. This will end the call today.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today's conference. This concludes the call. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a nice day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2015 NXP Semiconductors Earnings Conference Call. My name is Candice and I'm your operator for today. As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes. Now, I would like to hand it over to Mr. Jeff Palmer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.
Jeff Palmer - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thank you, Candice, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the NXP Semiconductors Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. With me on the call today is Rick Clemmer, NXP's President and CEO; and Peter Kelly, NXP's CFO. If you've not obtained a copy of our third quarter 2015 earnings release, it can be found at our company website under the Investor Relations section at nxp.com. Additionally, we have posted on our Investor Relations website a supplemental earnings summary presentation and a document of our historical financials to assist you in your modeling efforts. This call is being recorded and will be available for replay from our corporate website. Our call today will include forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties that could cause NXP's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the macroeconomic impact on specific end-markets in which we operate, the sale of new and existing products, and our expectations for financial results for the fourth quarter of 2015. Please be reminded that NXP undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements. For a full disclosure on forward-looking statements, please refer to our press release. Additionally, during our call today, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures which exclude the impact of purchase price accounting, restructuring, stock-based compensation, impairment and other charges that are driven primarily by discrete events that management does not consider to be directly related to NXP's underlying core operating performance. Pursuant to Regulation G, NXP has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our third quarter 2015 earnings press release, which will be furnished to the SEC on Form 6-K and is available on NXP's website in the Investor Relations section at nxp.com. I would now like to turn the call over to Rick.
Richard Lynn Clemmer - President, CEO & Executive Director: Thanks, Jeff, and thank each of you for joining us on our earnings call today. Our profitability in third quarter was very strong with non-GAAP operating margin of nearly 30% and we delivered total revenues of $1.52 billion. Revenue was approximately flat versus the same period in the prior year and increased about 1% sequentially from the prior quarter and disappointingly, below the lower-end of our guidance. In spite of weaker revenue trends, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.57 above the high-end of guidance, as a result of better growth margin and expense control resulting in improved profit follow-through. As we noted on our last earnings call, we were seeing weakened demand from customers given their concerns with the uncertain economic environment. This trend accelerated from late August downwards across multiple end-markets. This has resulted in lower-than-planned sell-through and an increase of channel inventory as a result our guidance for the fourth quarter reflects a much more reduced view of sales for the quarter. Before I turn to the details of our quarterly performance, I would like to highlight that we are only providing limited guidance this quarter due to the expected merger close with Freescale. Our view is that when we actually report fourth quarter results, certain line items will materially change. This includes, but is not unlimited to, the overall interest cost on our debt and the fully-diluted share count at the end of the fourth quarter. As this approach to guidance is different than past periods, I will personally include the revenue guidance expectations for the fourth quarter later in my remarks. Turning to our segment performance, HPMS segment revenue was $1.16 billion, up about 2% both on a year-basis and a sequential-basis. This was slightly weaker than our original expectations. We do not believe that we've lost any market share or key designs. Rather, we believe our customers are taking a much more restrained approach to end demand. Clearly, the growth our customers expected and communicated to us early in the year has been significantly reduced. Moving on to the end-market details of the quarter. Within Automotive, revenue was $308 million and in line with our expectations. During the quarter, revenue grew about 7% from the same period a year ago. And while down 1% sequentially, we did experience better-than-planned demand for keyless entry and in-vehicle networking products, but the sale of entertainment products was weaker than expected, though still strong on a year-over-year basis. We see the fourth quarter as being negatively impacted by the continued falloff in demand for the entertainment products within the automotive aftermarket segment both in Japan and China. Normally, we would've expected a seasonal uptick in demand within the auto entertainment area. As a result of the weaker demand, channel inventories have grown, and we are lowering our expectations until we see substantially improved sell-through. Clearly in the second half, demand for automotive products has been impacted by the fact that global auto unit production for the full year has been reduced from what had been anticipated earlier in the year, and we believe will settle in at about 1% unit growth versus the original 3% expectation as we enter the year. As we look to the fourth quarter, our expectation is for sales to be down in the high-single to low-double-digit range. In Secure Connected Devices, revenue was $317 million, up 5% from the same period in the prior year and up 15% sequentially. This was below our expectations, driven by lower-than-anticipated sales of broad-based MCUs in the market in China. Over the short term, our growth in connected device revenue will likely be below our longer term growth target due to a number of factors. First, the mobile transaction market continues to develop at a slower-than-expected pace, though our sales in the area has grown about 30% year-over-year. We do not expect significant new customer acceleration until we see that China handset OEMs add more transaction solutions to their platforms. There are encouraging signs, and our engagement level is very high, especially due to our ecosystem knowledge and ability to enable transit solutions in multiple large cities in China. However, growth related to these engagements will likely not materialize until sometime in 2016. Secondly, we have a number of new general-purpose MCU products where we are seeing good design win traction, especially in China. But the transition to revenue contribution is happening at a slower-than-originally-expected rate. Lastly, our mobile audio product growth is expected to slow as we've seen several of the Chinese handset OEMs reduce volumes while others have postponed the release of new handset platforms using our product due to the uncertain economic environment. Taken together, we expect secure connected devices revenue in the fourth quarter to be down in the high-single to low-double digit range. In the Secure Interface & Power group, revenue was $270 million, down 9% from the same period in the prior year and down 11% sequentially. This was below our expectations, primarily as a result of the weak demand in the base station market and to a lesser extent, the continued weakness in power lighting. Looking forward, we believe the RF power business will continue to struggle in the very short term as new base station build-outs continue to be delayed; particularly in China. Although we believe it could be an overcorrection as it was with the significant requested upsides last year, which could again result in shortages at some point in the coming quarters. Within our high-speed Interface business, we also expect to see significantly moderate in the fourth quarter as certain mobile customers reset run rates and rationalize inventory throughout their contract manufacturing supply chain – an unexpected change and a clear disappointment. Taking these factors together, we believe Secure Interface & Power group revenue will be down in the high 20%s to low 30% range in fourth quarter. Revenue in Secure Identification Solutions was $269 million, up 7% from the same period in the prior year and up about 5% sequentially, in line with our expectations. During the quarter, we saw demand for bank card products above our original expectations, primarily for dual interface products in China. Sales of mobility and transit products increased sequentially, though slightly below plan. We experienced a very modest ramp of new eGov programs, but at a lower level than originally expected. The challenge we are facing in the eGov market is delayed tender awards as the market continues to be exceptionally lumpy and influenced by macroeconomic conditions. We also do not see a significant positive impact on our banking business from the EMV upgrade cycle in the U.S. Demand continues to be predominantly for contact solutions currently, but we have multiple engagements for dual interface programs which should help growth in 2016. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect SIS revenue to be down in the low-double digit to mid-teens range, primarily due to the expected seasonal declines in banking revenue and lower-than-expected sales in the eGov and transit products. Finally, turning to the Standard Products segment, revenue was $325 million, down 2% compared to the year-ago period and up 1% versus the prior quarter. We have always said our Standard Products business was the best litmus test of the overall health of the end market. We are seeing trends that support this view with sell-through at our Asian distributors particularly weak. As with our Auto business, we will reduce our shipping to distributors during the fourth quarter until the view of end-demand becomes clearer. Consequentially, looking into the fourth quarter, we expect standard product revenue to be down in the low-double digit to mid-teens range. Taken together, this leads to – leads us to believe total NXP revenue in the fourth quarter will be down in the mid-teens range inclusive of about $25 million of sales in the Corporate and other segment. Peter will discuss expectations for margin and operating expenses in a few moments. Turning to our distribution channel performance, we are seeing the biggest disruption in sell-through. Total sales in the distribution were up 8% to support expected sales. However, reflecting the reduced demand environment, we actually saw sales out of distribution channel down 5%. The total months of inventory in the distribution channel were three months at the high end of our long-term target. Absolute dollars of inventory in the channel increased 25% on a sequential basis. In summary, our Q3 results were good from a profitability perspective but clearly a disappointment in terms of delivering revenue growth. However, even comprehending this, our HPMS business growth year-to-date is 12% versus the same period in 2014. The current demand environment is – in our target markets has clearly deteriorated and will continue to pose short-term challenges. Our guidance is a reflection of this uncertainty. We believe we continue to have market-leading product offerings, and our engagements with customers continue to be robust. We view the current environment more as a pause and would anticipate demand to improve in the coming quarters. Notwithstanding the current business trends, we continue to be very positive on the intermediate and long-term benefits of the merger between NXP and Freescale, both from a financial, customer and product solution perspective. As you know, the new company will have a combined revenue base of over $10 billion and will be the fourth largest non-memory semiconductor supplier with number one position in automotive, general purpose microcontrollers and network processors. In the short-term, we see a clear path to achieve $200 million in annual cost synergies in 2016 and ability to deliver $500 million in synergies in subsequent periods. Despite the current environment, our focus will be to drive the strategic benefit of the merger with Freescale, delivering a substantial increase in earnings. Aside from the financial benefits, the customer feedback has been very favorable. Early in the process, they clearly saw the benefits from the combined company. Several have requested that we engage on new product developments that neither NXP nor Freescale could have supported independently. This is especially true in the automotive market, where the combined portfolio is ideally positioned to deliver the broadest range of ADAS capabilities in all of the key areas including radar, vision systems and long-range vehicle-to-vehicle solutions. These engagements are clearly a significant opportunity but will take some time to translate into material revenue. Additionally, automotive customers are very excited about the potential to combine NXP's security capability with Freescale's broad microcontroller and the connectivity expertise of both companies. The combination of which is viewed as delivering, on the cornerstone of the Internet of Things are secure connections for the smarter world. Lastly, the overall regulatory approval process is progressing as anticipated, and we believe we are on track to close the transaction in the current quarter. We continue to make very good progress on the integration planning of the two companies. And the employees of both companies are anxious to proceed with the combination. We would like to thank the teams from both NXP and Freescale for all of the tireless efforts on additional activities planning for day one and their understanding for the regulatory process. We believe the merger of the two companies will drive a transformation in the market reach, product capability and will provide a significant catalyst for customer and shareholder value creation. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Peter, to discuss the financial details of the quarter.
Peter Kelly - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, Rick. And good morning to everyone on today's call. As Rick has already covered the drivers of the revenue during the quarter, I'll move to the financial highlights. In summary, Q3 was a good quarter from a profit perspective as we delivered record non-GAAP operating profit, operating profit margin and earnings per share. Non-GAAP operating profit was 29.5% and non-GAAP EPS was $1.57, both of which were above the high-end of our guidance. Cash flow was strong and our leverage ratio at 1.35 times continues to be substantially below our long-term target as we prepare to finance the Freescale merger. Focusing on the details of Q3, total revenue was $1.52 billion, up nearly 1% year-on-year but below our expectations and, clearly, a disappointed. We generated $748 million in non-GAAP gross profit and reported a non-GAAP gross margin of 49.1%. So, turning to our reportable segments. Within the HPMS segment, revenue was $1.16 billion, up about 2% year-on-year and up by about the same amount sequentially. Our Non-GAAP gross margin was 54%, 30 basis points better than the second quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin improved to 31.9% as a result of better gross profit and improving expense management. Within our Standard Products segment, revenue was $325 million, down 2.4% year-on-year and essentially flat versus the second quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was 35.4%, 30 basis points better than the second quarter. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 24.6%, a 132-basis-point increase sequentially. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $303 million, down $14 million on a sequential basis. From a total operating profit perspective, non-GAAP operating profit was $449 million, and non-GAAP operating margin was 29.5%, up 170 basis points sequentially. Our Interest expense was $44 million. Non-controlling interests were $18 million with cash taxes at $7 million. This resulted in total NXP non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.57, above the high end of our guidance, up 16% year-on-year and up 9% as compared to the second quarter. Stock-based compensation, which is not included in our non-GAAP earnings, was $34 million. Now, I'd like to turn to the changes in our cash and debt. Our total debts at the end of Q3 was $5 billion cash at the end of Q3 was $2.4 billion, and net debt was $2.6 billion. We exited the quarter with a trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.89 billion. The ratio of net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of the second quarter was 1.35 times, and our non-GAAP interest coverage was 10.2. Turning to working capital metrics, days of inventory remained at 95 days. And please note that days of inventory calculation includes $66 million of inventory mainly relating to our RF Power and Bipolar Power businesses, which is excluded from the inventory figure on the balance sheet as we have classified these product lines as assets held for sale. Days receivable were 37 days, an increase of 5 days sequentially, and days payable were 86, flat versus the prior quarter. Taken together, our cash conversion cycle was 46 days versus 41 days in the prior quarter. Cash flow from operations was $340 million and net CapEx was $74 million, resulting in non-GAAP free cash flow of $266 million. We repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares for a total cost of about $158 million or an average of $89.12 per share. As Rick has already provided details on our expectations for the fourth quarter, I will only provide a summary, but would like to reiterate that when we report our fourth quarter actuals, the actual report will be materially different due to a number of factors including interest expense and non-GAAP diluted share count, all of which are difficult to quantify at this point in time. We currently anticipate total revenue will be down in the low- to upper-teens range sequentially, reflecting the following trends in the business. Auto is expected to be down in the high single to the low double-digit range. Secure Identification Solutions is expected to be down in the low double to mid-teens range. Secure Connected Devices is expected to be down in the high single to low double-digit range. Secure Interface & Power is expected to be down in the high 20% to low 30% range. And Standard Products is expected to be down in the low double to mid-teens range. We anticipate revenue from the combination of manufacturing and corporate and other to be approximately $25 million. We expect non-GAAP gross profit to be about 49%, plus or minus 50 basis points. Operating expenses are expected to be about $310 million, plus or minus $5 million. So lastly, before I turn to your questions, consistent with our historical capital allocation strategy of returning all excess cash to our owners, we expanded our stock repurchase program and increased our buyback authorization by up to 20 million shares. I'd like now to turn it back to the operator for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. And our first question comes from John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Rick, I wanted to go back to your comments about the distribution channel. You gave us some good metrics for the calendar third quarter: sell-in, up 8%; sell-through, down 5%, three months of inventory. I'm kind of curious. Embedded in the Q4 guidance of down 15% for the total company, what's the view sort of in sell-in versus sell-through for distribution and where do you think distribution inventories will be at the end of the quarter?
Richard Lynn Clemmer - President, CEO & Executive Director: Yes, that's a really good point, John. And as you realize, with all the distributors we have and the broad range of product portfolios, it's hard to call that specifically, but clearly, when you look at our decreased revenue for the quarter at something in the mid-teens, our sell-in to distribution will be at least at that level, if not even maybe a little bit more of a decrease than the overall total. Based on everything we see from the distributors, Q3 clearly did not materialize with the growth that they had originally anticipated, that they put the orders in place for. And so, what we see today is – is their expectations to be a slight decline. Not a precipitous decline. The reason that we have the projected 15% decline is as we begin to correct those inventory levels that were increased in Q3. It's interesting, because at around three or slightly above three months of inventory, those aren't really so far out of the range of perspective of where we had really liked to be, but we would've liked to have gotten there over a number of quarters across a broad range of our product lines as opposed to a one-quarter increase based on a reduction of sellout. So, we clearly are going through a significant transition, and that's the reason we've adjusted our revenue projections for Q4, is to be able to take some significant actions to ensure that our inventory at our distribution partners are in line with their reduced expectations associated with the demand versus where they originally were back 90 or 120 days ago.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Rick, I know it's hard to forecast this, but is the assumption that most of the inventory correction through distribution will be done in the December quarter?
Richard Lynn Clemmer - President, CEO & Executive Director: John, I think it's really hard to completely pinpoint that. I think a big chunk of it will be – there could be some product areas where we still have a little bit. The – basically, if you look at the China car radio market, basically there were no orders in Q3. Sell through went away. And now the question becomes, do those orders come back? Because obviously, orders have to come back for us to be able to reduce that inventory. So, I think we'll make significant progress in correcting our inventory levels in Q3, but will we be absolutely where we want to be in all product lines? I don't think that I can actually say that for Q4.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): That's helpful. Then, guys, maybe as my follow-up. Peter, you guys have done a good job on the gross margin line. I think you gave us the utilization rates for Q3. Given sort of the revenue guide for Q4, where would you expect utilization rates to go? And it might be a moot point with the merger, but help me understand again, for every drop in utilization what the impact might be to gross margins a quarter out.
Peter Kelly - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I think there's a couple of things, John. One is if you look at our kind of manufacturing profile now, it's quite different from when we used to give that out, I think it was three or four years ago. So, we're able to kind of manage our overall wafer supply on a much more variable base now than we've done in the past. Now, we have two big internal fabs. So, we have ICNH (27:00), which to be honest, will continue to be largely full in Q4. And then in SSMC, which is our joint-venture fab in Singapore, we're able to keep – we own just about 60% of that fab. We're able to keep our side of that. Pretty full, but our joint venture partner is lowering its utilization of it at its 40% bit. So, utilization will be down in the fourth quarter, but financially, it's not a big impact to us actually. And you can see that in the – our guided gross margins pretty flat quarter-on-quarter, so, certainly, one of the good things we've done in the last few years.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thanks, guys.
Peter Kelly - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Apologize for the background noise. I mean, it sounds like maybe someone's coming to arrest us or something. I don't know.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks a lot.
Operator: And our next question comes from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I want to follow up John's first question, maybe ask it a different way. If you did not have the inventory burn, because we know you're a sell-and-revenue recognizer in the channel, from your answer, Rick, it sounds like your guidance would still be down at the same range. So, maybe the way to summarize it is down 15%. Is that what the guidance would be even if you weren't burning channel inventory, and if it would be different than that number, where do you think that the revenue guidance would in fact have been?
Richard Lynn Clemmer - President, CEO & Executive Director: So, I guess what I'll say, that's not what I intended to say. So, let me try to clarify. I think the decrease in our outlook for Q4 clearly comprehend some of the realignment in our distribution inventory with our partners. So, if we did not have that correction in the distribution inventory, our decline would not be 15% in the Q4 timeframe. I think, based on what we hear from our disti partners, on basic demand, I think it would be kind of low- to mid-single-digit decline in Q4 associated with it. So, clearly there's a significant chunk of our reduced outlook for Q4 that has to do with the realignment of the disti inventory, and there's a portion of it that's just associated with the reduced demand from our customers on an ongoing basis. And I don't know how to be too specific with that, but it's probably somewhat close to kind of half on both. But I think clearly, if we looked at the – just the demand from our customers, it would've been more like kind of low to mid-single digit decline with the remainder of our decline projected being really the realignment associated with our distribution inventory.
Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So, if that's – whether it's half 7% or 10% from what you just said of the 15% as coming from the channel inventory burn, I know it's hard to talk about the duration of that inventory burn. But whether it's 1Q or 2Q, is it your estimation that in all likelihood, you'll return to shipping in line and so the negative that you're facing in the fourth quarter will turn to kind of a mathematical positive at some point, and do you think that's kind of first quarter or it's going to be longer than that?
Richard Lynn Clemmer - President, CEO & Executive Director: Ross, I think it's hard for us to do a projection about absolutely specifics. I think it's going to take a while. I don't know that we'll be back at an absolute ship-through level on an equivalent basis by Q1 where there still won't be a little bit of inventory adjustment in Q1. I think it's really hard for us to see that. But clearly, I think we're taking a very direct and specific action in Q4 trying to realign as quickly as we can. I think it's important for us to get this cleaned up before we go into the combination. I think as we proceed with the combination, we want to be sure that our inventory levels are approaching in-line levels and where we would like to be to operate on more of a normal basis point forward.
Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. And I guess as my follow up, you mentioned about the combination of things. Peter, given the lower base of revenues that you have, I know Rick said that the target for cost synergies remains unchanged at the $200 million and then eventually $500 million. What's the – is there any change to the leverage target that you have, given the different base of revenues for both companies?
Peter Kelly - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: No. We kind of looked to that. So, I still think we'll be down in to – back to 2 by the summer of next year.
Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you.
Richard Lynn Clemmer - President, CEO & Executive Director: Thanks, Ross.
Operator: Thanks. Thank you. And our next question comes from Blayne Curtis of Barclays Capital. Your line is now open.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Rick, you mentioned that you saw in late August some softening, but then – September revenue didn't miss by that much. I'm just curious the trajectory here, did it accelerate into October? And then any view as to whether those trends have stabilized? And then a related question: OpEx came in much better for September. Were those planned moves ahead of the merger or were you able to react to this weakening demand?
Richard Lynn Clemmer - President, CEO & Executive Director: No. I think we should be specific about kind of our OpEx levels. We've talked about that we were really being very cautious relative to any additions in people in the current environment until we get into the merger. The fact is, is that we know we're going to have some people that are going to end up with their rows going away, and we want to be sure that we take advantage of placing as many of those people in the ongoing value-added growth as possible. So, we've been very specific in not adding resources in the current timeframe. But that's more associated with trying to do the best thing for the combination of the pre-scaling NXP employees as opposed to any specific action associated with what we saw on the near term with the demand reductions. When you think about this – this is product that ships through the channel. We're building it based on the expectations from our customers, as the expectations don't materialize, we'd still have the product that we built and shipping to our customers. It's better for it to be in the channel, where it can be shipped to the customers, than sitting on our docks after we finish building it. But clearly, that's the reason why we're taking aggressive actions to try to adjust that as quickly as possible. The demand, there are some areas, like in the after-market radio market in China where, it's still pretty flat. We don't see a lot of the increase in demand yet. The real question is, is when that will come back? And I think it's hard for us to identify specifically when that would come back for the after-market. That's a relatively small portion of the total car radio market. But it's a factor that has an impact on our revenue and one that we're trying to do the correction for associated with the distribution inventory levels. So, it's really hard to talk about specific run rates and where it is. For example, on our secure mobile transactions, on the mobile payment side, we saw most of that delayed with our partners from China, Inc., where we've worked on designs and have that ready to go, really delaying until they see a requirement where they have to offer that to be competitive with the leading smartphone providers. So, that clearly is a factor associated with it. And on the RF power side, clearly the supply chain is in a major transition. I know we talked about it specifically but it continues to be a hard reset by all of our customers associated with that – with them significantly reducing their inventory levels. And potentially, overcorrecting, and if we really do see the LTE rollout in China kick back in, we could actually be back in the shortage we were a year ago. So, this is a market segment that continues to be very difficult to call as we've said before and continue to believe that it will be. So, it's really – Blayne, when you think about it by every different product segment associated with it, but we felt like it was really important that we take an aggressive action here in Q4 to set up the distribution inventory levels at the right level in the NXP side before we get into the combination with Freescale, so that we can start with the right position moving forward.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Excellent. And just a clarification for you, Peter. I just want to make sure I understand the mechanics. You said lower utilization but then pointed to the December guidance. Would you take the unrealization in the current quarter? Is that something you recognize when the product sells through, i.e., first half of next year?
Peter Kelly - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes. Yes. On ICNH (36:12), which is the internal fab, it would move out three months, but that's completely full. On SSMC, the numbers are a lot lower than three months. But the reality is the underutilization we're talking about in Q4 is maybe a couple of points. I mean, we're talking about really low-90%s. Underutilization is not an issue for us.
Unknown Speaker: Right.
Richard Lynn Clemmer - President, CEO & Executive Director: But the major implications of that since it's really not our products were the miss is – it's probably more – it's reflected more on the real-time, Blayne, as opposed to being more when we ship it.
Peter Kelly - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes. But it's – it doesn't have any impact from a timing perspective. And it's absolutely negligible, so I wouldn't worry about that.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Appreciate that. Thanks.
Jeff Palmer - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thanks. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.
Operator: And our next question comes from William Stein of SunTrust. Your line is now open.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Great. Thank you for taking my question. Gentlemen, you're characterizing the shortfall in Q4 as – it sounds more like a short-term demand in inventory issue and less of a problem with positioning with your customers, can you confirm that? And then also, relative to that, you've had a 10% top line revenue growth target for some time, you've been doing very well on top line growth until this quarter in recent years and I'm wondering if you can comment on that longer-term growth outlook, please?
Richard Lynn Clemmer - President, CEO & Executive Director: Yes. Well, thanks a lot. We still believe that the fundamentals of our business support the double-digit growth that we've talked about over a three-year compounded growth rate basis. So, it's really important to reflect that as we've talked about that, that's always been on a three-year compounded growth rate basis. And we still see the same opportunity, Secure Connected Devices, we still think we're growing the high teens to low 20%s. Our Secure Interface & Power business which has – clearly has some disruption from the major adjustments in the RF power supply chain. We think over long term, we'll still grow in the low-double digit to mid-teen basis. And our Secure Identification Solutions, even though we continue to see the lumpiness that we've talked about on the eGov side being a detriment, we expect to see high-single to low-double digit growth. And then clearly, in automotive, with the strength and especially when we begin to look at the combined portfolio, on our current portfolio, we expect to see high-single digit growth. So, we feel very comfortable with the consistent growth over the three-year compounded growth rate basis that we've talked about were not reflective. The current expectations in alignment that we're talking about for Q4 doesn't really change that at all. But clearly, is aggravated by the significant adjustment that we have to do associated with the distribution inventory basis. If you look at our Q3 year-to-date, as we talked about, it's kind of high-single digit, and for our high-performance mixed-signal business is actually a 12% growth. So, we think that's still quite significantly above where we see the market growing through year-to-date through September.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks for that thorough answer, Rick. Maybe just one follow-up if I can. Many semiconductor companies saw weakness earlier in the year. In NXP's case, it sort of came upon us suddenly in Q4, or maybe from a bookings perspective during Q3, but we're seeing it in Q4. Is there something different about either the way you use distribution, the number of partners, something else that would sort of explain the difference, or how can you help us reconcile that, please?
Richard Lynn Clemmer - President, CEO & Executive Director: Yes. I think clearly our product mix is different than most of our peers when you think about it, with our ID business and our security business associated with it. So, I don't think you can draw a direct correlation with ours versus our peer group. Clearly, the growth that we saw early in the year, or through Q3, puts us in a good position. About 60% of our total revenue goes through the distribution channel business. And the fact is with the significant increase in the channel inventory, a 25% increase in inventory, as the orders that they had placed on us we were able to ship to, but the sell-through that they were originally planning didn't materialize to increase sell through. So, it's not like they've seen a significant decline in demand in most cases. There are some cases like the car radio aftermarket. But in most areas, it's not like they've seen a significant decline in demand. It's just they haven't seen the increase that they had originally planned that we were shipping inventory into the channel to be able to meet. So, since that increase did not materialize, we clearly are taking actions to reduce the inventory in Q4 associated with it.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks, Rick.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Chris Caso of Susquehanna Financial. Your line is now open.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Yes. Thank you. Just wondering if there's been any, I guess, changes in lead times or availability or products again, something that may have encouraged the distribution channel to build up some of that inventory and how that may have changed as you go into the back of the year. In addition, was there anything – we talked a lot about inventory and the distribution channel. What do you think has been the case with inventory at your customers as well? Has that similarly risen? And I guess that would also be something that would need to be burned off if that were the case.
Richard Lynn Clemmer - President, CEO & Executive Director: Well, Chris, the one area that we did see something specific was in our Secure Interface where a number of the supply chain with the custom manufacturers actually had built significant inventory for some of our key smartphone OEM partners. And we're seeing a correction that's taking place for that that was really disappointing, that kind of came up as we really peeled the onion and understood the inventory levels at some of the custom manufacturers associated with it. But that's probably the only thing that's really unique versus an ongoing basis. I think the other area that continues to be a major swing is in the RF power business where there's been very significant adjustments in the demand rates from our customers and inventory levels associated with that, where they're trying to go through a significant correction. So, I think those are some of the areas that are different than just the normal ongoing distribution levels.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Okay. Thank you. As a follow-up, can you talk about the financing for the upcoming transaction? The commitments are in place. Have the terms been fixed right now and are there any changes to the terms that you've either seen or may foresee as the deal gets to closure?
Peter Kelly - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: No, no. We still -- the commitments are the commitments. So, that's not an issue. I think, as you know, we put $1 billion of bonds in place a quarter ago and we intend to go out pretty shortly with some term loans such that we won't need the commitments.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Okay. And the terms of the term loans? Do you have information with regard to what should we expect from that?
Peter Kelly - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: No, until I do them, I won't know.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein Research. Your line is now open.
Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. On gross margins, I just wanted to just be very specific. So, I wonder, are you basically saying – let me ask you this, if revenues in Q1 were flat to down, are you basically saying there would be limited to no-impact on gross margin from that? Would all the gross margin impacts at that point only be around product mix and the like? There would be no measurable issues from utilization if Q1 revenues were flat to down on Q1 gross margins?
Jeff Palmer - Vice President-Investor Relations: Yes. I think, Stacy, this is Jeff. Just one comment. The percentage of our external foundry business has gone up substantially over the number of the years.
Peter Kelly - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes. So, basically, in our COGS, we have a lot more variable cost than we have historically.
Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Got it. That's helpful.
Peter Kelly - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So, there are outer limits. We do have some fixed costs still. So, if my revenue doubles or halves, in the end, you do have some limit. But kind of where we are today, it's much more impacted by the mix of the products we're selling than the actual manufacturing structure. Yes.
Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Got it. That's helpful. For my follow up, I just want to dig into the overall demand environment. It sounds like you're suggesting that this is a short pause. It's more inventory-driven. You're saying your customers aren't really seeing demand slowdowns necessarily, but they're not seeing the pickup. It sounds like a lot of the issues that are across many of your businesses were from China. Given we've been seeing some weakness there for a while, I'm just wondering why your customers would've been expecting to see a pretty big demand pickup into the end of the year and have to place the kind of orders that they did. What were they seeing, I guess, exiting Q2 and into the beginning of Q3? Why didn't they see issues earlier and kind of what changed? I find that dynamic very surprising.
Richard Lynn Clemmer - President, CEO & Executive Director: Well, Stacy, I think you've got to really address that on a product by product basis. I don't think you can draw an overarching view with one brushstroke. I think you really have to talk about it on an individual basis. I think on the car radio aftermarket, I think that began to change on them significantly, but it was clearly aggravated by the overall economic environment in China and the rest of the developing countries where the amount of funds that individuals want to spend on a high-end car radio have been reduced. So, we see a significant adjustment associated with that. Another area that's a good example is in the mobile wallet. We would have anticipated that there would've been a rollout in the mobile wallet late this year, associated with being able to meet the requirements to be competitive on the mobile wallet. As that delayed in China, we saw most of the China, Inc. handset. People would delay the implementation of the mobile wallet because there's an incremental cost there and if they don't need that to be competitive on the end product for their marketplace, then they're not going to add that cost basis associated with it. So, it's really different product by product associated with it. When we entered in Q3, we had orders from our disti partners that were based on the orders that they had from their customers. And as that growth in expected demand then materialize, and we did ship increased product into the channel, obviously it went into inventory. And so, now we're going through specific actions, product line by product line, to be sure that we address that. The car radio aftermarket is one that clearly is at too-high level, and we need to do a correction associated with it. If you think about our total inventory levels, at 3 or slightly over, that's not a totally out-of-the-realm level. The problem is, is we got to bearing one quarter by reduced sell-through as opposed to being able to build that up over a reasonable period of time a number of quarters. So, I don't think the absolute level is as alarming as the details when we peeled the onion below that which really has driven us to try to do a pretty significant reset in Q4 to take the revenue growth fluctuations down to reflect the lack of growth that's happening in the marketplace in most areas. Clearly not the case in RF power. But in most areas where there's just not the growth that we had originally planned. If we look at areas like the mobile wallet, we still are very confident in that over the long term and think that that will come back next year as they have to have a mobile wallet to be competitive with the leading smartphone supplier. So, our confidence in that is still there. It's just a matter of timing if when that gets deployed.
Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: So, do you think you're taking a bigger correction than you ordinarily would if you weren't closing the deal?
Richard Lynn Clemmer - President, CEO & Executive Director: I don't think we can say that, Stacy. I think what we're trying to do is be sure that we manage our inventories appropriately, but we also are trying to be sure that our inventories are in good shape as we do the combination and move forward.
Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you, guys.
Richard Lynn Clemmer - President, CEO & Executive Director: Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava of BMO. Your line is now open.
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi. Thank you. A few clarifications for me as well, Rick. Just going back to the Auto segment, most of the other chip guys actually have called out for not such a big decline in Auto. So, maybe you could help us understand your exposure by geos. And is China disproportionally higher for you? That was my first question. Second, also a clarification, I just want to make sure I got it correct. You are not seeing a pickup in EMV in the U.S. And if not, why not? Because the EMV card rollout seems to be accelerating as we're entering the year. Thank you.
Richard Lynn Clemmer - President, CEO & Executive Director: Yes. So, let's talk about Auto first. I think it's not as much on a geo basis, although it does – it is based on where it's built. But it's more about the aftermarket car radio market. And what we've seen is the amount of money that consumers are willing to spend in the developing countries, in China on aftermarket car radio products where they're looking to upgrade their audio systems has kind of completely collapsed in the near term because of the economic environment that we're in. Now, that happens to be primarily built in China but it's basically to serve the market in China as well as the overall aftermarket. So, we still see healthy demand in our overall Automotive business and if you look at the growth rate that we've been able to drive this year, and as we get through this inventory correction going forward, we feel very comfortable with the growth rate in our overall Automotive business. But the particular concentration that we see in Automotives has a lot to do with the car radio aftermarket where the demand has basically gone away for a period of time. It won't stay at zero forever, but we're doing a hard correction to be sure that we get the inventory levels in line with that. But the growth rate in the rest of the business, we certainly feel comfortable about it, as you and I both know, you don't win or lose market share on design wins on a quarter-by-quarter basis in Automotive. So, the market position we have in Automotive is still quite secure. It just happens to be the concentration that we have in the car radio aftermarket. On the (52:22).
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States): I'm sorry, Rick. How big is the aftermarket?
Richard Lynn Clemmer - President, CEO & Executive Director: Well, our car infotainment in total is about half of our Automotive business. We haven't broken out the aftermarket specifically but it's probably something like a third maybe of that. We'd have to get the specifics for you. But it's not the dominant share of the car infotainment business but it's a big chunk of the total still and certainly one as it goes to zero that has an impact on overall demand.
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Got it.
Richard Lynn Clemmer - President, CEO & Executive Director: On the U.S. EMV market, I think the thing that's really important to put into perspective, the U.S. EMV market, as it's implemented would contact EMV, the dollar size of that market is a much smaller market than where we are focused in other areas where we have dual interface that adds a lot more value for the users and a lot more content. We're beginning to see some opportunities on design wins in the U.S., on dual interface where people will have multiple wallets on the same card and have loyalty programs and other factors associated with it where we offer the contact expand that can be used, for example, for children to be able to use payments that can be replenished online, associated with it. So, we see some emerging opportunities in the U.S. so-called EMV market. Although it's dual interface as opposed to contact EMV the ones that we see from a growth basis. But if you look at the actual U.S. EMV market, because of the pricing point associated with the contact level and the actual volume, we don't see a significant uptick in the dollar size of that marketplace. And it's certainly dwarfed by the size of the other markets associated with it.
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Thank you.
Unknown Speaker: Thanks, Ambrish.
Operator: Thank you.
Jeff Palmer - Vice President-Investor Relations: Operator, do we have any other callers waiting to ask questions at this point?
Operator: I'm showing no further questions at this time.
Richard Lynn Clemmer - President, CEO & Executive Director: Okay. So again, thanks a lot for joining us today. Clearly when we look at the expectations for Q4, we're disappointed with revenue results. Although frankly, we're encouraged with ability to maintain our gross margins in a much more difficult environment with top-line revenue. So, we do have the positive aspects of that. The small range growth opportunity that we see for the current NXP portfolio is still intact.
Operator: Ladies and Gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2015 NXP Semiconductors' Earnings Conference Call. My name is Kaylie, and I'm your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] Now I would like to hand it over to Mr. Jeff Palmer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.
Jeff Palmer: Thank you, Kaylie, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the NXP Semiconductors Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. With me on the call today is Rick Clemmer, NXP's President and CEO; and Peter Kelly, NXP's CFO. If you've not obtained a copy of our second quarter 2015 earnings press release, it can be found at our company website under the Investor Relations section at nxp.com. Additionally, we have posted on our Investor Relations website a supplemental earnings summary presentation and a document of our historical financials to assist you in your modeling efforts. This call is being recorded and will be available for replay from our corporate website. Our call today will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause NXP's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the macroeconomic impact on specific end markets in which we operate, the sale of new and existing products and our expectations for financial results for the third quarter 2015. Please be reminded that NXP undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements. For a full disclosure on forward-looking statements, please refer to our press release. Additionally, during our call today, we'll make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the impact of purchase price accounting, restructuring, stock-based compensation, impairment and other charges that are driven primarily by discrete events that management does not consider to be directly related to NXP's underlying core operating performance. Pursuant to Regulation G, NXP has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our second quarter 2015 earnings press release, which will be furnished to the SEC on Form 6-K and is available on NXP's website in the Investor Relations section at nxp.com. Before we start the call today, I'd like to highlight the investor events we'll be attending during the third quarter. On August 11, we'll attend the Pacific Crest TMT Conference in Vale. On August 25, we'll attend the Jefferies Corporate Access Day in Chicago. On September 16, we'll attend the Deutsche Bank Technology Conference in Las Vegas. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Rick.
Rick Clemmer: Thanks, Jeff, and welcome, everyone, to our earnings call today. Our second-quarter results were quite good, with product mix essentially in line with our expectations, combined with solid cost control driving better operating profitability. Results in earnings-per-share above the high end of our guidance range. Specifically NXP delivered total revenues of $1.51 billion, up about 12% from a year ago period and up about 3% sequentially in line with our guidance range. While we're pleased with the results of the second quarter and our view of continued share gains in our target markets, we have witnessed a clear change in market demand. Conversations with both customers and channel partners reflect an increased sense of caution. To be clear of the uncertainty that our customers are highlighting is the realization of the slower growth macro environment but not a material downturn. It is this backdrop combined with the inventory connection that is taking place in RF power market that is coloring our view into the third quarter, which Peter will provide more details on later in the call. Now turning to our segment performance; HPMS segment revenue was $1.15 billion up 16% on a year-over-year basis and up about 4% sequentially. The second quarter marks the 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit year-on-year growth for the HPMS segment. The HPMS segment is our key focus area of growth and our track record demonstrates clear outperformance in net share gains relative to our peer group, which we believe is a sustainable long-term advantage. Moving on to the end market details of the quarter; Automotive revenue was $310 million, a new all-time high for the group. Additionally we are on an annual run rate to achieve record revenue levels in Japan, a geographic region of strategic focus. During the quarter, revenue grew about 8% from the same period a year ago and up nearly 3% sequentially. We experienced solid and continued demand for entertainment, keyless entry and in-vehicle networking products, offset by slight headwinds in our auto sensor business. In the Secure Interfaces and Power group, revenue was $303 million up 29% from the same period in the prior year and up about 4% sequentially and slightly better than our expectations. During the quarter we continued to see very good demand for enterprise products as well as accelerating traction for our RF small signal or smart antenna solutions. This was largely offset by anticipated sequential declines of RF power products used in the base station markets, those still up strongly versus the prior year period. As you recall we have been in a significant supply shortage during 2014 and began to see an equilibrium of demand and supply emerge late 2014 and Q1 of 2015. Entering Q2 we had anticipated and saw a more moderate demand environment. What has occurred and what is impacting our third-quarter outlook is, our customers are continuing to reduce orders in light of un-served demand reporting as a result of -- reportedly as a result of the ongoing government bribery investigations taking place within the China telecom industry. In Secured Connected Devices revenue was $276 million up 39% from the same period in the prior year, and down 4% sequentially. This was slightly below our expectations driven by declines for mobile transactions and a less than robust rebound in demand for our point-of-sale in mobile audio products designed into Android smartphones for the emerging markets. Revenue in Secure Identification Solutions revenue was $257 million, down 4% from the same period in the prior year and up 60% sequentially. During the quarter we expected and we saw strong improvement in demand for bankcard products, primarily for dual interface products in China, as well as continued traction for contact solutions in the U.S. market. We also experienced ramps of new e-government programs. Finally turning to the Standard Products segment, revenue was $322 million up 2% compared to the year ago period and flat versus the prior quarter. Turning now to our distribution channel performance. Total sales in distribution were up 8% with sales out of distribution also up 7%. The total months of inventory in the distribution channel were 2.3 months, at the low end of our long term targets. Absolute dollars of inventory in the channel declined about 1% on a sequential basis. Before turning the call over to Peter, I'd like to provide you with an update on the announced merger between NXP and Freescale Semiconductor. During the quarter we saw or we achieved two significant milestones. First we announced the sale of NXP's RF Power business to JAC Capital, a fundamental requirement we anticipated to attain regulatory approval of the merger. Secondly, we achieved very strong shareholder approval for the proposed merger at our recent extraordinary shareholders meeting. The remainder of the regulatory approval process is progressing as we had originally anticipated and we believe we are on track to close the transaction in the fourth quarter of 2015. We continue to make very good progress on the integration planning of the two companies. We are excited about creating a true industry leader focused on delivering differentiated product solutions, which we believe will create significant value for our customers and shareholders. In summary, our Q2 results were quite good. We continued to deliver improving operating profitability and very strong earnings growth, while at the same time continuing to invest in the business to fuel future growth. While the current environment does pose short term challenges, we view this as more of a pause than the significant downturn in demand. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Peter to discuss the financial details of the quarter.
Peter Kelly: Thanks, Rick, and good morning to everyone on today's call. I apologize because as I will have to stop and cough during my remarks as I have had a little bit of a cold recently. As Rick has already covered the drivers of the revenue during the quarter, I'll move to the financial highlights. In summary, Q2 was a very good quarter. We delivered record non-GAAP operating profit margins and earnings per share. Non-GAAP operating profit was 28% and non-GAAP EPS was $1.44, both of which were above the high end of our guidance. Cash flow is very strong and our leverage ratio at 1.43x continues to be substantially below our long term target as we prepare to finance the Freescale merger. Focusing on the details of Q2; total revenue was $1.51 billion, up nearly 12% year-on-year and in line with our expectations. We generated $734 million in non-GAAP gross profit and reported a non-GAAP gross margin of 48.7%. Turning to our reportable segments. Within the HPMS segment, revenue was $1.15 billion, up 16% year-on-year, and about 4% over the previous quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was 53.7%, 60 basis points below Q1, and non-GAAP operating margin improved by 140 basis points to 30.3%, as a result of improving expense management. Within our Standard Products segment, revenue was $322 million, up about 3% year-on-year, and essentially flat versus the first quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin at 35.1%, was essentially flat on the prior quarter. And non-GAAP operating margin was 23.3%, a 40 basis points increase sequentially. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $317 million, down $9 million on a sequential basis. From a total operating profit perspective, non-GAAP operating profit was $418 million and non-GAAP operating margin was 27.8%, up a 160 basis points sequentially. Interest expense was $36 million, $2 million higher than guidance as we had issued $1 billion of new debt during the quarter to fund the announced Freescale merger. Noncontrolling interest was $21 million and cash taxes were $10 million. This resulted in total NXP non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.44 above the high end of our guidance. This is up 32% year-on-year and 7% on the first quarter. Stock-based compensation, which is not included in our non-GAAP earnings, was $36 million. I'd now like to turn to the changes in our cash and debt. Our total debt at the end of Q2 was $5 billion and as previously announced we raised $1 billion in new debt issuing two unsecure bonds during the quarter. As a result cash at the end of Q2 was $2.4 billion and net debt was $2.6 billion. We exited the quarter with a trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.83 billion, and our ratio of net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of Q2 was 1.43x and our non-GAAP interest coverage increased to 11.6x. Turning to working capital metrics; days of inventory were 95 days. Please note that the days of inventory calculation includes $55 million of inventory mainly relating to our RF power and Bipolar Power business, which is excluded from the inventory figure in the balance sheet. As we have classified these products as assets held for sale. Days receivable were 32 days, a decline of 2 days sequentially, and days payable were 86 days, a decline of 4 days. Taken together, our cash conversion cycle was 41 days versus the 36 days in the prior quarter. Cash flow from operations was $351 million and net CapEx was $89 million, resulting in non-GAAP free cash flow of $262 million. We repurchased approximately 1.7 million shares for a total cost of about $162 million or an average of $95.26 per share. Now I would pause for a second and just talk to our expectations on net debt for trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA leverage. At the time of the merger announcement we mentioned we thought we would have a leverage ratio of about 3x when we close the transaction and that it would take us approximately six quarters post close to get back to a ratio of 2x net debt. Given the announced sale of our RF power business and assuming a fourth quarter close, we now have a leverage ratio of around 2.5x at the time of the close and we should hit our 2x target by the summer of 2016. Now I'd like to provide our outlook for Q3. We currently anticipate total revenue will be in the range of up 1% to up 5% sequentially. At the midpoint, we expect total revenue to be up about 3% in Q3, reflecting the following trends in the business. Auto is expected to be essentially flat; Secure Identification Solutions is expected to be up in the mid-single digit range; Secure Connected Devices is expected to be up about 20% sequentially, a little weaker than previously expected as we see some weakness in the China and the Android market. Secure Interface and Power is expected to be down in the high single-digit range, much lower than originally expected as we see a nearly full 40% reset in RF power business as the base station OEMs try to manage their supply chain. Standard Products is expected to be up in the low single digit range sequentially; and we anticipate revenue from the combination of manufacturing and Corporate & Other to be approximately $33 million. Taken together, total NXP revenue should be in the range of $1.52 to $1.57 or about - sorry, should be in the range of $1.52 billion to $1.57 billion or about $1.55 billion at the midpoint. We expect non-GAAP gross profit to be about 48.8%. Operating expenses are expected to be up about $400 million to $321 million and this translates into a non-GAAP operating profit in the range of $424 million to $448 million or about 28% operating margin at the midpoint. Interest expense will increase quarter-on-quarter by about $10 million, approximately $45 million as a result of the new debt taken on to refinance the merger. Cash taxes are expected to be roughly $8 million, noncontrolling interest should be around $18 million. Stock-based compensation should be about $37 million, which is excluded from our guidance. Diluted share count is assumed to be the same as the second quarter of 243.3 million shares. Taken together, this translates into non-GAAP earnings per share range of $1.45 to $1.55 or $1.50 per share at the midpoint of our guidance and this $1.50 includes the additional $0.04 of interest costs we have put in place to help fund the merger. So I'd like to turn the call back to the operator and Rick and I will be happy to answer your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of William Stein with SunTrust. Your line is now open.
Will Stein: Good morning. Thank you for taking my question and congrats on the very good results. I think Peter last quarter u gave us both - well a sort of preview on both Q3 and Q4 revenue growth, not sure I heard any update on the Q4 outlook. Acknowledging that you cited a weaker macro environment, I am wondering, if you can update that Q4 view, please?
Peter Kelly: Yes. We didn’t Will. And to be honest the real reason is it's really difficult to say what Q4 is now, because clearly we will be excluding RF power and we will be including Freescale. So, kind of giving out the full year revenue really doesn’t make any sense anymore. What I would say though is, if you look at kind of what we said three months ago and what we said now, with the exception of RF power clearly this one's sort of inventory reset going on. I am not sure I'd change our view substantially, I think people have been a little bit more conservative in their view of the market and there does appear to be a little bit of nervousness. But we are not - as Rick said in his prepared remarks, we have not really seen any kind of fundamental change. So we are pretty comfortable given what we said now and given what we said three months ago, [excluding] RF power.
Will Stein: That's very helpful. If I can have one follow-up. There has been quite a bit of news about hacking in the Automotive end market with one big auto OEM particular. It would seem NXP has a portfolio that's well-suited to Security there. Can you comment on any current or near-term revenue opportunity for - to address that issue in the market? Thank you.
Rick Clemmer: Thanks, Will. So when you think about the challenges associated with hacking in Automotive, I think it's a significant opportunity for NXP as we talk about bringing security to the car. We've had ongoing discussions with automotive manufacturers for some time but as you might imagine those discussions are clearly accelerating in the near term. We presented both some virtually immediate solutions on the gateway to the car and some interesting innovative solutions to be able to bring security to our in-vehicle networking and then frankly with the transaction associated with Freescale the ability to bring security on the automotive microcontroller side as well. So we see some significant opportunities and are deeply engaged in discussions with how we can help the car companies to be able to provide a safer more secure car and you one of the things that we want to be sure is that we moved aggressively in this area so that we can truly be able to facilitate the opportunity and help all of our customers make their cars safer relative to the public.
Will Stein: Thanks, Rick.
Peter Kelly: We will start this August - I missed something I should have said. I guess on the one hand you hand you say the market is incrementally more nervous or maybe even incrementally a little bit weaker. But I think the other thing that's maybe different from three months ago is our margins are incrementally more positive. So I am very, very pleased with the way our margins trend together.
Will Stein: There's a question there, but I will let someone else take it. Thank you.
Rick Clemmer: Thanks, Will.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Caso with Susquehanna Financial. Your line is now open.
Rick Clemmer: Chris can you hear us.
Operator: If your phone is on mute please un-mute.
Chris Caso: Sorry about that. Just wondered, if you could expand a bit on the comments of the leverage ratio on achieving that ratio by summer 2016? Once you get to that ratio, I guess what you said in the past is you take a look at which is [more great] use of cash, buyback or reducing debt further. Should we assume by that once - assuming the stock is around current levels that you would switch the use of cash from paying down debt to resuming your buyback once you achieve those ratios?
Rick Clemmer: Well I think given the high levels we would be buying back stock. What we have said in the past is that we had return all excess cash to the shareholders. So I mean really the point about being at 2x net debt by summer of next year, what we are trying to say there is, summer of next year basically all of our cash flow will go back into being returned to shareholders either by buybacks or possibly we had introduce a dividend at some stage.
Peter Kelly: I have felt very comfortable buying our stock at $96 through the quarter. I think I have said in the past I don’t really look at what we are from the perspective of a multiple while there is a discount of cash flow. And I am really, really comfortable buying our stock at the moment.
Rick Clemmer: I think the real key is, the proceeds from the sale of our RF power business clearly changes the original guidance that we gave at the time of the announcement of the transaction. So that with the continued strong performance of NXP, puts us in a great position to really be back below our long-term objective of 2x annualized EBITDA by the middle of next year or by the spring of next year.
Chris Caso: As a follow-up, with regard to the Freescale transaction you had talked at the time of a certain amount of cost synergies and what you expected to get out of the deal. Given that we have had a couple months pass, you have obviously seen Freescale's results and actually your own OpEx is a bit lower than what we had expected. Is there any change with regard to what your expectations are with regarding the accretion or the cost synergies post the transaction?
Peter Kelly: No. We had say what you want to do is you should take your view of Freescale, your view of NXP, add them together and add $500 million of profit. So we are doing lots and lots of [indiscernible]. At the moment we can only plan. So we are doing lots and lots of planning. There is nothing that indicates to us that we can't do the $500 million and we would expect $200 million of that next year.
Rick Clemmer: I think the one thing that we have not talked about and we continue to feel better about all the time with the discussions, is the opportunities on the revenue synergy and as we look at the feedback from our customers and the opportunities they talk to, we actually believe that that could be even more significant than what we had thought originally. But since that doesn't really happen in the first year, so we just did not commit that at the time of the announcement of the transaction. But we continue to be very excited about the combination of the two product portfolios and the opportunity it creates for our customers to really have an advantage with the more complete solutions that we can bring to the marketplace.
Chris Caso: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Vivek Arya: Thank you for taking my question. Rick, first one for you. Very encouraging to see these kind of results, while most of your peers are missing and guiding down substantially and I understand there are a lot of companies, specific products like [indiscernible]. But was hoping you could share your views, give us some more color on end market or geographies so far in Q3? What you are seeing and what sort of gives you the confidence this is going to be a short lived downtime?
Rick Clemmer: So I think the thing that we see as we talked to your distribution partners and our customers, there are some areas that clearly we don’t see the same strength. The smartphone market outside of the leader in smartphones, basically they are now even in China beginning to struggle a little bit in terms of their volume. And clearly Samsung as you saw with - what they have announced is not performing at the level you would expect. So clearly there are areas where we are not seeing as robust demand as people would have planned. The RF power adjustments is clearly having an impact on our overall growth as well as that of the marketplace for the base stations. With the uncertainty created about everyone afraid to place orders because of concern on the investigations going on in China relative to the anti-bribery. But what I have been told by a number of people in China is that that can't continue long because of the demand for capacity is going to bring that back up. So what I think we see across the board is a more cautious attitude, but clearly no significant decline at this point other than in the exception of the RF power area. But it's clearly more cautious area and one more people are a little more cautious about placing orders and putting orders on the books. But the fundamental demand and the health of the world economy, which has been tailored slightly as you know. The world economic growth has been reduced by two or three percent of a point this year and clearly the uncertainty over China. Although the Chinese government has had a significant track record of being able to charge their way through these forces. So I think all of these things considered plus clearly more uncertainty associated with it, but not anything that we see a true weakness or precipitous decline associated with and again it gets down to your engagement with customers and being able to deliver solutions that make a difference for them and in the marketplace.
Vivek Arya: Got it. As a follow-up, these are very good cost control both HPMS and Standard Products margins, a little close to the high-end of the long-term targets, perhaps even exceeding them. Could you give us some sense of what's helping this cost control? What are the other drivers to extract more leverage besides once you get to the Freescale transaction?
Peter Kelly: Yes. I think you are right and actually we were talking a little bit about it before the call. I think we talked previously about SG&A being around 10% of revenue. I think we are demonstrating right now we can run it at 9%. To be honest some of that is simply because we are not hiring ahead of the Freescale integration. So there's a few things that are a driver really. One is we are managing headcount much more tightly than we were earlier in the year. And usual lots of small things, keep an eye on your travel, making sure you manage your variable cost. I think we got some benefit from R&D last quarter in terms of just the way masks fell. But I wouldn't point to any one single thing, I think it's across the board the team are doing a terrific job on managing off that. And we are seeing leverage on our OpEx as our revenue grows.
Vivek Arya: Last quick one, if I could squeeze one. On the regulatory, any regulatory issues on the Freescale? I think you have mentioned confidence about closing it in Q4, any regulatory issues at all that you might have seen so far? Thank you.
Rick Clemmer: Well we continue to work our way through the process. We have had good exchange and good discussion with MOFCOM in China. We continue to make good progress with the EU and we are having a good interface and dialog in the U.S. So I think things are on track associated with it. We obviously are not through the process, so until you are through the process you can't say for sure. But I think we continue to make good progress on it and it clearly is an area of focus for us to be able to get through that as soon as we can.
Vivek Arya: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore. Your line is now open.
C.J. Muse: Apologies for my voice. I think I got a little bit of virus [indiscernible]. Question on SCD. Can you talk about the 20% up, how we should be taking back units versus rising content there?
Peter Kelly: Hey, C.J. I think your voice sounds even worse than mine. I mean but, if I could just repeat your question. So it's really about in Connected Devices, how is it - is the 20% just additional volume or do we have more content, is that it?
C.J. Muse: Yes. That's it.
Peter Kelly: I think what we say about Secure Connected Devices is that it's going pretty much as we expected. I will guess that we are kind of go here and it's a difficult question for us to answer for obvious reasons. But where we are seeing some weakness is really in the Android side of the business and the rest of the business is going pretty much as you would expect and its fully driven around volume rather than additional content.
Rick Clemmer: Yes. I think the one thing you have seen, we have seen a push out of some of the acceleration that we had planned in China because the leader in mobile wireless is not moving quite as rapidly for implementation, so that all of the other smartphone guys in China had to had fundamental capabilities. So we are engaged with all of those and they are all aggressively reviewing it, but kind of waiting for the right time to be able to drive the implementation, because clearly it has incremental cost on their bill of materials. That they want to be sure that they can provide the solution associated with it. So we are still just as positive about the general outlook associated with it but the actual timing of the ramp clearly has moved down slightly associated with it.
C.J. Muse: I guess a little quick on RF, have you guided in Q3 a full quarter of RF revenues and expenses or are you assuming only partial?
Peter Kelly: Full quarter. They are down 40% on Q2.
Rick Clemmer: So we guided a full quarter and we would anticipate that we would not close before the full quarter. Clearly if we were to do that we would have to make adjustments but we would assume that we will close that in Q4, C.J.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Blayne Curtis: Hey, guys. A great job on the quarter. A couple of questions. On ID you mentioned a pickup in contactless in the U.S. but also e-gov driving that business. Just curious, what are you seeing in terms of when U.S. could convert over and what was the bigger driver in June-September, is it still e-gov? You also mentioned China. Is there some [indiscernible] in ID would be helpful.
Rick Clemmer: So the most significant improvement was continuing to be and do 100% in China where we continue to see strength associated with the deployment in the market. Clearly there were some increase in the U.S. from the contact side as well as we are beginning to make some improvements now and dual interface in the U.S. albeit quite small. So I don't think anything has changed relative to our anticipation of when the U.S. market will really be implemented with [A&B]. It will be a slow progress, as we have talked about. We think that it's a matter of several years and depending on how it's implemented there could be even more opportunity for initial implementation with contact and then if they realize the advantages for the user interface on the interface actually then moving to dual interface. So I think that everything is pretty much as we have said over the last two quarters, no real changes associated with it. The near term was just driven by some incremental demand, primarily with China and dual interface, so the other two areas just were positive factors as well.
Blayne Curtis: Excellent. Just the auto market, obviously a constant and share gainer and you mentioned Japan. Seasonally - that market seasonally soft run in the back half and you guided flat. So I think I know the answer here, but just curious to your thoughts on the end market, the health of the market. Obviously there has been some concerns in China and such. Outside of your content story what are seeing just in terms of end market trends in auto?
Rick Clemmer: So, I think, we see - we believe that we still see it pretty healthy, general automotive market. We don't see any real significant uncertainty associated with it. Clearly one month of decline in automotive sales in China, with the uncertainty that the stock market declines brings is a factor. But we don't see any significant adjustment in the overall automotive consumption. We are still very positive about the general environment and continue to believe that it is a significant opportunity for us, especially as we begin to think about some of the emerging areas that will not contribute significantly to near-term revenue but will have a very significant in the long-term and specifically in the area of ADAS. With the combination with Freescale once we get the regulatory approval we see a significant opportunity to bring the portfolios together and really have a positive impact on our customers. And having met with customers a lot over the last quarter or so in combination with Greg at Freescale. Just as introductory meetings we've heard nothing but positive feedback from our customers associated with the opportunity that the combination of the portfolios bring.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Ross Seymore: Hi, guys. Congrats from me as well, great execution. Just a quick question on the SIP business. I know you have the 40% drop baked in for the HPRF side of thing, but it seems like the resulting NAV for the remainder of that segment sounds like it has to be up pretty strongly in the September quarter, kind of up single digits maybe even double digits. What's going on in that sequentially?
Rick Clemmer: Well that business has a portion of the activity that we have some of the smartphone and tablet players is positive and we continue to be pretty successful in the market with the some of the new introductions of technology as well. So what is the technology, Jeff?
Jeff Palmer: Smart antennas technology side of the cyber security is doing well into the next quarter.
Rick Clemmer: Right. As well as the next generation of the Interface Products.
Jeff Palmer: It's USB Type-C.
Rick Clemmer: Right. So the USB Type-C we are beginning to see the initial activity associated with that as well, Ross.
Ross Seymore: Great. I guess my follow-up on the SCD side of things. You mentioned a couple of different dynamics that Android was weak in China, we are all aware of that. And then a little bit of a slowdown in the mobile wallet adoption. I notice in your press release and in the presentation that you didn’t do anything to change the longer-term yearly growth rates of SCD and I appreciate one month or one quarter doesn’t cause you to really revisit that. But how do you see those markets actually re-accelerating? Do you think that Android weakness is something that will be pervasive for a while or just kind of more of a clause that you use to describe the entire industry earlier?
Rick Clemmer: So Ross, I think that it gets down to features, I think when you look at it clearly wallet has been very successful vis-a-vis Android and the features and with the high-end user appetite associated with it. When you think about the opportunity in China, I think with the current delayed deployment associated with that it pushes out some of the implementations of the mobile wallet in the Android platforms that are waiting to be in a position to drive that. So I think that's really more of a temporary pause. I don’t think that you see any fundamental significant changes associated with it. I think there is still the appetite by the users but it's all about the applications and the capability that different companies are able to bring. I think we have seen that clearly play out with what's happened with the announcement associated with some of the results of the latest products that have been released, such as the new Samsung platform. But I don't think it really changes the long-term outlook at all. I think it's more of just a near-term blip associated with it, more than any fundamental changes in the long-term growth of it.
Ross Seymore: Great. Thank you.
Rick Clemmer: Thanks, Ross.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie with Raymond James. Your line is now open.
Steve Smigie: Great. Just wanted to follow-up a little bit on the auto business. Rick you have kind of addressed it already in terms of its one month of weakness in China. But just in terms of if you see that kind of weakness, is that something if it were going to impact you that would have likely already occurred and so you sort of passed that or is that something that causes the customers to sort of back off in the future? So just curious about the timing of when that impact might typically hit you?
Rick Clemmer: I think the one month reduction of auto demand in China clearly is probably played into the pool process because remember most of our customers we have, have remaining inventory and so we actually see that pretty real time from the demand levels associated with it. But I don't think it was overwhelming factor in the health of automotive industry. Based on what we see we think it was more of just a short term blip. We think that the overall demand for automotives is still quite positive in our product portfolio and the increases in market share we have continues to play out well.
Steve Smigie: Okay. And then just my follow-up is on your e-gov business showing some strength here. In the past you have provided some color on certain governments or organizations that are implementing programs. So maybe you might be able to give us some color there that could give us some sense as to the sustainability in that growth? And one quick housekeeping, I think AMS mentioned that they have purchased a small business from you. Was there any meaningful revenue impact for that in the Q3 guide?
Rick Clemmer: So first off on the e-gov side, we have always said that it's a lumpy business and we had talked about a specific program a couple of years ago because of the significant size associated with it. We don't see any individual government that's at the same scale model associated with it. It's going to continue to be lumpy. A lot of growth taking place in the Middle East and Africa on the government side but we wouldn't want to comment on any specific country, I don’t think. Relative to the housekeeping on AMS that was really a development project that we've had that wasn't as successful as we thought it could have been and we had to make some decisions about what we did. We have had a pretty good track record of investing in some development programs and if we don't feel that will meet our long-term objective then we will either shut them down or sell those businesses and in this case we sold that sensor business to AMS, which they believe with their margin structure and their company objectives, they can be successful with that business and we wish them well.
Peter Kelly: Normally we wouldn't mention it, but I know AMS was in the press release. It's about $1 million a quarter of costs that we will go with it.
Rick Clemmer: And no real revenue.
Peter Kelly: No revenue.
Steve Smigie: Thanks, guys, appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. Your line is now open.
Vijay Rakesh: Good quarter and sorry to guide in this very bad macro backdrop, I guess. There is two questions. One on the automotive side, if you look at the next six, 12 months what is on the big ramps you see there? And also on the ID side you mentioned in China you are seeing a dual interface ramp. How far are we into that ramp, are we 20% done of the beginning? Can you give us some color to both, thanks?
Rick Clemmer: So on the dual interface we have talked about we are towards the tail end of that ramp associated with China. By the end of this year they have indicated that specifically that you cannot use a card that is not dual interface. So I would say if you put it in baseball terms, we are probably in the seventh or eighth inning associated with that. It's not like we are early on in the ramp associated with it.
Peter Kelly: But then also remember, we do see replacement orders afterwards, over time.
Rick Clemmer: Right. But it's not a one end down type of a marketplace.
Peter Kelly: Yes. But the ramp is kind of a…
Rick Clemmer: And I forgot your second question, I apologize.
Vijay Rakesh: It is an Automotive, as you look at the next six, 12 months, you know what are the ramps you are seeing there?
Rick Clemmer: We continue to see the ramp of some of our new engagements that we started several years ago. In automotive terms that's a new ramp associated within on the remote keyless entry. And then we see the growth towards the end of 2017 in the first vehicle-to-vehicle design win that we had associated with design win that will be rolled out in the 2017 model year. We think there are some opportunities out, in four to six quarters on some of the security products associated with it, but we have to be able to actually confirm those and be in a position to deliver that. But it clearly - when you think about the relationship we have with automotive customers and the strength we have with our security portfolio the opportunity is there for us to really be a significant participant in securing of the car.
Peter Kelly: Vijay if I could just add. We are not changing any of our long term growth rates that we have provided last year at our analyst day and we have said in the past we thought our auto group to kind of grow high single digits over three year CAGR. So it's really - it's not about individual design sockets in the auto businesses. It's more about a multigenerational trend of the revenue growth.
Vijay Rakesh: Got it. And one last question if I may. On the foundry side where are you guys now? Is it like 40% outsourced, do you intend to increase it, keep it at the same level? Thanks, that's it.
Peter Kelly: We are about 50% outsourced on our IC business and it will continue to grow over time because effectively all of our revenue growth is sourced externally. So as we grow, next year to being $10 billion revenue company and ultimately but then to $20 billion, you are going to see more and more of our - as a percent of our supply being external.
Vijay Rakesh: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Your line is now open.
Tore Svanberg: Thank you. Nice quarter. First question, some of your peers have talked about bookings being weak earlier in the quarter, but now early in this quarter actually starting to see some stabilization. I don’t know if that's a comment you share.
Rick Clemmer: I think we are not going to get into that. The truth is bookings bounce around on a week by week basis and I think it's hard to draw any real conclusion based on any near-term basis. I think we try to give you the best outlook that we had within everything that we see taking into consideration. But you know the trends on a week by week basis are so much influenced by other factors that I think it's hard to draw a real trend based on kind of the near term weekly impact.
Tore Svanberg: That's very fair and as my follow-up you mentioned USB Type-C. I was just wondering, where NXP participates there, is it on the interface side, is it on the cable or both? If you could just add some color to that, that would be great. Thanks.
Peter Kelly: Actually I think Tore, we think we can participate in just about all parts of the USB Type-C marketplace, both in handsets and in PCs. You probably won't see us on the real low end, aftermarket dongle, where there just could be some really low end products. We see that market being maybe $1.4 billion and TAM's size on 2017. We think we can get our arms on their share of market share there. Guiding principle always been high R&S.
Rick Clemmer: The real key is the fundamental capability is not just about the silicon per se, but it's the ability to bring power and data and the real universal basis associated with it and we are working with all the leading customers on the implementation associated with that and think that our demonstration of our capability and leadership in that area will be well put, well served here.
Tore Svanberg: That's really helpful. Thank you guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Your line is now open.
Stacy Rasgon: Hi, guys thanks for taking my questions. First on the OpEx I just wanted to verify, you have said you have delayed some hiring because of Freescale. But the OpEx control we have seen at this point, I just wonder really if this does not have anything to do with the synergies or the synergies that you are looking for are still in front of us and they can layer in on top of the current OpEx certainly?
Peter Kelly: The way we have said you should look at your synergies is you take your forecast for NXP, your forecast for Freescale, add them together and add $500 million of profit. So it's all intact. But we are not guiding synergies of this quarter's OpEx level. That's kind of irrelevant.
Rick Clemmer: So Stacy I think the key message we are trying to get across is we've been really very thoughtful of having people additions in the near term because of the fact, with a combination of both organizations we know that in driving those synergies there's going to be a number of people that are going to be affected. So we want to be sure that we have then minimized the disruption by not significantly adding people in the current period, that then might take jobs that we would have the ability to place people with the right skills associated with the integration. So it's really trying to be very thoughtful about the combination and how we can be in the best position moving forward associated with it and it gives us some advantages in the near term because we are not ramping people additions as we would have originally planned associated with it/ So that's really what we're trying to communicate Stacy.
Stacy Rasgon: Thank you very much that's helpful. I could ask - well go ahead…
Peter Kelly: There's one thing on that. The other thing I would say is there is as you would expect as we go into a merger kind of some noise around our results. But I have just two things I would like to pick out really. One is the fact that kind of now on a standalone basis I think I can run 9% SG&A. So I think that's a 100 basis point improvement over what we said previously. And the other thing is and I am not sure if I have picked what the total is, we are carrying $10 million more interest cost per quarter because of the merger than you otherwise would have seen. So everything else being equal, our guidance for Q3 would have been $1.54, if I haven't kind of put that definitely. So you are all going to see some noise in the next quarter or two, but I think all the signals are very positive at the moment.
Stacy Rasgon: Got it. It's very helpful. Thank you. If I could do one quick follow-up on gross margins. You had a little bit of upside this quarter and you have got a little bit of upside in guidance for next quarter. Can you give us some feeling on the drivers of that, is it mix pricing efficiency or something else? And if FX has had any impact on any of the numbers in the quarter?
Peter Kelly: Okay. So I guess a couple of things. On gross margin no one big thing. You see lots of moving parts. We have our regular ASP changes, continuing cost reduction and mix probably in those orders. But it's slowly creeping up, which I think is really good news. FX as we said earlier, although FX impacts are revenue, because this is about 14% of our revenue is denominated in Euros. We also have costs in OpEx that are denominated in Euros. So they kind of offset each other, so there is no real impact at the EBIT level. I guess going from Q1 to Q2, revenue is on an about $7 million headwind, which was kind of pretty much expected in our guidance.
Stacy Rasgon: Thank you guys.
Rick Clemmer: Thanks a lot.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Your line is now open.
Ambrish Srivastava: Thank you. Rick, you have been pretty good about articulating and then acting on that and I am referring to businesses that you don’t deem to be core to NXP portfolio and strategy. So if I think about wireless infrastructure, now that you have sold the NXPPs, so you would in effect be competing with the Chinese entities. And AT&T recently was asked about what does 5G do to CapEx and they said well SDN will have an impact of lowering capital intensity. So is wireless infra something and not just because I'm negative on the volatility, semis and volatility go together. Is this an area that you see as something that fits into the NXP portfolio longer term? Thank you.
Rick Clemmer: Yes. I think that the one thing that we have to consider is with the transition with NXP's RF power business being sold to JAC and with us then acquiring the Freescale business. The Freescale business is the true industry leader associated with it. The margin performance of that business is clearly in line with kind of our HPMS business. But as we have talked about before we don't like the fundamental volatility of that business, not when it's going up as rapidly as it did beginning kind of late 2013 and throughout early 2014 and certainly not with the inventory correction that's taking place by the industry in Q3. But when you think about our strategy as far as really focusing on being able to drive secure connections for the smarter world, one of the key things associated with that is being able to provide the infrastructure to accomplish those secure connections. And both the network processor at Freescale as well as the RF power business clearly play a role in being able to facilitate that. So you know I think we are very focused on those businesses and how any of our businesses can be a true industry leader and drive the kind of profit performance that we think is in the best interest of our shareholders. And clearly we think that business has that. The downside is that you have clearly a more inherent volatility from a historic basis than what it has. I think we haven't had the opportunity to spend a lot of time with the Freescale team associated with it, but you know, clearly there are some emerging applications in RF power business that we think could be beneficial for the fundamental business stretching beyond just the base station market itself. So it definitely is a business that falls into the characteristics of our HPMS business from a profit performance viewpoint and a true industry leader where it's at least more than 50% larger than the number two player. And so I think we feel pretty good about it.
Ambrish Srivastava: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Mark Lipacis: Thanks for taking my question. Rick you mentioned integration planning on the Freescale and I was hoping you could provide some more color on that. To what extent when you close the deal will you have your sales and systems integrated? So if sales force is hitting the ground day one going after those revenue synergistic opportunities?
Rick Clemmer: Mark, we are making a very significant investment and the fact is Freescale talked about on their earnings call. We have joint teams across the company. I think we have 35 or 40 teams across with a person - at least one person from each company working on these. And so I think in total we have maybe a couple hundred people that are actually working on the integration planning with a significant portion of their time being focused on that. So I think the synergies in the opportunity to work together on the planning for the integration for day one we are making good progress on. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to be more excited talking with customers about the opportunity to bring the two product portfolios together. So the key for us is to get through the regulatory process, so we can be in at this position to move forward quickly. But our objective is to be in a strong position for day one where we can hit the ground running and be sure that we don’t miss a beat with any of our customers on support and being able to drive the business opportunities to be able to drive solutions that have a favorable impact on our customers as they try to address some of the specific areas combining security and the computing capability to really be able to address the expanding connected device market going forward.
Mark Lipacis: Thanks. That's helpful. Rick, a follow-up for you if I may. I was hoping you would share your view on where the semiconductor industry is in the consolidation cycle and how does that affect your view on sort of participating? That's all I have thanks.
Rick Clemmer: Thanks, Mark. I think the industry is clearly - we've been talking about this for a long time. I mean the industry has - the industry is maturing. We don't have the double-digit growth that we had on a historic basis. And so with the slowing great growth you see a need for companies to be able to actually view transactions to consolidate the industry, so that it can meet the requirements associated with shareholders. I think that you are going to continue to see more and more of that. I think when you think about it there's a large number of subscale semiconductor companies that cannot afford the long-term R&D investment, the intellectual property. The competitive manufacturing cost base is not having sufficient scale to be able to drive volumes with the foundries and the channeled market to be able to address that. So I think you'll continue to see a significant opportunities. For us the opportunity with Freescale is really not about scope or scale. It's really about addressing the Secure Connected Device market and being able to bring the combination of the strength that Freescale brings from the computing side with the strength that we have, NXP has, on the security side as well as the connectivity side to be able to drive a more complete solution as we think about the Connected Device market going forward. So ours is really clearly driven by a strategic combination that we think creates significant value associated with that for our customers. I think that going forward from a NXP viewpoint on the new NXP, we will continue to be focused on that. With the opportunities, as Peter said, by the summer of next year we will be back down below our 2x annualized EBITDA objective. So we will clearly have the opportunity to think about other alternatives that will bring a more complete solution for our customers as well as the opportunity to return capital to our shareholders. So I think we are early on and there is going to be continued activity associated with the consolidation of the industry.
Mark Lipacis: Thanks for those comments. Rick, they were very helpful.
Rick Clemmer: Thanks. Operator we will take one more question and then we will end the call today.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
John Pitzer: Yes, good morning guys. Thanks for letting me sneak in and congratulations on the strong results given the industry backdrop. Rick I was wondering, if I could talk a little bit about kind of your view of the industry backdrop and specifically I know it's not a focus of the company, but the Standard Products division tends to correlate most highly with the broad semiconductor market. You are guiding up sequentially in the September quarter which kind of implies that business is flat year over year. That's versus a lot of kind of the broad base peers that are guiding anywhere from down mid single digits to actually down high single digits year over year. So I was just kind of curious, as to why that business seems to be doing better? And in general you have a more positive backdrop I think than some of your peers about kind of the current market environment and while we externally look at the one or two drivers of sort of outperformance in revenue, I know internally you guys look at 56 different business lines. I am kind of curious, if you guys have sort of a breadth index that you look at that helps you kind of monitor where you think we are in the cycle and what that might be telling you?
Rick Clemmer: So breadth index sounds like it is something you need to take into account after you have been out and had a long night of drinking. But talking about our product portfolio, I think John specifically in Standard Products, I think we try to be specific associated with this. I think we see a cautious environment from our customers and distribution partners with some uncertainty. And part of that's driven from a macro basis as the GDP growth continues to get trimmed, if you will. So not significantly reduced, but more of a trimming associated with the overall economic outlook. And so that ends up having an impact on seeing from a semiconductor growth viewpoint. I think for our Standard Products business I think there's a couple of things coming into account. Q3 is usually our strongest quarter from a seasonal basis. So that's clearly one factor associated with it. We talked about our distribution inventory being beyond 2.3 months which is really kind of below or at the low end of the range that we would like to have. So clearly we need to be in a position where we increase our distribution inventories from where it is because we pay these guys a good margin and we want to be sure that they carry the inventory to be able to meet our customer requirements. So I clearly would like to see that distribution inventory level at a higher level than it was at the end of Q2. So I think all of that kind of comes into account with the outlook that we have, but from a general business environment viewpoint, I think we would say that it is clearly cautiously or more cautious than it was 90 days ago. But we do not see a precipitous decline associated with the overall demand. I think you see a lot of noise in the market from different companies with their outlook associated with it. Clearly that has to do a lot with individual company's performance as well as the overall marketplace itself. And I think it's hard to draw any conclusion about any individual company or any conclusion about the overall market from any individual company, including us. But on Standard Products itself, clearly I think the fact that seasonally Q3 is usually a pretty strong quarter and the fact that our distribution inventory levels are unreasonably low at the end of Q2 is clearly a factor relative to our guidance in the Standard Products business for Q3.
John Pitzer: That's really helpful. And then maybe a couple of quick ones for Peter. Peter, just relative to the high performance RF sale, should we assume a 1.5 point or so of headwind as we think about modeling December quarter growth or revenue? And then just I want to get some clarity around your comments today on operating margin and SG&A. Historically the narrative has sort of been we are going to target sort of off margin range and it would drift above that for any reason we are likely to reinvest the extra back into R&D to drive growth. I am just kind of curious and I know that standalone company targets are becoming less relevant given where you are in the merger, but should we start to think maybe that your historic off margin targets are wrong and too old because you are just seeing better scale availability?
Peter Kelly: Yes. I mean, let's take that one first. We have said historically 26% and we are running 28% at the moment. I put that down to two things. I mean as a standalone company, where 28% is actually okay and it's two things. One is, I am convinced now we can run SG&A at 9% instead of 10%. And then the one that's kind of interesting is Standard Products they just performed absolutely brilliantly and with depending on how you look at that our guidance has been more around the fact that maybe they should run high teens rather than 23% EBIT. So we took them back to kind of high teens, that's another 1%. So my 26% going to 28% is strictly a better performance in SG&A and Standard Products are performing better than they expected. And what we are not sure about at the moment is that a temporary thing or is that something they can continue to run with. And to be honest it just looks like the guys are doing a brilliant job and that's what they can run with. So I am very pleased that we are up for good to kind of 28%. And neither those two things I talked about kind of impact our investment in the company at the R&D level. In terms of RF power it's kind of hard to kind of give guidance. I mean what we have said historically is it's - I think it's a very - well about $450 million business a year and it runs at kind of HPMS margin levels. So, yes, it just depends what you think it might be in Q4. We certainly give it up trying to predict what the base station OEMs are doing with their inventory level.
John Pitzer: That's helpful, thanks guys.
Rick Clemmer: Thanks John.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back to Rick Clemmer for closing remarks.
Rick Clemmer: Thank you operator. So just to summarize once again for the quarter. The revenue of $1.51 billion up 12% year on year we believe continues to outperform our peer group average in Q2 by roughly 2x, continuing the trend that we've been able to establish over the last few years. We grew operating profit 25% year-on-year to 27.8%, actually setting a record for the company and earnings-per-share growth of 32%, again setting a record for the company. So we continue to feel very good about the financial performance of the company and what we've been able to deliver. In addition we generated $262 million of free cash flow up 71% year on year, setting a good strategic position to be able to support the financial requirements associated with the merger with Freescale. So again we believe we are well-positioned to deliver on our long-term strategy and thank all of our shareholders for the continued support. I guess I would like to also be sure that we thank all of the NXP and Freescale employees for all of their hard work on delivering the results as we prepare for the pending merger once we get the regulatory approval. Thank you very much and have a great day.
Jeff Palmer: Thank you everyone.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q1 2015 NXP Semiconductors Earnings Conference Call. My name is Caroline, and I'm your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] Now I would like to hand over to Mr. Jeff Palmer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.
Jeff Palmer: Great. Thank you, Caroline, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the NXP Semiconductors First Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. With me on the call today is Rick Clemmer, NXP's President and CEO; and Peter Kelly, NXP's CFO. If you've not obtained a copy of our first quarter 2015 earnings press release, it can be found in our company website under the Investor Relations section at nxp.com. Additionally, we have posted on our Investor Relations website a supplemental earnings summary presentation and a document of our historical financials to assist you in your modeling efforts. This call is being recorded and will be available for replay on our corporate website. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause NXP's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the macroeconomic impact on specific end markets in which we operate, the sale of new and existing products and our expectations for financial results for the second quarter of 2015. Please be reminded that NXP undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements. For a full disclosure on forward-looking statements, please refer to our press release. Additionally, during our call today, we'll make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the impact of purchase price accounting, restructuring, stock-based compensation, impairment and other charges that are driven primarily by discrete events that management does not consider to be directly related to NXP's underlying core operating performance. Pursuant to Regulation G, NXP has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our first quarter 2015 press release, which will be furnished to the SEC on Form 6-K and is available on NXP's website, again, at the Investor Relations site at nxp.com. Before we start the call today, I'd like to highlight a couple of investor events we'll be attending during the quarter. On May 12, we'll attend the Jefferies TMT Conference in Miami. On May 19, we'll be attending the JP Morgan TMT Conference in Boston. And on June 2, we'll be attending the BofA Merrill Lynch TMT Conference in San Francisco. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Rick. Rick?
Richard L. Clemmer: Thanks, Jeff, and welcome, everyone, to our earnings call today. Our first quarter results were quite strong, with improved product mix driving better profitability, which resulted in earnings per share at the high end of our guidance range. Specifically, NXP delivered total revenue of $1.47 billion, up nearly 18% from the year-ago period. We are down about 5% sequentially, in line with our guidance range despite the strengthening of the U.S. dollar during the quarter. Our product mix was better than planned, allowing us to deliver significantly better profitability. Turning to our segment performance. HPMS revenue was $1.1 billion, up 21% on year-on-year and down about 6% sequentially. From a product line perspective, within Automotive, revenue was $302 million, up about 9% from the same period a year ago and up just over 3% sequentially, driven by the continued demand for entertainment and in-vehicle networking products. In Secure Connected Devices, revenue was $289 million, up 61% from the same period in the prior year, but down 17% sequentially, driven by the anticipated seasonality in the smartphone, tablet and emerging wearables market, as weaker demand for our mobile audio products designed into Android smartphones for the emerging market. In the Secure Interfaces and Power group, revenue was $291 million, up 44% from the same period in the prior year, but down 5% sequentially. During the quarter, we continued to see accelerating traction for our RF small signal, our smart antenna solutions. This was offset by stronger-than-anticipated headwinds in our Lighting business as the LED lighting market continues to rapidly commoditize. Revenue in Secure Identification Solutions was $222 million, down 13% from the same period in the prior year and flat sequentially. During the quarter, we began to see incremental improvement in the bankcard market, with positive trends in both China and the U.S. Finally, turning to the Standard Products segment. Revenue was $323 million, up 9% compared to the year-ago period and down about 2% from the prior quarter. Turning now to our distribution channel performance. Total sales into distribution were down 12%, with sales out of distribution also down 12%. The total months of inventory in the distribution channel were 2.5 months, in line with our long-term targets. Absolute dollars of inventory in the channel declined about 5% on a sequential basis. Before turning the call over to Peter, I'd like to provide you with an update on the announced merger between NXP and Freescale Semiconductor. We believe, when completed, this merger will create a true High Performance Mixed Signal powerhouse. We are making good progress on the integration planning of the 2 companies and are working through the regulatory process. We continue to expect the merger closing in the second half of 2015. We are very pleased with the significant integration planning activity taking place, which should assure a successful day 1 execution of the merger. As we progress through the process, I want to personally thank all the NXP and Freescale employees for their continued focus, diligence and openness to change. Overshadowed by the Freescale merger announcement, we also completed 2 smaller, strategic tuck-in acquisitions during the quarter. First, we completed the acquisition of Quintic Bluetooth LE -- low power energy assets, helping to round out our low-power RF connectivity portfolio focused on the requirements for the smarter world applications as well as helping NXP to continue to engage and more fully support our Chinese customers. Secondly, we completed the acquisition of Athena, an extremely well-respected security software vendor, which will complement our industry-leading SmartMX Java card operating system. These 2 technology acquisitions taken, together with the transformative Freescale merger, will help NXP continue to deliver on its vision for secure connections for a smarter world. In summary, Q1 results were very good. We continue to deliver strong earnings growth and at the same time, invest in the business to fuel future growth. We continue to expand our true industry leadership, focused on delivering differentiated product solutions, which will create significant value for our customers and shareholders. We continue to improve our profitability and have confidence in our medium-term growth targets. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Peter to discuss the financial details of the quarter.
Peter Kelly: Thank you, Rick, and good morning to everyone on today's call. As Rick has already covered the drivers of revenue during the quarter, I'll move to the financial highlights. In summary, Q1 was a very strong quarter in what is generally our weakest period. We delivered just over 26% non-GAAP operating profit due to a much stronger product mix. As a result, non-GAAP EPS was $1.35, which was at the high end of our guidance. Cash flow continues to be very strong. Focusing on the details of Q1. Total revenue was $1.47 billion, up nearly 18% year-on-year. This was pretty much in line with our expectations, though there were some weaknesses in mobile audio and LED lighting partially offset by small upsides in other parts of the business. We generated $711 million in non-GAAP gross profit and reported a non-GAAP gross margin of 48.5%. Turning to the operating segments. Within the HPMS segment, revenue was $1.1 billion, up 21% year-on-year, but down about 6% over the previous quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was 54.3%, 320 basis points above the fourth quarter, driven by the expected recovery in our product mix. Non-GAAP operating margin improved to 28.9%, driven by this mix improvement. Within our Standard Products segment, revenue was $323 million, up over 9% year-on-year, though down just over 2% versus the fourth quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was 35%, an 80 basis points improvement versus the prior quarter, again driven by better mix. Non-GAAP operating margin was 22.9%, a 210 basis points increase sequentially driven by the better mix and reduced operating expenses. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $326 million, down $4 million on a sequential basis. From a total operating profit perspective, non-GAAP operating profit was $385 million and represents a 26.2% operating margin, a significant milestone in what is typically our weakest quarter. Interest expense was $36 million, noncontrolling interest was $17 million and cash taxes were $4 million. This resulted in total NXP non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.35 and was at the higher end of our guidance, up nearly 38% year-on-year and flat as compared to the fourth quarter. Stock-based compensation, which is not included in our non-GAAP earnings, was $35 million. Now I'd like to turn to the changes in our cash and debt. Our total debt at the end of Q1 was $4 billion. Cash generation was very strong, with total cash of $170 million to $1.4 billion, even as we invested just over $100 million in acquisitions. Net debt improved to $2.7 billion. We exited the quarter with a trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.74 billion, and our ratio of net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of the first quarter was 1.55x. Our non-GAAP interest coverage increased to 10.7x. Turning to working capital metrics. Days of inventory were 92 days, an increase of 9 days. Days receivable were 34 days, an increase of 2 days sequentially, while days payable were 90 days, an increase of 10 days. Taken together, our cash conversion cycle was 36 days versus 35 days in the prior quarter. Cash flow from operations was $368 million. Our net CapEx was $80 million, resulting in non-GAAP free cash flow of $288 million. Now I'd like to provide our outlook for the second quarter. We currently anticipate total revenue will be in the range of up 1% to up 5% sequentially. And at the midpoint, we expect total revenue to be up about 3%, reflecting the following trends in the business: Auto is expected to be up in the low single-digit range; Secure Identification Solutions is expected to be up in the mid-teens range; Secure Connected Devices is expected to be down in the low single-digit range; Secure Interface and Power is expected to be up in the low single-digit range; Standard Products is expected to be flat sequentially; and we anticipate revenue from the combination of manufacturing and Corporate & Other to be approximately $38 million. Taken together, total NXP revenue should be in the range of $1.48 billion to $1.53 billion or about $1.51 billion at the midpoint. We expect non-GAAP gross profit to be about 48.5%, and operating expenses are expected to be up $6 million to $333 million. This translates into a non-GAAP operating profit in the range of $387 million to $414 million or about 26.5% operating margin at the midpoint. Interest expense will be approximately $34 million. Cash taxes are expected to be roughly $11 million, and noncontrolling interest should be around $21 million. Stock-based comp should be about $37 million, which is excluded from our guidance, and the diluted share count is assumed to be 243 million shares. Taken together, this translates into non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $1.33 to $1.43 or $1.38 per share at the midpoint of our guidance. Finally, I'd like to give you some color on our full-year revenue estimate. At the Analyst Day, we spoke about our plans to grow revenue well in excess of the market on a compound annual basis. Given the upcoming merger with Freescale, we thought it's important to keep the focus on our performance as a stand-alone company. So from now through the close, we plan to give you an update on our expected revenue performance for the full year of 2015. As for our latest forecast, we expect total revenue for the company for the full year of 2015 to be in the range of $6.2 billion to $6.3 billion. We think our quarterly profile will be slightly different in 2015 compared to previous years and would expect our revenue to grow 5% to 7% sequentially in each of the third and the fourth quarters. With that, I'd like to turn it back to the operator for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Stand by for your first question, which comes from the line of Ross Seymore.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: The first question is for Rick. Can you just talk about what you're seeing in the general market? It looks like your guidance is solid for the second quarter but slightly below normal seasonality. Can you just talk about what you're seeing from a bookings perspective, whether by end market, graphically, however you think would be most instructive for us?
Richard L. Clemmer: Yes. So I would say that, Ross, we kind of continue to see the market in general in line with what we've talked about, okay, but not great. Certainly not booming, but we see the market okay. A little different than maybe some of our peers have talked about. I think we all are faced with some implications of currency, which clearly had a couple of points impact on us and will. So I think currency is an overall impact that, for us, we're naturally hedged at the bottom line, so it doesn't have a bottom line impact on earnings, but it does have an impact on sales. But for the general market, I think we'd see things pretty good. Clearly, if you get in the handset or the smartphone space, there are the haves and the have-nots, some doing better than others. And so it kind of depends on where you're positioned. Clearly, we talked about banking beginning to look a little stronger. So some of the areas that we're to exposed to are not really in the typical semiconductor market, I would say. But the general semiconductor market we see is okay. Not great, certainly not declining. A little better than what maybe some of our peers have talked about, but we certainly have a different mix of products than most of our peers.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: I guess as my follow-up, in the SIS segment, you're finally looking for that snapback that we've been waiting for and getting closer to that 3-year CAGR of 10% you talked about -- or at least sequentially improving like that. Can you talk a little bit about what's driving that mid-teens guidance and how sustainable that is going forward?
Richard L. Clemmer: Well, I think we've always talked about this whole space is somewhat lumpy. As we rolled the China contactless banking, clearly, we had a significant uptick back a couple of years ago with the -- just filling the supply chain. We've been, as we talked about, a little more cautious on the ramp-up of U.S. banking than a lot of people have talked about. But I think we are beginning to see some positive effects. We are beginning to see some real movement in the contactless portion as well, where now some of the leading suppliers like AMEX now is focused on dual interface, the contactless card actually for their high-end users to be able to drive that ease-of-use and convenience, which is going to be the standard, basically, in China now. But all parts of it, including e-government, banking and transit, are all up. So we're seeing a broad-based general improvement, which is, as we've talked about all along, we have confidence in. We just think the market in that space is going to continue to be somewhat lumpy. But on the general overall basis, over the 3-year period of time, we feel very comfortable with that growth rate that we've talked about.
Operator: The next question we have comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Rick, I'm curious on the status of divesting your Auto's power amplifier business and the filing for the regulatory approval. I think in the last filing, you were planning to file for the regulatory approval on April 30, which is today. So I'm just wondering what the key milestones are from here.
Richard L. Clemmer: Well, I think that filing that we talked about on April 30, we've actually already done, so we're a little bit ahead of schedule on that, if I'm not mistaken. So I think that's progressing quite well. Actually in dialogue with some of the governments relative to that. So I think we're making good progress on the filings. On -- all of it is -- a requirement associated with giving the regulatory approval is selling our RF power business because the 2 combined are obviously very large. We have now received interest levels from quite a number of entities. We've actually narrowed that down and have entered a process to try to get to an agreement here over the next couple of months. So we're making good progress and on track, as I would say, to be able to support the requirements that we need to able to get the regulatory approval associated with the merger with Freescale.
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Got it. And as my follow-up, Peter, can you give us some more color on what's prompting this change in seasonality? I believe you mentioned seasonality could be different. And in general, what's the rationale for providing a full-year outlook? Do you have better visibility than before? I'm just curious why the change in the way you provide guidance.
Peter Kelly: Well, there's a couple of things, really, Vivek. One is as we talked to you and your colleagues over the last few months, we understand how difficult it is to really predict how we may do in any 1 quarter. And I have to be honest. I think using the word term seasonality is a bit loose at best anyway because it's really the sum of 56 different BLs doing what they do on a daily basis. And just as I look at what's out there, I think you guys were looking at what's happened historically. And we're coming up with a good view of what might happen in 2015, but with the wrong profile. So I wanted to make sure you understand -- understood what we thought we really could be, given our visibility into our individual businesses. I think the other thing as well is with the merger, I think there's a real opportunity to forget that there's 2 really fantastic businesses here. And although it's important to be focused on what we can do together, you need to keep an eye on how we're doing as an individual company. And I thought this was a way to bring your attention to that. And I think it shows we're confident that we're in line with our medium-term goals that we set at the Analyst Day back in November.
Richard L. Clemmer: And clearly, we had more confidence associated with it just being able to talk about that. But it's -- as we talked about, the market environment is okay. It's not off to the races. But it's consistent with the background to give you the perspective that we have for our revenue.
Peter Kelly: So I'm sure our lawyers will point to the safe harbor statement, Vivek, and tell you, you can't really believe what we're saying on a forward-looking basis.
Operator: The next question we have comes from the line of Blayne Curtis from Barclays.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I just wanted to follow up on the prior question. I agree with your comment on seasonality. It's tough to pin down. But I guess Q3 has been historically a better quarter from you -- for you than Q4. So is the way to look at it that you're kind of stealing from September a little bit and it's helping June? And that -- then December could be a little bit better? Or do you have some catalysts in December? Kind of what's behind the kind of the more muted September, but then December is typically weak for you, have been down sometimes, but it looks like you're going to see some strong growth?
Peter Kelly: Well, we do say no good deal goes unpunished, right? And so I was hoping you'd see it in a more positive fashion than we were trying to do what you suggested. No, not at all. I think Q2 is a good quarter. Rick mentioned there is a bit of a headwind from exchange rates. Q3 is a really strong quarter, and Q4 is a strong quarter as well. So no, there's nothing untoward. Basically, we have a really, really strong business. We think the way you should be looking at it is how we'll perform over the next 3 years, which is we'll grow well in excess of the market at every level -- at very strong levels of profitability. And then on top of that, you're going to add a really terrific business, which is Freescale. So we thought we'd give you a bit more visibility.
Richard L. Clemmer: But I do think you should look at last year. Q4 was actually up in last year from Q3. So I think that the point is, is things continue to evolve. I don't think you can really get too much into seasonality. It's really important that you kind of look at where the ramp-up is taking place with the end products that we're shipping to.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I gave you a compliment, actually. The full year of being pretty close to consensus, given the environment is pretty, actually, impressive, also with your euro exposure. So I was just curious on the slope of it, why the change. Maybe on the interface side, you always get the question on RF, I'll ask it again. I mean, you highlighted Lighting being weak, and your actual result in March wasn't so bad. So are you still seeing decent trends in that HPRF business?
Richard L. Clemmer: We are. I mean, it clearly is beginning to come more into balance as opposed to the shortage that we've had for an extended period of time, where we couldn't fulfill the requirements of our customers. So I would say we're coming more in line from a balance viewpoint. And we've always said that as we get to a point, we think it would flatten out for a basis, and I think that's kind of in line with what we're talking about, Blayne. We don't see a precipitous decline, but we don't see it continuing to grow as aggressively as it has over the last few quarters.
Operator: The next question we have comes from the line of Jim Covello from Goldman Sachs.
James V. Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Just kind of continuing on the theme. It's very helpful to get a color on the back half of the year. Which segments could drive the better-than-historical numbers in the back half of the year?
Peter Kelly: I think at this point, Jim, we're not going to go into the individual businesses. Overall, we think each of the businesses have opportunity for strength. Probably, the obvious one to pull out is the toughest quarter of all is, for Standard Products, is the fourth quarter. But I think all of our businesses will do well as we go forward.
James V. Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: So maybe I'll just use that as my follow-up, then. So the idea would be that each of the segments would be different than what we've seen in the past as opposed to any one segment driving outsized growth?
Peter Kelly: There might be.
Richard L. Clemmer: Yes. I think we see a good, solid acceptance across the board, and we're confident with the improved outlook really across the board, Jim. So I don't think you can point to any specific area. Secured Connected Devices continues to grow very strongly as does the Interface and Power. So we have all the growth drivers in place that's allowed us to be in a position to continue to outgrow the industry significantly and plan to continue to do that.
Peter Kelly: Yes. I think -- I mean, if you look at '14, you can see basically all of our businesses had a profile not dissimilar to what we've just described actually.
Operator: The next question we have comes from the line of John Pitzer from Crédit Suisse.
John William Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Rick, I wanted to talk a little bit more about the Secure Connected Devices business. I was a little bit surprised that it was the audio that was the headwind in the calendar first quarter. I wonder if you could just talk about the trends you're seeing in the mobile payment side. And I guess, as you go into the back half of the year, at least on a year-over-year basis within that product line, you're starting to come up against some really difficult compares. Do you think that you can continue to grow that business year-over-year in the calendar third and calendar fourth quarter? And if you do, can you just help us better understand kind of what some of those bottoms-up drivers might be, given that you're anniversary-ing some pretty good content wins as you get back to the back half of the year?
Richard L. Clemmer: So just to put a precursor, I don't think we want to get into any level of detail on doing projections for -- by quarter for the second half of the year, John. But I will tell you that what we talked about in the audio, it's probably driven as much as anything by some of the delays of the actual processor, where some of the Android platforms were slipped out based on that. So we saw a pause here with some of the audio products that we shipped based on that. So it's really more associated with the delay in the processor and the new phone introductions that slipped our audio product in the near term. Relative to mobile payments, we expect to continue to see strong growth there. I think it's going to be dependent upon the industry continuing to see that, but we see a lot of opportunities because you begin to think about wearables that have mobile payments associated with it, which there's one that's been announced now between American Express and Jawbone. So we see those things that kind of cross over between mobile payments and our banking business. So it gets kind of hard to distinguish between the 2, but the user case is very powerful and very compelling, and you can see how a number of things would continue to drive that very strongly. Clearly, one of the things that's going to be important is just how successful Apple Pay is in China to be able to set that overall marketplace, where all the other smartphone companies have to be in a position to offer the same capability. So I think those are the key factors that really builds our confidence and the reason why we feel as comfortable as we do relative to the revenue.
John William Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: That's helpful, Rick. And then maybe just as a clarification follow-up. I think you mentioned in your prepared comments that currency was a 200-basis-point headwind. I guess, if you look at sort of the full year guide you're giving, it's about plus or minus 10% growth. Would it have been 12% without currency? And then maybe you can just help me understand specifically how currency kind of flows through the model. I understand the fact that it's not really an EPS hit. I'm just kind of curious where in your revenue buckets does currency have the biggest impact.
Peter Kelly: It's -- I guess, it's kind of a slippery slope, really. About 15% of our revenue is euro-denominated. And if you look at last year, last year, currency was kind of $1.37 in the first half, and I think it went down to about $1.20 something by fourth quarter. And it's -- right now, it's about $1.09. So I think if you do the math, you can probably easily see 200 basis points there, John. I mean, it never quite works out like that because different businesses do different things at different times, and we're constantly renegotiating things with different customers. And probably without going into real specifics, Auto and Standard Products have a bigger exposure to the euro than anyone else, but everyone has just some exposure.
Richard L. Clemmer: Your basic assumption's kind of in the ballpark. I mean, we're not giving into the specific details because for us, the key is we have it hedged on an earnings basis. And -- but it is giving us some headwinds in terms of revenue. And you're in the right kind of ballpark with incremental growth we could have achieved if we wouldn't have had the headwinds from currency.
Peter Kelly: [indiscernible] right. He judges on what we deliver.
Operator: The next question we have comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore ISI.
Christopher J. Muse - Evercore ISI, Research Division: I guess, first question on margins. You did a great job there. And curious, how much of that was mix? How much of that was FX-related? Then how much in terms of improvements that we might see sustainable through the year?
Peter Kelly: Okay. So on EBIT margin, none of it was FX. We have a pretty much a complete hedge in the sense that although our revenue is impacted, we also have cost in euros as well, so it doesn't impact our operating margins. In terms of our operating margin improvement, it was mostly mixed, and most of it was forecasted in the sense of our guidance. We did a little bit better because we did have an even better mix than we thought. So that's the -- that was the big movement.
Richard L. Clemmer: And obviously, our Q2 guidance, it's sustainable.
Peter Kelly: Yes, yes.
Christopher J. Muse - Evercore ISI, Research Division: Excellent. And then I guess as a follow-up, can you talk about, I guess, the banking card market? You spoke earlier about the lumpiness there. But curious where you stand today. Clearly, great growth into Q2. What kind of visibility do you have into the back half there?
Richard L. Clemmer: I think we have fair visibility. I wouldn't say that it's -- we have all the orders in place, so I don't want to mislead you. But I think we have fair visibility associated with it. We clearly see an environment that is improving, as we said in the remarks, from where it's been. So I think that's encouraging. The one thing that I would like to focus on is when you look at the implementation in the U.S., as it moves from just contact EMV to contactless, to me, that's more encouraging than anything. And now, seeing some of those successes, and clearly, with the technology that's being used in like the wearables, as I mentioned earlier, the Jawbone device that's being done in conjunction with American Express, also contributing towards that. So that ease of use that comes from the contactless banking is really the key for us. And one of the reasons that we have continued to be encouraged about this over the 3-year growth rate that we've talked about is because of some of those used cases that we knew that were in the process of being developed that are now being rolled out.
Operator: The next question we have comes from the line of from Chris Caso from Susquehanna Financial Group.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: First question is regarding operating margins for the full year. And given your comments on the full year revenue outlook, how should we think about operating margins? You got to -- what I think was a goal in HPS -- HPMS operating margin [indiscernible] first quarter. Does that allow a little bit of upside versus your earlier goals for your operating margins for the full year?
Peter Kelly: Well, I think we've been pretty clear that we're not going to guide full year operating margins. You're right, our goal is hit 26%. So we did say on the last call that we think, as time goes on, we think we're -- we'll be able to do better than that. But no, I don't think it's sensible at this point in time for it to guide operating margins.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay, fair enough. Second question is regard to channel inventories. And you talked about channel inventories coming down a bit in dollars in the first quarter. I guess, first, to what extent does that provide -- as the channel reduces inventory somewhat, does that provide a headwind to revenue? And then, I guess, going forward, I think your comment last quarter indicated you sort of thought that the inventory levels we're seeing in the channel now were a bit low. Where do you think they go in the back half of the year, particularly if you see some of the strength in the second half that you've been talking about seasonally?
Richard L. Clemmer: So I guess, we think the channel inventory, it gets hard because there is so much pressure that you guys put on the major U.S. guys per turns and urns that they really try to force the inventory down, where, clearly, we'd like to be sure there's more inventory in the channel to be able to fulfill the customary requirements associated with it. I think the decline that we saw was basically just mix-oriented because if you look at it, our shipments in and shipments out in the quarter were both down about the same. So I think it was really more mixed than a true decline associated with inventory. We're still at about 2.5 months. Frankly, we'd like to be pushing a little bit higher than that, but it's not like it's off that much on a -- and it's really different product line by product line. So I think the inventory in the channel is clearly very healthy. There could be -- we could certainly stand for there to be a little more inventory in the channel. As far as having an implication on the second half revenue, we don't think that will be a real issue associated with it. And we continue to work with our good, strategic partners in distribution to be in a position to try to drive the -- to drive more growth because our growth in distribution, frankly, hasn't been quite as strong as it has been in some of the other areas.
Operator: The next question we have comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava from BMO.
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets Equity Research: A couple of questions, guys. First of all, on the -- you mentioned the weakness on the smart audio from Android handsets. Is that -- in your opinion, is that channel inventory along with demand weakness being worked down? And when do you see that bottoming out? And the second question, Rick, you talked about Lighting being rapidly approaching commodity. So that doesn't sound like something that would fit into your product portfolio profile. Should we be expecting that to be divested at some point? And then kind of related to that, how big is it as a mix of your total business?
Richard L. Clemmer: So a number of questions loaded in there. So clearly, on the audio case, this is about new model rollouts. It's not about channel inventory at all. So as there's been a delay in some of the processors, which has delayed some of the new model rollouts, we've seen a little bit of delay of some of the audio products, so not anything material. The design wins are still in place, but the ramp-up is not taking place because those new models have been pushed out.
Peter Kelly: But we do expect it to grow in Q2.
Richard L. Clemmer: Yes, sorry. And then your other question, sorry?
Peter Kelly: And we don't talk about M&A.
Richard L. Clemmer: Oh, yes. So we talked about Lighting being in intensive care. So it's not something that's new. But clearly, the environment is not a positive environment associated with it. As far as percentage of revenue, it gets lost in the rounding for us in total.
Operator: The next question we have comes from the line of William Stein from SunTrust.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: I'm hoping you can talk a bit about the timing and expected financial impact from the announced JAC joint venture in China.
Richard L. Clemmer: So they -- the -- that's really pretty immaterial. That's just our Bipolar Power business, which is basically triax for home appliances. We probably won't close the transaction since they're more of a financial rather than a strategic entity. We're in the process of the final due diligence. And I wouldn't anticipate that the transaction would close until sometime in maybe October 1 or...
Peter Kelly: Yes, maybe like Q3.
Richard L. Clemmer: Yes.
Peter Kelly: Or Q4. I'm glad you added that comment. You even actually said we said I don't expect it will close.
Richard L. Clemmer: No, I was trying to get the specifics of when it is. But -- so it's just not a priority business for us. It actually -- one of the key things for us is this is another area, where we're trying to look at different ways to do business in China. I think it's important to recognize we've done a joint venture with Datang. We've done -- now this a joint venture associated with it. We have a number of other joint ventures. We're really trying to continue to work all different avenues to be able to continue to do business in China with the changing regulatory requirements and the changing demand requirements associated with it. So it's more about that learning process than it is anything specific. The actual revenue that we have associated with that business is relatively immaterial.
Peter Kelly: Yes. I think the other thing that's interesting about it, Will, is it's -- I mean, to be honest, it is kind of an interesting business. And it has a profile on it that could make it something significant. But for us, it's just -- it just has the wrong margin profile. And it's something that could grow. But as Rick says, I think it will be a great way for us to continue to find our feet in China with a really, really strong partner.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: That's helpful. And maybe one other, if I can. There were a couple small acquisitions, I think, you closed them in the quarter. Any revenue contribution in Q1 or in the Q2 guide there?
Richard L. Clemmer: It's relatively immaterial. I mean, the Bluetooth Low Energy is more about a capability to be able to address our smarter-world requirements or the Internet of Things going forward. So it's really more about a strategic capability than it is individual revenue. There is revenue that comes associated with it, but it's relatively immaterial in that total scheme of things.
Operator: The next question we have comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley.
Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Just following up on NFC and Secure Element, particularly within China. Can you talk about just some of the relationships you have on the banking side and even transport? I think there's a relationship with Alipay in terms of just competitively how you feel you're positioned as mobile payment starts to be adopted in China.
Richard L. Clemmer: So we are the leader. We plan to continue to be the leader, and we plan to continue to have Intel-like market shares in that space. It's a key priority for us and one that we will continue to make strategic moves to continue to solidify our position.
Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Got it. And then just a follow-up on Autos. Tough to ask kind of quarter-to-quarter for some of the longer-reaching things like vehicle-to-vehicle with some of the RF stuff you're doing. But just even from a customer engagement perspective and then the suppliers, just looking for an update in terms of what the -- how the activity is on those 2 fronts.
Richard L. Clemmer: Well, vehicle-to-vehicle, remember, we don't ship our first product until the 2017 model year, so late '16. So it won't have any revenue impact at all until that period of time. As far as activity on the design front, it's accelerating. We have a number of discussions going on, a number of different RFQs that we're working with the car companies themselves, not just their suppliers, as well as then the ODMs to be able to supply them. So there is definitely an increase in activity. Frankly, as we look at the combination with Freescale, we think it even strengthens our position, which was already very strong before. So we think that it puts us in an excellent position to be able to support our customers going forward, and we continue to work that aggressively. But it's not going to have any revenue impact until -- of significance until '17, at the earliest -- not really material revenue until probably more close to the -- approaching 2020.
Operator: The next question we have comes from the line of Steve Smigie of Raymond James.
Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: I was hoping you guys could follow up a little bit in Secure Identification. And you talked about some strength also in, I think, the government document space and transit. And I was hoping you could talk about what are the drivers that are picking up there that give you the confidence here.
Richard L. Clemmer: On the government side, we have always talked about that being a lumpy business, so it just depends on when countries begin to roll out further implementations of electronic passports or electronic government documents. And it'll continue to be lumpy. There's still a significant marketplace that's not being served associated with the electronification of government documents. And one of the reasons that we're just encouraged about the opportunity there is we are focused on continuing to be the leader in that space. But it'll continue to be lumpy. A number of different countries in Africa are beginning to roll out that we had won -- or Middle East and Africa, I should say. And some of those that -- we had won, and we're beginning to roll out. And then because of government reviews, it gets delayed for a couple of quarters, and we're beginning now to see that pick up. But not anything that's off the charts material. It's just the lumpiness of that business and how it will continue. On the transit ticketing, that's a good business that also has some ups and downs associated with it, but a strong, solid growth going forward on an annual basis and a significant contributor to our confidence in being able to see the growth that we do in that total area over the 3-year period of time of kind of low double digits.
Peter Kelly: Yes. Just great, long-term secular trends, which will drive both of those business lines probably for many years to come actually.
Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: And then if -- could you just get some discussion within the Secure Interface business? What you see as a couple of main drivers there? But as part of that, if you don't mind talking a little bit about are there any changes into the Lighting interface? And could you potentially benefit from the coming USB Type C?
Richard L. Clemmer: Yes. Well, I think that we've done quite well in the Interface area. We plan on continuing to do quite well as Type C evolves. We think we have a good technical position and are pretty confident in being able to play a significant role in that space. But we have to see how those design winds materialize over a period of time. But in general, we -- the growth that we've had in that business last year, which was, I guess, 36% or something last year, and certainly in the first quarter continuing to have that strong year-over-year growth. Not necessarily on a sequential basis as smoothly, but the real key focus is being able to continue to have that strong growth on a year-over-year basis.
Operator: The next call -- I mean, next question comes from the line of Rajvindra Gill from Needham & Company.
Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: A question on just the general automotive industry. That segment continues to be fairly strong. Just wanted to get your feedback on kind of your expectations for this -- for that market this year. And what are your thoughts in terms of units as well as increasing semiconductor content? And with the merger with Freescale, if you could kind of discuss what Freescale adds to the table to help your overall automotive efforts.
Richard L. Clemmer: Well, so we've talked about over the 3-year period of time a high single-digit growth in Automotive, and we -- for NXP. And we continue to feel very confident in that. So I think that's in line with what we're seeing and continue to expect going forward. When you look at the combination with Freescale, they're very complementary fit. If you really look at their strength in automotive microcontrollers, their sensor and analog business, it's very complementary to our business with very minimal overlap associated with it. And then in addition to that, their i.MX processor is very complementary with our car radio business, with our silicon tuner and DSP business, where we'll be able to even offer a more complete solution that we can with just the audio focus that we have today. So very complementary. It will clearly position us even more significantly with our customer base. And all the feedback from our customers has been extremely positive about the opportunity to really be able to address their solutions on a more holistic front associated with it.
Jeff Palmer: And Raj, if I could just -- Raj, if I could just add to your original question. So what we said in our Analyst Day is we think auto unit production is probably 2% to 3% units for the industry. And then we think for total, semi content, we're thinking probably 300 basis points incremental growth on top of that. So auto semi growth may be about 6%, and our stated goal is to grow 50% faster than that. So it ties up to Rick's view of a high single-digit NXP semiconductor growth target.
Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Yes, that's great. It's very helpful. The next question is on the IoT market. The way I see it is that with the acquisition of Freescale, you guys have assembled very -- some of the crucial building blocks to address IoT, the embedded processing, sensors, connectivity, security. Wondering when -- what are your views on IoT this year? When do you think we'll see an inflection point in terms of meaningful revenue contribution? There are some competitors that are starting to break out IoT in their numbers. So if you could talk a little bit about IoT and kind of trajectory of that market, that would be extremely helpful.
Richard L. Clemmer: It sounds like the dot-com phenomena. I think we'll just deliver on top line growth and not try to give in to reporting IoT separately. I think we said all along, the combination of Freescale and NXP allows a true industry powerhouse to focus on the smarter world. We like to call it the smarter world as opposed to the Internet of Things because we think that's a little bit more descriptive than just the Internet of Things, which is still relatively undefined. When you look at the fundamental capability that's required for the Internet of Things, when you think about it, it's sensing, processing, connectivity and security. Clearly, with our leadership position in security, we think it positions quite well. And with the strong position that Freescale has on the processing side and then the combined connectivity strength that we have, we think it puts us in an excellent position to really drive solutions for our customers that will be much more significant than what either of us could have done on a stand-alone basis and really allows us to really think about a true leadership position and being able to serve that evolving market in the Internet of Things. Relative to material revenue, I think it's still a while before it becomes significant. Clearly, there are some indications of are there -- some significant ramp-ups of design wins. But it still ends up being relatively immaterial in the whole scheme of things if you look at the revenue impact itself. But really, the key for us is cobbling together a total solution to be able to address the requirements for our customers. And when you think about the Internet of Things or the smarter world, it's a much more broad-based set of customers. And clearly, in the U.S., the strength that Freescale has being able to combine our security and connectivity technology with that to be able to address the customer requirement is what we're excited about.
Operator: The next question we have comes from the line of Tore Svanberg from Stifel.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: First question, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the linearity of orders. Some of your competitors have talked about things not being as strong in March, but then now, actually, in April, things are starting to improve again. So just trying to get a sense directionally where business is headed.
Richard L. Clemmer: I don't think we need to -- I think people can get into orders on a weekly basis, and -- but I think in the whole scheme of things, it's about how we deliver on the results associated with it. And I think our business is so different than most of our peers out there that I don't think we could draw any similarities or conclusions associated with it. I think it's more important that we think the market is still healthy, still good, but not booming and not off to the races. So we feel very good. And there's always periods of time where you'll see orders a little bit slower or not. But I don't think you can really read anything into that specifically based on what we see.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: That's fair. And as my follow-up for Peter, your inventory days were down about 15 days year-over-year. Should I read anything into that? Or it's just a bit higher than normal a year ago? Or is there actually an incident here where -- an instance here, sorry, where inventories are actually a little bit tight?
Peter Kelly: No, it was higher a year ago because we were prebuilding -- we're making prebuilds associated with the closure of our ICN -- foreign ICN6 fabs in the Netherlands. So what you're seeing is the prebuild inventory that we made is just kind of burn -- starting to burn off. So no, I think the inventory is in no case in any bad shape [ph].
Operator: Okay. The next question comes from the line of Christopher Rolland from FBR Capital Market.
Christopher Rolland - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: So we've seen lead times increase for you guys, not only just over the last 4 months, but over the past couple of years here. And the extension was also pretty broad-based. We've also heard of some new capacity that you guys might be bringing online in 2Q and 3Q and finishing by the end of the year. So I guess, the first question is, does this accurately describe the situation? My second is, where are your front- and back-end utilizations now? And then lastly, is it fair to say that there's a modest risk that you potentially under-ship optimum demand? I'd say your guidance would probably speak against that, but is that potentially a risk into the back half of the year?
Peter Kelly: So, our fabs -- our wafer fab is in Singapore, which is the joint venture for our SSMC. We have a fab in the Netherlands, an 8-inch fab, a sister fab. And we buy about 45% of our product externally. I don't think lead times have been particularly expanding, and I don't see us as having any significant supply issues in terms of being able to deliver our revenue forecast.
Christopher Rolland - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: Okay, okay. So I guess, no new capacity coming online on either front end or back end, okay.
Peter Kelly: No. We spend this -- we spend a little bit of money on capital, so we're constantly kind of tweaking it. But most of our additional capacity comes from external sources.
Richard L. Clemmer: Right. We have in the wafer side.
Peter Kelly: On the wafer side. And on the assembly test, we're constantly refreshing our test facilities, and to a lesser extent our assembly. But we spend about 5% of our revenue on CapEx.
Jeff Palmer: As we said before, Chris, we have no intention of building another fab.
Christopher Rolland - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: Okay. And that kind of ties into my next question here, you might've answered it. But digging into the HPRF business, just, again, you have some comments already, but we saw lead times there for both you guys and Freescale come down pretty substantially. And I'm just wondering how to interpret that. It doesn't sound like there was any capacity added there at either of your companies, so it sounds like it's purely demand-driven. How would you guys expect lead times to continue over the next couple of quarters here?
Jeff Palmer: Chris, I think you and I have talked about this before. We really don't -- we're not going to make a comment on your checks on distribution lead times. I think for things like the HPRF business, which is quite a bit of a direct business, we do with a lot of big OEMs. What you're finding out from standard lead time sheets and distributions is not reflective of what we're quoting to our customers.
Richard L. Clemmer: But we did say that, that business is becoming more in line, more in balance. We did expand capacity last year. The industry expanded capacity last year to be able to serve the customer requirement. But it is becoming more in line, more balanced now. There was a shortage that was a huge shortage at this time a year ago. And clearly, demand is much more in line today, and we don't think that that's significant. We had talked about that we had expected after the spike in demand that it would be relatively flat for a period of time. And I don't think we're backing off of any of that. So in closing, the key messages today are we continue to deliver on revenue, $1.47 billion, up 18% year-over-year, more than 2x our peer group average, and with growth in High Performance Mixed Signal actually being up 21% year-over-year. We grew operating margins 28% year-on-year, and earnings per share were up 38% year-over-year. We generated $388 million of free cash flow, up 29% year-over-year. We believe we are -- continue to be well positioned to deliver on our long-term strategy and thank all of our shareholders for their continued support. Thank you, and have a good day.
Jeff Palmer: Thank you, everyone. This concludes our call today. We'll chat with you at the end of the next quarter. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that's -- thank you for your participation in today's conference call. That concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q4 2014 NXP Semiconductors Earnings Conference Call. My name is Ian and I'm your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes. And now I'd like to hand over to Mr. Jeff Palmer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.
Jeff Palmer: Thank you, Ian, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the NXP Semiconductors Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. With me on the call today is Rick Clemmer, NXP's President and CEO; as well as Peter Kelly, our CFO. If you've not obtained a copy of our fourth quarter 2014 earnings release, it can be found at our company website under the Investor Relations section at nxp.com. Additionally, we have posted on our Investor Relations website a supplemental earnings summary presentation and a document of our historical financials to assist in your modeling efforts. This call is being recorded and will be available for replay from our corporate website. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause NXP's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the macroeconomic impact on specific end markets in which we operate, the sale of new and existing products and our expectations for financial results for the first quarter of 2015. Please be reminded that NXP undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements. For a full disclosure on forward-looking statements, please refer to our press release. Additionally, during our call today, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which excludes the impact of purchase price accounting, restructuring, stock-based compensation, impairment and other charges that are driven primarily by discrete events that management does not consider to be directly related to NXP's underlying core operating performance. Pursuant to Regulation G, NXP has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our fourth quarter 2014 earnings press release, which will be furnished to the SEC on Form 6-K and is available on NXP's website in the Investor Relations section at nxp.com. Before we start the call today, I'd like to highlight several investor events we will attend. On February 11, we will attend the Goldman Sachs TMT Conference in San Francisco. On February 24, we will attend the Susquehanna Corporate Access Day in New York. On March 3, we will attend the Morgan Stanley TMT Conference in San Francisco. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Rick.
Richard L. Clemmer: Thanks, Jeff, and welcome all to our earnings call today. As this is our fourth quarter and full year report, I will spend a few moments highlighting key aspects of our full year results before moving on to the details of Q4. Overall, 2014 was another very strong year of growth for NXP and I'd like to personally thank all of the NXP teams for their hard work in helping to deliver a record set of results. As I look back over the past 4 years since we became a public company, I cannot think of a moment when I've been more proud of the team and the results that we have delivered. 2014 has been a pivotal year in demonstrating the potential of NXP and we look forward to further building on our success. There are 3 key achievements I'd like to highlight for the full year 2014. First, we delivered extremely strong revenue growth. Product revenue was $5.5 billion, up 17% from 2013 and greater than 2x the growth of the addressable market. Overall, the HPMS segment revenue was $4.2 billion, up 19% versus 2013 results. All businesses achieved new historic levels as we continued to realize positive customer actions with our unique HPMS solutions. Turning to an annual review of the individual HPMS end markets. Within ID or Identification or Security, revenue was approximately $1.5 billion, up 13% year-on-year. We continue to build upon our world-class security capabilities, which we have extended in recent years from the digitization of government documents to delivering secure payment cards, and have now been able to ramp in the very exciting mobile transactions markets. In Automotive, revenue was $1.1 billion, up 12% versus the prior year, with every product line turning in double-digit year-on-year growth as we continued to monetize design wins awarded in prior periods. In Infrastructure & Industrial, revenue was $883 million, up 21%. I'd like to particularly highlight the 69% year-on-year growth and resulting market share gains in the base station market from sales of our HPRF power amplifiers and the 129% growth in our mobile audio business, both driven by the innovation that is the core of NXP. Our Portable & Computing group had a tremendous year with revenue of $712 million, a 46% increase versus the previous year. This was driven in large part by company-specific design wins in the high-end smartphone and tablet market, but the broad-based portion of the business also continues to deliver pretty strong growth relative to the overall market. Finally, in our Standard Products segment, revenue was $1.3 billion, up 11% versus 2013 with real growth in our GA discrete sales and our Power MOS business. The second highlight that is -- the second highlight is we continue to improve our overall profitability, our overall non-GAAP operating profit, which we believe is the key performance metric for NXP, was $1.4 billion or 25% of revenue, an improvement of 26% year-on-year. In 2014, we have executed extremely well on a number of high-volume product ramps, and we now expect to use the base to drive our HPMS business towards consistent delivery of 29% EBIT margins. The third highlight is cash flow generation and capital allocation. In 2014, we generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow or 20% of total revenue, an increase of 68% versus the prior year. In addition to allowing us to reduce our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 1.7x, it also allowed us to return $1.4 billion to shareholders in the form of stock repurchases. Now I'd like to review the specific results for the most recent quarter, Q4. Overall, our results for the fourth quarter came in at the higher end of our guidance. Product revenue was $1.5 billion, a 2% sequential improvement and up nearly 20% versus the prior year period. This was $22 million above the midpoint of our guidance, reflecting better-than-historic seasonality. Total NXP revenue was approximately $1.54 billion, nearly a 1.5% sequential increase and about a 19% increase from the same period a year ago. Turning now to the segment performance. HPMS revenue was approximately $1.2 billion, an all-time record. HPMS revenue was up 3% sequentially and up 22% from the year ago period. Three of the 4 business lines achieved record quarterly revenues. Before turning to the specific results for our various HPMS businesses, I'd like to remind investors that the quarter will be the last quarter we will refer to the businesses under the old structure naming convention. Going forward, we will only discuss the business under the new structure naming convention. In ID, revenue was $411 million, up 4% from the prior quarter, a new record high, with demand just ahead of our expectations and up over 25% year-on-year. Order trends within the core ID business were in line with our expectations, declining 11% sequentially and down about the same level versus the year ago. Within the emerging ID business, revenue was up 40% sequentially and up over 200% versus the same period in the prior year as a result of the strategic mobile transaction design wins. Auto revenue was $292 million, a new record for the business. Revenue was up 1%, slightly better than our original expectations, and up 6% versus the fourth quarter of 2013. From a product perspective, we experienced strong sequential demand for car entertainment, mostly offset by anticipated seasonal declines in keyless entry and in-vehicle networking. Within Infrastructure & Industrial, revenue was in line with our original expectations at $253 million, up 6% sequentially, while revenue was up about 30% versus the year ago period. In the fourth quarter, the primary driver was strong demand of the high-performance RF power amps for base station applications with growth increasing strongly on both a sequential and year-on-year basis. In Portable & Computing end market, revenue was $213 million, down about 2% sequentially, better than our original expectations, with revenues up 34% from the year ago period. During the quarter, both the MCUs and interface products were down about the same amount, slightly better than the typical seasonal decline. From an end market perspective, both broad-based and key strategic mobile designs were both down modestly in the quarter, again better than the typical seasonal decline. Finally, turning to our Standard Products segment. Revenue was $331 million, essentially flat versus the prior quarter, slightly better than our expectations and up about 13% versus the year ago period. The Standard Products team has done an excellent job in refocusing its efforts away from commodity sectors of the market and has effectively managed pricing, costs and expenses, resulting in a consistent operating profit, which is much better than any of our competitors. Turning now to our distribution channel performance. Total sales into distribution were up 1% with sales out of distribution up 10%. The total months of inventory in the distribution channel were 2.3 months, which is below our long-term objectives and is down from the 2.6 months in Q4. Absolute dollars of inventory in the channel declined about 2% on a sequential basis. In summary, our results in Q4 were very good, near the high end of guidance and better than our normal historic seasonality decline. We achieved record revenue levels in the ID, Auto and Infrastructure & Industrial end market. Looking at the full year, we again clearly outgrew the markets we operate within and believe this has resulted in positive share gains for NXP. We are entering 2015 with a solidly improved financial profile. Our operating profits are up, our leverage is down and we are generating significant free cash flow. We believe NXP is ideally positioned with the right mix of products, intellectual property, unique systems and application expertise, which will enable us to help address our customers' challenges. Our ongoing priority will be to continue to grow revenue well in excess of the market and improve our operating margin towards the high end of our goals and to continue to create superior shareholder value. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Peter to discuss the financial details of the quarter.
Peter Kelly: Thank you, Rick, and good morning to everyone on today's call. As Rick has already covered the full year highlights as well as the drivers of the revenue during the quarter, I'll move directly to the financial highlights of the quarter. In summary, Q4 was a good quarter and generally at the high end of our expectations in what is normally a seasonably weaker quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per share at $1.35 was towards the very high end of our guidance, and cash flow generation was truly outstanding. Focusing on the details of the fourth quarter. Revenue was $1.54 billion, which was $22 million above the midpoint of our guidance. We generated $716 million in non-GAAP gross profit, $4 million below the midpoint of our guidance, and reported a non-GAAP gross margin of 46.6%. So turning to the operating segments. Within the HPMS segment, revenue was $1.17 billion, up 3% over the previous quarter and about $16 million better than the midpoint of our guidance. Non-GAAP gross margin was 51.1%, 220 basis points below the third quarter, driven by price mix and new product introduction costs. Non-GAAP operating margin was 27.5%, a decline of 90 basis points as lower OpEx helped offset some of the decline in gross margin. Within our Standard Products segment, revenue was $331 million, essentially flat versus the third quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was 34.1%, a 50 basis point improvement versus the third quarter primarily as a result of better product mix and the fall-through on the incremental revenue. Non-GAAP operating margin was 20.8%, a 10 basis point improvement as a result of the noted items, as operating expenses were essentially flat quarter-on-quarter. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $330 million, which was down $5 million on a sequential basis and a few million dollars below the midpoint of our guidance. From a total operating profit perspective, non-GAAP operating profit was $389 million and represents a 25.3% operating margin. Interest expense was $37 million, noncontrolling interest was $18 million and cash taxes were $7 million. This resulted in total NXP non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.35, about $0.04 better than the midpoint of our guidance and flat sequentially. Stock-based compensation was not included in our non-GAAP earnings. It was $34 million. I would now like to turn to the changes in our cash and debt. Our total debt at the end of Q4 was $3.99 billion, an increase of $191 million sequentially. During the quarter, we issued a $1.15 billion cash convertible note, which carries an interest rate of 1% and is due in 2019. Additionally, during the quarter, we repaid $750 million, drawn down on our revolving credit facility. Total cash increased by $591 million to $1.19 billion, and taken together, our net debt declined by $400 million to $2.81 billion. We exited the quarter with a trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.65 billion and our ratio of net debt-to-trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of the fourth quarter was 1.7x. As a further metric of the improving capital structure of the company, we've increased our non-GAAP interest coverage to 9.7x from 8.3x in the same period a year ago. During the quarter, we bought back 2.4 million shares at a cost of approximately $180 million or a weighted cost of about $74.22 per share. As Rick mentioned, this brings our total repurchases during 2014 to 23.2 million shares for a total cost of just over $1.4 billion or an average cost of $61.73 per share. Turning to working capital metrics. Days of inventory were 83 days, a decrease of 2 days. Days receivables were 32 days, an improvement of 10 days sequentially. And days payable were 80 days, an improvement of 4 days sequentially. Taken together, our cash convert cycle -- cash conversion cycle was 35 days versus the 51 days in the prior quarter due to the better collections and higher sales. Cash flow from operations was $556 million and net CapEx was $105 million, resulting in a non-GAAP free cash flow of $451 million or 29% free cash flow margin, a truly outstanding achievement. Now I'd like to provide our outlook for the first quarter. Historically, as you know, our fourth and first quarters are our seasonably weakest quarters. With this as background, we currently anticipate Product revenue will be in the range of down 2% to down 6% sequentially. At the midpoint, we expect Product revenue to be down about 4% in Q1, reflecting the following trends of the business. So within our HPMS segment, Auto is expected to be up in the low single-digit range. Secure Identification Solutions is expected to be flat to slightly down in the low single-digit range. Secure Connected Devices is expected to be down in the mid-to upper teens range, as expected seasonality in the high-end smartphone and tablet market influences our outlook. Secure Interface and Power is expected to be flat to slightly down in the low single-digit range. Standard Products is expected to be down in the low single-digit range sequentially. And we anticipate revenue from the combination of manufacturing and Corporate & Other to be approximately $35 million. Taken together, total NXP revenue should be in the range of $1.45 billion to $1.51 billion or around $1.47 billion at the midpoint. We expect non-GAAP gross profit to be about 48% driven by a more favorable mix, despite the impact of our annual price adjustments. And operating expenses are expected to be about flat to $330 million, plus or minus a few million. This translates into a non-GAAP operating profit in the range of $361 million to $385 million or about 25% operating margin at the midpoint. Interest expense will be approximately $36 million, cash taxes are expected to be roughly $6 million and noncontrolling interest expense should be about $16 million. Stock-based compensation should be about $36 million. This is excluded from our guidance. The diluted share count is assumed to be 243 million shares. It could be different depending on share price fluctuations and stock buyback. Taken together, this translates into a non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $1.25 to $1.35 or $1.30 per share at the midpoint of our guidance. As we look back at 2014, I'd like to observe the following: It was a strong year for revenue growth, and I think we clearly demonstrated we have a number of growth drivers which will benefit the company for a number of years. It was clearly a very good year for cash generation as we began to generate the cash generation capability of the company. Our EBIT profit improved dramatically, and our focus is on continuing to improve our EBIT margin as we grow revenue well in excess of the market. So with that, I'd like to now turn it back to the operator and we will answer your questions.
Jeff Palmer: Ian, we're ready [ph] for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of John Pitzer, Crédit Suisse.
John William Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Peter, I guess my first question is really around gross margins. HPMS gross margins in the calendar fourth quarter were kind of below the long-term target of 53% to 56%. In contrast, Standard Products is actually above now the long-term target. I'm just kind of curious if you can help me understand better what happened in mix within HPMS that drove gross margins below? How you see that coming back? And as you think about the new revenue categories within HPMS, how do we think about the margin profile in each relative to the target for HPMS?
Peter Kelly: Well, I think a couple of things, John. First of all, for the Standard Products team, I just think they've done an absolute outstanding job in the last year. I mean, I think they learned a lot from the first quarter blip they had, and their focus on how they manage their pricing has really been pretty impressive actually. And on top of that, they've managed to move their business away from some of the more commodity products to some of the more stickier and better-margin business, so I think a lot of kudos to the Standard Products team. In terms of HPMS, yes, it was kind of annoying where we ended up. It was really 3 things. One is pricing, most -- the big part of our pricing hits was in Q1. There was about a 1% pricing hit -- or not pricing hit, but what we agreed with customers in Q4. And then most of the rest of the decline versus Q3 was -- about 50% of it was mix and about 50% of it was new product introduction costs. And clearly, it was around our very high-ramping products. And what we want to make absolutely sure, and I think we've said this before, is we really don't -- we really want to support those products to the best level we can. We want to make sure we deliver absolute quality to our customers and that we end up being one of the stickiest of customers. So we are probably a bit conservative in terms of kind of how much cost we'll put in place to make sure these things work. But I have a lot of confidence that this will improve over the coming quarters. You see clearly from a mix perspective, you see some of it popping back in Q1. But I think the targets we set out for our HPMS business are very achievable and I'm looking for them to be up at, not in Q1, but I want them back at 29% EBIT pretty quickly.
Richard L. Clemmer: And I think, John, that's really the important thing to remember. Our focus is on delivering EBIT results and cash flow, which we think is really what's important for shareholders. Our gross margin may bounce around based on mix and portfolio and ramping new products with specific customers, but really the key focus for us is on delivering the EBIT bottom line results.
John William Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: That's helpful, Rick. Maybe as my follow-up, I can -- want to touch a little bit on, and I'll use the new revenue segment, the Secure Identification Solutions business. It acted as expected in Q4. And I do believe Q4 of last year, Q1 of this year, are the most difficult year-over-year comparisons for that business and that business tends to be lumpy. But I'm kind of curious, given that we haven't seen a lot of sequential growth there in a couple of quarters, year-over-year growth has been negative, what's the outlook there for 2015 in that segment of the business, especially as we go into the back half of the year? And do you think any of the lack of revenue growth there is a share issue?
Peter Kelly: Well, I think it's a couple of things, John. I mean, I'm not -- I don't really want to give full year guidance. But I would say -- we said at the Analyst Day that we think this can grow 10% compound annually over the next 3 years and we feel very confident that it will. It is a lumpy business, especially the kind of eGov part of it. So you do see some kind of interesting moves per quarter. I think in terms of share, and I guess there you're alluding to the banking business in particular, no, we don't see any share loss. We've seen the U.S. EMV market start to ramp in Q4. But to be honest, as we've said previously, the U.S. EMV market won't be a big revenue mover in 2015. So we feel confident on our share. We think the long-term growth prospects for this business are absolutely solid. The eGov business tends to be a little bit lumpy, but nothing has changed, really.
Richard L. Clemmer: And our leadership position there is just as strong as it has been, John. There is no weakness whatsoever, and in fact, if anything, continue to be in a really solid position.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya, Bank of America.
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Maybe the first one, Peter, very strong year of buyback activity last year, over $1.4 billion. How should we think about buybacks this year, especially when you look at the leverage that's come down to about 1.6x? So how do you think about buybacks? And would you be willing to take on debt to support buybacks? Or would that only be used for any strategic M&A?
Peter Kelly: Well, what we said on the earnings call is we'd use all of our excess free cash flow to buy back stock. And so that -- we would return all of our excess free cash flow to our customers. And the...
Richard L. Clemmer: Investors.
Peter Kelly: Sorry, to our investors. And the way to do that at the moment is through share buybacks, and we've not changed our view on that. I guess the real answer is, Vivek, is I can buy back a significant amount of our stock in the next year without adding any debt.
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Got it. And then as a follow-up, Rick, how do you see the traction with -- on the mobile side outside of your large North American customers? So for example, how do you see NFC trends at your Korean customer and then with your Chinese customers?
Richard L. Clemmer: Well, so our product position in smartphones and tablets is pretty broad based at this point in time. In the mobile wallet specifically, we continue to be excited about the market growth as leader, clearly with the market now seeing some momentum in North America and with the rollout that Apple has on Apple Pay. But when we look at China, we see a lot of interest and a lot of excitement associated with that and clearly a lot of the volumes will be driven in China. And whether it's sourced from a U.S. or a Korean smartphone company, we think that the opportunity in China will be significant and will represent a very significant growth feature. So we will focus as we have on high-volume platforms because each one of those platforms takes quite a few number of resources to be able to support the software and ensure that it operates within the ecosystem. So we'll try to be sure that we focus our resources on the high-volume markets and the high-volume models to be able to really drive top line growth and continue to maintain our leadership, and I think that's really the best way to kind of summarize it.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach, Morgan Stanley.
Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I had a question on the MCU business for broad-based markets, in particular some of the traction you've see in the 32-bit. Can you talk about the growth you expect in that market?
Richard L. Clemmer: So we -- our 32-bit ARM-based strategy or our microcontroller strategy is really based on our 32-bit ARM-based platform as we've really driven our focus there, both in a vertical basis, focus on the sensor hub space where we have seen a significant growth, but also in the general-purpose market with the specific verticals on a broad-based industrial. And so I think our growth there, we feel very comfortable with. We think we can continue to be a significant player and we're driving that. But the growth of the microcontroller market overall has a little bit more ups and downs than some of the rest of the semiconductor market. I think we expect to continue to see strong growth in the 32-bit ARM microcontroller market and we'll participate in that on a broad basis as well as a vertical basis.
Jeff Palmer: If I could just add to that, Rick. So Craig, as you know, the microcontroller business is underneath our naming convention of Secure Connected Devices, which we think can grow over a 3-year CAGR about 20% and that microcontroller business is one of the contributing factors of that kind of long-term growth.
Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I appreciate that. Thanks, Jeff. As a follow-up, in Autos, I know it's early stages, but can you talk about the opportunities in vehicle-to-vehicle communications and also interest you're seeing in the integrated RFCMOS chip for ADAS, if you can kind of frame what that means to your intermediate-term growth Autos?
Richard L. Clemmer: That's not going to have a near-term impact. The first vehicle-to-vehicle design win that we won that we referenced a couple of quarters ago is through the 2017 model year, which will begin to ship in late 2016, but that will be relatively small volumes. There is a lot more interest from broad-based automotive companies now in the vehicle-to-vehicle side, and there's a German company that has an RFQ out now that is in a broader base of models associated with it that we're very focused on ensuring that we can be a participant in that. On the radar side, clearly, there's a market there for radar and really it's about maturing our technology and ensuring that we can deliver on the performance to be able to drive that. So again, I think the growth is out beyond the next couple of years, but we think it's a significant market opportunity for us that we can believe, develop a true leadership position.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse, Evercore ISI.
Christopher J. Muse - Evercore ISI, Research Division: I guess first question on the SIS business. Curious if you could dig a little bit deeper into the EMV opportunity in China. Clearly, a very lumpy business. And I guess the question here is, as you look beyond, I guess, Chinese New Year, what's your visibility like in terms of a ramp and confidence that you can see growth there year-over-year in '15?
Richard L. Clemmer: Well, I think when you look at the deployment of the dual-interface cards in China, which is really the key aspect for us, it still has a long ways to go before it's fully penetrated. And then as we've talked about even after it's fully deployed, there is a replacement market that takes place for roughly 1/4 to 1/3 of that total market on an annual basis as those cards get replaced. I think the key is going from now the large banks to more of the mid-tier banks and smaller banks. But we're also excited about some of the new applications in that space relative to transits ticketing and being able to drive that. So I think the key is the combination of the transportation opportunity that we see where we announced a product a couple of months ago, working with OPPO and actually the Chinese government where it will be rolled out in 26 cities across China on the transportation side. So the combination of the eGovernment opportunities as well as the transportation beyond just the credit card opportunity or dual interface is really what gives us the confidence in the growth for the full year.
Christopher J. Muse - Evercore ISI, Research Division: That's very helpful. And I guess, a financial question, Peter. You've done a great job of really cleaning up the balance sheet to the point where leverage is no longer a concern. I've got you doing roughly $1.5 billion free cash flow, give or take, this year. And if you use all of that to buy back stock, you're reducing share count by about 8%. So is that the way to think about it? And then I guess, as a follow-up to that, at what point do you start to think about returning cash in other vehicles, i.e., dividends?
Peter Kelly: Well, clearly, I'm not going to go into the full year, but it's not rocket science to get to the map that you've got. I think what we've said about returning cash to shareholders is that given where the stock is at the moment, our inclination would be to buy back stock rather than a dividend. If the stock ever got to the point where it was fully valued or overvalued, I guess we clearly would use a dividend. But before that happens, we'd probably introduce a mix of a dividend and a stock buyback, and it's difficult to say when that will happen because it requires people like yourself to help get the stock to a point where it's more reasonably valued.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis of Barclays.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I just wanted to go back to the NFC business. Do you have to [ph] -- I mean, you said a couple of years ago that the radio would be more competitive and that's not really where you competed. You've actually done much better than that. As you kind of look out this year, you'll probably see radios from more suppliers. Just curious if you could focus on the high volumes. Obviously, when you bring in mobile payments, that's to your advantage. I'm just curious, from a competitive landscape on the radio side, how effectively can you compete? And do you still think this business can grow for you?
Richard L. Clemmer: First off, thanks for the thanks, it's a first. I think the real advantage that we have is bringing the overall complete solution. So where we really perform well is when there's a secure element involved for a true secure mobile payment. Somebody that wants to use an NFC radio just for another communication vehicle without the security associated with the secure element is really not where we're focused. So there's a lot of people that talk about applications that they don't believe require security. Part of that's driven by the carriers in the U.S. who've really refused to let anyone other than Apple implement a wallet with a secure element. So again, our focus will be in those areas where we believe there is an opportunity to bring our unique expertise from an ecosystem viewpoint, whether we can leverage the banking relationships we have to be able to drive the mobile transactions. We think that beyond what's taking place in North America today, the China opportunity will continue to be significant. And so when we deal with our customers, we'll be more focused on that China segment than focused on other regions of the world where they're still in the early phases of really thinking about what to do with the mobile wallet itself. And so you'll see us continue to focus on that with our customers and be sure that we don't try to focus on a broad basis on NFC because, again, where we bring a unique basis is with our solution know-how and the secure element that can make that much more unique.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division: And then I just wanted to ask on the high-performance RF, you've seen that end market moderate with some seasonality. How is the supply chain lead times there? Are you finally caught up in that market?
Richard L. Clemmer: I would say we're getting pretty caught up associated with it. The shortages that we had roughly a year ago have, I think, kind of have been tempered somewhat. The advantage for us is that because of the requirements from the marketplace, we were entering -- able to enter into some long-term arrangements with a number of our customers, which should bode well for the next few quarters in being able to continue to drive growth. The one thing for us is we haven't been quite as focused on the China ramp in LTE, but have been really focused on a broader basis associated with it. And so I think that's really the key, is our focus on really the rest of the world, Europe and Middle East and Africa, as it turns out with the design wins we've had, and less focus on the China rollout itself.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of William Stein at SunTrust.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: First, I'd like to address utilization. I apologize if this has already been asked, I just dropped for a minute there. I think utilization, you highlighted, was at 99% in the quarter. Does that relate to the Standard Products in addition to HPMS? And would it suggest upward margin pressure in Standard Products as you can sort of get more selective on mix?
Peter Kelly: I wouldn't worry too much about that, Will. It was 99%. Our IC fabs have been running pretty full for a while. To be honest, it's -- yes, Standard Products has improved in the front end, but the majority of their cost is actually in back end and in packaging. So yes, it has probably given them a little bit of a benefit, but not much. They've had to drop their utilization very, very significantly for it to have an impact on the profit.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Great. And then I'm wondering if you can talk a bit about some emerging applications you have in RF power amplifiers. There's some noncommunication-related demand that we're aware of. And also in V2X, obviously this is something that's not -- probably not going to hit meaningfully this year, but I'm wondering if you can talk about new designs or new design wins in either of those areas, please.
Jeff Palmer: Will, are you kind of alluding to some of the HPRF applications for things like lighting and solid-state ignition and things like that?
Richard L. Clemmer: Or heating, cooking...
Peter Kelly: Or heating, cooking, yes.
Jeff Palmer: Yes, they're very interesting and we've discussed this directly with you, but we don't see them as being real catalysts of growth in the intermediate term.
Richard L. Clemmer: In 2015, they won't represent a significant factor in growth associated with it. And you talked about vehicle-to-vehicle, which we may have discussed while you dropped off there, Will. But we -- the first design win we've seen is for the 2017 model year with shipments beginning in late 2016. The one thing that we have seen is one of the German automotive companies is actually looking at a much more broad-based rollout associated with that. It's actually in the RFQ process at the current time frame. So there is some traction in the ramp-up associated with it, but it's still out in late '16 and 2017, not really going to have any material impact on the next year or so.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava, BMO Capital Markets.
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets Canada: I just wanted to get back to the SIS business, folks. What -- when do we start to see a return to year-over-year growth for this business? And then I had a quick follow-up as well, please.
Peter Kelly: I guess SIS, we've said, compound annually, we expect it to grow by 10% over the next 3 years. So we don't guide beyond the current quarter here.
Richard L. Clemmer: I think there's a lot of discussion about it, but frankly, it's a very solid business with a broad array of portfolio that we feel good about, and as Peter talked about, driving significant growth over the next 3-year period of time. And I think that's one of the advantages of NXP is the broad base of our product portfolio, so that not all segments have to be faring perfectly at any one time for us to be able to still significantly outgrow the market and gives us a real advantage in being able to drive the top line revenue growth.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Chris Caso, Susquehanna.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: My first question is on the EBIT margins and I recall at the Analyst Day, you were talking about 26% EBIT margins for 2015, and it looks like by the guidance, you're already achieving that. If you were, Peter, as you said earlier, to improve the HPMS margins, but yet maintain where you are in Standard Products, does that provide a path to upside potentially for those targets?
Peter Kelly: Yes. In the Analyst Day, we said we think HPMS could run at the 29% level. And if you trim that out, it would take the, just by natural growth, it would take the company to something more like the 27% level. So I think, as you go out in time, there is the opportunity to go to 27%. We are pretty focused, though, at the moment on we want to significantly outgrow the market. We've moved the profitability of the company up to 25%. The focus on this year is to get to 26%. But yes, yes, I think there's opportunity.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. And just moving forward, a question on FX and given the currency moves we've seen, is there any impact to your business, either on the revenue side or the cost side, from the currency moves we've seen?
Peter Kelly: Well, first of all, from an EBIT perspective, there's really no impact. We have a natural hedge. So about just over 20% of our revenue is euro denominated. And I don't have the exact number, but I think about 60% of our OpEx and some of our manufacturing cost is euro based. So overall, they offset each other. Yes, from a revenue perspective, it puts a little bit of pressure on revenue and margin, which is then offset by OpEx. But we really don't like to use currency as an excuse because overall, it does not have a big impact on us at the bottom line.
Richard L. Clemmer: But the key is our revenue would have been better in the current quarter if we wouldn't have seen the pressure on the euro. So it does have an impact on our top line, which we really haven't talked about because I think it's important that we basically reflect the overall growth of the company. And as Peter said, we have kind of a natural hedge in place on the bottom line results.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore, Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Lots of great detailed questions have been asked and answered, so I'm going to start with a bigger picture one for Rick. A quarter ago, there was a lot of consternation about what was going on in the industry, downturn pending, et cetera. Obviously, that didn't impact you. But could give us a view of what you are seeing as far as the health of industry and the broad-based market that you are addressing? Any sort of linearity of bookings, lead times, those sorts of metrics would be helpful.
Richard L. Clemmer: Thanks, Ross. I think the market is still kind of where it's been for the last few years. As I talk to our customers and certainly our distribution partners, no one sees a robust uptick, but no one really sees a decline that's not just more of a typical seasonal basis. So I think where we're at is, for the general health of the industry, we kind of see a mid-single-digit growth, which is kind of where it has been, not really something that's significantly up or down from that. Clearly, the questions on the overall economy in China coming to bear associated with it, concern over the European economy, positives relative to the U.S. economy. But when you wash all of it out, it's kind of steady as she goes, kind of mid-single-digit growth fundamentally. And really the key is really being able to have the design wins to be able to differentiate yourselves versus the overall market, which we've been very fortunate in accomplishing over the last few years and think we can continue to do that.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Great. And I guess as my follow-up, this is one for Peter and admittedly a little bit of down in the weeds. What was on the cash flow statement, the note hedged derivatives for $208 million?
Peter Kelly: It's just to do with the way you account for the convert, Ross. It's an embedded derivative.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie, Raymond James.
Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Was hoping you could comment or follow up a little bit more with color on the in-vehicle networking. I think you indicated it was maybe down a little bit. Is that just a fluctuation? And overall, could you talk a little bit about the color? It sounds like there should be a lot more in-vehicle network going forward and that seems like maybe a more immediate opportunity than some of the ADAS stuff?
Richard L. Clemmer: I think that's a really good point. As more and more electronics are added to the car, obviously you have to be able to communicate from those electronics to the individual node -- in-nodes and so the transceiver requirements associated with in-vehicle networking are key. What we saw in Q4 was just a normal seasonal basis. It wasn't really any indication of any strength or weakness. It was just more of a normal seasonal basis. But we are -- we do believe that we can continue to maintain our leadership in in-vehicle networking, and clearly, with the ever-increasing electronics content in the car, driving that overall market faster than just the automotive industry itself.
Peter Kelly: Yes, I'd say it's like a rounding rather than a real drop.
Jeff Palmer: And when you step back and look at the automotive industry, you have to look at it more on a year-on-year basis, Steve. The in-vehicle networking was up quite nicely year-on-year mid-teens versus same quarter a year ago. So nothing to be worried about there.
Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Okay, cool. And then if I could just follow up on the key fobs as well. It seems like, out at CES, saw some pretty sophisticated key fobs that even had like video screens on them, stuff like that. Can you talk a little bit more about the opportunity there and your market share position going forward on that?
Richard L. Clemmer: Yes, we've talked about that basically every major car that's manufactured in the world, with the exception of the Toyota in Japan and frankly a few models from Europe, but basically all of the rest of the car manufacturing uses our technology associated with the remote keyless entry. The key for us is continuing to add intelligence associated with it and seeing the inherent growth that's driven from that. As Kurt went through at our Investor Day, the opportunity to go from the original implementation, which was under $1 per key, to several dollars to, in the most advanced cars, being double-digit dollars associated with our content really representing a significant opportunity for us.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg at Stifel.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: My first question is on distribution inventory in the channel. I think you said it was 2.3 months, which is below -- quite a bit below what it is normally. What is the normal range? And are you expecting it to return there? Or could potentially 2.3 months be the new norm?
Richard L. Clemmer: We would certainly hope that 2.3 months is not the new norm. Clearly, in Q4 -- in the previous quarter we had shipped into the channel to be prepared for the ramp in Q4 in manufacturing. And with that then being shipped out in Q4, solid decline in the inventory from the 2.6 months that we were in Q3 down to the 2.3 months in Q4. We clearly would like for it to be closer to the 2.6 level. In some of our Standard Products, we'd like for it to be up closer to 3. I mean, one of the key advantages of the distribution partners is being able to maintain that inventory to be able to serve the market in a much more rigorous basis. So with the margins that they give, we'd like for them to be in a position to carry that inventory and then Standard Products closer to 3 months, but overall kind of in the 2.5, 2.6-month level, maybe a little bit above that is where we'd like to be. So I don't think it's a new norm. There's always a pull from the largest U.S.-based distributors for their turns and earns, which will try to keep inventory low. And we'll be trying to make it more reasonable so that they earn the profits that they're getting associated with it. So that's kind of natural. But I would not anticipate the 2.3 months of inventory to be the new norm. I think it'll continue to fluctuate around. It has been fairly consistent at 2.5 to 2.6 months for most periods over the last couple of years except for, I guess, a couple of quarters, and so we would anticipate that it would go back up to the 2.5 to 2.6 months.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: Sounds good. And as a follow-up, could you just update a little bit on your capacity plans for this year? And do you have a CapEx estimate for calendar '15?
Peter Kelly: CapEx, we guide to 5% of revenue. Most of our additional revenue is supported through foundries, so the money we spend on CapEx is typically kind of maintenance-type CapEx and CapEx to test in the back end.
Operator: The last question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay, Canaccord Genuity.
Matthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division: A lot of questions have already been asked, so I'll just do a bigger picture one on the mobile payment side. Maybe Rick, you can give a little bit of an update on what you're seeing on the point-of-sale side? Obviously, your primary customer there is influencing the industry quite a lot and changing things from a mobile payment acceptance point at the point-of-sale. So how are you seeing that transition happen by market? And how that might influence what secure element or hardware is chosen by other OEMs as they roll out mobile payments later on?
Richard L. Clemmer: So I think from a pure point-of-sales basis, which, by the way, we happen to have a very significant market share, we're roughly 80% of the market associated with that segment, we do see a growth in the contactless terminal side. So I think in the U.S., we do see that from a customer base. Clearly, as that has been rolled out, there's a broader acceptance. We'll see more of that taking place in the U.S. I think one of the areas that we continue to be very excited about is China where we see contactless really being very significant and where we want to participate, not only on the mobile wallet side in the high-end smartphones, but also in the contactless side from a banking basis as we've talked about bank cards being dual interface in China, representing that convenience that comes with the contactless use. Our point-of-sale terminals, just as a reference, was up 18% year-over-year. So a very healthy growth and we believe that, that continues to be a contributor as we go forward to the opportunity and our ability to outgrow the market. So thanks a lot for your continued interest and support of NXP. In closing, we believe our results in 2014 continue to demonstrate measurable and consistent execution of our long-term strategy. The key messages today were growth. Our growth in 2014, growing revenue by 17% to $5.5 billion, clearly being driven by our HPMS business, which delivered significant growth of 19% year-over-year. Our profitability, which improved operating profit margin dollars to $1.4 billion, up 26% year-on-year. Overall, we continue to make good progress towards our long-term HPMS profitability goals. Cash generation. 2014 was a key year for NXP, generating free cash flow of $1.1 billion, up 68% year-on-year. And the ability to facilitate our capital returns where we returned $1.4 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases. So in total, we believe we are well positioned to deliver our long-term strategy, and really want to thank all of our shareholders for your continued support. Thanks a lot.
Jeff Palmer: Thank you very much, everyone. This ends our call.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation, you may now disconnect. Good day.

Rick Clemmer: Thanks, Jeff and welcome everyone to our earnings call today. We are really pleased to be here as our results and guidance today mark major milestone in the growth story that is NXP. Performance in the third quarter was very strong with revenues better than planned, expenses under control and earnings above expectation. Our outlook for the fourth quarter moves to a better than seasonal trend as the company specific product cycles continue to ramp against the backdrop of what appears to be slightly less optimism, in overall semiconductor market. Product revenue was approximately $1.47 billion, a 13% sequential improvement and up, 21% versus the prior year period. Total NXP revenue was approximately $1.52 billion, also a 12% sequential increase while up approximately 21% versus the year ago period. Turning now to our earnings performance, HPMS revenue was $1.14 billion, up 15% sequential increase and up nearly 24% from the year ago period. As noted in our earnings release, beginning January 1st, we are planning to reorganize certain parts of the HPMS segment. The goal of the change is to drive our product lines in a more focused application and customer centric approach, in order to address the next phase of semiconductor growth, in particular security beyond that of smartphones and tablets today. In today’s call, I will keep my prepared remarks to the existing HPMS structure although we had provided a bridge between existing and new structure on our investor relations website. We will discuss this further at our upcoming Analyst Day in just under two weeks. Now I’d like to review the results for our various HPMS business units. Within our ID business, revenue was $396 million, up nearly 16% versus the prior quarter, above our expectations and up, 20% on a year-on-year basis. In the core ID business, revenue was down about 3% quarter-on-quarter with banking up sequentially offset by sequential declines in the eGovernment in the automatic fare collection businesses, while the remaining product lines were essentially flat versus the prior quarter. Overall, core ID represented about 70% of the total ID revenue in the third quarter. In the emerging ID business, we experienced very strong growth due to the mobile transactions. And total emerging ID was up about a 115% sequentially and up over 160% versus the year ago period. Moving now to our Portable & Computing end market, revenue was $217 million nearly a 48% sequential increase and up 67% from the year ago period. Growth in the quarter was driven by the launch of new mobile platforms driving demand for both interface and MCU products. While new mobile platforms drove the majority of this sequential increase, we also experienced positive growth in the broad-based MCU market. Within our infrastructure and industrial business, revenue was $238 million, up 13% sequentially and up about 18% versus the year ago period. During the quarter, revenue was in line with our original expectations as Playstations OEMs drove the majority of the increase, though we continue to see strong demand for our smart audio products. Within our automotive business, revenue was $288 million, a good quarter in line with our expectations and reflecting normal third quarter seasonality. Revenue was a flat quarter-on-quarter and up 10% versus the third quarter of 2013, continuing our double digit growth in the automotive business over the last few quarters. From a product perspective, we experienced sequential growth in keyless entry and in-vehicle networking though flatly offset by sequential decline for entertainment products. Finally, turning to our Standard Product segment, revenue was $333 million, better than anticipated, resulting in a 5% quarter-on-quarter and a strong 14% versus the year ago period. We experienced a good mix in the business with general purpose and logic being the largest factor of the sequential increase. The general discrete portion of the business continues to perform well. Turning now to our distribution channel performance, total sales-in distribution was up 29% with sales out of distribution up 19% as we continue to position the [inaudible] ahead of ongoing mobile platform ramps anticipated for the fourth quarter. The total months of inventory in the distribution channel were flat at 2.6 months, in line with our longer term model. However, absolute dollars of inventory in the channel did increase about 18% on a sequential basis, again in preparation for the ongoing ramp of new mobile platforms. In summary, our overall results in Q3 were very good, with very good overall product revenue, better operating profits and good free cash flow. As can be seen in our earnings release, we are anticipating a better than seasonal quarter in Q4. Over the long term, we expect to continue deliver growth in excess of the overall market, continued growth in earnings a robust cash flow generation. Now I’d like to turn the call over to Peter to discuss the financials.
Peter Kelly: Thank you, Rick and good morning to everyone on today’s call. As Rick has already covered the drivers of revenue, I’ll move directly to the highlights of the quarter. Overall, the third quarter was a very good quarter with revenue up over 12% Q-on-Q. Our non-GAAP net income was up over 22% and non-GAAP EPS of nearly 24% demonstrating the strength of our model. Total revenue non-GAAP gross profit, operating profits and net income were all better than the midpoint of our guidance and non-GAAP EPS was a $1.35, which is $0.05 above our midpoint. Focusing on the details of the third quarter revenue was $1.52 billion which was $20 million above the midpoint of our guidance and $166 million increase from the second quarter. We generated $725 million in non-GAAP gross profits or 47.9% non-GAAP gross margin. This was about $7 million above the midpoint of our guidance and $70 million better than the second quarter due to better revenue performance. So turning to the operating segments, within the HPMS segment, revenue was $1.14 billion, up 15% versus the previous quarter. And HPMS non-GAAP gross margin was 53.3%, 210 basis points below the second quarter, primarily due to a higher mix of newly introduced mobile transaction products. Non-GAAP operating margin was 28.4% which was 60 basis points above the prior quarter. Within our Standard Products segment, revenue was $333 million up above 5% sequentially. Standard Product non-GAAP gross margin was 33.6% or 40 basis points versus the second quarter and non-GAAP operating margin was 20.7%, an 80 basis points improvement sequentially. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $335 million in line with our guidance they were up $13 million sequentially, primarily as we continued investments in support of major customer programs. From a total operating profit perspective, non-GAAP operating profit was $390 million and represents a 25.7% operating margin, up about 90 basis points versus the prior quarter. Interest expense was $34 million and non-controlling interest was $17 million. Cash taxes of $5 million was slightly better than the guidance. Total NXP non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.35 which is at the high end of our guidance and $0.26 better on a sequential basis. Stock based compensation which is not included in our non-GAAP earnings was $34 million. So now I’d like to turn to the changes in our cash and order. Our total debt at the end of the second quarter was $3.81 billion, up 228 million on a sequential basis, largely as a result of the share repurchases we made. Cash at the end of the quarter was $594 million and we exited the quarter with a trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.59 billion and our ratio of net debt to trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA at the end of Q3 was 2.03 times, in line with our target of two times. We brought back in the quarter 8.7 million shares at a cost of approximately $574 million for a weighted cost of about $65.77 per share. Turning to our working capital metrics, days of inventory were 85 days, a decrease of 11 days sequentially. Days receivable were 42 days while days payable were 76. Taken together, our cash conversion cycle was 51 days versus 59 days in the prior quarter. Cash flow from operations was $397 million and net CapEx was $81 million, resulting in positive free cash flow of 316 million or 21% free cash flow margin. During the quarter, TSMC our joint venture paid a dividend of 130 million and given NXP’s only subscription of the joint venture, this resulted in a cash outflow from investment of $50 million paid to TSMC. Now I’d like to revise our outlook for the fourth quarter. As Rick noted in his prepared remarks, and as seen in our earnings release, we are planning to change the business structure of the HPMS segment of January the 1st 2015. In an effort to help investors and analysts understand these changes in events, we’ve decided to provide our fourth quarter guidance on both the existing structure and the new structure. Based on our analysis, it appears we continue to gain market share across the product portfolio and we anticipate NXP should continue to substantially outperform the overall market. We have a number of company specific programs which we see contributing to solid growth in future periods, even though we do see slightly less optimism in the overall semiconductor markets. With this as a background and despite typical seasonal declines in the third quarter, we currently anticipate product revenue to be essentially flat as compared to third quarter plus or minus 2%. This is clearly better than our historic seasonality into the fourth quarter. At the current business structure, we expect the following trends in the business on a sequential percentage basis. Within our HPMS segment, we would expect Automotive to be about flat, Identification is expected to increase in the low single digit range. Infrastructure and industrial is expected to increase in the mid-single digit range, Portable & Computing is expected to be down in the low single digit range. Under our new business structure, we expect Secure Identification Solutions or SIS to be down in the low double digit range. Secure Connected Devices or SCD is expected to increase in the mid-teens percentage range. Secure Interface & Power or SI&P is expected to be about flat, and Automotive as indicated previously is expected to be about flat. Standard Products is expected to be down in the low single digit range. We anticipate revenue from the combination of manufacturing and Corporate and Other to be approximately $41 million. Taken together, total NXP revenue should be in the range of $1.49 billion to $1.54 billion or about $1.515 billion at the midpoint. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be about 48% at the midpoint plus or minus. Operating expenses are expected to be in the range of $328 million to $333 million or about $332 million at the midpoint. And this translates into a non-GAAP operating profit in the range of $376 million to $401 million or about 26% operating margin at the midpoint. Interest expense in our debts should be approximately $37 million on slightly higher gross debt given the share repurchases in the third quarter. And cash taxes are expected to be roughly $9 million and non-controlling interest expense of about $18 million. Stock based compensations should be about $35 million which is excluded from our guidance. Diluted share accounts should be about 247 million shares depending on share price fluctuations and buybacks. And taken together this translates into non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $1.26 to $1.36 or $1.31 per share at the midpoint of our guidance. I’d like now to turn the call back to the operator for your questions. Michelle, if you’ll poll for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. The first question we have comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
John Pitzer – Credit Suisse: Yeah, good morning guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question and congratulations on the strong results. Rick, the quality of the line was a little poor. I just wanted to make sure I heard you right, you said sales in to distribution was up about 29% sequentially and sales out were up 19%. If that’s right, can you just confirm that? And as you look into the fourth quarter, how do you think that will look sales in versus sales out?
Rick Clemmer: Yeah, those are the correct numbers, John. Sales in was up 29% with sales out of distribution up 19% and again that was as we continue to position inventory for some of the product grants associated with the mobile platform. So the actual dollars in the channel were up 18%. We don’t expect to see that any different, 2.6 months of inventory is clearly within the range that we would like to have. In fact in some of the work do you like products we’d have to add a little bit more than that so, that’s well in the range of what we would like to have, John.
John Pitzer – Credit Suisse: That’s all for, Rick. And then Rick, clearly kind of curious if there was any 10% customer in the quarter? And clearly now that the mobile payments guy in Cupertino has moved forward I’m kind of curious as to what impacts do you think that might have on other customers within mobile payment so there is sort of a direct effect on Apple Pay and there is an indirect effect. I’m kind of curious of how you see the indirect effect playing out over the couple of quarter relative to the attached rates overall of and the handsets?
Rick Clemmer: Well I think John, first off I should reiterate that we can’t talk about any specific customer design wins associated with our mobile wallet, but we continue to be the leader in mobile wallet and plan to be there. I think what that drives is, it drives the stimulus for us for a broader acceptance associated with it. It’s people that use other policy their branch, paying very simply with their phone. And Peter Kelly was showing me how easy it was last night and I was quite impressed with the ability to maintain your records on your phone in true that you don’t forget to turn in expenses because you have those receipts, you don’t lose the receipts. And so we would expect that to be more of a snowball effect and actually accelerate mobile payments deployment throughout a broad range of customers had we’ve been working with a broad range of customers associated with the client in any case. The rate of acceleration I think will continue to be strong and frankly in China wanted to think it happens with the contact with [Audio Gap] we think facilitate the infrastructure of mobile payment implementation in a broad basis in China.
John Pitzer – Credit Suisse: Perfect. Thanks, guys.
Rick Clemmer: Thanks, John.
Operator: The next question that we have comes from the line of Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Blayne Curtis – Barclays Capital: Great results, but couple of questions, first, can you say what drove that I mean you had a huge guy from Portable & Computing you ended up beating that number. Is that MCUs or interface or both? And then I’m assuming given it’s such a strong quarter it’s down in Q4 I’m assuming you still have some customer tailwinds in the Q4 as well. Any color there would be helpful.
Rick Clemmer: Yeah, I mean clearly we talked about P&C last quarter in Q2 being growth primarily from non-new mobile platforms. But in Q3 big chunk of the growth did come from new platforms from mobile and both MCU and interface and we expect that to continue strong, but without any real new programs coming in, in Q4. But better than what previously we would expect on a seasonal basis. And Blayne the other thing I should mention here is in Q3 we also had strong business in the broad base micro controller market as well which is the little different than some of our competitors have commented on the micro controller market.
Blayne Curtis – Barclays Capital: Great. And then still trying to get my hand on in the new segments I’m sure you’ll inform me at the Analyst Day. But it looks like the majority of the core IDs is going to be in the Secure ID solutions which you have down in December. Can you just talk about what’s driving that and I guess the outlook in the next year, are you seeing any uptick in EMV for U.S. as such?
Rick Clemmer: So I think the key thing for Q4 is just seasonal demand in banking. So it still has somewhat of a seasonal pattern, but we’re encouraged about the opportunities for both the U.S. as well as continued strong performance in China contact was thinking and we also expect a good growth in the eGov side next side as well RF tagging. So, I think we’re pretty optimistic about a broad based growth in that segment for next year, although as we’ve said many times before, it ends up being more projects by projects so hard to track on a sequential basis much better to look at on a kind of the year-over-year basis.
Blayne Curtis – Barclays Capital: Perfect. Thanks.
Rick Clemmer: Thanks, Blayne.
Operator: The next question we have comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Vivek Arya – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Thank you for taking my question. Rick one investor push back is that just near term a lot of your growth is coming from the smartphone market and I’m wondering how you react to that? And how much of that is just micro headwinds and how much of that is the lumpiness in different programs?
Rick Clemmer: Well the fact is we have a broad base of portfolio and we actually think that that’s an advantage that gives us the ability for different segments to be performing better at any one time so that we have the opportunity to continue to outgrow the industry going forward. The fact is that new models and smartphones and tablets is contributing to our growth in the near term. And I guess the one thing I would emphasize is in areas where there is unique technology involved so it’s not more of a general basis that’s easy to change from one supplier to another. So, we feel very good about that business as we talked about on the call, one of the things that we’re doing with the new organization structure is really preparing for growth for the semiconductor industry beyond smartphones and tablets. And we see that in the next few years the opportunity to see significant growth factors well smartphones and tablets and we wanted to be sure that we can take our security leadership as the foundation to be a leader in those continuing going businesses as well. If you look at mobility roughly speaking, it’s kind of in the 20% or little bit over as far as percent of revenue. So, we feel very comfortable with that basis and I’d like to experience the growth that comes with it. And when you talk about mobile wallet, I’m not sure that’s really something that you would put in a general bucket associated with mobility even though it clearly goes into mobility platform.
Peter Kelly: I think you can get obsessed on quarters. I mean if you look at our annual growth, it’s just very, very broad based.
Vivek Arya – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Peter, I have a follow up. You have done, I believe about 1.26 billion in buybacks year-to-date, probably a little bit above the free cash flow you will generate this year and I’m wondering how we should think about buybacks getting into Q4.
Peter Kelly: What we’ve said, I’m not going to guide the fourth quarter, but what I would say is we think we’re undervalued, so we think buybacks of stock is an excellent way to return from this to shareholders. And my view hasn’t changed on that at the moment.
Vivek Arya – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Got it. Can you talk about the China as the LTE market, there is some concern about tight supplies of amplifies and base stations and since you have leadership there, I’m wondering how you think about the supply and demand trends in that market? Thank you.
Rick Clemmer: I think we’ve talked all year about the fact that we’ve not been able to meet our customers’ commitments and created problems which we weren’t very happy about on an ongoing basis. While we’ve seen our ability to increase our capacity and obviously indicated in the numbers that we reported today and with the guidance for Q4, but the bottom line is I think we still are not able to meet completely our customers’ requirements. We still see a pretty healthy dominion. I think the one thing that’s really important to emphasize is people talk about it being China LTE, and I think the factor that we get from our customers that’s not even the majority of the growth that we see in our business focus on China LTE. It may be that the platform that we got designed into much broader base and lot of what our customers tell us it’s going into Middle East and Africa, even some expansion in the U.S. It was going into South America in Q2 in preparation for the World Cup. So I guess what’s important to emphasize is the demand that we see from our customers and the specific feedback is it’s much more broad based than just China.
Vivek Arya – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Thank you.
Rick Clemmer: Thanks a lot.
Operator: Next question we have comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Ross Seymore – Deutsche Bank: Hi, guys. Congrats on another solid quarter and guide. Rick, first question is for you a bigger picture one. You mentioned that the semiconductor market I think “it’s slightly less optimistic.” It’s a big debate on what exactly that means these days cyclicalities and all etcetera. Can you give us a little bit of color on how you’re viewing the two of the current end demand in your broader based market please?
Rick Clemmer: Yeah. So Ross, it gets hard for us to really be able to call the total market based on the areas that we plan. I think we kind of use standard products as an indicator to that and what I would tell you is it’s probably not as strong as Q3 and so the question is, how much of that is seasonal or we would typically anticipate the semiconductor business to be off a little in Q4 and how much of that is other. We see some customers, where there is some weakness and we see other customers where there is very strong growth. So there is clearly a mixed message out there, but in general like for example micro controllers interface outside of the smartphone and tablet ramp, we saw a very good quarter in Q3. So I think in general, we see mixed signals associated with it. We don’t see anything that alarms us relative to significant decline or any significant inventory position, but there are some mixed signals so it’s not just onward and upwards as it has been frankly for the last few quarters prior to this.
Ross Seymore – Deutsche Bank: Great. That’s perfect. Thank you. And one follow up, one for Peter quickly. On the gross margin side of things, for the fourth quarter you’re guiding it flat by the traditional end markets splits or product splits. I would have thought that mix would have been a little bit favorable. So can you just walk us through the puts and takes in the gross margins please?
Peter Kelly: I’m kind of not sure why you would think it would be more favorable. I mean I guess if we’d have guided down, the argument would be some of the industrial products would be flatter and some of the more seasonable products would go down. But the mix hasn’t done that Ross so the mix is pretty stable.
Ross Seymore – Deutsche Bank: I guess what I was just looking at I&I being solidly in your guide and P&C being down into the extend the opposite cause the gross margin comes down a little bit in the third quarter, it would seem like it would revert the opposite direction back and the forth.
Peter Kelly: Actually, when you go into the detail mix we don’t see that at all. In terms of the end of what products, it’s relatively stable.
Ross Seymore – Deutsche Bank: Thank you.
Peter Kelly: Thanks, Ross.
Rick Clemmer: Thanks a lot, Ross.
Operator: Thank you. The next question we have comes from the line of Jim Covello from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
James Covello – Goldman Sachs: Hi, guys. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Good morning. Congrats on the good results. Question on what used to be the computing business you guys have done such a terrific job at that and the customer of quality the products because they only use the highest quality products. How important strategically or philosophically for you to grow out now your exposure in that space just not the subject or some of the same volatility some other suppliers who are levered to them in that space and have been over time?
Rick Clemmer: Thanks, Jim. Thanks for your comments. I think for us our focus is really on providing the fundamental capability. So last year most of the tear downs basically talked about DM6 and now moving forward to sensor hub actually being sourced by NXP then we can’t comment on that. What we can say is, is that we want to be sure that we take sensor hub technology and the advantages that it brings in battery life which is a critical feature for most users to broad based customers. And so with China Inc. as well as all of the largest handset guys, we are working specifically on that. And some of the unique capability that we have on high speed interface, we actually think we have some advantages we can bring in broad based customers there as well. So we’re not focused on any individual customer per se, it’s really more about technology and being able to drive that in a broad based space and again, our intent is to focus on those areas that are typically caught up in using the design in and design out and then design in somebody else. That can always happen but we clearly have line aside for some number of product trends or product platform basis to understand what happens. But our real focus is how we’ve brought our customer base and be able to drive more consistently associated with that across the general market because of the unique technology that we bring.
Peter Kelly: And Jim may be if I could add just one thing, in the new we don’t have that kind of fuel mobile business that obviously we have businesses or product lines that have kind of sell into those areas. And probably Secure Connected Devices the SCD business is the bit that’s most closely correlates to that. And I think over time we’ve been doing all plans recently we don’t see that getting really probably gets about 25% of our revenue over time. You normally see more mix may be a little bit more in the second half, little bit less in the second half of the year but we really want to have an awful lot of exposure to mobile segments. Certainly not going to be in the position of some of the companies that you see out there where massive single device exposure to a single customer.
James Covello – Goldman Sachs: That’s helpful perspective. And then, if I can just ask a follow up it’s related to John Pitzer’s question early, John asked about kind of the mobile pay. I guess my question is with what your largest NFC customers doing in terms of how they’re using NFC and I guess may be disabling for other functionalities so it could be used towards Apple Pay. What kind of dynamic do you see that is impacting on NFC outside of Pay for other customers? Because I think you guys have articulated very well that NFC has a broad range of applications not just payment at the site of purchase.
Rick Clemmer: I think one of the key things associated with NFC solutions is mobile payment is kind of the foundation but when you begin to think about all of the applications that take place associated with that, the encouraging thing is we can’t even think about all of the applications that will happen. One of the things that we talk to our automotive customers about in NFC it’s just simple pairing between your smartphones and car radio system which I don’t know about you, but every time I get in a new rental car, it takes me 15 minutes before I get my damn phone paired up before I can drive. But just being able to click and have that paired is actually a real benefit as we hear from automotive customers. So I think we can’t even think honestly about all of the applications that NFC can facilitate, but the ability to have a real secure connection and that’s really what our focus is as we go forward. We’ve been talking about that on the call today, we’ll talk about it a lot more on our Analyst Day, but we’re trying to really think about the future and how we leverage the leadership position we have in security and really looking then secure connections instead of talking about the Internet of things which nobody really knows what that is whether it’s machine to machine or we just try to say secure connections for a smarter world. And really that’s what we’re focused on as we look at the company beyond smartphones and tablets even though smartphones and tablets actually fall into that connected or smarter world as well.
James Covello – Goldman Sachs: Really helpful. Thanks again and congratulations.
Rick Clemmer: Thanks a lot, Jim.
Operator: Thank you. The next question we have comes from Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Craig Hettenbach – Morgan Stanley: Yes, thank you. For EMV, in North America, understanding it’s going to be a multi-year roll out. Can you talk about kind of near term what you’re seeing and the momentum that you do see in that marketing kind of going into 2015?
Rick Clemmer: We’ve seen a lot of activity, a lot of companies looking at technology, a lot of people talking about design wins. We’ve been fortunate to win a good share of those and we want to be focused on continuing to maintain our worldwide leadership on contact between 60% to 70% range. But as far as significant ramp up and volume I think it’s still in the early innings associated with it and we would expect that not to be a significant growth factor until 2015 timeframe.
Craig Hettenbach – Morgan Stanley: Got it. Thanks. And as a follow up, in the automotive market there have been some concerns of slowing growth particularly in Europe. Can you talk about the trends you’re seeing within automotive by geography?
Rick Clemmer: Yeah it’s really hard for us to break down the geography because when we ship to Boston Continental they may ship it to… If we ship it in Germany, they might ship it to China, if we ship it into China, they might ship it into Indonesia, Southeast Asia. So it really gets hard for us to have very specific information as to where the products are actually going. I would say Q3 which is typically a weak quarter in European automotive because of the vacation schedules was okay. [audio gap]. As some of the previous quarters for the E&C it shouldn’t have been. I think one of the things that have been key for us in automotive area that’s kept us from having a decline that we would typically have on a seasonal basis is some of the strong demand we’ve had on the car ramp up of new design wins that we’ve had in Japan and China and Asia. So I think that’s one of the key factors that allowed us to maintain double digit growth in our automotive business on a year-over-year basis.
Craig Hettenbach – Morgan Stanley: Got it. Thanks for the color there.
Rick Clemmer: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. The next question we have comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh from Sterne Agee. Please go ahead.
Vijay Rakesh – Sterne Agee: Hi guys. Congrats on a solid quarter and guide here. Just to get 2015 here on the Secured Connect Device side what are the opportunities do you see there in ID or home automation with the security? Thanks.
Rick Clemmer: We already see it in the early stages today, but it’s still relatively small or miniscule part of the total business. I think when we started talking about that, we have a smart lighting product we’re encouraged in working with some of our partners like Greenway for example to be able to take that to the much broader marketplace associated with it. One of the things that’s important to point out is even though it wasn’t last quarter, but a quarter ago, we won the Delphi design on the first design that’s actually been issued on Vehicle-to-Vehicle or ADAS design. And one of the reasons why we were able to secure that or win that design was because of the security product that we had that the automotive customer did not want to have the ability to have communications intercepted or influenced or changed. So that security feature represented one of the significant factors that allowed us to be the first company to actually have a significant design win in the Vehicle-to-Vehicle opportunity that I know you’ve probably may have seen some of the increased discussion even in the U.S. government but also European governments relative to the ability to bring safety to the citizen, reduce the number of accidents and reduce the cost of repair associated with those accidents.
Peter Kelly: I think for NXP, next year it’s probably 10s of millions rather than 100s of millions in that space. And I’m talking about your comments on ID and hopefully it starts to pick up as you get out into ‘16 and then more into ‘17. I don’t really see that as massive revenue drown for us next year.
Vijay Rakesh – Sterne Agee: Got it. And just going on the EMV side, I know you said briefly, I should get 2015 that’s where they start. Can you bracket for us the opportunities there in 2015 on EMV between U.S. and China? Thanks.
Rick Clemmer: China has continued to be the strongest growth segment for us over the last few years. We had a very strong growth contribution from the China dual interface cards in 2013. In 2014 has continued strong although not with the most significant growth. I guess one of the things that I understand was in the press just this week, was PBOC talked about that they now have issued over a billion cards so that addresses the markets that’s being rolled out in China. And I think China is well ahead of the U.S. and positions them well in acceptance of mobile payments and having the infrastructure in place to be able to drive that very successfully. When it comes back to the U.S. it is still a little bit of an issue there is two parties involved or three parties in some cases and the party that pays the additional cost associated with the EMV card isn’t necessarily gets the benefit of their fraud reduction associated with it. Security is clearly a high priority. In fact, you may have seen that President Obama actually put out a presidential order in the last few days specifically requiring that over the next 18 months that U.S. government ensures that all of the citizens’ information is protected with a chip device to be sure that, that it avoids some of the cyber security risk associated with that. We just announced this week a roll out of product that we’ve been working with Google on this secure access to cloud. So clearly it’s an area of great deal of excitement for us, although pretty nice and relative to the actual trends today.
Vijay Rakesh – Sterne Agee: All right. Great. Thanks.
Rick Clemmer: Thanks, Vijay.
Operator: The next question we have comes from the line of Chris Caso with Susquehanna Financial Group. Please go ahead.
Chris Caso – Susquehanna Financial Group: Thank you. Good morning. Wanted to come back on some of your earlier comments related to the market in general and it sounds like those comments are referring more to kind of what you’re seeing around and inherent from those as opposed to what you’re seeing in your business. I guess my question is to what extent some of those factors you’re seeing around you are factored into your guidance, may be you could talk about as you’re looking forward into the fourth quarter the level of conservatism that you’re taking with approach to guidance or just really basic on the levels you’re seeing from your customers?
Rick Clemmer: Thanks. I think it would be good point to point out when I was [inaudible] about the general broad base semiconductor market and not NXP because basically our guidance that’s the expectation for NXP and clearly the ability for us to be above what would be the typical seasonal pattern in Q4 indicates the strength of our new design wins and being able to accomplish that. What we try to do with our guidance is to give best perspective on the range of revenue we see. So clearly we think that we’ve done that this quarter to give you a perspective of what we see. We try to lay it out just as directly and straightforward as we can. The key for us is the ramp up of design wins that we have and the mix of our business one of the things that does gives an advantage is the portfolio of our product and not all business have to be performing at the same rates all the time as clearly indicated with our Secured Identification Solutions in the near term which is a little weaker. But it gives us stability when the broad based portfolio we have so that we can continue to outperform the industry and overall growth by having multitude of platforms to be able to drive in the marketplace and not focus on mainly singular platform but so critical to drive the growth of the company.
Chris Caso – Susquehanna Financial Group: Great. Thank you. As a follow up, if I can come back to the automotive market and if I look at the quarterly revenue growth rates have moved around a little bit this year on seasonality. But as you look at on an annual basis what’s your level of confidence that automotive segment for you guys remain as a double digit growth.
Rick Clemmer: I think the right way to look at automotive is year-over-year so you take the seasonal pattern out as you’ve indicated. So I think that is positive for us that we continue to be in double digit growth over the last few quarters associated with automotive and when we’re looking forward, we are have to align with most of the inventory that we have is managed inventory so we actually see that very real time from a production viewpoint. But really clearly the growth that we see being double digit, what we really talked about going forward is something that’s high single digit. So we’d expect that to be slightly lower than what it’s been over the last few quarters. But we continue to see very positive environment. The continued ramp up of the platforms that we’ve won over the last few years either in the remote keyless entry with the second largest U.S. automotive manufacturer that’s probably something like fourth or third of their roll out of their models. So still there is significant growth there and then in our car radio platforms with the new design wins that we have with and Pioneer and a lot of new customers that we’ve won over the last few years, there are still changing models bringing to end of life models that we’ve not included in continuing to ramp up the volume to new design wins that we’re in allows to perform at a different level than the automotive industry itself.
Chris Caso – Susquehanna Financial Group: Okay, great. Thank you.
Rick Clemmer: Thank you, Chris.
Operator: The next question we have comes from the line of Tore Svanberg from Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Tore Svanberg – Stifel Nicolaus & Company: Yes. Thank you. Congratulations on the results. My first question is on your inventory dates, 86 days I think that’s the lowest you had in three years. So just hoping you could talk a little bit about you feel that that’s an ideal number at this time or how do you intend to potentially change the number going forward?
Peter Kelly: Well from a dollar base effect, it’s still a significant level of dollars. I’m comfortable fighting in the organization as CFO I’d like zero inventory because I like the cash. So from my customer perspective you really have to look at what provides the best service. I think where we are at the moment it’s okay, actually in the couple of spots a bit low. I’d like to see a little bit more finished goods in automotive but that’s really just because you never know what natural disasters might occur in the world. I think our ID business has a pretty good inventory I&I seems pretty solid. I thought may be in the past it was little high now it’s come down but no I think inventory is okay and it’s easy to manage your inventory when you’re growing quite rapidly so I feel very comfortable with the inventory at the moment.
Rick Clemmer: I think probably we want to point out, we still have a few product lines where we’re handing out to see from being able to meet our customer requirements. And so clearly there is not any inventories in those areas.
Peter Kelly: Yeah Playstations are very strong of that.
Rick Clemmer: And we actually even have some product lines requirement we’re kind of hand them out associated with it. So I think in general, our inventories are in really good shape but we’re still right at the edge of being able to maintain the support associated with the customers for the design wins that we’ve been successful at winning one.
Tore Svanberg – Stifel Nicolaus & Company: That’s fair enough and a good problem to have. And as my follow up, you’re guiding your I&I business to be up in the mid-single digit to the December quarter some of those segments tend to be down seasonally. So I’m just wondering if there is any new programs or any specific [audio gap] at this point?
Rick Clemmer: Yeah I think the combination continued being able to meet our customers’ requirements improving our supply in our high performance RF, the power amplifier for base stations and also may be little bit of new model designs in our mobile audio products that’s contributing to slightly in Q4.
Tore Svanberg – Stifel Nicolaus & Company: Thank you again. And great quarter.
Peter Kelly: Thanks, Tore.
Operator: The next question we have comes from the line of Mark Lipacis from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Mark Lipacis – Jefferies: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just a follow up on the power amp for base station products. It sounds like you’re still allocating there. Is there any changes in the market from that standpoint on the demand side the companies talk about weaker demand I’m wondering if you’re seeing the same? That’s the first question.
Rick Clemmer: Yeah, we really haven’t seen any significant change in demand associated with the power amps. I think again we talked about earlier may be a factor associated with that is, it seemed like the design wins on the platform are more concentrated outside of China than inside of China or may be some of our competitors are more concentrated on the platforms on China as opposed to that. But we haven’t really seen what I would consider any significant weakness and in fact really develop some very good relationship with customers. Sometimes the best relationship come out of the problem areas which obviously we had earlier in the in being able to support our customer requirements. And frankly we still have a couple of individual products that we struggle our customer requirements now which is clearly significant for them achieving their revenue goals and we have quite ongoing discussion how we support that.
Mark Lipacis – Jefferies: That’s helpful. Thanks. And then follow up question just on Standard Products just a clarification, you’re expecting that business to be down low single digits is that seasonal or is that normal seasonal expectation do you think? You also talked about the signals you look at typically help you understand whether or not you’re going into an inventory correction or demand inflexion. What are those signals that you typically look at? Thank you.
Rick Clemmer: Let me address the first one, on Standard Products, it’s fairly typical from a seasonal basis but again as we said earlier there are some questions that are down and other customers that are up. So it’s really hard to draw distinct conclusions associated with it but clearly we think more of what we see would be classified as the typical seasonal basis as opposed to real change of demand from a broad based on the semiconductor side but there are mixed signals associated with it. Relative to indicators of what’s going on in the market we look broadly at many things like book to bill. We try not to talk a lot about book to bill because we don’t it’s a very strong good indicator because there’s many times when you will be below one on a book to bill basis on a weekly basis that really isn’t the indication of the future as it is in some other company’s cases. We look at inventory levels but it really all comes back to really understanding the customers’ demands and trying to be on the top of the demand from customers as much as we can and the environment we see from our customers primarily our distribution customers we see today, it’s still okay. We don’t see any precipitous decline but we don’t see a robust uptick either clearly. But the feedback we get from our customers on a daily basis is that demand’s okay.
Mark Lipacis – Jefferies: Fair enough. Thank you.
Jeff Palmer: Thanks, Mark. Operator, we’ll take our last question now please.
Operator: Yes. The last question comes from the line of William Stein of SunTrust. Please go ahead.
William Stein – SunTrust: Thank you very much for squeezing me in here. I’d like to address inventory and in particular distribution. So it sounds like inventory was up on a dollars basis pretty substantially in the channel. But Rick you eluded to some specific programs may be mobility a little surprising you turn to think about distribution serving very diversified kind of small and medium customer base. So can you highlight what’s going on there?
Rick Clemmer: Yeah thanks, Will. So I think what we were trying to say is the larger increase on the dollar basis on the inventory was more specifically associated with unique mobile platforms smartphones and tablets being prepared for those ramps associated with the volume because we still have the number of our customers that while we serve significant volumes we do that through the distribution channels some other ODM relationships and the way that they manufacture that. I think we feel very comfortable with our distribution inventory at 2.6. We think that in fact our Standard Products we would like to be higher on that on an ongoing basis and Standard Products is clearly in a very healthy position we have some of our product lines that we’d like to have more inventory in place, very healthy position. We have some of our product lines that we’d like to have more inventory in lines associated with it than when we are on the 2.6. As some of the inventory that have been in place for some of those product, associated with new products and product grants associated with new products in the smartphone and tablet space going into production then we would hopefully be able to put some additional inventory in some of those areas where for example we actually don’t have much inventory in place [audio gap]. So I think the key thing is the overall message that we see is at 2.6 months we feel very comfortable with it and think it’s well in line and well under control.
William Stein – SunTrust: Great. Thanks. And then maybe I can switch gears to ask about capital allocation the debt hasn’t come up in a while obviously you’ve matured significantly in that regard about to turn net leverage ratio about and what looks like pretty stable cash flow in the last couple of quarters, would you consider that perhaps you should operate at a higher debt level and especially given that you believe the stocks are undervalued, you’ve highlighted that a few times, would you contemplate more leverage?
Peter Kelly: It’s a great question, Will and as a finance guy because of the fact that I really see NXP as an industrial company and contribute to the industrial company, I think we could operate at a higher level of debt I’m not sure that the semiconductor industry is quite ready for it. I think the big question for us in the coming years is in order to maintain our two times ratio we would technically would have to increase our gross debt and we sort of did that in the quarter. So we’ve maintained the two times ratio we’ve increased our gross and net debt really just because we’ve got a revolver. And we use that to buy back stock but I think at this point in time we have a terrifically healthy balance sheet. Our cash flow generation is excellent and with the stock price where it is we will continue to reach cash to shareholders buybacks.
Rick Clemmer: I guess if I can add something what Peter did in the current quarter by increasing our debt a little bit was more of if you will, little bit of a pull end of what buyback might have happened by the cash flow generated from the ongoing business. I think we feel very comfortable with our debt structure. We like it and it gives us a lot of flexibility as in the future when we think about M&A transactions where we obviously might use debt to be able to facilitate that.
William Stein – SunTrust: Great. Well I look forward to digging in more on these on your Analyst Day.
Jeff Palmer: Thanks, Will. May be I’d like to pass the call back to Rick Clemmer for some final comments now before we end the call today.
Rick Clemmer: So I thank you all for your continued interest in NXP. The key points of the highlight we progress in 2015. Our revenue growth continues to be robust with growth significantly above our peers based on the year to year revenue and midpoint of our guidance 2014 is shaping to be a near to high watermark in terms of the total revenue with several businesses achieving record revenue levels already. As improved profit profiles, Q3 gross profit dollar were up about 24% and operating profit dollars up 37% on a year-on-year basis continuing to generate strong growth in earnings per share that we’ve reported. On cash I can’t emphasize enough the strong cash generation capability we have increased free cash flow roughly at about 105% representing a 21% free cash flow margin during the quarter. And clearly we tried to use that cash as well as we talked about pulling in little bit about of our debt to repurchase our shares over the last 12 months returning just over $1.34 billion to shareholders. So thanks a lot for your support and we’d look forward to seeing you in our upcoming Analyst Day on November 5th in New York City.
Peter Kelly: Thank you everybody. Appreciate your time on the call today.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today’s conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Thank you for joining and enjoy the rest of your day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q2 2014 NXP Semiconductors NV Earnings Conference Call. My name is Susan, and I'll be your operator for today. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards of this conference. As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes. I'd now like to hand over to Mr. Jeff Palmer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.
Jeff Palmer: Thank you, Susan, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the NXP Semiconductors Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. With me on the call today is Rick Clemmer, NXP's President and CEO; as well as Peter Kelly, our CFO. If you've not obtained a copy of our second quarter 2014 earnings press release, it can be found in our company Web site under the Investor Relations section at nxp.com. Additionally, we have posted on our Investor Relations Web site a supplemental earnings summary presentation and a document of our historical financials to assist in your modeling efforts. This call is being recorded and will be available for replay from our corporate Web site. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause NXP's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the macroeconomic impact on the specific end markets in which we operate, the sale of new and existing products and our expectations for financial results for the third quarter of 2014. Please be reminded that NXP undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements. For a full disclosure on forward-looking statements, please refer to our press release. Additionally, during our call today, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the impact of purchase price accounting, restructuring, stock-based compensation, impairment and other charges that are driven primarily by discrete events that management does not consider to be directly related to NXP's underlying core operating performance. Pursuant to Regulation G, NXP has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our second quarter 2014 earnings press release, which will be furnished to the SEC on Form 6-K and is available on NXP's Web site in the Investor Relations section at nxp.com. I'd like to now turn the call over to Rick.
Rick Clemmer: Thanks Jeff, and we welcome everyone to our earnings call today. We are really pleased to be here as our results and guidance today mark major milestone in the growth story that is NXP. Many of the design opportunities we have discussed over the last several quarters and before continue to see significant and material traction. As our third quarter guidance reflects, we believe the momentum should continue into future periods. Turning to our results for the second quarter, they were very good and overall above the high-end of our guidance. Our results reflect strong broad-based revenue performance, good operating profit growth with incrementally higher operating expenses as we continue to invest for future growth. Product revenue was approximately $1.3 billion an 8% sequential improvement and up 13% versus the prior year period. This was a new record of NXP since the IPO with nearly all of our business lines delivering revenue performance above our expectations. Total NXP revenue was approximately $1.35 billion also an 8% sequential increase was approximately 14% from the year ago period. Turning now to our segment performance HPMS revenue was just under a $1 billion at $988 million an 8% sequential increase and up nearly 13% from a year ago period. We believe our HPMS revenue growth continues growth in excess – well in excess of our peer group, a clear proof point that our HPMS strategy can consistently deliver growth in excess of our industry peers. And now, I would like to review the results for our various HPMS businesses. Within our ID business, revenue was $343 million, up 8% versus the prior quarter in line with our expectations and 1% growth on a year-on-year basis. Remembering the year ago period was influenced by strong initial ramp on an initial stocking of our China banking business which as you would expect has an impact on the year-to-year comparison. Order trends within core ID business were solid with revenue up 5% sequentially. Growth within core ID was driven by good demand across nearly all product lines especially in banking with slight sequential declines that we had anticipated in the eGovernment business. Overall core ID continues to represent about 85% of the total ID revenue. Within our emerging ID business which includes mobile transactions and authentication, revenue was up 22% sequentially but down about 1% versus the year ago period. Moving now to our P&C end market, revenue was $147 million, a 9% sequential increase and a 39% from the year ago period. This was $10 million better than the upper end of our expectations primarily due to broad based market – multi-market demand for both interface and NCE products. Within our infrastructure and industrial business, revenue was $210 million up 15% sequentially and up about 17% versus the year ago period. During the quarter revenue was inline with our original expectations as base station OEMs drove the majority of the increase. For our emerging business and car lighting business were both up sequentially. Within our automotive business, revenue was $288 million another strong quarter though a just bit below expectations. Revenue was up 4% quarter-on-quarter and up 14% versus the second quarter of 2013. From a product perspective we experienced strong sequential demand for entertainment products, while keyless entry and in-vehicle networking solutions were both up modestly. Finally, turning to our Standard Products segment, revenue was $316 million better than anticipated resulting in a 7% quarter-on-quarter growth and up a strong 12% versus the year ago period. We continue to experience better mix in the business driven mostly by the general discrete portion of the business. I would like to acknowledge the hard work of the standard products team as cut in over the last year. They are gaining market share, delivering improved profitability and focusing on more defensible long-term opportunities. Turning now to our distribution channel performance. Total sales in the distribution were up 9%, with sales out of distribution up 4% as we position material ahead of an anticipated strong Q3. The total months of inventory in distribution channel were 2.6 months inline with our longer term models. Absolute dollars of inventory in the channel increased about 8% on the sequential basis. In summary, our overall results in Q2 were very good, with better overall product revenue, better operating profit and good free cash flow. And can be seen in our earnings release we are anticipating another strong quarter in the Q3. We believe we can continue to monetize our company-specific opportunities, which should result in better-than-industry growth, continued improvement in profitability and robust cash flow generations. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Peter to discuss the financial details of the quarter.
Peter Kelly: Thank you, Rick. And good morning to everyone on todays call. As Rick has already covered the drivers of revenue, I'll move directly to the highlights of the quarter. Overall, Q2 was a very good quarter and at the high end of our expectations. Total revenue, non-GAAP gross profit, operating profit and net income were all better than the midpoints of our guidance and non-GAAP EPS was $1.09 from $0.04 above the midpoint. Focusing on the details of Q2. Revenue was $1.32 billion, $123 million above the midpoint of our guidance and $103 million increase from Q1. We generated $655 million in non-GAAP gross profit or 48.6% non-GAAP gross margin, about $16 million above the midpoint of our guidance and $38 million better than Q1 due to better than expected revenue performance on an improved mix. Now let me turn to the operating segments. Within the HPMS segment, revenue was $988 million, up about 8% versus the previous quarter. HPMS non-GAAP gross margin was 55.4%, 60 basis points below the Q1 while non-GAAP operating margin was 27.8%, 50 basis points above the prior quarter. Within our Standard Products segment, revenue was $316 million up 7% sequentially. Standard Products non-GAAP gross margin of 33.2% was flat versus Q1 on a percentage point basis. And non-GAAP operating margin was nearly 20% up 190 basis improvement sequentially. Really is pleasing to see our Standard Products recovered as we indicated it would over the last year and is now solidly within the range of excellent profit performance. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $322 million, up $5 million on a sequential basis as we continued investments in support of major customer programs as well as accruals for incentive compensation better than expected market share growth and progress towards profitability goals. From a total operating profit perspective, non-GAAP operating profit was $334 million and represents a 24.8% operating margin, up about 60 basis points versus the prior quarter. Interest expense was $34 million; non-controlling interest was $19 million and cash taxes were $8 million in (indiscernible). Total NXP non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.09 towards the high end of our guidance on $0.11 better on a sequential basis. Stock-based compensation, which is not included in our non-GAAP earnings, was $37 million. Now I'd like to turn to the changes in our cash and debt. Our total debt at the end of Q2 was $3.58 billion essentially flat on a sequentially basis. And cash at the end of quarter was $661 million. We exited the quarter with a trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.49 billion, and our ratio of net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of Q2 was 1.97x inline with our target of 2x. We bought back 3.8 million shares at a cost of approximately $223 million or a weighted cost of about $59.40 per share. Turning to our working capital metrics. Days of inventory were 96 days a decrease of 6 days sequentially and excluding prebuilds associated with the restructuring of our fabs, our effective DIO was 88 days. Days receivable were 43 days, while days payable were 80. Taken together, our cash conversion cycle improved to 59 days from the 66 days reported in the previous quarter. Cash flow from operations was $242 million, and net CapEx was $89 million, resulting in positive free cash flow of $153 million or 11% free cash flow margin. Free cash flow was a little less than previous quarters as we paid our bonuses and in 2013 on a slightly higher restructuring cash out payments of about $28 million. Now I'd like to provide our outlook for Q3. Based on our analysis that appears we are continuing to gain market share across the product portfolio and we anticipate NXP should continue to substantially outperform the overall market. We continue to have a number of company specific programs, which we see contributing to solid growth in future periods. With this as a background, we currently anticipate product revenue will be in the range of up 10% to up 13% sequentially. At the midpoint, we expect product revenue to be up in Q3 about 11%, reflecting the following trends in the business, all on a sequential percentage basis. Within our HPMS segment, we expect Automotive to be flat to slightly up sequentially; Identification is expected to be up in the mid teens range; Portable & Computing is expected to be up in the 40% range at 4-0; Infrastructure & Industrial is expected to be up in the low-teens range; Standard Products is expected to be up in the low single-digit range. We anticipate revenue from the combination of manufacturing and Corporate and Other to be approximately $43 million. So taken together, total NXP revenue should be in the range of $1.47 billion to $1.52 billion, or about $1.495 billion at the midpoint. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be about 48% to the midpoint plus or minus. And operating expenses are expected to be in a range of $330 million to $340 million, about $335 million at the midpoint or 23% of the revenue which is still under our target metric of 24%. This translates into a non-GAAP operating profit in the range of $370 million to $395 million, or about 26% operating margin at the midpoint. Interest expense on our debt should be approximately $35 million. Cash taxes are expected to be roughly $7 million, non-controlling interest expense should be about $17 million and stock-based compensation should be about $34 million, which is excluded from our guidance. Diluted share count should be about 250 million shares, but obviously depends on share price fluctuations and the level of buy backs we execute. Taken together, this translates into non-GAAP earnings per share in a range of $1.25 to $1.35, or $1.30 per share at the midpoint of our guidance, so an excellent quarter, strong guidance. And I'd like to turn it back to the operator for your questions.
Jeff Palmer: Susan we will for questions now.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: Yes. Good morning guys, thanks for letting me ask the question, congratulations on strong results. I want to focus my question and follow-up really on some of the sub-segments driving growth in the September growth. I guess my first question, within the ID guidance for September, can you help me better understand what's coming from core ID versus the more emerging ID and within the core ID bucket, are we starting to see kind of the banking business come back or the eGovernment come back a little bit of color there would be helpful?
Rick Clemmer: So I think the key John is on banking, China banking was really strong Q2 a year ago, when we really had the stocking into play. So China banking even in our Q2 results as come back but it's not as high as the year ago basis because again that was more on a stocking basis. So I would say our China banking business now is back at more of a steady state basis slightly below where it was a year ago – a year ago Q2 but very strong. Clearly, when you look at Q3, we will have a significant portion of our growth it will come from the emerging ID business but we haven't broken out the details of that and just we would like to anticipate growth for the total ID business.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: And then Rick, on the industrial and infrastructure, I know that you have been trying to kind of balance the strength coming from base stations with the capacity you have, yesterday we kind of I guess Tuesday night, we kind of got a data point from the PLDs that maybe there is a pause going on there. You guys kind of guiding I&I up pretty significantly in the September quarter. Is that again, another base station driven event or can you help us understand what's driving the growth there for September?
Rick Clemmer: For September, we expect strong growth in base stations, we have been capacity limited in supporting our customers and been hand to mouth actually constraining the shipments that they could ship based on the power amplifier which is not the position we like to be in. We tried to base this business for where we can have a nice profitable growth as opposed to a bombast cycle. So we have actually frustrated some of our customers in the near term not being able to meet all the requirements but anticipate strong growth in Q2. And to be fair as we talked to our base station customers it's much more broad than just China LTE, the customers that we have in and if you will think about over the last few quarters John, one of the things that we see in the base stations is the growth of some accounts where weren't designed in before. So we are actually growing more than just the basic demand as we gain share in the near term based on the design wins we have. But, it's clearly been limited based on our manufacturing capacity. We bring on some additional capacity in Q3 and that will clearly give us the position to be able to support our customers in a little bit more significant fashion than we were able to do in Q2 and hopefully not had quite as many customer visits to explain their frustration with our like up support.
Peter Kelly: And John, it's Peter. Certainly base stations is doing quite well and Rick explain that. We are also seeing in that segment, our TLS business is doing fine and our emerging business is also doing very well in particular our mobile audio. So it's not just base stations.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: Thanks guys. Congratulations again.
Rick Clemmer: Thanks John.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays: Hey, guys great results. May I can about the other segment Portable & Computing up 40%, to the extend you can talk about it, maybe difficult maybe in the context of do you have new ramps that you are adding in this sector or is it similar products just getting more penetration, is there anyway you can kind of breakout where that's strength coming from?
Rick Clemmer: Vijay, I think the key was that it was broad based. It was across our macro which is – Blayne, sorry Blayne.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays: Yes.
Rick Clemmer: It was broad based across our interface and macro. So we would not – it was not any ramps key programs in Q2. We do expect to see some of those in Q3, the guidance that we have. But, this was really broad based with design wins that we've won with the acceleration of those on a very broad based with most of that actually going through the distribution channel.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays: Got you. And then maybe just following back up on your infrastructure comments. Do you think now given where you are shipping to in September that you are going to be caught up and if you can just comment, I mean I think you have done a good job managing this versus some others who have shipped ahead and off to correct? Are you seeing any sort of pause in China more directly that others have mentioned.
Rick Clemmer: We are seeing that at all Blayne. What we are seeing is, is that our customers tell us we are still not meeting their full requirements. But I think the one thing that we as well as our base stations customers, they are seeing broad based demand. I mean in Q2, there was one of the issues we struggled to be able to support the growth in Latin America supporting deployment associated with the World Cup. But, there is a broad based base station demand in the Middle East and Africa and well beyond just China that we understand from our base station customers and we are still not meeting the requirements. Now we are taking the opportunity and working with our customers to be sure that we secure longer term run rates and orders with these base station customers as well. So it's – we created frustration for them but we have done as good a job as we could working through that and now trying to be sure that we secure longer term business on an ongoing basis with the intent again to make it a profitable growth business and not focused on doing best cycle.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays: Thanks guys.
Rick Clemmer: Thanks Blayne.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of William Stein, SunTrust. Please proceed.
William Stein - SunTrust: Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question and congrats on the very strong guidance. Maybe I'm going to go at Portable & Computing guidance a bit of a different way. Can you help us understand the – maybe the relative level of concentration in terms of customers and products that are driving the very strong guidance there is it? I'm sure it's not one customer, one product, but maybe give us a sense as to how concentrated or diversified that growth is going to be?
Rick Clemmer: I think the key thing is to not just talk about Q3 but to talk about Q2. As we talked about our Q2 results which were extremely strong, we see that on a broad base -- customer base. So with broad number of design wins from early through the distribution channel, clearly, we have some key design wins at some of the leading smartphone and tablet company in Q3 that will be a significant factor in our Q3 growth. But it's not just in a single customer concentration. There is a broad based growth with really the design wins in the smartphone and tablet area being incremental growth over and above that.
William Stein - SunTrust: That's helpful. Maybe shifting to another area, I think you didn't talk about, I believe that the company got a design win for it's [V2X] (ph) or 80211-E product in the quarter and it seems to me that's fairly compelling product area. I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about what we see the – maybe in the longer term opportunities there? Thank you.
Jeff Palmer: William, this is Jeff. We did talk about that we had – and ordered the first design on our Car-to-Car communication program. The automobile industry works in a different cadence and just about any other industry. That design will go into production until the 2017 model year, surprise to see it late 2016. So it's still quite a ways away from being real revenue. But we are pretty excited about that discussions with other major auto OEMs are going very positively. What was kind of interesting about the award on the Car-to-Car communication was also it's not just the communication part that was – we were seen as being superior to, it was the security that we brought into the system. So it was a very, very -- very good award for us in that perspective.
William Stein - SunTrust: That's great.
Rick Clemmer: Yes. I think we are really encouraged about the opportunity of driving a total solution base there then providing a security as well as the overall connectivity really placed our strength as we go forward and what we are trying to accomplish as a company. And as Jeff said, it will be a few years before it ramps. But, we clearly one of the leader in that space and true that we are thought leader in the Car-to-Car, vehicle-to-vehicle communications.
William Stein - SunTrust: Great. Thanks very much.
Jeff Palmer: Thanks Will.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of CJ Muse, ISI Group. Please proceed.
CJ Muse - ISI Group: Hey, good morning. Thank you or good afternoon. Thank you for taking my call. I guess first question, tell us if you can kind of talk about the sustainability of the outside growth that you are seeing in P&C and ID, love to hear your thoughts in terms of leverage to the breadth of customers you talked about as well as any individual product cycles that we should be thinking about?
Rick Clemmer: I don't think we want to get in – back into the discussion of individual product cycles and individual product designs. I think the thing that we see is clearly the opportunity for the mobile wallet to finally begin to emerge as the kind of expectation as we have had for quite some time. And with some of the new used cases being a significant opportunity in driving the results. So I guess the only thing we can really say CJ is, we are giving you pretty good guidance relative to the revenue growth, we don't think it's a one shot pop. We think this is a sustainable systemic change of the fundamental core of the business where you will see mobile wireless and clearly the interface designs that we have had contributing in the microcontroller design wins contributing on the P&C side. But we see that on a sustainable basis. We don't see that it's just a near term pop.
Peter Kelly: Yes. CJ, its Peter. One of the things we have been talking about is kind of long-term compound annual growth rates over the years. We still see P&C has been kind of mid-teen sustainable growth rate over a number of years.
CJ Muse: Okay. Very helpful. And then if I could follow-up Standard Products below a quarter great operating margins, I guess how should we think about growth from here and there and as well as, is there more juice on the operating side or should we be thinking around 20% go forward?
Rick Clemmer: Well, 26% on operating income.
Peter Kelly: If the Standard Products – few years ago it ran well over 20% but that was in a really, really unusual market. So I think Standard Products running between 18% and 20% is super, super solid. We would expect it to grow inline with the semi-market generally. And of course, we are very focused as Rick says in total company level that one is 26%.
CJ Muse: And I guess to follow-up there, were there any particular drivers of strength there, or is it just broad based?
Peter Kelly: It's broad based. Discrete and it's basically we think a reflection of the kind of current strength in the semi-market.
Rick Clemmer: It was really in transistors and diodes where we saw the strength this quarter and we think it's well served. And so long as we can run as Peter said 18% to 20% then that gives us the support we need to be able to run the 26% operating income for the total company.
CJ Muse: Perfect. Thanks so much.
Peter Kelly: Thank you.
Rick Clemmer: Thanks CJ.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava, Bank of Montreal. Please proceed.
Ambrish Srivastava - Bank of Montreal: Thank you. A question on the more broader businesses that you serve. And we always thought about the cyclical factors, what are you seeing in terms of lead times orders, channel inventory, the more broader end. And then, I had a question on free cash flow, CapEx ticked up a little bit for the year, should we still be thinking in the 5% range in terms of capital intensity? Thank you.
Rick Clemmer: Well, so, on the channel inventory we talked about it being a 2.6 months, so still well within the balance where we would like it to be. It increased slightly in the quarter on a dollar basis as we prepare for the increased revenue in Q3 be able to meet our customer requirements. But, I think that where we are as an industry is we are now beginning to see an improvement in demand. So I think we has an industry had been waiting to see China and I think when you really get down to it the demand improvements are here. And it's looking fairly attractive. So the positive thing for us is, as we have some incremental demand through the design wins that we have that actually position us better than just a general industry growth. So I would say that unlike where we have been over the last couple of years where we said, we felt like the industry really worth of seeing a strong growth. But we have been able to drive design wins and now we are beginning to see growth in the industry with the incremental design win striving growth over and above that. Now, let Peter talk about the CapEx.
Peter Kelly: CapEx. CapEx, we could really try and run 5% through the cycle. To be honest this year probably will be a little bit higher my guess is maybe 5.8% of revenue. Our CapEx tends mostly to actually be in the backend and particularly in test of the CapEx level what you spend in our frontend fabs is, is relatively small and tends to cover how we boast particular bottle mix as opposed to large scale investment, so capacity is increasing, our growth is covered external sources.
Ambrish Srivastava - Bank of Montreal: Hey, great. Thank you.
Jeff Palmer: Thanks Ambrish.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya of Bank of America. Please proceed.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America: Thank you for taking my question. Rick, I'm curious in emerging ID mobile banking, are you seeing demand for just NFC controller chips, or are you seeing also healthy attach rate for the secured element. And if there is anyway to quantify what the attach rate of secure element is today and what it can be next year?
Rick Clemmer: As we know and you know a different – our customers have different architecture associated with it. I think as we go forward, but we think will be the game changer that really proves the ease of use. It will have a combination of secured element, the radio. So we feel very comfortable with the strength of the secured element and continuing to contribute to the business. But, there will be certain of our customers that will just use the radio without having a secured element. So it's not like we can push – point to any single direction associated with it. But I would tell you that we were excited about the growth going forward, the secured element will deploy a significant share of that mobile wallet opportunity.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America: Got it. And maybe just to clarify that and then my follow-up question. So the clarification would be that in terms of content then is it then fair to assume that your average content in emerging ID hopefully stays similar to what you are getting today. And then my follow-up question is just your view of industry consolidation, you have obviously shown a very good sales growth and you have achieved your operational and that delivering objectives as the first milestone you had set out. So what is the next major milestone for NXP? And do you think it will perhaps need some inorganic transaction? Thank you.
Rick Clemmer: Well, on the industry side, I guess what we said, we started seeing kind of late last year was now that we have our capital structure or our net debt is below 2x annualized EBITDA, we feel very comfortable with our capital structure and like our debt structure where it is, even basically 75% of it being unsecured and locked in at 3.8% Peter?
Peter Kelly: Yes.
Rick Clemmer: Overall debt cost, so we feel very comfortable with the debt structure where we have it. So we think that gives us the opportunity to think about acquisitions that we wouldn't have thought of through kind of the end of last year. As you can tell that we are not going to be running out quickly and buying something just to be able to buy something. We will be very patient. What we would want to do is, focus on something that will expand our one of our key franchise areas, our true leadership positions and strengthen that. It would have to be significantly accretive and we want to be in a position where we could be back at the 2x annualized EBITDA basis within three to five quarters. So that said, we are not going to do a $5 billion or $6 billion M&A deal. But, we would have the tendency to be limit that to more like a couple of $1 billion. But, we would be very patient and very careful on our first transaction as we think it's important to be able to continue to support the organic growth that we have and demonstrate to our shareholders the opportunity to really exist with the company as it is today. But, we do have the opportunities now to think about inorganic growth in an additive to that growth that we both portrayed and talked about from the core NXP business.
Peter Kelly: Which is exactly what we have been saying I guess for the past nine months now.
Rick Clemmer: Right.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America: And content on emerging – you think that's stays roughly similar to what you have right now?
Rick Clemmer: Yes. I think clearly we will continue to have some customers that would just use the radio and some that we use the radio and secured element. We think that the real killer app would be – we will have the radio plus the secured element which provides the security to really be able to protect individuals' wallets. We think that if somebody is using the radio then there is a weakness, they are trying to use software as the security and clearly that exposes it to additional hacking issues. And so we think the secured element plays a very key part of the total mobile transaction solution that provides the security that we all want to have of our individual wallet.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America: Okay. Thank you.
Rick Clemmer: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore, Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank: Hi, guys. Congrats on the strong quarter guide. Thanks for letting me ask you a question. The automotive market, big market for you guys across a couple of different segments, can you give us a little more color why that was a little bit weaker than expected in any other dynamic you are seeing going forward in it?
Rick Clemmer: Yes. It wasn't really anything of significance. I think it was just kind of some shipments at the end of the quarter that kind of got held up. So I wouldn't take any indication of the weakness in the business based on the results that we have in Q2. We continue to see really strong growth in automotive business. Our position is especially in the car entertainment now having – basically all of the mid and high car radio platforms that use our technology that's still ramping at a number of those as they transition. And then the true leadership position that we have in the remote keyless entry as well as the in-vehicle networking in a very strong position. And so really the key for us has been the emerging areas that we talked about the design win on the vehicle-to-vehicle and being in a position where we can be a thought leader in that space and in some of the other emerging technologies that we think can play a role in growth in automotive that we will talk more about it in our Investor Day in November.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank: Great. And I guess it's my follow-up switching gears over the gross margin thought side for Peter. I know in your guidance the operating margin is improving nicely, the slight drop in the gross margin, can you give us a little color, is that just mix, is it mix between segments, mix within the segments, anymore color would be helpful? Thank you.
Peter Kelly: I think it's a number thing. It's mix – probably mix within segments rather than between segments. And then the ramp of some new products, so I don't say it's kind of split pretty evenly between the two of those.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank: Great. Thank you.
Peter Kelly: And to point out the operating margin, it's pretty terrific.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley: Yes. Thank you. I want to touch on just operating margins with the guidance to Q3, you kind of right in the door step of 27%. I know you talked about also continuing to invest for growth. So maybe give us some of the puts and takes in terms of the leverage fall through as well as some of the growth initiatives as you go forward?
Peter Kelly: Our intension is to remain 26% and we have been pretty clear we don't really intent to go beyond that. So to the extent that we get additional revenue which would give you leverage on OpEx will reinvest in R&D further it's a drop of future growth for the company. So you should plan above average industry revenue growth and 26% EBIT below tax rate, fantastic earnings growth.
Rick Clemmer: And generating a lot of cash.
Peter Kelly: Yes.
Rick Clemmer: So I think the key for us is, we would rather be sure that we drive incremental growth as opposed to trends squeeze out an extra 50 basis points on operating income. We think that there is some areas that clearly if we step or improve the investment on R&D side will give us a better long-term growth opportunity. So we have some of those built up as we committed to our investors that it was around 26% operating income. But, our focus is on maintaining the 26% operating income and generating well above industry growth at least 50% faster than the industry growth which we think will generate a lot of operating income and then with the tax position as Peter said a very strong cash flow that can continue to be very efficient for our shareholders.
Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley: Got it. Then is my follow-up speaking to that strong cash flow and the back buy activities been robust in the first half of this year. Can you update us on your thoughts in terms of return of cash in your view on buyback in the context of where the stock is?
Peter Kelly: Well, given our current stock prices it's absolutely the division where we continue to buyback stock.
Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Your question comes from the line of Chris Caso of Susquehanna Financial Group. Please go ahead.
Chris Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group: Thank you. Good morning. The first question is with regard to the bank card business. And in the U.S. that business – U.S. hasn't been a big contributor yet, can you help us to a level set that the size of the opportunity there and how long you think it will take to realize that opportunity? And then maybe the same for China, that is contributing now but is the quarterly run rate that you are experiencing now with the China bank card business a stable run rate going forward or do you expect that to step up over time?
Rick Clemmer: Let's talk about China first, since it's been such a significant contributor of growth over the last year. So I think what we see in China in the – it's kind of a little bit of the best implementation, they have said they will not issue any cards that are not doing interface after the end of 2014 and they will not accept any cards that don't have the protection associated with it after 2015. So they have accelerated the growth or the implementation in China but probably cutting the overall implementation by at least half. In the case of the U.S., there is not a government dictate or an organization it can drive the implementation for the U.S. So it really comes down to the reduction of fraud and the ability to provide better security. And frankly, part of the problem is the entity that paced the incremental cost about implementing EMV in the U.S. is not necessarily the same entity that gets the benefits of the fraud reduction. So the overall ecosystem will be much slower to implement in North America but based on some of the issues that we saw late last year and early this year with fraud we see a definite increase in activity. We are very confident that EMV will be rolled out in North America that it would be rolled out over a number of years. It's not something that will be rolled out or implemented on an equivalent basis to what's actually happening in China today.
Chris Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group: Okay. Thank you. And…
Jeff Palmer: Chris, the other thing I would add to Rick's comment is just in the U.S., we see the size of the U.S. C and B market about 1.50 billion cards and it's probably going to be 5 years, 7 years to full penetration of the U.S. very similar to what it took place in Europe. So kind of have to – like I said it's not going to be just a step function over night. And in China, as we said the opportunity is about 1.5 billion cards, probably 20% penetrated there, but I still think it will take a number of years to get fully penetrated.
Peter Kelly: And even over 5 years, whether it's 5 or 7, it won't be linear nuance, so you won't see like fifth division of first year, you will probably see a lot less than a fifth in the first year, it will be slower and then pick up.
Rick Clemmer: It's really hard for us to project. We provide the technology and the capability and they are going to implement that at their own space about the increased cost that they had to invest on a per card basis for the reduced productivity. So it's hard for us to project, we do see a definite increase in activity. A lot of specifications going out associated with new card implementations, but again, we think that it will transpire over a very extended period of time.
Chris Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group: All right. Thank you. That's helpful. And just move on to the NFC and secured element business and really a question of why that business is defensible. And when investors see growth on [hindsight] (ph) platform there is naturally a fear about the sustainability in that revenue. Can you go into – what about your NFC and secured element business allows you to hold on to the stock once you design those?
Rick Clemmer: Technology, we have to continue as the best technology on the marketplace and continue to win design. As we know couple of years ago, we lost NFC design on a major platform. Fortunately, we are able to win it back in the next platform. So it's about the technology we provide continuing to be in the leadership position and really the benefit that we have in providing the secured element, we are not only a few companies that can provide the secured element, will it be able to provide a total solution basis. And the only semiconductor company that has a software platform with our java card operating system to be able to provide a complete robust solution at a one stop shop.
Chris Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group: Great. Thank you.
Jeff Palmer: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh, Sterne, Agee. Please go ahead.
Vijay Rakesh - Sterne, Agee: Hi, guys. Congratulations. Looks like your strongest September quarter guide in five years. I just want to talk a little bit on the automotive side, in the past you talked about design ramps, just want to see what you are seeing in near and mid-term in terms of design wins ramping either it's A dash or [road link exit] (ph)? Thanks.
Rick Clemmer: Well, on the vehicle-to-vehicle implementation Jeff talked about that earlier that will be the first design win that we won, we will not be into 2017 model year which will be shipping in mid to kind of follow up 2016. So we are excited about the design win but as always the case in automotive, you win the design win a number of years, but we actually see significant revenue certainly that took place when we won the door locking solution from the number two U.S. automotive manufacturer. And we are still ramping the models associated with it several years into the process. So it's not like it's going to create any significant revenue upside certainly not this year nor next year but it's really important for us to establish the foundation in the thought leadership on vehicle-to-vehicle and ensure that by providing a total solution including the security that were uniquely positioned that will really be able to drive that. But, it's not going to be a significant revenue improvement in the next six quarters or so or actually move further than that.
Vijay Rakesh - Sterne, Agee: And just looking at the foundry side, any change in strategy there, are you guys increasing your outsourcing there, any color there? Thanks.
Peter Kelly: No change to our strategy, but we are increasing the number of white good percent to total that we buy externally. So that's just kind of we are managing our growth there.
Rick Clemmer: Yes. But we are rapidly ramping our supply from foundries. We will be at 50% of our total wafer supply in the not too distant future. So going from much lower basis…
Peter Kelly: Few years ago, we were less than 15%. I think we were 30 exit in last year and as Rick said, we look solid and picking up.
Vijay Rakesh - Sterne, Agee: Got it. Thanks.
Jeff Palmer: Great.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie, Raymond James. Please proceed.
Steve Smigie - Raymond James: Great. Thanks a lot. Just turning back to the using software as part of the security elements/NFC, can you talk about how you guys play in that software side of it in terms of how secured is that.? And then what's the business model for you guys there, how do you get paid for being involved there?
Rick Clemmer: That's a very good question. So on the java card operating system is the something that we have had for well over a decade and investment levels. So this is a key part of our solution in the security space. We have customers that will use their own software on top of our semiconductor platform and we have other customers that will use a solution, our semiconductors as well as our software solution. But, really the key for us is by providing the total solution gives us really the ability to add value for our key customers associated with it. And it's significant investment, it's something that if a competitor wants to really come and pursue it, a number of years never before they could have something that would be equivalent to it. So we think that it's a very key in our defensible barrier associated with our security business, our ID business and being able to position our true leadership position we have there and being able to maintain that. So it is a critical element. It's one that we continue to increase our investments in that area based on the customer base and being able to provide those solutions. But it is very important to our security business and being able to continue to be a leader.
Steve Smigie - Raymond James: Okay. And then just on the ID business, can you give us some sense of how much ID in the June quarter was core versus emerging and within core roughly the buckets there.
Jeff Palmer: Steve, its Jeff. Core ID was about 85% of total ID in the June quarter. So it doesn't speak for the lot. We don't provide granularity below that on the different sizes of the kind of sub-business lines. We have said that the banking business continues to be the largest portion of ID overall. We have said that our other transaction business is the second largest overall that's showing level of granularity to really go into.
Steve Smigie - Raymond James: Thank you.
Jeff Palmer: Thanks Steve.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Sujeeva De Silva, Topeka. Please proceed.
Sujeeva De Silva - Topeka: Hi, guys, nice job on the quarter. Just couple of questions on the infrastructure business, the base station area where you have constraints, is that the only area in the business where you are seeing constraints in. When do you expect the constraints to ease, how many quarters? Thanks.
Rick Clemmer: I think you are real careful about talking about of the only area of the business with constraints. I mean clearly as we ramp up our revenue, we are having and Peter talked about the fact, we are having to increase our CapEx investment. So there are other areas where we are limiting back reduction associated with it. The most significant in the near term has been in the area of our HPRF business. And we continue to make investments there trying to improve our customer support. But again, our focus has been on making that a nice profitable growth as opposed to a bombast. And so our additions are somewhat gaited and we have done some of those additions in capacity in conjunction with some of the customer commitments. So as far as when we'll be caught up, I think that kind of – if we believe what our customers tell us we are still a couple of quarters out from being caught up with the overall demand. We are being concerned back earlier in the year whether it was in double or triple ordering taking place in HPRF and that's one of the reasons that we have been relative stop pulling our capacity additions. But, we are encouraged about the growth of that business. We are encouraged about the design wins and frankly we are encouraged about the strengthening and some of the relationship with our customers that actually our problems have been able to facilitate associated with it.
Sujeeva De Silva - Topeka: And I have another question on the P&C business, what's the percent the steep versus direct roughly in, what I'm trying to get at is what's the underlying growth you are seeing in the disti part of it, which is a more broad based business? Thanks.
Rick Clemmer: Well, in our P&C business, I think it's about 65% through the distribution channel, it's a little more concentrated than our overall business in total which is more like 50% through the distribution channel and that really has to do with the portfolio. I mean our microcontroller business is clearly more like 80%, 85% through the channel. And so I don't think there is any real significance associated with that other than some of the key smartphone and tablet design wins we are growing most of our microcontroller business is broad based general industrial applications.
Sujeeva De Silva - Topeka: Okay. Thanks guys.
Rick Clemmer: Thanks.
Jeff Palmer: Thanks Suj.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jim Covello, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: Hi, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Great job on the report. A lot of questions on I&I that have been very good already and you guys gave some really, really helpful color. Just one very specific question there, have you seen any decrease in the lead times of the longest lead times components yet or they still where they have been over the last couple of quarters?
Rick Clemmer: You mean, as far as we provide lead times to our customers or our own the parts that we secure associated with it?
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: I'm sorry, your lead times according to your customers, whatever your longest lead time, if it's a power app, whatever your quote on the longest lead time items to your customers, does that come down at all?
Rick Clemmer: No. It hasn't at all Jim. I mean the truth is, it's not about lead times, it is about allocation of our capacity and working with our customers to be able to meet the requirements. And we still see that for the next couple of quarters with our customer base. We don't see that changing significantly.
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: Very helpful. And then just as a follow-up, the growth in the distribution channel inventory, is it – should we take from your last question that the majority of – an understanding that's the preparation for customer ramps in the third quarter. Is the majority of that growth in MCU and Portable & Computing consistent with the question – the answer to the last question, or are there some other areas that contributed to that?
Rick Clemmer: There were some other areas that contributed to that as well, I mean it's basically with the ramp up of design wins that will take place in Q3, it was kind of being in a position to provide that across the board.
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: Terrific. Thank you so much. Good luck.
Rick Clemmer: Thanks a lot.
Jeff Palmer: Thanks Jim. Operator, I'm not sure do we have any other participants in the queue at this point?
Operator: At this point there are no further questions in the queue.
Jeff Palmer: Great. So I will turn it back to Rick real quickly for his comments.
Rick Clemmer: Thanks Jeff. First of, we thank all of you for your continued interest in NXP. I think it's important to reiterate the key points and the progress that we have had through 2014. Our revenue growth continues to be robust would grow significantly above our peers. Based on the year-to-date revenue and the mid-point of guidance 2014 is shaping up to be a new high watermark in terms of total revenue with several businesses achieving record revenue levels. It's also important that we point out an improved profit profile with Q2 profit dollars up about 21% and operating profit dollars up 31% year-on-year. Our strong cash generation, we are able to increase our cash flow 34% year-on-year while spending just over $1 billion on share repurchases over the last 12 months. So once again, thanks for your support and interest in NXP and we will be talking to you.
Jeff Palmer: Thank you very much for everyone on the call.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Good day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q1 2014 NXP Semiconductors NV Earnings Conference Call. My name is Sheryl, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for training (sic) [replay] purposes. And I'd like to hand over to Mr. Jeff Palmer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.
Jeff Palmer: Thank you, Sheryl, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the NXP Semiconductors First Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. With me on the call today is Rick Clemmer, NXP's President and CEO; as well as Peter Kelly, our CFO. If you've not obtained a copy of our first quarter 2014 earnings press release, it can be found at our company website under the Investor Relations section at nxp.com. Additionally, we have posted on our Investor Relations website a supplemental earnings summary presentation and a document of our historical financials to assist in your modeling efforts. This call is being recorded and will be available for replay from our corporate website. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause NXP's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the macroeconomic impact on the specific end markets in which we operate, the sale of new and existing products and our expectations for financial results for the second quarter of 2014. Please be reminded that NXP undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements. For a full disclosure on forward-looking statements, please refer to our press release. Additionally, during our call today, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the impact of purchase price accounting, restructuring, stock-based compensation, impairment and other charges that are driven primarily by discrete events that management does not consider to be directly related to NXP's underlying core operating performance. Pursuant to Regulation G, NXP has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our first quarter 2014 earnings press release, which will be furnished to the SEC on Form 6-K and is available on NXP's website in the Investor Relations section, also at nxp.com. I'd like to now turn the call over to Rick.
Richard L. Clemmer: Thanks, Jeff, and welcome, everyone, to our earnings call today. Overall, our results for the first quarter were very good, reflecting better revenue performance, strong cash flow generation and slightly higher operating expenses as we continue to invest for future growth. Product revenue was approximately $1.21 billion as -- a 4% decline sequentially, though up nearly 14% versus the prior year period. Nearly all of our business lines delivered revenue performance above our initial expectations, slightly better than typical seasonal performance. Total NXP revenue was approximately $1.25 billion, also a 4% sequential decline, although up nearly 15% from the year-ago period. Turning now to our segment performance. HPMS revenue was $912 million, nearly a 5% sequential decline, but up nearly 18% from the year-ago period. We are very pleased with the strong year-on-year growth. Our results continue to support our view that the HPMS segment can consistently deliver growth in excess of our industry peer group. Now I'd like to review the results for our various HPMS businesses. Within our ID business, revenue was $319 million, down 3% versus the prior quarter, about $5 million better than our expectations, and up 6% on a year-on-year basis. Order trends from the core ID business were better than our expectations, declining about 2% sequentially but up 23% versus the year-ago period. Sequential growth within core ID was driven by demand for infrastructure and the support associated with the enhanced buildout in eGovernment solutions, offset by anticipated sequential declines in the remaining product lines. Overall, core ID continues to represent about 85% of the total ID revenue. Within our emerging ID business, which includes mobile transactions and authentication, revenue was down 15% sequentially and down 43% versus the year-ago period. If you recall, our Q4 results included a strategic IP licensing agreement, making quarter-on-quarter comparison less meaningful. From a product perspective in emerging ID, we did see good sequential growth of mobile transaction solutions as a result of the new major smartphone platform launch. Moving now to our Portable & Computing end market, revenue was $135 million, a 15% sequential decline but up 45% from the year-ago period. This was near the upper end of our expectations, primarily due to broad-based demand for interface products. Further, our results in the quarter reflected the normal seasonal influences of the key smartphone and tablet markets where we participate. Within our Infrastructure & Industrial business, revenue was $182 million, down about 8% sequentially, while revenue was up about 19% versus the year-ago period. During the quarter, revenue was modestly below our original expectations, primarily as we continue to manage HPRF product demand issues for base station customers. The revenue trends during the quarter for the remainder of the Infrastructure & Industrial product lines were essentially in line with our expectations. Within our Automotive business, revenue was $276 million, another strong quarter. Revenue was essentially flat quarter-on-quarter, generally in line with our expectations, and up 20% versus the first quarter of 2013. From a product perspective, we experienced strong sequential demand for both in-vehicle networking and sensor products during the quarter. Demand for the keyless entry products were essentially flat, and sales of infotainment products declined modestly in the quarter, but both were in line with the expectations. Finally, turning to our Standard Products segment. Revenue was $295 million, essentially flat on a sequential basis but better than our normal seasonal trend. Performance was better than planned and up about 6% versus the year-ago period. We experienced better mix in the business, primarily driven by the discrete portion of the business, as we continue to focus on winning longer-term stickier opportunities. The key message on our Standard Products segment continues to be the improved profitability profile. Turning now to our distribution channel performance. Total sales in the distribution were down about 7%, with sales out of distribution down 2%. The total months of inventory in the distribution channel were 2.5 months. Absolute dollars of inventory in the channel increased about 3% on a sequential basis. In summary, our overall results in Q1 were very good, with better overall product revenue, better gross margin and strong cash flow. With Q1 being normally our seasonally weakest quarter in a year, we feel especially positive about the remainder of this year. We believe we can continue to monetize our company-specific opportunities, which should result in better-than-industry growth, continued improvement in profitability and robust cash flow generation. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Peter to discuss the financial details of the quarter.
Peter Kelly: Thank you, Rick. Good morning to everyone on today's call. As Rick has already covered the dramas of revenue, I'll move directly to the highlights of the quarter. Overall, Q1 was a very good quarter and better than our expectations. Total revenue, non-GAAP gross profit, operating profit and net income were all better than the midpoint of our guidance, resulting in non-GAAP EPS of $0.98. Focusing on the details of Q1. Revenue was $1.25 billion, $16 million above the midpoint of our guidance. We generated $617 million in non-GAAP gross profit or 49.5% non-GAAP gross margin, about $19 million above the midpoint of our guidance, essentially driven by 3 things: about 1/3 was the result of better revenue; about 1/3 was due to better product mix; and about 1/3 was due to the onetime positive benefit relating to a product-related insurance claim of $5 million from our past period. Note, the insurance benefits is reflected in our Corporate and Other segment. Now let me turn to the operating segments. Within the HPMS segment, revenue was $912 million, down about 5% versus the previous quarter but about $6 million above guidance. HPMS non-GAAP gross margin was 56%, 50 basis points below the fourth quarter. And non-GAAP operating margin was 27.3% of revenue. Within our Standard Products segment, revenue was $295 million, essentially flat sequentially but about $6 million above guidance. Segment non-GAAP gross margin of 33.2%, 190 basis point improvement versus the fourth quarter. And non-GAAP operating margin was 18%, a 170 basis point improvement, as the business continues to normalize into our expected operating range. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $317 million, up $4 million on a sequential basis and above the midpoint of our guidance range, as we continue to pull forward investments in a major R&D program to support future growth and, to a lesser degree, incentive compensation. From a total operating profit perspective, non-GAAP operating profit was $301 million and represents a 24.2% operating margin, down about 90 basis points versus the prior quarter. Interest expense was $34 million. And during the quarter, we repriced our term loan due in 2017, which lowered our overall blended interest cost to 3.9%, a 40 basis point improvement from the prior quarter. Noncontrolling interest was $14 million, $4 million better than guidance. And cash taxes were $4 million, also $4 million better than guidance. This resulted in total NXP non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.98, $0.08 better than the midpoint of our guidance and flat on a sequential basis. Relative to our earnings per share guidance, about 3% -- about $0.03 of the upside was due to higher revenue and better mix, partially offset by increased OpEx; $0.02 was due to the previously mentioned insurance claim; and the remainder was due to lower tax and noncontrolling interests. Stock-based compensation, which is not included in our non-GAAP earnings, was $28 million. Now I'd like to turn to the changes in our cash and debt. Our total debt at the end of Q1 was $3.58 billion, an increase of $262 million, as we took short-term usage of our revolving credit facility to fund stock buybacks. Cash at the end of Q1 was $720 million, a sequential increase of $50 million. We exited the quarter with a trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.41 billion, and our ratio of net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of Q1 was 2.02x. We bought back 8.3 million shares at the cost of approximately $458 million or a weighted cost of about $54.91 per share. Turning to our working capital metrics. I would like to point out that both our DSO and DPO increased by approximately 6 days and offset each other due to the difference between our regular monthly calendar and our reporting calendar, where March 31 is the first day of our second quarter. Days of inventory were 102 days, an increase of 6 days sequentially. And excluding prebuilds associated with the restructuring of our fabs[ph] in Europe, our effective days in inventory was 91 days. Days receivable were 41 days, while days payable were 71 -- 77, sorry. Taken together, our cash conversion cycle was 66 days versus the 61 days reported in the prior quarter. Cash flow from operations was $273 million, and net CapEx was $50 million, resulting in positive free cash flow of $223 million or 18% free cash flow margin. Now I'd like to provide our outlook for Q2. We continue to see very positive trends across our business and still expect to see the 2014 demand environment develop stronger than 2013. With this as a background, we currently anticipate product revenue will be in the range of up 4% to up 9% sequentially. At the midpoint, we expect product revenue to be up in Q2 about 7%, reflecting the following trends in the business, all on a sequential percentage basis. Within our HPMS segment, we expect Automotive to be up about mid-single digits, Identification is expected to be up in the upper single-digit range, Portable & Computing is expected to be flat, Infrastructure & Industrial is expected to be up in the mid-teens range, Standard Products is expected to be up in the lower single-digit range. We anticipate revenue from the combination of manufacturing and Corporate Other -- Corporate and Other to be approximately $40 million. Taken together, total NXP revenue should be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.35 billion, or $1.326 billion at the midpoint. We expect non-GAAP gross profit to be in the range of about 47.8% to 48.6%, or about 48.2% at the midpoint. Operating expenses are expected to be in the range of $310 million to $319 million, or about $315 million at the midpoint. This translates into a non-GAAP operating profit in the range of $312 million to $337 million, or about 24.4% operating margin at the midpoint. Interest expense on our debt should be approximately $35 million. Cash taxes are expected be roughly $8 million, and noncontrolling interest expense should be about $17 million. Stock-based compensation should be about $35 million, which is excluded from our guidance. Diluted share count should be about 252 million shares, depending on share price fluctuations. Taken together, this translates into non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $1 to $1.10, or $1.05 per share at the midpoint of our guidance. I'd like to now turn it back to the operator for your questions.
Jeff Palmer: Operator, would you call [ph] for Q&A, please?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse.
John William Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Just real quick, last quarter, guys, relative to the full year for ID, you guys gave some pretty healthy growth rates. And given that you're giving decent sequential growth rate guidance for the June quarter, year-over-year is still suffering from difficult comparison from last year. And so I'm kind of curious, are you still confident in kind of the ID growth rate for the full year? And help us understand the back half drivers of that full year growth would be helpful.
Richard L. Clemmer: So, John, remember, when we talked about that, we said high teens over the intermediate term, not for the year basis itself, just to be clear associated with it. But you shouldn't take any backing off of our expectations in growth from that comment either. I just want to be clear associated with it. Clearly, in ID business, we have talked about that we expect, with some of the design wins that we've seen, a strong ramp-up of mobile payments in the second half of the year. And that's -- it gives us the confidence in the growth rate that we have. So the combined design wins that we have and the business that we see, we think, will be the significant contributing factor. If we go beyond this year, then, clearly, the continued ramp-up of -- well, in -- even in the second half this year, the ramp-up of banking in developing countries. But if we look out beyond this year, then, clearly, the ramp-up of EMV in the U.S. is a factor relative to growth in ID as well. But there's a combination of a number of different factors in ID, so it's not any single factor. The Infrastructure side, to be able to support the combination of EMV, as well as mobile payments, we expect to see a nice uptick associated with that as well. So our ID business has a multitude of different areas where we expect to see continued strong growth. In the mid to high teens over a multi--- in near-term basis -- intermediate term basis, sorry.
John William Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Helpful, Rick. And Peter, on the gross margin guidance for the June quarter, at the midpoint, you're guiding gross margin down sequentially on up revenue. Can you just help me understand a little bit better what's happening with mix Q-on-Q that's driving that dynamic?
Peter Kelly: Yes. To be honest, it is -- once you exclude that $5 million insurance payment and the increased revenue, it is mix. And we agonize because we know no one likes to hear that the answer is -- it's mix. And it's not in any one area, John, so I can't say it's a result of a massive increase in one product line. Probably, the best thing I can say is it's probably a higher mix of kind of volume products in Q2 across pretty much all of our businesses. I think the good thing is that even though gross margin looks a little weaker, you can see that the EBIT continues to improve.
John William Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Perfect. And then my last question, guys, just on the buyback, big step-up in the March quarter from what had been sort of a $160 million per quarter to what was north of $450 million in the March quarter. And, Peter, in your prepared comments, you talked about kind of funding that through some financing activities. I'm just kind of curious from here, how do I think about the buyback level? Broadly speaking, what kind of targets should we think about over a 4-quarter period?
Peter Kelly: Obviously, a lot depends on what the stock price is, John. But I'll -- I think as I've said on previous calls, I'll continue to use our available cash to buy back stock. That just seems to be the best use of our cash right now versus anything else we can see.
Richard L. Clemmer: Yes, if you look at -- over the 4-quarter period of time, most of the projections, we'll have about $1 billion. And as Peter has talked about, our top priority will be to continue to repurchase shares, John.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Talking about the OpEx side, it was a little high in the quarter, and then you're guiding it up again in the guide. I know you talked about front-end loading some major R&D projects. Is there any more color you can give on that? Is that something that is imminent timing-wise, where the revenue from those investments is going to come through? Or is it even something that you're front-end loading it now, and then therefore, some additional leverage or lack of R&D would be necessary in, say, the second half of this year or even 2015?
Richard L. Clemmer: So what we tried to say, John -- Ross, was that we were pulling it forward. So because of the agreement that we talked about in Q4, obviously, we have a requirement to increase our investment levels. And we're pulling that forward to be sure that we meet the customer requirements associated with it. So it would support the growth that we anticipate in the next few quarters coming out in revenue, but we have to make those investments now to be able to support that product development to drive that growth, Ross.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Great. And I guess as my follow-up on the ID side of things, you said it was a little bit lighter in the quarter, nothing too worrisome, and you're guiding it up going forward -- in the I&I side of things, excuse me. If you have that base station business, can you give us an update? I think back in Mobile World Congress, you were one of the few companies saying things look like they could be a little overheated. And even on today's call, you mentioned that you were doing some either demand or inventory management. Can you give us an update on double ordering, demand versus reality? Any sort of color on that front will be helpful, and then I'll go away.
Richard L. Clemmer: So, Ross, I think the only thing we can really say -- I mean, we can't say whether our customers are double or triple ordering. There's no real way to know that. We would say that the significant broad increases that we've seen across the board from all of our major customers are difficult for us to support because of the significant spike of the increase in demand, with the requirement to put additional capacity in place, taking a much longer period of time to be able to bring that out. So we clearly see a very strong demand across the board from all major customers. Part of that is from the design wins that we've been talking about over the last couple of years that we've won on the LTE. But part of that is just from the broad overall demand increase. And we are struggling to be able to meet our customer requirements associated with it. But it's not -- there's no way for us to know for sure whether there's double or triple ordering taking place. All we can do is interface with our customers and try to meet as much of their requirement as we can, although the significant ramp-up of the demand is extremely difficult for us to completely meet their requirements.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: So I guess, when you said it was a little bit disappointing versus your original guide, it really wasn't a demand issue anymore so than it was... it's for matching your supply to whatever demand was there?
Richard L. Clemmer: Absolutely. No problem with demand at this point in time. We expect [ph] a little less demand right now, Ross.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis from Barclays.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division: On ID, when you look at the guidance, is that a factor of mobile or -- you had mentioned that you're seeing some infrastructure pickup. Are you seeing any better indications of core ID picking up in China? You had talked about the spring timeframe. Just wondering what your thoughts are at this point.
Richard L. Clemmer: Well, yes. We talked about -- the core ID business had very strong growth in Q1. And clearly, we see an improvement in the demand associated with the banking in China. So I think what we talked about, we are seeing, but I think what we'll -- what we expect is to have that kind of higher -- mid- to high-teen growth coming on more strongly in the second half of the year than in second quarter itself.
Peter Kelly: But we definitely saw a pickup in -- or we are seeing a pickup in Q2 in banking for China.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Got you. And then, Peter, you talked about, really, mix being the driver into June. Is that something that you potentially reverses in the back half or is this -- are some of these factors a factor of businesses that you'll see continuing to grow?
Peter Kelly: I mean, it's hard to say, really. I think we have this massive focus on our EBIT. And it's surprising our relatively small numbers can change the percentage on the gross margin percent. I think our focus really will be continuing to manage our mix in line with our volume growth and, at the same time, seeing what we can do from a cost down perspective to improve it further. But I guess we'll get to that at the end of Q2, when we guide for Q3, but we're very confident on our roadmap to get into a world-class EBIT percent.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Got you. And then just finally, on Auto, there's a lot of concern about inventories. Clearly, you're guiding that out nicely. If you can just talk about what you're seeing in terms of inventory levels and what are the drivers for you into June.
Richard L. Clemmer: Well, we'll see -- in June, we'll see -- we talked about the car infotainment, which is about half of Automotive, being a little weaker in Q1, as we had expected. And we will see that come back clearly in the Q2 timeframe. So I think that's probably the key area. We don't see any slowdown of demand from our customers. So even though there were some discussions -- I guess I haven't seen any recent discussions on inventory, although, clearly, back, I guess, 6 weeks ago, there were some concerns about North America Automotive inventory, but we did not see any reduction in the pull rates from our customers through that period of time and don't expect to see any through the Q2 timeframe, Blayne.
Jeff Palmer: At the same time, Blayne, we start seeing very good uptick in registrations in Europe. So trends in the European auto market have actually been generally positive.
Operator: The next question comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America.
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I have a question on your Portable & Computing business. You've done extremely well with one large customer on the interface and the sensor hub products. I'm wondering how the success in selling more products to that customer or in broadening out on those kind of products to other customers. I'm just trying to get a sense of what the long-term growth opportunity is and the level of customer concentration in that division right now.
Richard L. Clemmer: So I think the only -- I mean, it's consistent with what we've said, we're trying to broaden that out to other customers, including the broad-based growth that's taking place in smartphones in China. So there's a lot of activity going on. We have some favorable feedback. In fact, in the mobile audio, we have a broad base of design wins on the high end of smartphones in China. So I think the only thing we can really say is we're continuing to work that. We continue to be optimistic about driving that into other key customers, but it won't be a significant contributor in 2014 revenue. The 2014 revenue, P&C being up year-over-year 45% kind of talks about the success we've had in that business. And we'll follow up more of the seasonal patterns associated with it, and we'd anticipate kind of a strong growth in the Q3 timeframe after Q2 being somewhat flat.
Jeff Palmer: I don't think we see any change in our success with our major customers for P&C products at this point.
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Got it. And then, Rick, on the mobile payment side, there has been a move towards this use of this host-card emulation or virtualizing the secure element. Do you think that poses any threat to your emerging ID or the NFC business in any way?
Richard L. Clemmer: We don't believe so. I mean, time will tell. Our belief is, is that the host-card emulation, actually, could accelerate the mobile wallet rollout, but it doesn't provide the inherent bulletproof security that a true secure element does. And so all it takes is, a situation like Target had, for there to be a massive move from a host-card emulation to a secure element implementations to be sure that the inherent security is there. So we still believe in the fundamental security. It's offered by the secure element approach. But we think the host-card emulation can actually accelerate the mobile wallet. I mean, there's more and more discussion about the success of the mobile wallet with -- now I saw a recent report, where I think it was 1.1 billion handsets in 2017 or '18 recently. So the expectations on the mobile wallet still continue to be strong, and we see the host-card emulation is being kind of a beater or a seeding process for that overall effort.
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Got it. And maybe one last one on the financials. With the base of the -- of your growth, I think the HPMS segment will soon be at or above your long-term targets of the 24% to 29% operating margin. Is that 29%, Peter, is that some kind of structural limit or are there any drivers that can take HPMS to something above those long-term targets that you've set?
Peter Kelly: I guess, Vivek, I'd see a spin-off rate is more like about 27%. And it's -- with the kind of growth rate that we have in -- we're kind of comfortable with that, actually. One thing we don't want to do is choke off the growth in the business by obsessing over an unreasonably high EBIT number.
Richard L. Clemmer: I think we've been very specific that if it came down to squeezing out an extra 50 or 75 basis points of operating income are driving more inherent growth, we would invest to be able to drive the growth. We feel like that there's more value creation by continuing to grow well above the industry average growth rates than trying to squeeze out an extra 50 or 75 basis points in operating income.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley.
Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Within the ID business, can you talk about any changes in the competitive environment within China that you may or may not be seeing? And then also within North America, the EMV rollout, which looks to be later this year, 2015, can you just talk about kind of visibility and how you see that shaping up?
Richard L. Clemmer: Well, let me address the U.S. first. I think we see a lot of discussion, a lot of activity on EMV rollout in the U.S., but we don't think it will be a significant factor in 2014 revenue. There could be some shipments later in the year, but we expect that really to be a factor in 2015 and beyond. Relative to China, I think the position that we have, we continue to be in a strong leadership position in the dual-interface banking, contactless banking, and we'll just keep [ph] changing on that at the current timeframe, although, clearly, as we have competitive challenges as we go forward because of the leadership position we have, there's going to be more people that are going to be trying to take a piece of that. But so far so good relative to maintaining our leadership position.
Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And as my follow-up, nice to see the continued rebound in Standard Product gross margin. Can you talk about, as we go through 2014, maybe the influence of the cycle, any puts and takes in manufacturing and how you see that business performing through the year?
Peter Kelly: We think it's definitely benefiting from the fact that the kind of general semi markets seems to be stronger than it was in 2013. We think we'd like to see it running at about the 18%, 19% EBIT level. And clearly, we're in a position now where we'll -- to be able to continue to do that.
Richard L. Clemmer: The Standard Products is focused on profitability, not revenue growth. So what we're trying to do is ensure that we deliver on the kind of margins that we believe that business can [indiscernible].
Jeff Palmer: If I could also add to that, I think the team in Standard Products has done a very good job of trying to refocus their design win approach towards stickier opportunities in a way for maybe more [indiscernible] tight markets than they've been exposed to in the past.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh from Sterne Agee.
Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Just speaking on the Automotive side, can you go over the big opportunities you see in second half '14 or into 2015 and what are the key ramps you're seeing there now?
Peter Kelly: Key ramps in Automotive?
Richard L. Clemmer: I think they really continue to be the design wins we've seen -- we've talked about in the past on the entertainment side. We've talked about that there's 28 major platforms globally on entertainment, of which we've then designed into 27. Of the 27, not are all in production, so we'll continue to monetize those over time. We're not providing any guidance for the second half, but so -- what we've said is, over a longer term, we think Automotive can grow mid to upper single digits over a multi-year period, entertainment being one of them. Keyless entry will continue to be a good driver. And then further out over probably more than 4- or 5-year horizon is car-to-car communication.
Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Got it. And then just on the free cash flow side, obviously, solid free cash flow there. But if you had to allocate between the usual share buybacks and debt reduction and M&A, how would you allocate that over the next 12 to 24 months?
Peter Kelly: Share buybacks.
Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Debt reductions, no?
Peter Kelly: No, no. I think our debt's in great shape. I mean, we're in 2x trailing 12-months EBITDA, and so -- and I'm very happy with our level of gross debt.
Richard L. Clemmer: Yes, our interest cost is now down to 3.9% on an ongoing basis, so we like our debt structure where it is today.
Operator: Our next question comes of the line of James Covello from Goldman Sachs.
Gabriela Borges - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: This is Gabriela Borges on behalf of James. I was hoping you could give us an update on where utilization levels are today and how comfortable are you with your mix between internal and external manufacturing capacity?
Peter Kelly: So utilization levels were 93%. Our IC business is running pretty -- well, it's actually close to 100. We're very happy with our mix of internal and external. We're gradually increasing our utilization of external foundries, particularly as we transition to 12-inch type wafers. So utilization is good. We see no issues. And our relationships with the external foundries is exactly where we want it, actually. So...
Richard L. Clemmer: But clearly, if you look at our revenue growth over the next couple years, the bulk of that will come from wafers that are outsourced from our foundry partners that will be the contributor relative to our revenue growth. And so we'll continue to see our outsourced percentage grow as we move forward.
Peter Kelly: And we have no intention of investing in a 12-inch fab or expanding our front end capacity internal.
Gabriela Borges - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, if I may, on in and out of things in the industrial and consumer markets. Are you seeing any real demand today for these types of solutions? And are there synergies here with your portfolio of security products that perhaps give you a competitive advantage versus some of the other my [ph] control and analog companies that are also targeting growth in this space?
Richard L. Clemmer: Well, we think -- we've been talking about this more broadly for the recent period. I mean, we believe that secure connections for the smarter world, we're uniquely positioned to be able to drive the security in the connections which we think is -- as we move beyond smartphones, I mean, clearly, smartphones have the security requirement and increasing security requirement. As we move beyond smartphones to the Internet of Things, security will be a key element associated with it, and we think that we're uniquely positioned as a company to be able to provide that fundamental capability. So we do perceive that there's significant opportunities for our security capability to fundamentally drive growth on a broader base of Internet of Things and other secured connections for the smarter world.
Operator: The next question comes from Chris Caso from Susquehanna Financial Group.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: I wonder if you could speak a bit about the inventory levels in the channel. I think your comments indicated the channel inventory is up 3 -- about 3% sequentially. Are you seeing any evidence of a general restocking, distributors and customers, as business conditions appear to be strengthening. And as a follow-on to that, could you talk a little bit about your lead times, with your utilization levels rising as having any affect, stretching out your lead times?
Richard L. Clemmer: Yes, so just the inventory is still at 2.5 months, a very reasonable level, we don't see any restocking taking place by our distributors. I think they're waiting to see their orders. Clearly, they're focused on churns and earns. It drives them to be able to keep their inventory levels at the absolute minimum that they can. And so -- but I guess the key is, while we see an improved, generally, environment, we don't see a significant ramp-up or step-up that's driving just the inventory levels. But we believe that they continue to be at a very reasonable level of 2.5 months. And I forgot your second question.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: It was lead times.
Richard L. Clemmer: Oh, lead times. I think lead times, in general, remain about the same. Clearly, there are areas where we have some capacity limitations, like for example, in HPRF or base stations that we talked about, where lead times are completely irrelevant now. It's about capacity allocations. So I think in general, lead times remain fairly consistent, but we do have a few select areas where there is a significant increase in lead times.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. As a follow-up, with respect to your IP business, and obviously, you had some impact to that on the December quarter. But I know that's been an area you guys have been focused on as a business going forward. Should we have any expectations for some similar licensing or other benefits as we go through the remainder of the year?
Peter Kelly: Yes, what we've talked about is we'd like to see about 100 basis points of EBIT from our IP business. I think in Q4, it was about 130. It was rather large. Q1, it was about 70. So yes, we continue to expect to see benefit from our IP portfolio.
Richard L. Clemmer: And as we've said, it will be fairly lumpy as we go through it on a quarter-by-quarter basis, but expect on an annual basis around 100 basis points of impact associated with intellectual property, and we still feel good about that.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: And that generally will be more in the line of onetime licenses as opposed to ongoing volume-based licenses?
Richard L. Clemmer: I don't think you should draw that conclusion. I think our overall intellectual property income, we think, will generate about 100 basis points of operating income or EBIT margin, and it will be in all different forms associated with it.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of William Stein, SunTrust.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: I'm hoping you can talk about growth in tagging applications in ID, so getting away from the areas that people tend to focus on, like banking and the emerging side of NFC. Any comment on the tagging side?
Peter Kelly: Actually, tagging is a little bit stronger for us. It's an interesting part of the business. I think we've said in the past, we thought it was -- particularly from a gain perspective, we thought it was a super niche and not something that would generate significant revenues for us. And as it's turned out, it's been quite a nice niche. It's not hundreds of millions of dollars, but it's pretty positive. We begin to see -- continue to see nice trends, and it's quite a profitable line for us.
Richard L. Clemmer: Yes, I think the -- clearly, we've seen it move into a broader base of application, then just tagging for inventory purposes or books and all the things that people have talked about in the past. But it -- as we look at some of the consumer applications, we have won now a second major consumer design win. And originally, in the -- gained Skyline there. We talked -- we've had shipped about 10 million units or something, and we've shipped well over 100 million units. So I mean, it is a contributing factor but not a major factor in moving the needle for the total company. It's a nice business, it contributes, but not something that's going to move the needle for the total company at all.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Great. And as a follow-up, I want to turn one of the earlier questions on its head a little bit regarding capital allocations. Someone asked about debt, buyback. When I look at my model, and I look towards the end of 2015, if my gross margin assumption estimates are right. I show net leverage metrics of in the low 1s, like 1.3. And I have to ask myself, is that the right leverage level for this kind of company? And could you potentially raise that to do more buybacks in, let's say, 1.5 years kind of timeframe if you don't find another use of cash, like M&A?
Peter Kelly: I'd agree with you. I think 1x is probably too low a level of net debt to trailing 12-months EBITDA. But we'll -- as we go through 2015, we'll see what we want to do there. Certainly, taking on more debt to buy back stock or -- that's -- we don't have anything that we want to report, but maybe at some point, we would want to do some M&A. So yes, I'd agree with you completely, I think 1x would be far too low a level for us.
Richard L. Clemmer: I think the way to summarize it is, is we feel very comfortable with our current debt structure today. Net interest cost that's 3.9% is -- and 75% of it fixed rates, we think, and 75% of it unsecured is a good position to be in. As far as out 1.5 years or so, I think we'll have to see where we are at that point in time.
Peter Kelly: We're right with you. We agree with you, okay?
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie from Raymond James.
Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Just quickly on the bank card market, as you're getting your incremental design wins or having discussions in China and then in the U.S., are you finding what's happening is your 3 major customers are gaining share in those markets? Or are you more having discussions, where you're getting wins with new customers that are existing card makers in these markets already?
Richard L. Clemmer: I don't know exactly how to respond to that. I think that the leadership position that we have in the developing countries on contactless banking, we continue to see a very solid position. We think that, that could be -- as the overall volume continues to grow, we could see that market share that we have go down 10 or 20 points or so over some period of time because it's hard to maintain the high levels of market share we have. But we think that as the EMV market in the U.S. grows, we see no reason we shouldn't have the same kind of market share that we do in contactless banking on a worldwide basis. And we think we're positioned to do that. If we're -- whether that comes from -- which customer it comes from, I think, is something that we probably should let them talk about as opposed to trying to do the projections associated with that.
Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Okay, great. And then on the Portable & Computing business, I think you talked about it being flat sequentially. You guys have -- generally, you've had some nice design wins there. Overall, should we think about the seasonality for that business, really? We would see maybe the third quarter would be maybe your strongest seasonal quarter, is that the right way to think about that?
Richard L. Clemmer: Yes.
Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And if I could sneak one more in just -- in terms of the in-vehicle networking, where you expect to see the strengths, say, over the next year or 2, is it -- would that be more still on LAN and CAN, FlexRay stuff? Or do you think it could be more growths or maybe Ethernet-type applications?
Richard L. Clemmer: We think -- we're trying to be sure that we have a strong position on the Ethernet side, but we don't think that will be a significant factor on growth for the next year or 2. We think it'll continue to be FlexRay and CAN, CAN/LIN, but with some integrated CAN/LIN as well. So there is some integration that's taking place that drives some of that, but we would not expect Ethernet to be as strong a growth factor in the near term. We think that's a little further out in time. And clearly, our position in vehicle-to-vehicle communications outside of the vehicle itself is really where we want to be sure that we can demonstrate the fundamental leadership technology that we have and continue to drive the market place for the safety opportunity that comes from vehicle-to-vehicle communications. And you're beginning to see much more broader acceptance of that. In the U.S., the Department of Transportation now has come out endorsing vehicle-to-vehicle, have not said they will enforce it but at least endorsing it. And we think the opportunity there is very significant, although it'll be out in time several years as opposed to something that would be in the next few quarters. And we want to be sure that we continue to be in a strong leadership position there on vehicle-to-vehicle.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from ISI Group.
Christopher J. Muse - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: I guess, first question, in terms of your outlook for a faster ramp in ID in the back half, as well as seasonally strong mobility in Q3, curious what your early read is on Q3 sequential growth relative to typical seasonality, if there is such a thing?
Peter Kelly: No, we don't actually guide Q3, Q4. What Rick was talking about before is, on a number of occasions, we've talked about the kind of medium -- the medium-term growth expectations, i.e., over the next 3 years, on a compound annual basis. But really not appropriate for us to try and guide Q3 or Q4 at this stage.
Christopher J. Muse - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: It was worth asking. I guess, second question, in terms of share buyback, curious how we should think about how we model buyback versus dilution from share grants to employees.
Peter Kelly: I think there's a couple of things there. Obviously, forecasting this stuff is actually quite difficult and -- nigh impossible for you guys, which is why we give a number for the next quarter. What -- one thing I would say, which is a number that it's probably difficult for you to get to is a $5 change in share price actually increases or decreases dilution by about 1 million shares. And then, of course, the big move in any particular quarter, you only get the kind of weighted average in -- so the most you could get -- the highest impact you can get from a buyback in any quarter is probably 2/3 of it, if we did it right after the earnings call. In terms of our overhang, our common stock is about 252 million shares at the moment. We have about 22 million equity brands [ph] outstanding. But I have about 10 million shares in Treasury, so a simple overhang is only about a 4.5% at the moment. But to be honest, it is difficult for you to forecast it, which is why we give you the Q2 number. And it's difficult for me to give you a Q3 and Q4 number because I don't know what we're going to do from a buyback perspective.
Richard L. Clemmer: Nor what the stock price.
Peter Kelly: Nor what the stock price is going to be [ph]. And our [indiscernible] dilution is about less than -- it's less than 2%, and that's helpful as well.
Christopher J. Muse - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: That's helpful. And last question for me. Considering the pull-in of some OpEx related to IP project, curious how we should think about sort of any onetime lumpiness up or down in OpEx going into the second half.
Richard L. Clemmer: No. I think it's -- clearly, we're -- we pulled it in to be able to meet the technology requirements of our customers so that we can support the ramp-up on a product capability. And I don't think it's going to be lumpy, it's just we've pulled in that increased investment that we planned and associated with it.
Peter Kelly: And not from an OpEx perspective but from a cash perspective, I just thought I should probably have mentioned, in Q2, we have our 2013 bonus payments. So from a cash perspective, there'll be about -- I want to say about $55 million, $60 million in Q2. That's a big lump of cash-out that relates to the 2013 bonus achievement. But that's obviously not an OpEx issue.
Operator: The next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava from BMO.
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets Canada: Peter, I just had a question on the EBIT target, and I just want to make sure I get it right. On the one hand, you said on the HPMS side, that you're comfortable with where it is. But then earlier on, like you said, that -- I think, Rick, you said that you have a maniacal focus to get to 26%. So where is that trade off? Should we think about Standard Product? Is that what's going to get you there? What's -- am I thinking it right?
Peter Kelly: Let me have a go with that. I think Standard Products should run about -- if it runs 19%, we should be able to get to 26%. So the HPMS does have to improve a bit, but the idea of HPMS going up to 30% or something from the 27% it is today, it's not going to do that. I mean, if you do the math, you can work it out. It doesn't require a big improvement in HPMS to consistently get to 26%. The thing we're really focused on is -- and you may see some lumpy things on a quarterly basis. But on an annual basis, we'd really like to run significantly ahead of the industry on revenue growth with a 26% EBIT level. And then given that we don't really pay much in the way of tax, a lot of that falls through to earnings and cash and is generally a very virtuous cycle. So that's really the message we're trying to get out.
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets Canada: Okay, that's helpful. And then a quick clarification, and I apologize if you did address it in the beginning. What's guiding the growth in the I&I for the second quarter?
Richard L. Clemmer: We talked about HPRF per base stations and the strong demand that we have and being able to meet the -- trying to be able to meet, not meeting, our customer requirements associated with it. It's being a significant factor. But...
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets Canada: And that's largely in China?
Richard L. Clemmer: I wish -- our customers are telling us that it's much more broad based. And then we also have our emerging business, where we have some new development that will drive some growth associated with the success we've had on the audio design wins quite broadly in China in -- with the smartphones. And some growth in POS [ph], where we have smart lighting, where we're being successful with the deployment associated with smart lighting and LED drivers.
Jeff Palmer: So really, Ambrish, it's really across the whole portfolio in the Infrastructure & Industrial group but driven by the base station end market.
Operator: The next question comes from Liwen Zhang from Blaylock Robert Van.
Liwen Zhang - Blaylock Robert Van, LLC, Research Division: Would you please give us update on the works protest in Netherlands and the impact on the gross margin?
Peter Kelly: Yes, no, it was resolved several weeks ago, and it was resolved very amicably. Had no impact on outputs and no impact on gross margin. We have a very, very good relationship with our employees and our works council in the Netherlands and, I guess, in all of our locations, actually.
Richard L. Clemmer: So if I could just add, I think during the process of the negotiations, there were a couple of basically one-hour demonstrations over lunch on the site, which was not significantly disruptive to gross margin or the production.
Peter Kelly: They're not disruptive at all.
Liwen Zhang - Blaylock Robert Van, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then my next one, actually. Also the last one. And how about the impact from the facility damage at Japanese supplier for Furukawa Electronics?
Peter Kelly: Yes, we have a very robust program to help us in the event of natural disasters. And unfortunately, we've been able to use that several times in the last few years: initially, with the Japanese tsunami; and then with the Thai floods. It's proved to be -- the damage in Japan has proved to be a challenge. It's required us to do a number of things. But to date, it's had no impact on our revenue, and we don't expect it to as we go forward.
Operator: And the final question comes from Suji De Silva from Topeka.
Sujeeva De Silva - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: In terms of the Standard Products, can you talk about -- I know you've been through an up cycle now, but any structural changes that are happening under the covers in the portfolio or efficiencies that we can we have a better trough peak range in the next cycle?
Richard L. Clemmer: Well, I think the key is more focused on the customer and product selection associated with Standard Products. So the team has done a really good job of being -- of changing their customer mix away from the Computing side and more towards the Infrastructure and Automotive side, which proves to be much more sticky on design wins and a little bit different characteristics on pricing. So we're hopeful that it will give us more stability in overall margins of that business, although we'll have to prove it. But the bottom line is, is that we're much more focused on margins than revenue. And the guys have delivered on changing mix and performed fairly well associated with that. We're pleased with the progress they've made in the most recent quarter and see no reason we can't continue that for the next quarters.
Sujeeva De Silva - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Great. Sounds constructive. My last question is on the acquisition environment you're seeing now, is it target rich? Do you think the valuations are stretched? Are there any product holes or new areas that would be focuses. And lastly, currency there, would you think about using your stock or would it be cash?
Peter Kelly: It's always hard to talk about acquisitions. I guess, the smart answer from me would be they're all outrageously expensive. Unless they bring [ph] the 5%, it's never going to happen, except for us. I -- no, I just think it's an impossible question to answer, actually.
Richard L. Clemmer: I think harder than you think [ph]. The only thing that we could say is, is that as we've been talking about for the last few quarters, where -- historically, we would not have been active in the M&A market because of our maniacal focus on reducing our debt. Our capital structure now allows us to be in consideration associated with that, but we don't have anything at all to talk about at this point in time.
Sujeeva De Silva - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Rick, would you kind of play in a new area of growth or fill in product holes, just generically?
Richard L. Clemmer: I think that's a level of detail that we shouldn't even think about. I think the key is, is that our capital structure is supportive of at least considering it at this point in time. We think that, organically, we can continue to outgrow the industry, but if it positions us better, then obviously, we would consider some things. Thanks a lot. So we thank all of you for your continued interest in NXP. The key points that we'd like to highlight in the progress through 2014 are the continued revenue growth at a robust level that we believe is better than our peers, with an overall revenue in Q1 that was actually up 14% on a year-over-year basis. We think the improving and stable profitability, with Q1 gross profit dollars up 15% and operating profit dollars up 18% on a year-on-year basis. And clearly, our focus on cash generation has resulted in strong cash generation, with 19% free cash flow and 179% year-on-year increase and basically returning $828 million in share repurchases over the last 12 months. So thanks a lot for your support, and look forward to talking to you. Thanks.
Jeff Palmer: Thank you, everyone.
Operator: Thank you for joining today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter NXP Semiconductors Earnings Conference Call. My name is Patrick, and I'm your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Jeff Palmer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Jeff Palmer: Thank you, Patrick, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the NXP Semiconductors Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. With me on the call today is Rick Clemmer, NXP's President and CEO; as well as Peter Kelly, our CFO. If you've not obtained a copy of our fourth quarter 2013 earnings press release, it can be found at our company website under the Investor Relations section at nxp.com. Additionally, we have posted on our Investor Relations website a supplemental earnings summary presentation and a document of our historical financials to assist in your modeling efforts. This call is being recorded and will be available for replay from our corporate website. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause NXP's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the macroeconomic impact on the specific end markets in which we operate, the sale of new and existing products and our expectations for financial results for the first quarter of 2014. Please be reminded that NXP undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements. For a full disclosure on forward-looking statements, please refer to our press release. Additionally, during our call today, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the impact of purchase price accounting, restructuring, stock-based compensations, impairment and other charges that are driven primarily by discrete events that management does not consider to be directly related to NXP's underlying core operating performance. Pursuant to Regulation G, NXP has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our third quarter -- fourth quarter 2013 earnings press release, which will be furnished to the SEC on Form 6-K, and is available on NXP's website in the Investor Relations section at nxp.com. Before we begin the call today, a few housekeeping items. I'd like to highlight NXP's attendance at the following investor conferences during the first quarter: We will be presenting at the Goldman Sachs TMT conference on February 11 in San Francisco; and the Morgan Stanley TMT conference on March 5, also in San Francisco. And lastly, we would like to announce the save the date for our upcoming Analyst Day, which will be held on May 8 in New York City from approximately 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. We will be sending out a formal invitation in the coming weeks and would appreciate an RSVP if you plan to attend. I'd like to now turn the call over to Rick.
Richard L. Clemmer: Thank, Jeff, and welcome, everyone, to our earnings call today. As this is our fourth quarter and full year report, I will spend a few moments highlighting key aspects for full year results before moving on to the details of Q4. Overall, 2013 was a very good year for NXP, and I would like to personally thank all of the NXP team for their very hard work in helping to deliver our results. We successfully delivered on most of the goals we outlined at the start of the year. The positive highlights include: First, we delivered very strong revenue growth. Product revenue was $4.68 billion, up 13% from 2012 against an addressable semiconductor market, which we believe to be about 4% to 5% in 2013. Overall, the HPMS segment revenue was $3.53 billion, up 19% versus 2012, with a broad-based growth as we continue to realize positive customer traction with our unique HPMS solutions. Looking at our focused HPMS end markets, we saw robust growth within our ID business, which was up 32% year-on-year to nearly $1.3 billion, due in part to the strong growth associated with initial ramp in our China bank card business. In our Portable & Computing business, revenue was $488 million, a 17% increase versus the prior year, as key wins in the high-end smartphones and tablet market continued to ramp throughout the year. In our Infrastructure & Industrial business, revenue was $729 million, up 15%, a result of good growth across nearly the whole portfolio, although partially offset by declines in our noncore silicon tuner business. Lastly, we experienced broad-based growth in our Automotive business, with revenue of just over $1 billion, up 9% versus the prior year, which we believe is stronger than the overall automotive semiconductor market growth. The second highlight is that we improved our overall profitability. Our overall non-GAAP operating profit, which we believe is a key performance metric for NXP, improved 34% year-on-year to 23.3% of revenue. This is very good performance, notwithstanding the challenges we experienced in our Standard Products segment in the first half of the year. Our non-GAAP gross profit margin improved about 15% year-on-year to 47.7%. Third, we generated $681 million in free cash flow, or approximately 14% of the total revenue. This was up 44% versus the prior year. Lastly, we improved our capital structure significantly and lowered our leverage to about 1.9x on an EBITDA-multiple basis, successfully achieving one of our long-term goals. We took actions throughout the year to further improve our very reasonable maturity profile, resulting in an overall blended cost of debt declining to 4.3%, over 100 basis point improvement, and moving the majority of our debt to fixed rate and unsecured. In summary, 2013 was a very good year for NXP. Let me assure the team has no intention to rest on its laurels. We will continue to invest in products and solutions that will ultimately delight and enable our customers' long-term success. Our product investments, plus the strength of the markets we have focused on, should result in our continued revenue outperformance versus both our immediate peers, as well as the overall semiconductor market. We will continue to maniacally focus on improving our long-term operating profitability. We believe this will translate into robust free cash flow generation from our current strong levels and provide the foundation for the company to continue to create significant shareholder value appreciation. Now I'd like to review the specific results for the most recent quarter. Overall, our results for the fourth quarter came in at the higher end of our guidance. Product revenue was $1.25 billion, a 3% improvement sequentially, and up nearly 17% versus the prior year period. This was about 200 basis points above the midpoint of our expectations, reflecting better-than-seasonal results versus the overall semiconductor industry. As a result of preference [ph], we would normally expect product revenue to decline about 4% to 5% sequentially into Q4. Total NXP revenue was $1.29 billion, nearly a 4% sequential increase, and up 16% from the year-ago period. Turning now to our segment performance. HPMS revenue was $957 million, an all-time record of the segment. HPMS revenue was up nearly 4% sequentially, and up 22% from the year-ago period. To put this in context, since the time of the IPO, the HPM segment has delivered average quarterly growth that is 4x the average quarterly growth rate of our HPMS peers over the same period, well above the objective that we had established. Now I'd like to review the results for our various HPMS businesses. Within our ID business, revenue was $329 million, flat versus the prior quarter, which was in line with our expectations, but still up over 13% on a year-on-year basis. Additionally, during Q4 as part of the program to monetize our IP, we were able to sign a comprehensive intellectual property licensing deal, which, over its lifetime, is worth about $40 million. This particularly -- particular deal included intellectual property and software licenses and is mainly in our ID business. The deal will impact our P&L for a number of years, and the impact to our Q4 EBIT was about $24 million. Order trends within the core ID business were in line with our expectations, declining about 2% sequentially, but up 30% versus the year-ago period, and the core continues to represent about 85% of total ID revenue. Within core ID, eGov, automatic fare collection and tags and labels product lines were all incrementally up in this quarter, offset by sequential declines in banking and infrastructure product lines. I believe it is important to highlight that our banking business is now up over 100% year-on-year and is now the largest revenue contributor in our core ID business. We continue to see the recent softness in end market, primarily in China, as only a temporary pause and fully believe that we will see a reacceleration of demand during coming periods. Within our emerging ID business, which includes mobile transactions and authentication, revenue was up 18% sequentially as a result of the noted IP licensing agreement but declined about 30% versus the year-ago period. I'd also like to take a moment and address a topic that has been in the news lately. As we have commented on for some time, there's a sizable EMV chip-based bank card upgrade cycle on the horizon in North America. We believe the recent highly-publicized credit card thefts at major retailers will ultimately prove to be an additional catalyst to move the upgrade cycle along. We believe NXP is ideally positioned in the secure banking market, with about 70% global market share. But beyond market share, NXP is the recognized leader in secure identity solutions, including government, banking, mass transit, point of sale and mobile transaction implementations. As we've said for some time, we believe our ID business should be able to sustain a robust compound growth rate for several years to come, and the global chip card banking upgrade cycle is only one of the growth areas. Moving now to our Portable & Computing end market. Revenue was $159 million for the quarter, an all-time high for the group, clearly reflected to the unique design wins we have won. Revenue was up 22% sequentially, better than our original expectations, and up 50% from the year-ago period. During the quarter, we experienced substantial growth in MCUs related to key design wins at a strategic smartphone and tablet customer, combined with very good sequential demand for our high-performance interface products. Within our Infrastructure & Industrial business, revenue was $194 million, down about 4% sequentially, slightly below our original expectations, while revenue was up about 20% versus the year-ago period. During the fourth quarter, after a strong Q3, our High Performance RF business for base stations was up modestly in Q4 versus the normal seasonal decline we would expect to see, while we experienced sequential declines in our silicon tuner business, and to a lesser degree, seasonal decline in our power and lighting business. Within our auto business, revenue was $275 million, a new record for the group, which firmly puts the business on a solid run rate in excess of $1 billion per year. Revenue was up 5%, better than our original expectations, and up 21% versus the fourth quarter of 2012. From a product perspective, we experienced broad-based sequential demand for keyless entry, car infotainment and in-vehicle networking products, while sensor products were essentially flat in the quarter. Finally, turning to the Standard Products segment. Revenue was $294 million, up 1%, slightly better than our expectations, and up about 2% versus the prior year. The key message on our Standard Products segment is the improving profitability profile. Turning now to our distribution channel performance. Total sales into distribution were up 3%, with sales out of distribution down about 1%. The total months of inventory in the distribution channel were 2.4 months. Inventory levels were still at the low end of the levels we would normally like to operate the channel at for optimal service levels and customer support. Absolute dollars of inventory in the channel increased about 7% on a sequential basis. In summary, our results in Q4 were very good, especially within our HPMS segment, as key design wins continued to contribute to our better-than-industry growth. We achieved record revenue levels in both our Automotive and Portable & Computing end markets. Looking at the full year, we clearly outgrew the markets and we -- that we operate within and believe this has resulted in positive market share gains for NXP. We are entering 2014 with a solidly improved financial profile. Our margins are up. Our leverage is down to where we want it to be, and we are generating significant positive free cash flow. We believe NXP is ideally positioned with the right mix of products, intellectual property, unique systems and application expertise, which will enable us to help solve our customers' problems. Our ongoing priority would be to improve the ability to consistently deliver solutions in a timely manner and we will structure our business to support this improvement, which help to enable our customers' success. Now with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Peter to discuss the financial details of the quarter.
Peter Kelly: Thank you, Rick, and good morning to everyone on today's call. As Rick has already covered the full year highlights, as well as the drivers of the revenue, I'll move directly to the highlights of the quarter. Overall, Q4 was a good quarter and better than our expectations. Total revenue, non-GAAP gross profit, operating profit and net income were all better than the midpoint of our guidance, which resulted in non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.99. Focusing on the details of the fourth quarter. Revenue was $1.29 billion, $28 million above the midpoint of our guidance. We generated $636 million in non-GAAP gross profit, $12 million above the midpoint of our guidance, and reported a non-GAAP gross margin of 49.2%, in line with the midpoint of our guidance. This was 240 basis points above our results in the previous quarter, with about 100 basis points of the sequential improvement resulting from the IP licensing revenue deal that Rick spoke about earlier and the remainder due to the combination of incremental revenue, pricing, mix and utilization. Now let me turn to the operating segments. Within the HPMS segment, revenue was $957 million, up nearly 4% over the previous quarter, with non-GAAP gross margin at 56.5%, 240 basis points above the third quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin was 30.3% of revenue, an increase of 310 basis points, primarily the result of the previously mentioned items. Within our Standard Products segments, revenue was $294 million, up 1% sequentially, with non-GAAP gross margin of 31.3%, a 210 basis point improvement versus the third quarter, primarily as a result of improved utilization and fall-through on the incremental revenue. Non-GAAP operating margin was 16.3%, a 150 basis point improvement as a result of the noted items, as operating expenses were essentially flat quarter-on-quarter. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $313 million, up $30 million -- $13 million on a sequential basis, and in line with the midpoint of our guidance range. Please note our Q4 operating expenses included about $9 million associated with the Dutch crisis tax. The anticipated expense was included in our guidance for the quarter. For the total operating profit perspective, non-GAAP operating profit was $324 million and represented 25.1% operating margin. Interest expense was $39 million during the quarter. We finalized the refinancing of our 9.75% senior secured debt and essentially repriced our term loan due in 2020. Together, the 2 actions have lowered our overall blended interest cost to 4.3%, a 90 basis point improvement from the prior quarter. Noncontrolling interests were $19 million and cash taxes were $13 million. This resulted in total NXP non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.99, $0.04 better than the midpoint of our guidance and $0.14 better sequentially. Stock-based comp, which is not included in our non-GAAP earnings, was $31 million. Now I would like to turn to the changes in our cash and debt. Our total debt at the end of Q4 was $3.32 billion, a decline of $376 million, sequentially, due to the timing of the 9.75% debt exchange highlighted previously. Cash at the end of Q4 was $670 million, a sequential decline of $271 million, also a result of the timing of the noted debt exchange. We exited the quarter with a trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.38 billion, and our ratio of net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of Q4 was 1.93x. Improving our leverage ratio was a significant milestone, an area of intense focus for the company, especially when considering the time of the IPO in August 2010, our leverage ratio stood at 4.2x. We've also improved our non-GAAP interest coverage from 2.4x at the time of the IPO to 8.3x today. We believe our leverage is appropriate given the size and cash flow generation of the company, and it provides us with a significantly lower cost of capital. We bought back 3.97 million shares at a cost of approximately $163 million or a weighted cost of about $41.07 per share. I'm also pleased to announce that the Board of Directors has approved a new 25 million share stock repurchase program. Consistent with our prior comments, we believe our shares continue to offer compelling value, and we will continue to be opportunistically active in our repurchase program. Turning to working capital metrics. Days of inventory were 96 days, a decrease of 5 days. And excluding prebuilds associated with the restructuring of our funds in Europe, our effective DIO was 83 days. Days receivable were 35 days, an increase of 4 days sequentially, while days payable was 71, a decrease of 2 days. Taken together, our cash conversion cycle was 61 days versus 67 days in the prior quarter due to better collections and higher sales. Cash flow from operations was $313 million and net CapEx was $70 million, resulting in positive free cash flow of $243 million or 19% free cash flow margin. Now I would like to provide our outlook for Q1. As far as the fourth and first quarters were our seasonally weakest periods. However, as Rick highlighted in his remarks, our Q4 results were significantly above seasonal norms. We continue to see constant trends across our business and view the demand environment incrementally better than we have in the past. With this as a background, we currently anticipate product revenue in the range of down 3% to down 6% sequentially. At the midpoint, we expect product revenue to be down about 4% in Q1, reflecting the following trends in our business. Within our HPMS segment, we expect Automotive to be about flat. Identification is expected to be down in the mid-single-digit range, with a sequential comparison influenced by the IP revenue in Q4. Portable & Computing is expected to be down in the mid-teens range, as seasonality in the high-end smartphone and tablet markets influence our outlook. Infrastructure & Industrial is expected to be down in the mid-single-digit range, primarily as a result of weaker demand in our emerging silicon tuner business. Standard Products is expected to be down in the low single-digit range sequentially, and we anticipate revenue from the combination of manufacturing and corporate to be approximately $35 million. Taken together, total NXP revenue should be in the range of $1.21 billion to $1.25 billion, or about $1.23 billion at the midpoint. We expect non-GAAP gross profit to be in the range of 48% to 49%, or about 48.6% for the midpoint. The sequential decline in gross margin is expected to be a result of lower IP revenue, the effective annual price reductions and slightly lower fixed cost absorption, offset by incremental cost of mix improvements. Operating expenses are expected to be about $308 million plus or minus $1 million, and this translates into a non-GAAP operating profit in the range of $276 million to $306 million, or about 23.6% operating margin at the midpoint. Interest expense on our debt should be approximately $35 million. I would like also to highlight earlier this morning we announced our intention to reprice our existing $486 million term loan that is due in 2017, with the terms and maturity remaining the same. We expect the transaction to reduce our interest expense and be accretive. The copy of the press release detailing the repricing can be found on our company IR website. As a result of the previously mentioned actions taken in Q4, combined with the repricing announced today, we believe our full year interest expense will be about $135 million. Cash taxes are expected to be roughly $8 million, and noncontrolling interest expense should be about $18 million. Stock-based compensation should be about $27 million, which is excluded from our guidance. Diluted share count should be about 256 million shares depending on share price fluctuations. Taken together, this translates into non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.84 to $0.96, or $0.90 per share at the midpoint of our guidance. As we look back to 2013, I'd like to observe the following. It was a strong year for revenue growth, and I think we've clearly demonstrated we have a number of growth drivers which will benefit the company for a number of years. It was clearly a good year for cash generation, and we've begun to demonstrate the cash generation capability of the company. Our EBITDA margin improved dramatically, but we are still below where it needs to be. So we will consider our performance in 2013 to be a B, a B+ at best. Clearly, our expectation of ourselves is that we're at A+ performance and essentially need to continue to drive the above-market revenue growth and deliver EBIT margin in the 26% range, and this will be our focus as we go forward. I'd like now to turn it back to the operator, and we will be answering your questions.
Jeff Palmer: Operator, please poll for questions, if you will.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of William Stein with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: I wanted to congratulate you on the very nice trend and in addition the big buyback that you announced. And I'm wondering if you can talk a bit, Rick, about your prioritization of cash flow. Your buyback seems to be a little bit less than 10% of the shares outstanding. What would cause M&A to prioritize above that? And what other priorities would you consider in the coming year?
Richard L. Clemmer: So first off, thanks for the comments. I think we've been pretty specific on our capital structure that until we achieve this low 2x annualized EBITDA, we've been maniacally focused on paying down debt. So that's a significant achievement for us to be down at the 1.9 level here in Q4, which basically, as we've said, gives us another tool in our toolkit where we could consider acquisitions so long as they weren't of the size that we couldn't repay back within 3 to 5 quarters. So I guess all we're trying to say is we now have the ability to consider M&A opportunities as they become appropriate and which would expand our growth above the organic growth objectives that we've set as a company well above the marketplace growth. Relative to the focus, so long as our stock price continues to trade at a significant discount to our peers, then we plan to continue to be focused on stock repurchases, indicated by the 25 million shares, or basically $1 billion committed to -- over $1 billion committed to in the stock repurchase. So that will continue to be our priority. If we were to see our market price increase to more in line with our peers, then at that point in time, we clearly would be in a position to consider dividends as well. We'd have a little bit of work that we would have to do associated with some of our debt structure to be able to achieve that. But clearly, that's not something that we're working on in the near term so long as we continue to trade at a significant discount to our market peers. But our primary focus and objective will be on continuing to buy back our shares in the marketplace, as you've seen over the last couple of quarters.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: That's great. I appreciate that. If I could follow up with one more on the ID end market, could you talk a little bit about the impact of the IP licensing deal, maybe clarify the comments around the contribution in the quarter and in future quarters? And then also, any view on when China, the PDOC [ph] or their equivalent to their EMV initiative might come back, and your view for the full year growth in that market?
Richard L. Clemmer: Yes. So on China, let me address your last question specifically first. We've said that we expected their supply chain to be kind of stopped as they're trying to distribute the cards that we distributed earlier on. And we would not expect to see a resurgence of growth in the China contactless banking market until kind of the springtime. So we still believe that to be the case. It's a huge market opportunity still, and one that we think our leadership position can continue to bear fruit. But clearly, the recent activities in the U.S. banking business present opportunities for growth, maybe late 2014 and 2015. As we've talked about, we have our ID business expected to grow in the mid to high teens for 2014, and those are clearly the contributing factors, or some of the contributing factors, to give us the comfort with that rather bold commitment about the continued growth of that business, which continues to grow well above semiconductor industry growth. And our leadership position there continues to bear significant fruit.
Peter Kelly: And Will, along the -- on the IP deal, so we signed an overall deal, as Rick mentioned. The total value was about $40 million. The impact on profit in Q4 was about $24 million, which is just over 100 basis points impact to our gross margin and EBIT. In terms of kind of how it plays out, the balance will be reflected in our P&L over the next couple of years. And as you know, these deals are never simple. They involve lots of different aspects of the business.
Richard L. Clemmer: Yes, and if I could just add one other thing to that. It will require that we increase our operating expenses a little bit going through this period of time with the implementation associated with it. So -- but hopefully, with extremely good pay-off over the long term.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of the Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: So Rick, Peter, you had very strong growth and execution last year. How should we think about the sales growth and profit growth, just conceptually for 2014?
Richard L. Clemmer: We've consistently said that we want to outperform the industry by at least 50% on the growth rate basis. We've clearly been able to demonstrate well above that through this period of time but believe that we have the design wins and the product portfolio in the right markets -- right end markets that will continue to support growth well above the overall semiconductor market. So that clearly gives us a solid base, as we believe that strong revenue growth is the key ingredient in appreciating our shareholder value. And then from a profit viewpoint, we've set profit objectives, we want to ensure that we perform at the top tier level in operating income, and it continues to be the highest priority focus we have going in 2014. So I would expect us to continue to see improvements in our operating income percentage performance. And clearly with the strong cash flow generation capability that results in, we'll have the opportunity to maximize the impact on our capital structure and thus our shareholder value.
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Got it. And as a follow-up, I think, Peter, you had alluded to reaching 26% EBIT margins. Is that a goal for this year? Is it a goal for exiting this year? Or -- and just beyond sales growth, what are the other levers that you have to reach that goal?
Peter Kelly: Okay, I guess a couple things. One is I'm not going to give full year guidance or guide Q4 '14. Our target is to get to 26%. And as I mentioned in my remarks, until we get there, I won't be happy. I don't think there's any kind of magic levers. I do think we have the ability to grow more than 50% faster than the market, obviously that's a help. We need to continue to work on all the things that good semiconductor companies do. So improve our yields, manage our costs, improve our mix, manage our pricing, but there's no one big lever. I think the one thing I would add is we have no intention of going above 26%. So to the extent that we see opportunity to do that, we would invest more in R&D. So in your models, you should not assume we get beyond 26% on an annualized basis.
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Got it. And just one last one if I may. I think you have said previously that the Standard Products business is nonstrategic to the business. You have seen very good profit improvements there. Any progress in looking at potential divestments? And just given the profit contributions from that group, is there a way to make any potential transaction neutral to earnings? Just conceptually, how are you thinking about that business as part of NXP?
Peter Kelly: I don't think there's a lot of point in us talking conceptually. Our view on Standard Products is -- has not changed. And clearly, we wouldn't talk about any specific M&A, if there was any.
Richard L. Clemmer: But the key focus for us is to continue to improve the performance of that business. And while we've made some good progress, we still have more progress to do. We think the best thing that we can do is continue to improve the performance, which, by the way, is already well above the industry average of the competitors in that space. But we think we've got a superior business, and we want to continue to operate it to the fullest extent possible. But clearly, our priority and focus on growth is in our High Performance Mixed Signal areas, where we have a much stronger application spaces and direct connectivity with customers, but we have extremely solid Standard Products business that we think can get -- continue to make progress into at least 18% plus operating income levels, and that's our focus associated with it.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Crédit Suisse.
John W. Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I'm kind of curious, this time last year going into 2013, you guys had some pretty high-profile potential socket wins that were maybe kind of for us from the outside looking in, kind of look at and see outsized growth. I'm kind of wondering this year if you can help us out a little bit. As you look at about outgrowing the industry in '14, what are the top sort of 2 or 3 areas either by end market or specific products that you think are going to show the most outgrowth for you guys throughout the balance of the year?
Richard L. Clemmer: John, we've already stated pretty clearly that we think our security business -- our ID business will have the opportunity for mid- to high-teen growth, which puts us in a very strong position, that's with design wins. Clearly with the banking business coming back on in springtime, on the China contactless banking market, with the beginning surge and more obvious growth of the banking in EMV being a significant contributor associated with growth in that as well. We talked about our P&C business based on the design wins we have and the position we have with the strong customer relationships in those design wins, clearly being able to grow kind of in the mid-teens basis. And our I&I business, which will have some upward pressure because of the kind of turn on of the -- finally of the base station market, we have low double-digit, as we had some tempering factors based on our kind of our nonstrategic silicon tuner business that we expect to continue to see very strong growth in our HPRF business focused on base stations. And in our Automotive business, we've talked about kind of mid- to high-single-digit growth which is, clearly we believe, a strong position in the industry. So we have extreme confidence in continuing to outgrow the industry. There's been some people that have talked about the outgrowth of the industry is -- we demonstrated, and give us credit for that, and say that there's not more -- any more to be had. And clearly, we see the design wins and the customer relationships to continue that for the foreseeable future. So for the next 12 to 24 months, which is kind of as far out as you have any relative confidence level in your overall growth rate, but we feel very comfortable with that, and we think that we'll continue to deliver the performance associated with that.
John W. Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Rick, that's helpful. Maybe as my follow-up, I always hate to use the word normal seasonal because there's so much variance in this industry around seasonality. But it sounds like despite the better-than-seasonal Q4, the guide for Q1, I guess I should look at through the window of your view of normal seasonal. But I'm wondering if you can help out, just given the growth in P&C, how is -- how do you think seasonality is evolving through the model? And as you think about Q2, Q3, Q4, how do we -- how should we think about kind of a baseline normal seasonality for the business?
Richard L. Clemmer: First off, I think we would agree with you that seasonality is hard to track and changes every damn year. So I'm not sure that seasonality can -- you can draw a lot of conclusions from it. I think the one thing that's important in what we've said for first quarter is you have to realize that we outperformed in Q4. So that tempers the growth a little bit in Q1 as you look at it. So I think we feel very good about our Q1 outlook contributing which, clearly if you look at on a seasonal basis, is usually down as Q4 is usually down. We were able to outperform that in this Q4 with our performance. But then we see usually from there an uptick in Q2, and probably the strongest quarter of the year in Q3, typically a little bit of a decline in Q4. This year, we were able to offset that -- this year -- last year in Q4 that we just finished, we were able to offset that. But we actually think that our Q1 outlook is quite strong and above where most people were but from a higher base from Q4, which actually tempers the growth a little -- or reduces -- makes the decline from a higher point a little bit. So we think that the performance even in Q1 is above what we would have been talking about 90 days ago. It's just that from a Q4 basis, it doesn't have something that's much different than a typical seasonal basis.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Rick, you kind of touched on this, but the outlook for the I&I business, can you talk about what you're seeing on the infrastructure side? And then are you seeing that headwind in silicon tuners continue into Q1?
Richard L. Clemmer: The silicon tuners business is one that -- there's a lot of people talking about focusing on that area. We're clearly still the industry leader, but we're not focused on it as a strategic area and so -- just because of the competitive nature of it, and it doesn't support the profit models that we want to achieve. So we'll see. We'll continue to see some headwinds on silicon tuner. I would tell you that our base station business -- when we had the earnings call last quarter, we talked about that we were yet to see the recovery in China. About 2 or 3 weeks after that, we began to see customer orders coming in significantly. And now we see -- we actually have difficulty in fulfilling all the customer requirements where they've increased their orders significantly. If you look at the growth that we've had in our base station business, it's been very strong, and we expect that to continue throughout 2014. And so if anything, we might see some upward pressure in that portion of the business. But the key thing for us today is to be able to meet our customer requirements and ensure after we've been successful at winning these design wins, now that it looks like the demand is truly there, that we're able to support our customers. But yet we want balance that off and be sure that we don't -- with the orders going up 2x and 3x in a matter of a couple of months, we want to be sure that there's not double and triple ordering so that we have fixed assets we put in place that are not able to be utilized. So the balancing act for us is to put the right level of capital investments in place to support the design wins we have and be able to support our customers with clearly an uptick of base station deployments around the world, not just in China, but actually orders coming from around the world based on the continuing desire to expand the networks and improve the performance associated with that in most developed regions of the world.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division: And then you touched upon some of the growth drivers in core ID. I was wondering if you could touch upon emerging ID and particularly, NFC outlook for this year.
Richard L. Clemmer: So last year was -- obviously with our Q4 results, it's pretty obvious was a slow year for us because we had gone through a period of time where we had done the Galaxy II and III, and we were pretty public about losing the Galaxy IV. So we would not expect to see a strong resurgence in NFC the kind of middle of the year. We think there are clearly a lot more increased activity on the mobile wallet. And we're very encouraged about the activity, with the potential of it being much more successful with the deployment than what we've seen in the past from the customers we worked with associated with that. So I would say we're very optimistic about growth in the mobile wallet space, and the opportunity is for that to become a much more significant convenience factor for the consumer as we look out into the second half of this year.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Excellent. I'm going to squeeze in one more for Peter. The gross margin guidance is actually quite strong if you pull out the IP impact. Particularly, Standard Products is back over 30%. Can you keep it at this level? And are you looking at this business a bit differently given what happened last year?
Peter Kelly: Well, I think we always said we feel Q1 and Q2 was the aberration where we're performing today. So yes, we think we can keep it at 30%.
Jeff Palmer: Blayne, if I could, I think the one disconnect we saw is the investors' view on Standard Products as being a impacted business, and we've never viewed it as that. We knew it had some issues, we knew we had to get through it, but we never saw it as an impacted business that was not -- that couldn't generate at least low 30s gross margin and kind of high teens operating margin if it was running correctly.
Richard L. Clemmer: And so Blayne, well, our focus is on continuing to make improvements from where we were in Q4. So it's -- we would not expect to see us slip back from those levels, but yet continue to incrementally improve from that to get to those margin levels that Jeff talked about. So we believe we have the best performing Standard Products business in the industry. And the key is just the cash that it generates and the customer relationships associated with it and how we can take advantage of that as a company, drive more growth associated with our High Performance Mixed Signal business.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.
Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Just touching on the Automotive business and the $1 billion run rate. Can you talk about trends you're seeing from a dollar-content perspective? And then on that very strong growth, is there anything to note by geography or penetration that's helping you out?
Richard L. Clemmer: Well, the strength we have, it's really been the underpinning -- from a different factor than just the normal growth of the market is in our car infotainment business, where over the last few years, we have now won 27 of the 28 mid- and high-end car radio platforms. And we want to go win the 28th as well, but there's like roughly 4 to 6 of those that we've won over the last year, 1.5 years, that are still -- that ramped in 2013 and are still in the ramp phase in 2014 as they shift from their previous suppliers to our products. So clearly, that's been the most significant growth segment that we have in our Automotive business in the near term, and then the rest of it is continued design wins. We had a design win with the second largest U.S. automotive manufacturer on keyless entry that we started shipping 1.5 years, or a year and change ago. And we continue to ramp additional models associated with that and contribute to our growth associated with it. As we look forward, we're quite excited about the U.S. announcements that took place earlier this week on vehicle-to-vehicle communications, where we clearly believe that we've [indiscernible] out and have a leadership position, taking basically the software defined radio from our car infotainment to be able to provide a bridge and work with Cisco in the infrastructure side, and we both have invested in a software company to be able to do the -- facilitate the software stack associated with that. So we're quite excited about the opportunity on vehicle-to-vehicle communication. So as the Department of Transportation talked about, significant reduction in accidents and ability to save lives with just improved intelligence in the car. So we see that over the intermediate term, not significantly in 2014, but in the intermediate term as being another significant opportunity for growth in our Automotive space.
Jeff Palmer: And, Rick, the geographic concentration will considerably [ph] -- real concentration we can highlight.
Richard L. Clemmer: I think the only thing I would say is, is we clearly continue to see weakness in Southern Europe, but Northern Europe and North America, China, I guess the one thing that we should probably comment on, while we've been the fifth largest semiconductor supplier worldwide, in China, we moved up from being the third largest in 2012 to actually the leading -- actually, that's in 2012, to the leading semiconductor supplier in China. So the growth that we see in China is probably the strongest segment, followed kind of equally by North America. And -- I should be careful, China, plus developing countries, is where we see disproportionate growth, with North America and Northern Europe being next, and clearly, some weakness in the Southern European customers.
Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Got it. And then just as a follow-up, can you talk about your expectations for the business -- the channel this quarter? You mentioned last quarter sales into distribution were a little bit higher than sales out. How are distributors managing business today? And any comment on kind of order trends there?
Richard L. Clemmer: Yes. I think what you actually see in the most recent quarter is we had one product line that we had not been able to really get any inventory into distribution because we didn't have the capacity available to do that. So we didn't have sufficient levels to be able to support our distribution partners with that, and we were able to kind of fix that in the current quarter, which was one of the factors about the sell-in versus the sellout in the current quarter. I think as you talk to our distribution customers, they're beginning to be much more optimistic relative to demand, and that's delightful since it's the first quarter in quite some time that I had been able to say that. But I think we do see from our distribution partners more of a positive perspective about demand. And frankly, we'd like to see our inventory levels edge up a little bit from where we were in the current quarter. We're up a little bit in -- at the end of the year, and we'd like to be able to take that up a little bit more as we move forward.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: You went through a lot of auto business commentary there a bit ago in the last question, Rick. But there's been some investor concern of late, just the last couple weeks, about rising inventory and potentially slowing demand. Could you give any color commentary on what you guys are seeing as far as any near-term trends in that business?
Richard L. Clemmer: We're removed from that. So if there's car inventory that takes place, to be fair, it's not as efficient a supply chain, so it would take a little while before we would see the factory orders. Where we really see order -- or as they go through of manufacturing, so they would have to adjust their manufacturing levels. And we have not seen any significant weakening in the pool from the vendor-managed inventory that would indicate any slowdowns relative to production. I think the one thing you have to also be thoughtful about, Ross, is the real growth factor that we believe will be a contributing factor for 2014 is in the developing countries and in China. And it's amazing how China is moving from low-end models to mid- and higher-end models all the time as well, which obviously plays to the semiconductor content. But I don't think -- I think it's a little early. And clearly, with the inventory levels, at least what I've heard about it being a lot concerned about the weather, I think it's a little bit early to be overly concerned about the demand in the automotive space. We still see very healthy demand in developing countries, China, and frankly don't see a slowdown or significant adjustment in Northern Europe nor in North America. But I saw the same report inventories, although I understood it was significantly a factor of weather related.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Great. And I guess as my follow-up question, a bit of a longer-term one. Everybody here in the U.S. obviously is excited about the EMV thing and that transition beginning. What sort of help could you provide us, if any, on sizing the absolute opportunity, the TAM that, that represents in your mind? And any sort of color on the timing when you think that ramp will begin?
Richard L. Clemmer: So Ross, there's a lot of people that get paid a lot more money than I do to project when EMV is going to take place -- I mean, when electric vehicles are going to take place. On electric vehicles, I think...
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: I actually meant the EMV for the banking side.
Richard L. Clemmer: On the banking side, it's up. Okay. So I think there's clearly going to be more pressure to pull that in than what we've seen before. We've been talking about that as being a contributing factor in the growth opportunity that we see in our ID business and will make that a more sustainable growth as it gets pulled in and ability to contribute more in the following year associated with that as well. I guess the real key for us in our security business is the broad breadth of the product portfolio that we have, everything from the infrastructure side that's required as there's improvements in the contactless banking, even RFID tags with accelerated deployment associated with that, transportation ticketing, so I don't think there's any one thing associated with it. I clearly do believe that there will be some significant pressure on EMV. We clearly are a leader in the banking market, so we want to be in a position to take advantage of that. And we're working with our customers to be able to look at what can be done with -- like the programs to be able to support the retailers that have identified the specific issue associated with it. But we clearly believe that it's about time that the U.S. get in line with the rest of the world and reduce the fraud rates, which clearly, EMV is an opportunity to be able to accomplish that. And we've been pushing that for some time and plan to continue to be there to support our customers in the deployment of that.
Jeff Palmer: Ross, if I could just add to your one question about sizing. I'd say if you look at some of the data from people like EMVCo, in North America, the card size is probably 1.5 billion cards. But don't get yourself too excited to think that, that's all going to get upgraded in a 12-month period. It'll take several years to just upgrade it. So while we're excited about the opportunity, we don't want you guys putting it in your models for the next 2 or 3 quarters.
Operator: Your next quarter comes from the line of Chris Caso with Susquehanna Financial Group.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: I'd like to just come back to some of your comments about inventory in the channel. It seems a bit unusual that the inventory in the channel has stayed this low this far into a recovery. Do you think, going forward, there will be a catalyst for the channel become -- bring inventory back to -- closer to historic levels? And what impact would you expect from that? Or do you think that there's a sort of a more permanent phenomenon of the channel and I guess customers in general just running the inventory a lot more lean than they have in the past?
Richard L. Clemmer: Well, I think calling this a recovery may be a stretch. It's somewhat [indiscernible] recovery to say the [indiscernible] say that up to this point in time. I think on the inventory channel, it's always an arm wrestle, especially with the 2 U.S. major partners indistribution as they're focused on terms and earns, and they try to keep their inventory as low as possible. And we try to keep their inventory at somewhat reasonable levels to be able support our customers associated with it, which is the reason we pay them the margin associated with it. So I think the key thing for us this quarter was we had one specific product line that we were able to put some inventory in place to support our customers going forward. I would like to personally see our months of inventory jump another 1/10 or 2 over the next quarter so. I think as our distribution partners begin to feel better about the general economic environment, then we'll see them much more willing to do that as well. And clearly, there's some initial signs of that, which is encouraging because we haven't seen that in the past quarters. Always before in the general economic environment, we've talked about a very anemic overall economic viewpoint. And I think we are beginning to see signs and signals of an improved economic environment with random indicators and not anything as specific. Even though you continue to have concerns like the China reports that came out in not -- in the last week or so. So I think the key for us is, is we want to continue to edge up our inventory levels a little bit, so as the market takes off, we're able to support that. One of the best examples of not having sufficient inventory is the base station increased demand we see now where we're clearly struggling to be able to support their demands. And we actually have another product area or 2 where we're having issues in being able to support significant increases in demand from our customers.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay, great. As a follow-up, with respect to the margins, and clearly, you guys achieved what you set out to do with respect to the margins over the last year. Can you talk to what you can do to keep them there? And of course, I agree with your comment that it hasn't been a very strong recovery so far. And hopefully, it gets better, but the industry is still cyclical. And I guess what do you guys -- what can you guys do when, inevitably, things slow and kind of convince the investors this operating margin structure has a degree of permanence to it?
Peter Kelly: Well, I think -- it's Peter. I think there's a couple of things. First of all, our -- first of all, we have a very significant -- course of our cost is variable, all right? So you don't really see huge improvements in our profitability because our revenue increases. At the same time, you are not going to see huge declines in our profitability if our revenue was to decline. I think the key really is the markets you take and the positions you have in those markets, we're very, very focused on having a relative market share of 150. So we don't just want to be #1 in the market. We want to be significantly larger than the next person there. I think if you look at our Automotive business, the pricing structures we have in there, the long-term pricing structures, sometimes it's kind of frustrating from our perspective as we have to -- not we have to, we've agreed annual cost reductions to our partners that we have to support. But in the end, it's having good products and good markets, continuing to manage your costs, continue to work with world-class suppliers, continue to improve our yields. So I don't think we're as subject to cyclicality as you may think we are.
Richard L. Clemmer: I guess the only other thing I'd like to add to that is, is when you look at our business mix, with our Automotive business and our ID business, which, combined together, are over half of our total business. Clearly, the Automotive business follow the typical semiconductor cycle. And our ID business, if you look at the demands associated with it, really follows more of a project-by-project orientation and the ramp-up of deployments of those projects, which is not really following the semiconductor -- typical semiconductor cyclicality either. So we're kind of at least immune in a significant share of our business to typical semiconductor cycles themselves. And then as Peter talked about, I think with the cost structure we have in place, you would not see the same kind of fall-through or impact if there was any semiconductor cycle pressures on the remainder of the business.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of James Covello with Goldman Sachs.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: First question on the ID segment. You guys had tremendous growth there on a year-over-year basis, 32%. On a sequential basis though, that business hasn't grown in a year in terms of quarter-over-quarter growth, inclusive of the first quarter guidance. You mentioned the springtime as a potential rebound sequentially in that business. Should we expect to see a significant sequential rebound maybe in Q2 in order to put us back on that mid- to high-teens growth trajectory? Or is that going to be something that kind of more gradually ramps in?
Richard L. Clemmer: So I think your point is well taken about the sequential growth. They're -- are relatively kind of flat on a sequential basis. But still, our ID business was up 20-something percent. Actually, our core was up...
Peter Kelly: Well, the core...
Richard L. Clemmer: 30% versus a year ago.
Peter Kelly: Yes, the quarterly business is up 13% year-on-year, all in.
Richard L. Clemmer: In total, but the core itself was...
Peter Kelly: It was up 30% year-over-year.
Richard L. Clemmer: Up 30% year-over-year. So I think you go through -- with a business as broad as that business is with the different customer basis and the different products that are shipped there, it's a combination of a number of things, Jim. And when we talked about a resurgence, we're really talking about the contactless banking in China beginning to come back in second quarter. Clearly, as the concern in the U.S. on EMV will be a contributing factor to increased growth associated with that business. And then we talked about with the interactions and work that we're doing with a number of players on the mobile wallet, we expect to see a significant improvement in that kind of mid to -- midyear as well, midyear to fall. So I think we feel very comfortable with mid- to high-teens in that business and with a broad basis and continuing to see very strong growth. So I think that we're going to go through this period just a little bit of a lull based on the mix of businesses we have and would clearly expect to see some improvement in the Q2 time frame and continue to see that improve beyond there as well, Jim.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Very helpful. And if I could get some perspective. If you can help us to understand your comment about the significant discount to the peer group. What metrics are you using there? Is that a cash flow-based multiple or earnings-based multiple? And are you including stock-based comp expense in there? And are you including the Standard Products peer group? That'd be helpful.
Richard L. Clemmer: Yes, we shouldn't be telling you guys about the multiples associated with it. Hopefully you guys can do the calculations. I mean, clearly, every calculation we look at, we are a significant discount to our peers associated with it when we look at it on a normalized basis. But the key for us is we're going to perform, and you guys can determine the appropriate value associated with it. But we know that we can continue to outperform marketing growth. And if you look at most industries, a company that grows higher than the peers actually has a trading multiple that's above the peers as opposed to a discount to the peers. But any multiple we look at, we trade at a discount to our peers associated with it.
Peter Kelly: Including and excluding stock-based comp.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie with Raymond James.
Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: I just want to clarify some of your earlier comments on market share in the banking card business. I thought I heard you say 70%, and I think at your Analyst Day you said overall, you're 44%. And I thought the MIFARE was 70%, so backing into that seemed like banking card would be lower, so if you can just clarify that. And then as we think about EMV in the U.S. and more banking cards in China, can you talk a bit about your competitive advantage, maybe from a technologies perspective, why will you continue to win in these markets versus some of your competitors?
Jeff Palmer: So I'll take the comment on the market share, Steve. So at the Analyst Day in '12, that was before the significant acceleration of the China banking upgrade cycle. We went through a kind of a review today, just in the last few days, and we still think our market share on a global basis, in the banking card market, is about 70%.
Richard L. Clemmer: And that clearly comes from a transition of the marketplace to -- from mag stripe to contactless, with contactless growing very rapidly and mag stripe actually decreasing associated with it, and our strength focused on the mag stripe. Our position and what really has facilitated our leadership in the China banking market is the dual interface standard where we're kind of a leader in establishing that. And it comes down to not only the security you provide, but the speed with which you have the ability to read on the card from a contactless viewpoint as well. So that leadership position, on the combination of the speed, as well as the security, is really what continues to position us very well and in a true leadership position. If you look at the MIFARE, our market share is actually more like 85%. And it's really a different market not included in that bank card market. So it's a separate market. And on the infrastructure side, we continue to be something in the 75% to 80% range as well. So our leadership position in ID is one that we've invested in for a long time, worked on in for a long time. And it really comes as much from the fundamental core security technology that you have in-house, which really has nothing to do with the semiconductor business. It's the cryptology and the software associated with it where we believe we have some of the world-leading experts to be able to facilitate that and will continue to be a significant factor for NXP as the industry grows. When you start looking out at the Internet of things, you're going to want to be sure that each one of those things has some level of security associated with it. So we think that the position that we have in security plays well to that overall continued growth. And one of the reasons we feel as comfortable as we do about having a conviction in outgrowing market by at least 50%, and as we've demonstrated since the IPO, actually outgrowing the market by over 4x.
Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Okay. That's very helpful. And then just in the emerging identification, so excluding NFC, but looking at some topics you touched on today, and as you mentioned the past. You've talked about tagging, you talked about authentications/cyber security. Can you talk about if those have been developing here as you might thought? And could those be significant dollar drivers over the next year and 2 years?
Richard L. Clemmer: So one of the things that we continue to be extremely excited about is our authentication business. And we've talked -- actually Google talked at a conference now about NXP being the supplier for their so-called newbie [ph] device, which is a physical device that they now use where your computer has to have that physical device before you can access their cloud at the enterprise level, so it provides a much more robust security with a handshake to be sure that there's not tampering. It reduces the risk of tampering and cybersecurity associated with it. And also one of the things that they're looking at for their consumer users offers the opportunity to store your password information so you don't have to have a piece of paper you carry around, or like I typically do, forget my password when I go to a site I haven't been to in a month or 2 and have to re-create the password. So I'm actually looking forward immensely to the rollout of this to the consumers so I can actually implement that. I don't think that it'll be a huge growth factor in our ID business for 2014, but we believe out beyond the current year and looking forward that the authentication of the cloud, that NXP, because of the actual security leadership position we have in the technology basis, we can play a significant role in the security -- in the cybersecurity protection associated with access to the cloud.
Operator: And your final question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh with Sterne Agee.
Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: I had a question on the banking side. Obviously, 1 billion to 1.5 billion cards in the U.S., big opportunity here, even with a -- even if you take 20% to 30% penetration, that's much bigger short-term opportunity than anything that you had before. What are the signposts that investors should look at to see that ramp? And also on the NFC side, you mentioned a midyear ramp. Is that for the marquee phones? And on the IP, are you going to add any more licensees as you go through 2014?
Richard L. Clemmer: You've got a number of questions there, Vijay. So on the IP, we talked about our IP monetization, so we plan on continuing to work that diligently associated with it. We have lawsuits in place with some potential people that we believe are infringing our patents. We expect to continue to move those forward, so we'll have income associated with that. So it will be in a different form than what we talked about. But we think going forward, IP becomes the significant factor in being able to protect our market position and be able to provide our customers with a solution that has a -- and more secure from an intellectual property protection basis than the alternative. So we do believe that, that's significant, but we have also an IP monetization program that, as we've said, we want to be sure can contribute about 100 basis points of our profitability on a full year basis, and although it'll be choppy on a quarter-to-quarter basis. On your comment on the banking, at 20% to 30% share, I should be fired and our team should be fired if we were to let our market share on that go down from the 60%-plus level. 60%, 70%, down to 20%, 30%. So I would expect that on that opportunity, we would clearly have the same kind of market share we demonstrated in that market. So I think we plan to be a leader in the deployment of that and be sure that we work with our customers because we're not -- there are partners that we work with in being able to provide that fundamental technology, but we clearly believe that we should be a leader. The real question is, is how rapidly that will develop. And we've said that all along that we think it will be much more of a growth factor late in 2014 and 2015. That could get pulled in a little bit, but we don't think it'll be overall very significant associated with it. And I apologize; I forgot what your middle question was.
Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Oh, it was on NFC, on the ramp. And maybe -- by the way, on the banking side, my question was more -- even if you see a 20% to 30% penetration off the 1 billion cards, there's a big opportunity for you. I know you guys are the leader there, so...
Richard L. Clemmer: Oh, you're talking about more of the ramp-up associated with that?
Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: That's right.
Richard L. Clemmer: Look, the bottom line is, is we want to be sure that we can provide the technology and provide our customers with ability to win in that space and be able to protect financial transactions so they're done in a much more secure fashion. I just saw a report yesterday that said the fraud rate in the U.S. was twice the fraud rate in the rest of the world where EMV was implemented. So clearly, it's a factor associated with it.
Peter Kelly: I mean, this is not new news to us. It's exactly what we've been saying for the -- I don't know, the past year or so. Clearly, it's been our expectation that ID can grow in the mid to high teens on a compound-annual basis over the next few years. So it's glad to -- it's good news that everyone is realizing -- everyone else is realizing this is an issue, but this is not new news.
Richard L. Clemmer: And relative to the mobile wallet, I think we probably just should say that we see the opportunity for a significant increase or step-up kind of in the second half of the year associated with that with the customers that we're working with.
Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: And that's for smartphones, mobile wallet kind of thing?
Richard L. Clemmer: Yes.
Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Got it. And my last question, on Ethernet and cards, it looks like there's a big opportunity going forward with a lot of guys talking about Ethernet. How are you guys positioned there with your wins? And how do you -- how are you looking at the transition from CAN to -- CAN/LIN to Ethernet?
Richard L. Clemmer: Well, first off, we think that they will coexist. We also should be sure that we don't lose FlexRay. When it comes to safety in-vehicle networking, FlexRay is still very significant, associated with it. So as the industry begins to move to Ethernet, one of the things that we've done is worked on being able to provide that. And actually, our customers has encouraged one of the leaders on the commercial side of Ethernet to be able to work with us in providing that same core technology that would be sufficiently robust to be able to support the automotive market. So we see it as a significant opportunity and one that we want to be sure that we continue to be a thought leader in the overall in-vehicle networking capability within the car.
Jeff Palmer: Operator, we'll probably going to have to end the call now. Rick, would you like to make any final comments?
Richard L. Clemmer: Sure, Jeff. Thanks. So listen, we thank all of you for your continued interest in NXP. In summary, we believe our results in 2013 demonstrate measurable success in executing our long-term strategy, specifically our full year revenue growth of 13%. We believe NXP achieved clear share gains in multiple HPMS markets. We made good progress towards our profitability goals, but we still have work to do there, and it's clearly one of our key focus priority areas. Full year HPMS revenue growth at 19% showed the increased traction in operational performance solidly within our long-term model. Every one of our HPMS businesses delivered robust growth in excess of the semiconductor market, and our design wins that we've been able to achieve will support continued growth well above the industry average. We generated significant improved free cash flow of $681 million, and we will continue to see that improve as we go forward. We believe NXP is well positioned to consistently outgrow its overall peer group, and although as we mentioned, trading at a significant discount to the peer group. So thanks a lot for your interest and support, and I look forward to our future discussions.
Jeff Palmer: Thank you very much. With that, I'll end the call. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Third Quarter NXP's Semiconductors NV Earnings Conference Call. My name is Stephanie and I'll be coordinator today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Jeff Palmer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Jeff Palmer: Thank you, Stephanie. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the NXP Semiconductors third quarter 2013 earnings call. With me on the call today is Rick Clemmer, NXP's President and CEO; as well as Peter Kelly, our CFO. If you've not obtained a copy of our third quarter 2013 earnings press release, it can be found in our company website under the Investor Relations section at nxp.com. Additionally, we have posted on our Investors Relations website a supplemental earnings summary presentation and a document of our historical financials to assist in your modeling efforts. This call is being recorded and will be available for replay from our corporate website. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that cause NXP's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the macroeconomic impact of the specific end markets in which we operate, the sale of new and existing products and our expectations for financial results for the fourth quarter of 2013. Please be reminded that NXP undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements. For a full disclosure on forward-looking statements, please refer to our press release. Additionally, during our call today, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures which exclude the impact of purchase price accounting, restructuring, stock-based compensation, impairment and other charges that are driven primarily by discrete events that management does not consider to be directly related to NXP's underlying core operating performance. Pursuant to Regulation G, NXP has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our second -- third quarter 2013 press release, which will be furnished to the SEC on form 6-K and is available on NXP's website in the Investor Relations section at nxp.com. Before we begin the call today, I'd like to highlight our attendance at the following upcoming investor conferences during the fourth quarter: The Crédit Suisse TMT conference on December 4 in Scottsdale, Arizona; The Bank of America Merrill Lynch High Yield Conference on December 4, in Boca Raton, Florida. I'd like to now turn the call over to Rick.
Richard L. Clemmer: Thanks Jeff, and welcome everyone to our earnings call today. Overall, we are very pleased with our performance in Q3. Revenue was slightly below the midpoint of our guidance as a result of some slight weakness in the mobile market. We achieved historic record revenue levels in nearly all of our HPMS business units, with 15% year-on-year growth, a continued reflection of design win momentum we have previously highlighted. We delivered earnings at the high-end of our guidance with incrementally better profitability in both our HPMS and Standard Products segment. We continue to control our expenses in line with our intermediate targets. Taken together, the improvement in profitability and expense control directly translated into very robust cash flow during the quarter. In terms of overall demand, our performance by the end market materialized very much as we had originally projected other than the slight weakness in the mobile market. Moving to the details for Q3. We delivered product revenue of $1.21 billion, a 5% sequential increase and an 8% increase from the comparable year ago period, as Standard Products revenue declines year-on-year slightly impacted the strong HPMS growth. Total NXP revenue in Q3 was $1.25 billion a 5% sequential increase and nearly a 7% increase from the comparable year ago period. On a segment basis, total HPMS revenue was $922 million, up 5% sequentially, but up nearly 15% versus the year-ago period. Overall, our HPMS segment delivered excellent results and we achieved record revenue levels in 3 out of 4 of our focused end markets, with ID continuing to perform at close to the record levels delivered in the previous quarter. Turning to the performance by HPMS end market, revenue in our ID business was in line with guidance at $329 million, down 3% sequentially, but still up nearly 20% versus the year-ago period. Our core ID business was flat sequentially and continues to represent over 80% of overall ID revenue. This was in line with our expectations due to good demand for secured government ID products. Design momentum for our core ID products continues to be very strong across all verticals. Our emerging ID business declined in the quarter as the expected result of lower mobile transaction revenue. We continue to see encouraging design win momentum at all our customers, but do not anticipate our mobile transaction business to meaningfully re-accelerate until sometime in mid-2014. Turning to our Automotive business, revenue was above guidance at $261 million, up 3% sequentially and up 9% versus the year-ago period. The business delivered much better than seasonal growth as demand was positive across all product categories, and continued to experience the ramp of the new entertainment and keyless entry programs, we experienced a particular strength in our in-vehicle networking products. I'm also pleased to announce that during the quarter, we sampled the first device in our so-called road link family of software-defined radio platforms, enabling car-to-car and car-to-infrastructure communications. Our road link products had been successfully tested in multiple real-world field trials, within Europe, the U.S. and Asia, with initial production anticipated in late 2015. This is an exciting new market opportunity for NXP, which some researchers believe could be one of the most impactful safety features since the widespread deployment of safety belts. Within our Portable & Computing business, revenue was $130 million, up 23% sequentially, and up 9% versus the same period a year ago. Both our High-speed Interface and Microcontroller businesses were both up more than 20% during the quarter. While we saw strong growth from the new and existing program ramps in the mobile market, growth was slightly less than what we had originally projected. Within the broad-based non mobile business, growth was actually better than our original expectation. Looking at our Industrial & Infrastructure business, revenue was $202 million, up 12% sequentially, and up 18% versus the year-ago period. This was essentially in line with our expectations. Performance in the quarter was very good across the majority of the portfolio. Our performance RF and small signal RF devices for base station applications experienced a compound growth in excess of 20% sequentially, and up more than 15% year-on-year as new programs we have highlighted in the past continue to ramp. Our Power and Lighting business was up nearly 15% in the quarter, and up more than 20% versus the year-ago period, primarily as a result of strong solid-state lighting product growth. A significant highlight in the quarter was very strong growth within our emerging products group, which includes the Maximus smart mobile audio amplifier. The group posted growth of better than 35% during the quarter, primarily as the result of ramps with several leading smartphone manufacturers. Turning to the Standard Products segment, revenue was $291 million, up 4% sequentially, but down 8% versus the same period a year ago, which was slightly weaker than expected as a result of weaker than projected demand for mobile OEMs. We are very pleased to confirm the growth in operating margin improvements, as we had projected, with the team making good progress towards operating the business within our long-term target objectives. Moving on to the channel performance. Absolute inventory dollars and distribution increased versus the prior quarter. On a dollar basis, sales into distribution were slightly higher than sales out, which was up 6%. The total months of supply with our distribution channel was again at 2.2 months, flat sequentially and below our longer-term metric of 2.4 to 2.6 months. In summary, our performance in Q3 was very good. We're delivering strong broad-based revenue growth. We continue to realize the benefits of solid design win traction and share gains across multiple end markets. From an operational perspective, we're tightly controlling our expenses in support of our long-term EBIT targets. Our model is delivering very positive operating leverage as a result of excellent margin in our HPMS segment and the initial improvements in our Standard Products segment. We continue to take active measures to optimize our capital structure and reduce our quarterly interest expense. We believe we will continue to deliver top line growth better than the industry peers, improving the operating profitability that's driving solid bottom line earnings growth. And I'll turn the call over to Peter to review the financials in more detail.
Peter Kelly: Thank you, Rick, and good morning, to everyone on today's call. Overall, we delivered a very good quarter with the main highlights being increased revenues, improved gross margins in both HPMS and Standard Products segments, reduced interest expense, the continued improvement of our capital structure as we completed a debt transaction which converted highest cost, secure debt to lower-cost fixed-rate unsecured debt, stronger-than-expected non-GAAP earnings, and as a result, extremely robust free cash flow. Moving on to the specifics of the quarter, top line revenue was $1.249 billion, up 5.1% versus the second quarter and just below the midpoint of our guidance. We generated $585 million in non-GAAP gross profit or 46.8% non-GAAP gross margin, which was $45 million better sequentially. Total non-GAAP operating expense was $300 million or 24% of revenue, and in line with our plan. We are operating solidly within our expense model, reflecting the positive efforts of all of our business unit managers. And we continue to invest in R&D as a priority. All in all, this resulted in non-GAAP operating profits of $285 million, or 22.8%, about 80 basis points better than our guidance, and 130 basis points higher versus Q2, demonstrating positive operating leverage. Let me now turn to the segment performance. Within our HPMS segment revenue was $922 million, up 5% versus the prior period. A result of weaker-than-expected demand from our mobile customers. HPMS non-GAAP gross profit was $499 million or 54.1%, a 30 basis-point improvement. And HPMS non-GAAP operating profit was $251 million, up about $13 million from the prior quarter or 27.2% operating margin, again, solidly within our long-range model. In our Standard Products segment, revenue was $291 million, up 3.6% sequentially, and again a little weaker than expected in revenues from our mobile customers. Standard Products segment non-GAAP gross profit improved to $85 million or 29.2% gross margin, and this was a 540 basis point sequential improvement successfully flowing through the P&L. Standard Products segment non-GAAP operating profit was $43 million, or 14.8% operating margin. Interest expense was $44 million, in line with our expectations, and noncontrolling interest was $17 million with cash taxes at $5 million. Taken together, our non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.85, about $0.03 better than the midpoint of our guidance, primarily through the result of improved gross profit and slightly lower operating expenses, even with a slightly weaker revenue. Stock-based compensation, which is not included in our non-GAAP earnings, was $20 million in the quarter. Now I'd like to turn to the changes in our cash and debt. Our total debt at the end of the third quarter was $3.7 billion, up $360 million from the second quarter. During the quarter, we completed a $500 million unsecured note transaction. And the new bond carries a fixed interest of 3.5% and is due in 2016. The sequential increase of our gross debt is a result of the timing between the issuance of the new bond and subsequent payoff of the $422 million 2018, 9.75% senior secured note, which has since occurred on October 15. Cash at the end of the quarter was $941 million, up $372 million sequentially, a result of the previously mentioned debt payoff timing. We exited the quarter with net debt of the $2.76 billion, a reduction of $56 million, and a trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.3 billion, resulting in a net debt of trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio of 2.15x. I'm confident we'll be below our 2x leverage ratio during the fourth quarter, which is a significant milestone for the company. We bought back 4.3 million shares at a cost of approximately $159 million, or a weighted cost of about $37.26 per share. Consistent with our prior comments, we believe our shares offer a compelling value and we'll continue to be opportunistically active in our repurchase program. Turning to working capital metrics. Total days of inventory on the balance sheet were 101, a decrease of 3 days. Excluding pre-bills for the restructure of our fabs in Europe, our effective DIO was 88 days. Receivable days were 39, up 1 day, while payable days were 73, consistent with the prior quarter, resulting in a cash conversion cycle of 67 days, a 2-day improvement from the second quarter. Cash flow from operations was $298 million, and net CapEx $54 million, resulting in the very robust $244 million in free cash flow, or approximately 20% free cash flow margin, a new historic level for the company. Now I'd like to provide our outlook for the fourth quarter. Influencing our outlook again this quarter is our continued success with customers, resulting in strong demand for our HPMS products across multiple end markets. We currently anticipate product revenue to be in the range of down 2% to up 4% sequentially, reflecting better than historic seasonal trends. At the midpoint of this range, up 1% sequentially, we anticipate the following trends, all on a percentage point basis: Within our HPMS segments, we expect identification revenue to be flat-ish. Within our Auto business, we expect revenue to be up in the low single-digit range, similar to last quarter, and relatively strong given normal seasonality. Within Infrastructure & Industrial business, we expect revenue to be flat-ish, and within our Portable & Computing business, we expect revenue to be up in the mid-teens percent as our new mobile programs continue to ramp. And finally, within our Standard Products segment, we anticipate revenue will be flat to slightly down. We anticipate the combination of manufacturing and corporate and others to be about $34 million. And taken together, total NXP revenue should be in the range of approximately $1.22 billion $1.29 billion, or $1.27 billion (sic) [$1.265 billion] at the midpoint, up about 1% sequentially. We expect non-GAAP gross profit to be in a range of 48.6% to 50%, or just over 49% at the midpoint, and operating expenses to be about $312 million. At the midpoint of our guidance, we anticipate about 100 basis points negative impact from a one-off crisis tax that the Dutch government is expected to institute on Dutch employee compensation. This translates in a non-GAAP operating profit in the range of $288 million to $332 million, or about 25% operating margin at the midpoint, 24% at the low end and 26% at the high end. Our progress to improving our margin profile has been quite good and consistent with the planned actions we've highlighted over the recent quarters. Interest expense on our debt should be approximately $40 million. Cash taxes roughly $30 million. And noncontrolling interest expense should be about $17 million. Stock-based compensation should be about $27 million, which is excluded from our guidance. And diluted share count should be about 256 million shares depending on share price fluctuations. Taken together, this translates into non-GAAP earnings per share in a range of $0.85 to $1.02 or $0.95 per share at the midpoint of our guidance. In summary, a strong set of third quarter results coupled with a better than seasonal outlook for the fourth quarter. Our revenue growth continues to outpace the broader market, and we continue to generate significant cash and expect to be below our debt to 2x EBITDA leverage target during the fourth quarter. Before I open it up for questions, Jeff has just passed me a note and I may have read out the midpoint of our revenue guidance incorrectly. The midpoint of the guidance is $1.265 billion. So with that, I'd now like to turn it back to the operator for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Crédit Suisse.
John W. Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I think this is either the fifth or sixth consecutive quarter of outperforming the industry, so congrats on that. I guess, Rick, can you drill in a little bit on the mobility side of the business? Because, clearly, there's parts of that business that I'm assuming saw a pretty decent growth in the calendar third quarter, but you also talked about the weakness in that space being the reason why you were a little bit shy of the midpoint. I'm just kind of curious if you can just remind us how big mobile is within the total mix and kind of the pieces within that. And more importantly, when you look at the strong sequential guide you're giving for the Portable & Computing space, have you taken into account continued further weakness kind of in the legacy mobile? Or how does that play out?
Richard L. Clemmer: So -- thanks, John. So first off, I think it's important to realize that for -- mobile for us is growing with the design wins we've had in smartphones. So it was a year or so ago, it was kind of high single-digit, now it's up to kind of in the low-teens, I would say. But that's across all of our business segments including Standard Products and logic, transistors and diodes, which changes quite a bit as they changed their design. So at one point in time they had up to 20 ESD diodes in some of the -- or 25 ESD diodes in some of smartphones. And as they do the redesigns, that comes down. So that's a changing factor. What we did see was healthy growth across all of our customers in the smartphone space, but just not quite as healthy as what we originally anticipated. The one benefit we had was the ramp up of design wins that we talked about, specifically in the sister [ph] hub and continued success in the interface part of the smartphone market that we talked about. So those are really the key bases for us and, yes, obviously we've taken into account the best estimates that we can of our customer expectations although, as we all know, in the Mobile business, that bounces around a quite a bit. But we've reflected what we believe to be the best projections associated with that. And I think it's just a good testament to the continued design win success that we've had at the leading smartphone customers.
John W. Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Rick, that's really helpful. Then maybe a follow-up for Peter. Peter, when you think about gross margins and incremental gross margins, the fall-through has been pretty impressive over the last 5 or 6 quarters. From current levels, how should I think about fall-through on the incremental gross margin line? And then I'll use your words of "extremely robust free cash flow." Especially given where your valuation is relative to your peers, how do we think about uses of all that cash you're generating?
Peter Kelly: Well, let me, I guess, go back with that. Yes, I guess, we've been saying for a while that we think we'll generate very significant amounts of cash. And we've also said that once we get below our targeted 2x trailing 12 months EBITDA, we would decide exactly what was the best use of cash for our shareholders, whether it would be to go out and buy the company's -- buy back stock or institute a dividend. I think right now, we would love to acquire and grow the business, but that's one thing to do that and being able to do that, and having companies available is not always -- it's not always at the same time. So right now, I think what we're doing is -- and you saw it in the third quarter, with our stock price trading the way it is, we'll go out and buy back stock, we bought back quite a few shares in the third quarter, 4.3 million. And as I said, with the stock price trading the way it is, I would expect to continue to do that. In terms of margin fall-through, we think it's very, very important to continue to invest in the business. So I'm kind of pleased at where our profitability is in -- or where it's projected to be in Q4, and obviously, we've had this kind of one-off impact of the Dutch crisis tax. But I'll expect to continue to invest in R&D with the incremental margin.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: My first question is, your ID business has been a solid grower and a differentiator, the challenge I have, and I believe a lot of investors have, is we don't know how to model growth in that business because there are very few macro or competitive indicators. So my question is, as we look forward, should we expect ID to grow at its historical rates, is this a 10% grower, or is this a 15% grower? How should we just conceptually think about modeling growth in this very important business of yours?
Richard L. Clemmer: I think it's one of our key priorities and with that, we're very -- as we talked about this year, we were very convinced of double-digit growth, if you look at Q3 with basically 20% growth year-over-year, kind of demonstrates the robust strength that we have in that business across a broad array of portfolios, everything from transit ticketing to eGov with passports and ID cards and mobile transactions. And so the strength we have associated with that is the weakness as far as projections associated with it from your perspective, because it does go into transit ticketing. It does go into RF ID tags. It does go into passports, which are very project-oriented [ph], and up-and-down associated with it. The one area that kind of grows significantly is certainly on the mobile transactions with the design wins we have. So I guess the best way to say is we feel very comfortable that we'll grow at least 50% faster than the market in that space, and it will be double-digit growth. But as far as giving you some indices to really be able to model off of, I don't think we can really to that because, frankly, it's just not that easy a business to do the projections associated with. I think that there's no reason to believe that it'll be significantly different than what we've been able to accomplish. Although clearly, on a project orientation basis, it'll have some ups and downs associated with it. But we continue to feel extremely good about our ID business and the success we will have with new handset models going forward on mobile transactions. Although to be fair, it'll kind of be mid to next -- mid-next year to next fall before we see a significant ramp up in additional design wins in the mobile transaction space.
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: And on the Standard Products business, very good improvement in profitability, it think in the past you have said that it is not core to the business. But it does provide tax and scale benefits and it's obviously quite accretive. What strategic or financial options are available to reduce sort of the drag on growth from the Standard Products segment? And what will be the decision criteria as you look at those options?
Richard L. Clemmer: Well, the drag on growth, it's -- we're more focused on profitability in Standard Products than we are growth. We've always said that we'll try to grow in line with the market in Standard Products and not outgrow the market. That our HPMS growth of growing at least 50% faster than the market because of the significant share of our total business that HPMS is. Standard Products is 1/5 or so of our total business. So it's not a significant factor relative to the growth, but -- and we want to really focus on ensuring we deliver -- continue to deliver industry-leading profit margins in Standard Products as far as [ph] the Standard Products business competitors as opposed to driving growth. So it'll continue to be a factor in our overall growth. I think it was particularly impactful in Q3 because it was negative and took our 15% year-over-year growth in HPMS down to single digit in total when you combine it with Standard Products. But our plan is, is that we want to continue to grow at least 50% faster than the market, but our Standard Products business basically grow in line with the market as we really continue to focus on profitability of that business as opposed to top line revenue.
Peter Kelly: And Standard Products is clearly, probably the best Standard Products business in the world. So there's a lot of good in that business.
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. Got it. And just one last one. As a clarification, Peter, maybe how should we model interest expense for next year? And if I could just include on one IP monetization, I think in the past you have mentioned that as an objective. How should we model that going forward? Any progress on that?
Peter Kelly: I think a couple of things, one is interest probably $145 million to $150 million next year. And IP monetization, we've spoken about, they've been about 100 basis points of our profitability.
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: For next year?
Richard L. Clemmer: We've said that after we got to that level, we would continue to expect it, on an annual basis, to contribute around 100 basis points of profitability, although it will be somewhat different on a quarter-by-quarter basis depending on the project and relationships that are signed up on an individual quarter basis. But then on the full-year basis, we would expect about 100 basis points.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: When I look at what we've heard from the semi industry quarter-to-date, almost everybody else is guiding about 5 points below what the Street had expected, and it seems to imply something had changed over the last month or so. So the question I'm asking for you guys, it's obviously not affecting you, but, Rick, when you look at the overall state of the industry, what have you seen from either a booking's perspective, or just a general demand perspective that can give us a little bit of clue on what's going on? Because clearly, you're seeing something that's slightly different than most of your peers.
Richard L. Clemmer: Yes, Ross, I think -- again, I think the key factor for us is the ramp up of the design wins that we've talked about previously and the ability to support the customer engagements that we've been able to drive associated with that. I think that's really the key factor for us that allows us to be better than seasonal in Q4. Typically, Q4 would be down a little bit. So this gives us the ability to really be better than seasonal. I think that, overall, general demand, we don't still see a robust recovery. We've talked about -- we don't think our book-to-bill is very effective way to measure the status of the business, but it's certainly not anything to write home about. The general environment continues to be spotty, but it's based on the design wins that we have and the ramp-up of those design wins and the customer engagements that give us the comfort relative to being able to do the projected revenues for Q4. So I think it really does confirm, once again, the success we've had with the design wins and the differentiated basis that allows us relative to the rest of our analog mixed-signal peers.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Great. And then, as my follow-up question, one for Peter. You guys did a great job in the operating margin side, so -- and one clarification in the near term and then one slightly longer-term aspect to the question. The 25% at the midpoint, you said that includes about 1 point tax -- crisis tax. Any sort of information on that would be helpful. The clarification is, does this quarter include IP revenues that you had expected to hit? And then, the longer-term question is, what should we expect from an operating margin target perspective now that you have attained more or less the guidance that you had hoped to hit in the fourth quarter of this year?
Peter Kelly: Okay. So Q4 does include the Dutch crisis tax. So the Dutch -- it has to pass the first house of parliament in the Netherlands, and we won't know about that till December. But the Dutch government have decided to levy a one-off tax on the compensation of any employees that make more than EUR 150,000 a year, and that includes compensation from option grants, bonuses, salaries, et cetera. And you -- I think you will have seen that ASML and a bunch of other Dutch companies also have put it into their guidance. So it's not absolutely certain yet. We think it's likely, but there is a possibility it won't pass. And then, if it doesn't, it'll obviously not be an issue. Q4 did include some IP. So we're pretty much on track where we said we would be. And then, I have to confess, I'd really like to enjoy Q4 before I start to kind of get into trying to guide 2014.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Caso with Susquehanna Financial Group.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: I wondered if you could comment a little bit on the I&I group. Obviously, it's been running at pretty strong year-over-year growth rates. And I guess, specifically, within the wireless infrastructure business, we've heard some mixed commentary from some of your peers on that. What's your expectations for that business? And I guess, maybe you could help us to understand a little bit of the lumpiness of that business.
Richard L. Clemmer: I think we have tire tracks on our back from trying to project the growth associated with the High Performance RF business. So we have been a little more cautious than some other semiconductor suppliers into that space. Clearly, we saw growth in Q3. We think that, that will roll off a little bit in Q4 just with kind of normal seasonality. But one of the key factors for us has really been the increased design wins in HPRF as well. So if you look at where we've gone on 2G, where we're 20%, 25% market share to 3G where we were just under 50% and at -- with 4G or LTE where the design wins we believe that we've won are more than half the market, maybe as much as 60% of the market, with the engagements with the new customers that we haven't had in the past at the same level. So that's really what drives our fundamental growth in HPRF. But it's still a lumpy business. It's just not easy to do projections. What we've tried to do is streamline our process flows to be sure that we have some raw material inventory in place so that we can handle the flex up. But yet if the orders don't materialize not have quite as much financial impact on the downside. But it will continue to be a lumpy business. We feel good about our position and where we are, but it's certainly not a smooth business that is what most of you guys would like to see on just a smooth upward trend.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. And just as a follow-up -- and obviously, as you say, it's really too early for you guys to be providing any commentary on 2014. But given that we're coming off of a better-than-seasonal Q4 already, is there anything that you see now that would influence you to -- that we should take into consideration when we are doing our -- obviously, we'll have to do our estimates for Q1. Anything we should take into consideration as we look into Q1 that may cause it to be a little better, a little worse than normal seasonality, realizing that the Q1 is typically one of your stronger quarters?
Richard L. Clemmer: Actually, that's not correct. Our Q1 is usually down kind of mid-single digit and on a seasonal basis, and we would expect that to kind of be -- we wouldn't see anything that would change that perspective associated with it. We're not giving you any projections for Q1. We talked about we still want to, at least, grow -- outgrow the market by 50% for the full year. But typically, on a seasonal basis, our Q1 is down kind of mid-single digit, and then we see a little bit of an uptick in Q2, the strongest quarter being Q3. And typically, Q4 is down slightly. Although, this year, we don't see the same downward pressure that we typically do. But clearly, Q1 is typically a down quarter for us on a seasonal basis. And we'll give you more guidance on that when we do the Q1 outlook in 90 days.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of James Covello with Goldman Sachs.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Congratulations on the continued outperformance, fundamentally it's just extraordinary. Haven't seen anything like it in a long time in this industry. I guess the first question is sort of on your longer-term portfolio mix. You guys have been so consistent in your message that you would continue to take higher growth potential even if it's slightly lower gross margin business and you'll take as much of it as you can get and you'll balance out the margin and the revenue. Is there a limit to how much of that you would take in terms of what you think a healthy long-term mix for your portfolio is? Or will you continue to take all of that, that you can get?
Richard L. Clemmer: So, Jim, we have a conviction to really move forward in a basis where we want to confirm that we can outgrow the market. And the key for us is that the business at a bottom line EBIT level is still on a positive basis around that 25% basis where it's creating significant shareholder value, we're going to do everything we can to do that. So we have a very strong position that we want to be as focused as we can on driving the top line growth so long as it's a profitable business for us. We're not going to get in businesses that are in mid-teens or upper-teens from an operating income basis. But on an ongoing basis, if it delivers to the bottom line results, which most of those do because of the significant volume nature associated with it, then we want to be very focused on taking as much of it as we can. [indiscernible] about the gross margin, but focused on the EBIT margin.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Right. And so, I guess, I'll just stick with -- on that topic for my follow-up, which is just that there is no concern there about getting too much exposure to one segment, you'll just -- you feel like you can manage that over time?
Richard L. Clemmer: Jim, there's always a concern that you have to be somewhat balanced. I think one of the strengths of our portfolio is the different businesses that we play in, so that we can have different segments that contribute at different times. And so, I actually believe that the portfolio we have gives us more of a strength to weather through some of the typical semiconductor cyclicality better than some of our peers that are much more focused.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie with Raymond James.
Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: I was hoping you could comment on your emerging ID business. And specifically, I was hoping you could talk about NFC in context of the fact that it seems like in certain ways you're doing better than expected. Maybe Broadcom can't do an integrated chip and the performance doesn't seem that good on some stuff they put out there, which is on the positive versus on the negative side. It seems like Apple maybe is going more of the path of low-energy Bluetooth. And so, I was hoping you could talk in terms of context around that. And also just any update on the opportunity for cyber security and anti-counterfeit for 2014.
Richard L. Clemmer: Yes. So I think we're just as convinced on the opportunity associated with NFC across the board as we ever have been. We see the strength associated with that. We see that, as that takes place, the ease-of-use, which is really what it's about, and the security that it offers in protecting the mobile wallet as being key contributing factors. So I think we still feel just as good about NFC as we did when we invented it a decade ago. And clearly, the basis that it's taken longer to materialize has been a cost to us. But I think that if you look at the design wins we have across the board, we feel very comfortable about the continued movement. And as we look at financial transactions, we think that ease-of-use and the security that comes from having the secure element as well that makes the banks and the credit card companies feel much better about supporting the mobile transactions is really the key associated with the growth. But I think -- we think that the growth -- the fundamental growth associated with it is just as strong as we've seen. Most of the industry is still projecting that 1/2 of the smartphones by the year 2015 will have -- be NFC-enabled and we certainly concur with that and believe that the design win momentum we have would support that.
Jeff Palmer: And, Steve, I'll just add too -- we actually view Bluetooth low-energy as more of a complementary technology to NFC, not a competitive technology and we could probably take it offline and go in more detail. But we don't see that as an immediate threat to NFC. It's a different type of technology. And then, Rick, on his commentary on cyber security authentication efforts?
Richard L. Clemmer: Thanks. I'm sorry, I forgot. So I think we actually feel just as good as we have about the cyber security opportunity. Clearly, it's an area that's in its infancy. The one good thing is that Google actually at a conference announced that we're the supplier of their -- gosh, I forgot what they call it.
Jeff Palmer: Nivi [ph].
Richard L. Clemmer: Nivi [ph]. A product that will actually store everyone's individual passwords and give -- it will actually do authentication of the access to the cloud that they've rolled out on the enterprise side. So they talked about our product being the key component that supports that. We hadn't been able to talk about that previously. But since they've talked about it at their conference, we can talk about the design win we have there. So I think we're still in the infancy phase associated with that, but we're quite excited about the unique security capability that we have in being able to provide a very compelling value proposition and providing a secure access to the cloud and being able to fight cyber security. So as far as next year, it's not going to be huge in moving the bottom line, but it's really about seeding the market and being able to provide the foundation for the significant opportunity that exists in the intermediate-term future.
Jeff Palmer: Do you have a follow-up, by any chance?
Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Yes, sure. And just a question for Peter on use of cash. It seems that Q4, you're likely going to hit your target there on 2x trailing EBITDA. And when you gave the list of stuff -- you talked about a bunch of stuff, possible acquisitions, buying back stock, but I didn't really hear you comment on more debt pay-down. I'm just wondering if that's just assumed and so that's why you didn't mention it. But is that still the plan -- also keep paying down debt?
Peter Kelly: Well, I think if the stock price is where it is, I'll buy back stock. I think that will be a better use of funds for the shareholders. I mean if the stock price goes to $100, maybe -- which I guess is arguably where it should be, it would be a different discussion. But when we're trading $37, I'm going to be buying back stock.
Richard L. Clemmer: Yes. With a significant discount to our peer trading, clearly, our focus will be on repurchasing shares as frankly you saw in Q3 with the strong repurchase that we did and -- but that will be balanced off with the opportunity to continue to pay down debt if that's a good return for our shareholders or looking at growth through acquisitions that we really haven't put much effort and attention on previously. So obviously, there would be boundary conditions around anything we would do, which would have to be significantly accretive. We wouldn't want it to be huge, so we'd want to be able to be back to within our 2x annualized EBITDA basis within 3 to 5 quarters or so. So we're not talking about huge acquisitions. But if they can drive significant shareholder value appreciation then, clearly, we'll put more attention and focus on that than we have previously when we've been maniacally focused on driving down our debt to the 2x annualized EBITDA up to now.
Peter Kelly: Yes. I mean, our valuation is very frustrating. I mean, we're growing like crazy, which you'd expect to drive a premium fee. But instead, we have a fee that's not a small discount, a huge discount to everyone else's. It's unbelievably frustrating, really. But I guess it is a great buying opportunity, so...
Richard L. Clemmer: And now, with private equity being below 24% of our shareholding, some of the excuses associated with private equity ownership at least gets minimized associated with it.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Peter, I apologize if this is obvious. But I just wanted to clarify. The crisis tax, you said 100 basis point impact, is that to non-GAAP margin? And if you could just talk about -- you actually were able to guide higher even despite OpEx creeping up. Could you just talk about why that's moving up?
Peter Kelly: Yes, OpEx is moving up because of the crisis tax.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Easy enough, but I just wanted to confirm. So does that come back down, the one-time charge?
Peter Kelly: Well, I guess, the way to look at it, we don't -- if we didn't have that one-time charge, OpEx would not be going up. I think, as we move forward and you look at your models, I'd look at our OpEx more as a percent of revenue than a flat dollar base. We're going to continue to invest in R&D to drive growth in the business.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. But just -- it's a one-time -- I mean, I'm not familiar with the Netherlands rules, right? It's a one-time charge?
Peter Kelly: It's absolutely one-time, yes. Well, that's what the Dutch government have told us to do.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Perfect. And then, this was hit on a bit before...
Richard L. Clemmer: [indiscernible] we could do the same thing next year. It's something that they've chosen to do relative to trying to address their tax -- their deficit issues in the Netherlands.
Peter Kelly: And it's extremely frustrating. And all my peers at the other Dutch companies are just as equally frustrated with both the timing and the magnitude of this.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I can imagine. The second question just on the NFC radio and the handsets. I think that's been pretty much written out of your story given the well-known share loss. It actually seems like you've gained a little content back on Note 3 [ph] with your new part. I'm just kind of curious how you view the handset opportunity. I think the expectations are very low. Do you see any opportunities particularly as maybe some of the share shifts on the connectivity side for you to do a little bit better there?
Richard L. Clemmer: Well, we've talked about this. First off, I think we should be clear. We have over 200 SKUs that we've won design wins associated with, while maybe our competition's won maybe 10 to 15 or something. So we still continue to be in a very strong leadership position associated with NFC solutions on a broad-based customer. The well-known Galaxy IV design win loss that we had clearly has been a significant factor on our revenue, but we're in very aggressively on Galaxy V and in support of any other design wins that are required to able to drive this. So we plan to continue to be a leader in the mobile payment space and feel very confident with the next generation of technology that's being deployed with our customers now that we're getting extremely good feedback about the performance associated with it and our ability to be successful in continuing to drive that leadership basis. So I wouldn't say that we backed off of that or anything, it clearly -- we have the well-known design win loss that had an impact now, but it continues to be focus area for us. But again, it will have some nominal impact on our total revenue because it's only about 5% of total revenue. But it's very important for us to be able to maintain the momentum in our -- the security aspects of ID business because our real focus is on the secure element and ensuring that we can drive the success there, where we have a unique technology lead and a unique technology position. While the NFC radio itself is frankly just another radio, although we have some good technology there as well. But our real focus is on the security side and how we can drive the secure element on a broad basis to be able to meet the requirements of the credit card companies and the banks, as they plan to continue to focus on rolling out mobile payments.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of William Stein with SunTrust.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: I'm hoping we can talk about the margin ramp in Standard Products. It's a very big improvement this quarter. And we know from earlier in the year there were some quality issues there and some mix issues. Are those all addressed, or are there still -- is there still a meaningful upside in that segment to margins?
Richard L. Clemmer: Well, we've talked about that we had those -- we've made most of the operational improvements back a quarter or so ago, and it just takes a quarter to flow through the inventory valuation on our P&L. So I think we're performing fairly well associated with the operational performance in Standard Products. I think we have to continue to be very focused on which parts of the markets we engage in to be sure that we can drive the improvement in bottom line results that we're focused on. Clearly, even with the improvements that we had this quarter, there's some significant improvements to get back into the operating range that we would like to operate that business. So we would expect to continue to see improvements as we go forward associated with being more focused on the product mix and ability to drive the scale of that business. But the operational performance that we talked about -- the quality issues, which were roughly 1/3 of the decline we had earlier in the year, we think those are pretty well behind us. That's not to say that something couldn't happen again. But clearly, the ones that we talked about at that point in time are pretty much behind us now.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: That's very helpful. And as a follow-up, regarding the use of cash, it sounds like certainly not a change in your comments, but M&A is maybe a little bit more prominent in the discussion. And I'm wondering if you can talk about the characterization of the kinds of transactions you might want to look at in terms of sizing, margin, accretion, growth, those sorts of things?
Richard L. Clemmer: So I think we have to be real careful associated with that. I mean, we're going to do what's in the best interest of our shareholders. That's our focus. And we've said that we believe getting below 2x annualized EBITDA, where we were at least at a metric of investment grade, not that we'll be investment grade without the ratings agencies going through a cycle or 2 associated with it, but we felt like that it was imperative that we had to focus on driving our debt down to be below 2x annualized EBITDA. As we achieve that, then we'd have more flexibility to focus on other alternatives to be able to drive shareholder value that includes M&A, but not limited to M&A. And in fact, at the current stock prices, share repurchases are clearly a very meaningful part of that overall strategy in how we continue to focus on driving shareholder value. As far as M&A itself, clearly, it would have to be something that would fit within our product portfolio, that would either strengthen our portfolio or be a close adjacency associated with it, that would have to drive significant accretion and would have to be within the boundary conditions that I talked about. We wouldn't want to go out and take our net debt position where we will be significantly above the 2x for more than 3 to 5 quarters. So I think that's kind of as much as we're willing to say about kind of what we would consider. But our focus is on driving shareholder value, which M&A would only be a piece of that, not the predominant piece associated with it.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh with Sterne Agee.
Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: On the -- I'm just wondering, as you look at 2013 exiting, what is your foundry mix and what do you see it exiting 2014? And on gross margin line, obviously, it's picked up nicely. But as you look at 2014 with the fab multi-sourcing, et cetera, what's the -- what are the puts and takes in the gross margin line there?
Peter Kelly: I would have to check the numbers, but I think we -- in 2013 we're in about 35% foundry, and it probably goes up to like 40%, 45% in 2014. I'm not sure I quite caught your -- I'm not sure I quite understood you at the second part of your question on the puts and takes of our...
Jeff Palmer: The impact on gross margin, I think, is what...
Peter Kelly: I'm not sure I kind of want to define it that specifically. I think, overall, we don't see any big disadvantage or any big advantage. I think it's more around the -- our margins are driven more by the products we build than the manufacturing costs.
Richard L. Clemmer: Clearly, the product mix will be much more significant than what share of our business we do with the foundry partners versus our joint venture versus our internal manufacturing facility. So that would be clearly a much more significant factor on our gross margin. It's not just -- when you look at the portfolio of products we have, a little bit of a mix change in any individual quarter can have a pretty significant swing on our overall gross margin as we change that mix. So it's not just a continued straight line basis of trying to do that. So I think we still feel good about the improvements, and we still feel good about the targets that we've established. But it really won't be as much a factor relative to how much of our manufacturing is sourced from foundry partners versus internally manufactured.
Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: On the ID side, identification side, it obviously looks like the EMV card should be a pretty decent opportunity for you. Can you talk about that a little bit?
Richard L. Clemmer: We -- I think Visa has made a proclamation that by -- is it third quarter of 2015?
Jeff Palmer: Yes...
Richard L. Clemmer: Third quarter of 2015, they'll change the rates significantly if that's not implemented. So I think that's really kind of, at least, a line that appears to be drawn in the sand at this point in time. If you look at the implementation in Canada, it's already in works and accelerating associated with it. And really, the rest of the world, besides North America, which has this propensity towards mag stripe as being the transaction standard associated with it. If we actually look at some of the movements outside of -- in Asia and the developing countries, where we see contactless being a very significant factor associated with it -- has more of an impact than EMV card deployment in North America itself -- or in U.S. itself.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.
Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Just following on the strength in Portable in Computing, any early insight into next year in terms of how you think about the new product pipeline and design activity in that segment?
Richard L. Clemmer: We're continuing on -- I think we're -- as it was a significant factor in changing our business, we felt like we had to be more specific with some of the design win targets that we had. I think it's more just run a course of the business, continuing to win those design wins, the [indiscernible] generation of products and it's part of more a normal standard business. So the success that we've had with -- on the interface side and then moving into the sensor hub, we plan on continuing to focus on driving that on a broad basis across the board to customers including those smartphone customers in China. But not any specific design wins that we want to talk about as far as growth for 2015. But we still feel very comfortable that we can outgrow the industry by at least 50%.
Jeff Palmer: Craig, do you have a follow-up?
Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I do. On the capital allocation front, you mentioned M&A. Can you just talk through maybe some of the parameters in terms of things you'd look for and then also margin profile that we should keep in mind if M&A does come up?
Jeff Palmer: I think, Craig, Rick highlighted that before that we're probably not going to go into a lot of detail about that. As long as it creates significant shareholder value, we'd be interested in looking. But I think -- I don't think we're going to rehash that question again. Do you have another question you'd like to ask?
Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: No, that was it.
Jeff Palmer: Great.
Richard L. Clemmer: I guess the only thing I would add to that is we would not anticipate anything that will reduce our margin targets associated with it. So it would have to be something that, with the implementation, would fall within the business profile that we've established.
Operator: The final questions will come from the line of Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.
Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Rick, I believe you said that sell in was slightly higher than sell out. Do you think -- what would you attribute that to? Is that attributed to seasonal patterns? Is that what normally happens at this time of the year? Or is there -- is this a cyclical-driven dynamic?
Richard L. Clemmer: So, Mark, I don't think that we saw anything that was -- that is really an indicator as far as our distribution business. I would say that it was more of a continued very tight control over inventories, and I don't think that you should read too much into the increase in sell-in in the mix. I mean, the key factor -- the key metric in trying to continue to evaluate our distribution business is that the inventory levels remain below what we would expect to be the standard levels and the -- and our distribution partners continue to be very tight, focused on turns and earns in trying to keep their inventory levels to a minimum to be sure that they deliver the returns that they can. So I don't think you should take anything other than the factor that the inventory levels continue to be at lower than what we would expect on a historic basis, and we haven't seen any real uptick associated with that, which I think is really the key message we're trying to communicate, Mark.
Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: That's very helpful. Last question for Peter. If Q1 is normally a seasonally weaker quarter, can you give us any indication about what would you expect your own utilization rates to be? And would we expect inventories to be a source of cash in Q4?
Peter Kelly: I'm just trying to think -- from a cash flow perspective, historically, Q4 is a good cash flow quarter and Q1 is a weaker cash flow quarter. But I cannot -- pretty much beyond that, I'm not sure I could really say much and we don't forecast utilization.
Jeff Palmer: Well, everyone, thank you very much for your time today. Rick, do you have any final words?
Richard L. Clemmer: Yes. I think -- thanks for all of your favorable comments relative to our results in third quarter and the projections for Q4. I think it continues to be a strong testament to the results of what the team's been able to put in place and deliver. And our focus is continued on how we focus on driving shareholder value increase, which -- again, we're not trying to signal M&A as being the primary basis, but only one factor in the toolkit to be able to drive increased shareholder value. So with the increase in earnings that we've been able to generate and actually as we look forward with a very strong continued earnings per share growth, we feel very comfortable with the position and pleased with the performance. And thanks to all of the NXPeers [ph] that may be listening to the call as well for their good progress and their contributions relative to our results. So thanks a lot.
Jeff Palmer: Thank you, everyone, and we'll speak with you shortly. Thank you. Bye now.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect, and have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2013 NXP Semiconductors Earnings Conference Call. My name is Sonia and I will be your coordinator today. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Jeff Palmer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Jeff Palmer: Thank you, Sonia, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the NXP Semiconductors Second Quarter 2013 earnings call. With me on the call today is Rick Clemmer, NXP's President and CEO; and Peter Kelly, our CFO. If you've not obtained a copy of our second quarter 2013 earnings press release, it can be found in our company website under the Investor Relations section at nxp.com. Additionally, we have posted on our Investor Relations website a supplemental earnings summary presentation and a document of our historical financials to assist in your modeling efforts. This call is being recorded today, and will be available for replay from our corporate website. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause NXP's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the macroeconomic impact on the specific end markets in which we operate, the sale of new and existing products and our expectations for financial results for the third quarter of 2013. Please be reminded that NXP undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statement. For a disclosure on forward-looking statements, please refer to our press release. Additionally, during our call today, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the impact of purchase price accounting, restructuring, stock-based compensation, impairment and other charges that are driven primarily by discrete events that management does not consider to be directly related to NXP's underlying core operating performance. Pursuant to Regulation G, NXP has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our second quarter 2013 press release, which will be furnished to the SEC on Form 6-K and is available on NXP's website in the Investor Relations section at nxp.com. Before we begin the call, I'd like to highlight our attendance at the following upcoming investor conferences during the third quarter. We'll be at the Jeffries 2013 Corporate Assets Summit on August 28 in Chicago. We'll be attending the Deutsche Bank 2013 CMT conference on September 10 in Las Vegas. Now I'd like to turn the conference call over to Rick.
Richard L. Clemmer: Thanks, Jeff, and welcome, everyone to our NXP earnings call today. We are very pleased with our performance in Q2, which came in at the higher end of our guidance, both on revenue and on earnings. More importantly, we are also encouraged that the broad-based momentum we experienced in Q2 should continue into Q3. Our result in our guidance are clear proof points of the diversity of our product portfolio and that the design win momentum we have discussed in the past is coming to fruition. We believe our results are a reflection of the success NXP has achieved in delivering value-added products to our customers across multiple end markets. I'd now like to move on to the results for Q2. We delivered product revenue of $1.16 billion, a 10% sequential increase and a 12% increase from the comparable year-ago period. This was in the upper range of our guidance. Total NXP revenue in Q2 was $1.19 billion, just over a 9% sequential increase and nearly a 9% increase from the comparable year-ago period. On a segment basis, total HPMS revenue was $878 million, up 13% sequentially and up 18% versus the year-ago period. That was $15 million better than our expectations. Our HPMS segment delivered excellent results, as we experienced robust double-digit sequential growth across all of our focus end markets. I would also like to highlight that our Identification and Automotive HPMS businesses achieved record revenue levels during Q2, and both are now each solidly operating in revenue run rates of over $1 billion per year. I'd like to thank both teams for their intense customer focus and passion to win to achieve the targeted goals. Turning now to the performance by HPMS end market. Revenue in our Identification business was $339 million, up 13% sequentially, and up 45% versus the year-ago period. Our core ID business was up 28% sequentially, representing over 80% of overall IV revenue. This is a new record revenue, and was above our expectations due to the combination of better than anticipated demand for contactless banking products, as well as very good demand for automatic fare collection and Infrastructure products, which are areas we don't talk about much. Design momentum for our core ID products continues to be very strong across all verticals. Our emerging ID business declined in the quarter with lower mobile transaction revenue. We expect that our mobile transaction business will be roughly flat year-on-year due to the effect of already well-documented product transition at one of our major customers. And the adoption rate of the new design wins continues to be truly outstanding. We continue to see encouraging volumes of new design wins at all of our customers, with over 300 SKUs currently having been awarded, with a clear shift to our next-generation NXP and secure element technology that will bring about an even better consumer experience and more enhanced security. Interest in our new identification products continues to gather steam, but we will likely take a little bit longer than originally thought to emerge as a material revenue business for us. Turning to our Automotive business. Revenue was $253 million, up 10% sequentially and up 4% versus the year-ago period. That was above guidance. The business delivered strong sequential growth due to the combination of better than seasonal demand, the launch of a new customer entertainment programs and the continued ramp of major keyless door entry programs. And now turning our Industrial and Infrastructure business. Revenue was $180 million, up 18% sequentially, and up 15% versus the year-ago period. Performance in the period was very good across the entire portfolio, with all product lines contributing to the growth. High Performance RF for base station applications and Small Signal RF devices experienced growth above 10% sequentially, and more than 15% year-on-year, primarily due to the ramp of new programs, which we have highlighted in the past. We believe the long anticipated 4G buildout in China is still ahead of us, beginning in the second half of the year, which should help support even further growth. Our P&L -- our Power and Lighting business was up over 20% in the quarter, though from a small base, but still very good growth. We continue to maintain our leadership position in silicon tuners with the business up in the high single-digit range during the quarter. Within our Portable & Computing business, revenue was $106 million, up 14% sequentially, but down 1% versus the same period a year ago. Our High-Speed Interface and Microcontroller business were both up in the low teens percentage range on a sequential basis. Growth during the quarter was primarily a result of the rebound in our broad-based, nonmobile business. Consistent with our expectations, the initial shipments of the new sensor hub microcontroller design wins began as expected. We also experienced a modest rebound in demand for existing mobile interface designs of the Tier 1 mobile OEM. Our traction with new and existing design wins in the smartphone space is doing very well. Turning to the Standard Products segment, revenue was $281 million, up 1% sequentially and down 3% versus the same period a year ago. Our performance was slightly below our expectations as a result of weaker than projected sales for certain logic products within the mobile end market. The revenue performance of our discreet business, which is -- had some issues over the last couple of quarters, had incrementally improved and was up during Q2. As we've said in the past, the top line performance of our Standard Product segment is a good first order approximation of the direct influence of the macroeconomic and external cyclical patterns on our business. Moving on to the distribution channel performance. Absolute inventory dollars in distribution was flat versus the prior quarter. On a dollar basis, sales into distribution were essentially in line with sales out. The total month of supply within our distribution channel declined to 2.2 months, below our longer-term metric of around 2.4 to 2.6 months. We see this as low for the level of future business we anticipate, and are working with our distribution partners to improve inventory levels. In summary, our performance in Q2 was very good. Our HPMS segment is firing on all cylinders. Our model of strong franchises across multiple end markets is enabling us to perform exceptionally well, even if certain high-profile markets like PC and high-end smartphones experienced moderating growth. The product line teams have worked diligently on overall 26% operating margin performance target and to execute on the operating expense control programs, while yet still investing in R&D for future drivers of growth. The HPMS segment is now performing solidity above 27% within the operating margin model we had targeted. The Standard Product segment is slowly beginning to recover, and we have confidence of its return to expected performance levels. We are very confident in achieving our overall company margin targets, as Peter will highlight in a moment. Taken together, our performance translates into top line growth, better than industry peers, very good and improving operating profitability and stellar bottom line earnings growth. We believe our model will continue to deliver superior earnings growth. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Peter to review the financials in more detail. Peter?
Peter Kelly: Thank you, Rick. Good morning to everyone on today's call. Overall, we delivered a very good quarter. The main highlights being stronger-than-expected top line revenue growth, stronger-than-expected non-GAAP earnings, the continued pay down of our debt, as well as completing a debt transaction, which converted about $750 million of floating rate secure debt to fixed-rate unsecured debt, with a very attractive interest rate. Moving on to the specifics of the quarter, top line revenue was $1.188 billion, up 9.5% versus the first quarter, and above the midpoint of our guidance. We generated $540 million in non-GAAP gross profit, or 45.5% non-GAAP gross margin. This is about $46 million better sequentially when removing the one-time legal benefit we recorded in our first quarter results. Total operating expense was $285 million or 24% of revenue, an improvement of over 200 basis points versus the first quarter. During the quarter, we made excellent progress on the expense control programs we've previously highlighted, and we are clearly demonstrating the operating leverage in our model. We continue to invest in R&D. And although we stepped up our R&D investment, we were not able to rate it quite as much as originally planned. All in all, this resulted in non-GAAP operating profit of $256 million or 21.5%, about 50 basis points better than our guidance, and 200 basis points versus the first quarter. Again, normalizing for the one-time benefit realized in Q1. Let me now turn to the segment performance. Within our HPMS segment, revenue was $878 million or 13% versus the prior period, and approximately $15 million better than expected. HPMS non-GAAP gross profit was $472 million or 53.8%, and non-GAAP operating profit was $238 million or 27.1%. In our Standard Products segment, which to remind you, is now the combination of our General Purpose Logic and Discreet business, revenue was $281 million, up 1% sequentially and approximately $9 million below our target. Standard Product segment non-GAAP gross profit was $67 million or 23.8%, and non-GAAP operating profit was $26 million or 9.3%. The internal manufacturing issues we discussed on the last earnings call are largely resolved, and should have minimal impact in the second half of the year. Interest expense was $47 million, slightly better-than-expected, non-controlling interest was $18 million, about $1 million above the guidance and cash taxes were $9 million or about $3 million better than expected. Taken together, our non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.71, about $0.05 better than the midpoint of our guidance, as a result of better revenue and lower operating expenses. As a reminder, our non-GAAP earnings does not include stock-based compensation, which was $20 million for the quarter. Now I'd like to turn to the changes in our cash and debt. Our total debt at the end of the second quarter was $3.38 billion, down $59 million from the first quarter. During the quarter, we completed a $750 million unsecured note transaction and we used the net proceeds and cash on hand to repay both our $616 million 2016 secured floating rate term loan and our $243 million 2013 floating rate notes. The new bond carries a fixed interest rate of 3.75%, and is due in 2018. We've continued to see interest expense in the $185 million range this year, and are committed to our ongoing deleveraging programs. Cash at the end of the quarter was $569 million, down $26 million sequentially. And we exited the quarter with net debt of $2.8 billion, and a trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.2 billion, resulting in a net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio of 2.3x. I'm very pleased to say that we believe we should achieve our 2x leverage ratio exiting the year, which will be a significant milestone for the company. You will note we bought back 1.7 million shares at a cost of approximately $48 million or just over $28 per share during the quarter. Additionally, yesterday, a new 10 million share repurchase program was authorized. Consistent with our prior program, our repurchase efforts are primarily aimed at offsetting the dilution related to employee option exercises. Turning to working capital metrics, days of inventory were 104, a decrease of 7 days, and excluding the 3 deals for the restructuring of our fabs in Europe, is 93 days. Receivables days was 38, down 1 day, while payable days was 73, down 5 days, resulting in a cash conversion cycle of 69 days, a 3-day improvement from the prior quarter. Cash flow from operations was $160 million, and net CapEx was $46 million, resulting in $114 million in free cash flow or approximately 10% free cash flow margin. Now, I'd like to provide our outlook for the third quarter. Influencing our outlook again this quarter is strong demand due to company-specific design wins in multiple areas of our HPMS business. We currently anticipate product revenue to be in a range of up 4% to up 8% sequentially. At the midpoint of this range of 6% sequentially, we anticipate the following trends, all on a percentage point basis. Within our HPMS segment, we expect Identification revenues to be down low mid single digits. Within our Auto business, we expect revenue to be flat, so relatively strong, given normal seasonality. Within Infrastructure & Industrial, we expect revenue to be up in the low teens range, and we anticipate our Portable & Computing business to be up in the upper 20% range, as new mobile programs begin to ramp in earnest. Within our Standard Products segment, we anticipate mid single-digit sequential growth. We anticipate the combination of Manufacturing and Corporate and Other to be around $34 million. Taken together, total NXP revenue should be in a range of approximately $1.23 billion to $1.29 billion, or $1.26 billion at the midpoint, up about 6% sequentially. We expect non-GAAP gross profit to be about 46 at the midpoint, and we expect operating expenses to be about flat at 24% of revenue, though up in dollar terms, as we continue to invest in R&D and sales programs to support our ongoing and planned growth. Taken together, our guidance should translate into a non-GAAP operating profit in the range of $268 million to $288 million. Interest expense on our debt should be approximately $44 million, cash taxes roughly $7 million and non-controlling interest expense should be about $16 million. Stock-based compensation should be about $20 million, which is excluded from our guidance. Diluted share count should be about 258 million shares, depending on share price fluctuations. Taken together, this translates into non-GAAP earnings per share in a range of $0.78 to $0.86, or $0.82 per share at the midpoint of our guidance. Our 1/3 of housekeeping item in July, the Board of Directors of SMC, our joint venture wafer fab with TSMC, approved and distributed a special dividend in the amount of approximately $120 million. That is normal at this time of year. As a reminder, the joint venture is owned 62.5% by NXP, and 37.5% by TSMC, with the financials consolidating into NXP. The net result is our total cash balance has been reduced by approximately $46.5 million, to be cited in the third quarter. Finally, and before I move to my summary, I'd like to provide an update on our stated margin expansion programs. At this point in time, we're on track with both our margin improvement programs and our OpEx improvement plan. We are confident that in Q4, we will achieve our goal of exiting 2013 at 26% non-GAAP operating margin. In summary, a strong set of second quarter results, coupled with a strong outlook for the third quarter. Our revenue growth is clearly in excess of the market and is broad-based. We continue to generate significant cash and pay down debt, and will reach our debt to EBITDA target ahead of our plan by the end of 2013. Our earnings continue to improve, and the leverage in our model is being demonstrated with a 6% planned growth in revenue for the third quarter, driving a 16% growth in net income. With that, I'd now would like to turn it back to the operator and ask for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of John Pitzer.
John W. Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Wanted to ask a couple of questions around the margin profile for June, September and the full year reiteration. Just relative to the June quarter, it looks like you were slightly light of your guidance by our math, all due to Standard Products, so Peter, I'm kind of curious why you think Standard Products is now at a bottom and is going to improve from here? And specifically, relative to the forward September guide on gross margin, what's the expectation for standard product gross margin next quarter? And quite frankly, HPMS, given that a lot of the growth is coming from P&C, which tends to be lower gross margin, but op margin neutral?
Peter Kelly: I guess, a couple of things, John, you're right, in the quarter, we were a little bit lower than we expected at the gross margin level on the Standard Products segment. And it was, I think in Rick's notes, he mentioned that we were a little bit light on GPL revenue, which related to small phone and tablets. And that does tend to be a bit higher margin. So that's really what hits us for Q2. We really don't plan to guide our HPMS and Standard Products gross margin percent. But I think if you look back to kind of historic levels, there's no reason why a return to what we'd expect in Standard Products shouldn't drive probably 150 basis points improvement at the total NXP level on its own. You had a third question embedded in this one, or?
John W. Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: It was the idea of P&C driving a lot of the growth sequentially in the September quarter, tends to be lower margin business. Is that all offset by the strength in INI?
Richard L. Clemmer: It's a combination of things, John. So I think it's safe to say that we feel comfortable about the guidance for Q3, with the combination of P&C and INI. I think it's also important to point out that some operational issues we talked about over the last couple of quarters in GA, we have seen improvement. The actual financial improvement results is delayed a quarter, as you know, from our PII implication. So it doesn't actually show up in the bottom line results in the quarter as that performance improvement takes place.
John W. Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Perfect, guys, and this is my follow up. Peter, glad to hear you reiterate exiting the year at that 26% op margin target. It does imply a relatively healthy jump, Q3 to Q4, so I'm just curious, are there any sort of incremental OpEx cuts we get, Q3 to Q4, to help you achieve that target? Or why so confident in that target exiting the year?
Peter Kelly: Well, I think there's, kind of 2 sides of it, John, on gross margin, we highlighted the 3 general areas, we were working -- we're very, very confident in the way they are progressing. So I'm very comfortable with that. I do think Standard Products will recover. And you'll note, our gross margin guidance for the quarter is kind of 46% to 47% on the range. So I think a small pickup in Standard Products were delivering on the gross margin programs. And OpEx -- I'll be very honest, a lot depends on the mix. My assumption is, has been around 50% gross margin and 24% OpEx. If we were really dependent on the revenue mix, you could have a slightly weaker margin, maybe 49% and a bp, but if that happened, then OpEx would naturally be lower as well. But it's hard to say at this point. Q4 is still a long way away. But I'm quietly confident at that 26% there.
Operator: The next question comes from Vivek Arya.
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Good to see the strength in Infrastructure and Industrial. Rick, I'm wondering how should we think about it beyond Q3 on the one hand that is, expectations of all the China at the average, but on the other hand, comps are getting tougher after a strong Q2 and your guidance for Q3. So how is the level of visibility along some of these Infrastructure bids, and how much is the visibility into an inventory build, versus actual consumption?
Richard L. Clemmer: So we've been rather cautious in setting expectations specifically in our high-performance RF area, based on the ups and downs and the lack of predictability associated with those demands. What we see is that definitely some of the customers are beginning to prepare with some initial orders, to ensure that they can meet the requirements of the ramp up. But when that actually gets shipped is very inconsistent, to say the best, over a period of time. So we still plan that business fairly conservatively. And we're not counting on huge upticks immediately based on that. But based on the demand that we see from our customers, we feel comfortable associated with the outlook that we're talking about.
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And the other thing, just how should we think about seasonality, then, in Q4? Because you also have other, very strong growth in your P&C segment, ID is also seeing very strong growth. Last year also, you had a couple of very good quarter than somewhat more of a seasonal outlook in Q4. So how should we think about seasonality this year, as you look at all the demand drivers?
Jeff Palmer: Yes, Vivek, this is Jeff. As you know, our view of seasonality is, there's no real magic here. When you look at our backward looking revenue that we posted, we take a median value over the past 3 years. And if you look at INI in the last number of years, it's stronger in Q2 and in Q3, a little weaker in Q4, but not substantial. So I don't think if there's anything magical we can give you insight, in terms of seasonality on that.
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: One last question, on -- just on Standard Product gross margin, I think you mentioned that a couple of the issues had been resolved and the main weakness right now was just on the GPL side. It's impacted some of the smartphone ramps. So other than the mix issue, is there anything else that we should be worried about, whether it's a pricing issue or any other issue that would prevent improvement in standard product gross margins?
Richard L. Clemmer: No, I don't think so. I think, we're seeing a little bit of the pricing kind of, like we did last year, in Standard Products, where we saw the -- per significant decline in Q1, and then a little more stabilization, we were a little bit gun shy about where we would see that this year, but I think we've seen some of that more stabilization in Q2 or at least starting by the middle of Q2, I would say. So no, I think that we feel pretty comfortable relative to the guidance that we've given out, associated with Standard Products.
Peter Kelly: There's one thing to remind you also, remember, in our business model, the effects of improved utilization are seen 1 quarter afterwards. So as you saw in our results, utilization did go up in Q2, which is primarily in the Standard Products area. The effects of that will flow through the P&L and we've seen in Q3 and beyond. So if the issues that we had in our manufacturing facility are largely behind us, and the utilization's improving, we feel very confident in Standard Products getting back to where it's operated in the past.
Richard L. Clemmer: And now, by the way, the performance associated is well above all the competitors in that space, and even the performance that we demonstrated with the weakness associated with it, still [indiscernible] that one of the best performing Standard Products business in the industry.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of James Covello.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I guess, first question, relative to the model that you've all laid out many times, the $5 billion in revenues, $4 in EPS, first, assuming there's no change to that model, and then second, we're at that revenue run rate now in the September quarter, the quarterly revenue run rate that would get us to the $5 billion, and we're at $0.82 in EPS, could you give us the bridge chart that would walk us from the $0.82 in EPS, to the dollar in EPS going forward?
Peter Kelly: Well I guess, first of all, I do believe we can get the $4 EPS. And the bridge is pretty simple, Jim, you just have to get to 26% EBIT.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Well, I mean, I guess, how much of it -- is it just all that? It doesn't have anything to do with interest expense? It's just all EBIT?
Peter Kelly: You come in here, you can work out the math, it's pretty straightforward. The key thing for us as a company, is generate 26% EBIT. We're already starting to throw out lots of cash, we'll throw out even more cash, interest rate -- interest costs come down pretty dramatically. And you get the full dollars pretty fast. So, I mean, of anything, can feel more confident now than I did last September.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: That's great. And then from a follow-up perspective, and I've asked this question to you guys several times over the years, including at that analyst meeting where you originally laid out the model. Given the choice between faster revenue growth and lower gross margins, you've said in the past you would take any business, even if it were lower gross margins that was operating profit dollar accretive, does that continue to be the model, and therefore should people maybe worry a little bit less about your gross margins, and focus a little bit more on the operating profit?
Richard L. Clemmer: Absolutely. I mean, what we've talked about all along, is that we're trying to drive bottom-line EBIT result, that deliver cash below free cash flow for the business. And we've said that we have ups and takes on product mix, on gross margin, and really, the key focus should be driving the bottom line EBIT results, which is what we're focused on, and what we're driving associated with it. So looking at the OpEx and the gross margin, our indicators about how we're going to get to that, but the bottom line is, we're very focused on driving the 26% EBIT, and being able to continue to make progress associated with that. It will continue to generate the significant free cash flow that will generate, going forward, that will continue to pay down our debt and be very accretive on an earnings basis. When you look at the backward earnings since our IPO, we've had about a 56% compounded growth in earnings. And you look at the opportunity to continue to drive well above anybody else in the industry, forward earnings growth.
Peter Kelly: Yes, I remember our conversation well, Jim. And I think we have a choice between significant revenue growth in excess of what the market sees, and 26% EBIT. I'll take that every time, as opposed to 28%, 29%, 30% and very low revenue growth. So we think a high revenue growth business with 26% EBIT would just drive massive value to our shareholders.
Operator: The next question comes from Blaine Curtis.
Mark Kelley - Barclays Capital, Research Division: This is Mark Kelley on for Blaine. The first question I have is about your Authentication business, it sounds like maybe it's pushed out a little bit. So my question is, are you still expecting to get the same share or has something else changed, any color there would be helpful.
Richard L. Clemmer: Yes, so we're still very excited about our Authentication business. Like, any time you have a new business, it's fundamentally a new core technology. It takes, either it will be faster or slower than what you planned, relative to the ramp up associated with it. While we're really encouraged on some of the activities that we have going on in cybersecurity, some of the opportunities to provide a more secure solution in access to the cloud did -- would not require the -- are that would be much more powerful than the current password protection that we all use, and some of the opportunities for authentication on products, we still are just as encouraged about the opportunities there. And in fact, to see it as maybe even larger than we did 3 or 4 quarters ago. But the ramp up, specifically associated with some of those programs, is not quite as rapid as we had originally envisioned. But no real indication of anything. And in fact, we think the strength we have, the unique security expertise that we bring, is still well-positioned to be able to provide a secure access to the cloud. Authenticating your access to the cloud will be a major factor in cybersecurity protection.
Peter Kelly: And Mark -- just to reiterate Mark's question, no share loss, at least this is really just a slower take off of a new business for us.
Jeff Palmer: Exactly. Mark, do you have a follow-up?
Mark Kelley - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I do. I guess, in terms of inventory levels, by geography, are there any areas that you think are more lean than others, any color you guys have would be helpful.
Richard L. Clemmer: It turned out specifically, as it relates to the distribution channel?
Mark Kelley - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Yes.
Richard L. Clemmer: Yes, I think that, clearly in Asia, I think there's a little less inventory, it's obviously, different levels by each one of our distribution partners, and some less, and some more. But I think there's probably a lower level of inventory, more on the Asian side, than the rest of the world. And that's clearly one of the areas that we're trying to work with our distribution partners on getting to the appropriate level of inventory, to be able to support the decrease in future demand that we see growing up. And I should be very specific, probably, our revenue guidance at the midpoint doesn't have a lot of increase in distribution inventory reflected in that. Although it would have a little bit of an increase in the low level that we ran in the most recent quarters, the 2.2 months in the high end of the range of revenue.
Operator: The next question comes from Chris Caso.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Maybe just to start, just on order of clarification. As you look into the fourth quarter operating margin guidance, it does seem that, in getting to that number, it would suggest a good increase in gross margins. Is the right interpretation of that, as you said previously, there's a quarter lag between the increases in production and the impact on gross margins, is that the explanation for what we're likely to see in Q4?
Peter Kelly: No, what we talked about previously, Chris, is there's 3 big programs we're working on. One's related to our wafer pricing. I mean, not literally just pricing, but some costs associated with wafers and other parties associated with basic blocking and tackling, including gold to copper conversions and the like. And the third relates to our IP portfolio. Clearly, there is a benefit from Q3 to Q4 -- sorry, Q2 to Q3 on utilization. But I would not expect a significant benefit from Q3 to Q4 on utilization.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay, so it's mainly on the cost side and on the addition of IP revenue in the portfolio that benefits the gross margin in Q4?
Peter Kelly: Yes, exactly what we talked about previously.
Jeff Palmer: Keeping our OpEx under control, it's a target.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: And just as a follow-up then, you talked about, you didn't have a significant inventory restocking at distribution in your third quarter guidance. But I guess, if the conditions continue, what sort of signals are you getting back from your distributors at this point? And I guess, at what point would the distributors be forced to put on a little additional inventory? And I guess, in conjunction with that, what sort of visibility do you have, as the inventory levels of your customers?
Peter Kelly: I guess, a couple of things. On distribution, I think one of the things with distribution, when you're growing as rapidly as we are, it's sometimes not easy to keep the channel to stop those the way you would like. So we would see some movements from quarter-to-quarter. I don't think we are seeing the, and maybe Rick would like to comment, I don't think we're really seeing the channel or end customers having too much or too little inventory at this point in time, it seems it's pretty balanced.
Richard L. Clemmer: No, I think that's a good point, I mean you got to remember that all of our Automotive customers basically is a vendor-managed inventory, which is owned slight [ph] for them, so as far as they're concerned, that's at a very reasonable level. As we look at supporting the smartphone and tablet customers, that's very hand to mouth, associated with it. I guess, the one area that we've been ramping, and was a significant ramp of our revenue in Q2 was specifically associated with the contact with banking to support China. There clearly -- better ramp of the pipeline associated with it. And at some point in time, we'll see that come to more of a normalized run rate associated with it. But that's the only area at all where I think there was really a huge supply chain, we're calling it, not replenishment, but establishment, and that kind of gets lost a little bit in the rounding, but it's a factor in the guidance that we set for our ID business, which is down slightly for Q3 on a sequential basis.
Operator: The next question comes from Steve, sorry, Steve Smigie.
Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Rick, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about potential growth drivers as we look out to 2014 for the ID business? And specifically, wanted to inquire about say, the Banking Card business there, and the Transit business. For the Banking Card business, does it take a ramp in say, U.S., chip and PIN banking cards to make that business grow, or are there other things that are more likely to be the driver in 2014? And for the transit, are there the specific programs that you have sort to be getting indications on now, in order for that to get it sort of typical growth rates for next year?
Richard L. Clemmer: So I think our ID business, with the broad portfolio of applications, everything as you say from the transit side to the mobile wallets to the contactless banking to PIN chip for U.S. or North America with the implementation associated with it, and also, we continue to be very excited about the cybersecurity protection associated with it. We feel very confident in the growth of our ID business having double-digit growth. Specifically, the China banking, contactless banking, has been a real opportunity for us, and has driven a lot of our growth over the last couple of quarters, been a significant contributor to that growth. But we see that still growing. We see that still being a significant position, where we've really been able to facilitate that transition in that market, and play a key leadership role in driving that. And what we are seeing, is now more and more interest as we go to mobile payment for people to begin to look at adding MIFARE and fare collection on to mobile phones to be able to accomplish that. So again, that just provides additional opportunities associated with a ramp up with our unique proprietary leadership technology, that we do license to other people as well. So I think there's a multitude of platforms that will continue to give us the confidence in our growth in our ID business. And we look forward to continuing to see the double-digit growth, not only next year, but for the next few years. And you have a follow-up?
Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Yes, just to drill down on your answer there a little bit, so on the mobile wallet that you mentioned, with the MIFARE, is that mostly going to be come in the form of some sort of licensing, or you end up on a solution where you are included separately, even maybe from just a semiconductor solution? And then, specifically on handsets too, is it still seem likely to you that, that even if maybe your Radio business wasn't as strong for NFC that the secure element portion of that still looks like on its own, could ramp pretty nicely next year?
Richard L. Clemmer: Yes, so MIFARE could be in the form of licensing, it could be in the form of shipment, so it would be in the form of both, I think that the fact that there is excitement about the usage of smartphones is a key factor. So we could deliver that in either way. I think the key thing for us in the mobile wallet is, we had seen the integrative radio be pushed out in time. And with our next-generation of product, that we're just beginning to ship, we see increased performance associated with that, so that we see the potential for discrete solution to potentially have longer life than we would have anticipated a year or so ago. And with that, with the increased technology that we have in this next generation of products, bringing a better consumer use and improved levels of security, we think is really key associated with that. So even though the consolidation of the radio is ultimately going to take place in the connectivity chip, we see the opportunity for us to continue to play in the mobile wallet space in a significant fashion, as we go forward for the next year, 1.5 years. Certainly, the next 6 to 8 quarters.
Jeff Palmer: And Steve, I'm just going add to that, to Rick's comment, is if you look for proof points in Rick's prepared remarks, we talked about being awarded over 300 SKUs, which go across the handset and other consumer products. So I think, companies are looking at who has the best technology from a security perspective, what companies have the best radio performance, who has the best interoperability, and I think they're coming back to NXP and our design win momentum continues to reflect that.
Richard L. Clemmer: And this is all about the security side, and it's about the ability to deliver that bulletproof security and that's where we think we do the best.
Operator: The next question comes from Ross Seymore.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Just following on, on that ID side of things, clearly quite different performances between your core in emerging in the June quarter, as we kind of expected with what's going on the handset side. Any color you can provide on those subsegments within your down slightly guide for the third quarter? And really, what I'm trying to get at is, where is the base on the emerging side, where either the inventory correction and/or seasonality comes into play and normalizes?
Richard L. Clemmer: Well, I think as we set the guidance, it's a reflection of 2 things, #1, as I've talked about, the pipeline that we've been filling up significantly, in the China contact was thinking, at some point in time, we'll see that ease off a little bit, Ross, to go to a steady run-rate as we get that supply-chain really filled. But to be fair, there are some of individual government programs that had pushed out in time, and is reflected, as governments looking where they're spending their dollars, so we still see the same opportunity for electronic passports, electronic ID cards that it's may be pushed out a little bit in time. And that's reflected in our view as well. So I think it's a combination of all of those, that says, we're going to be slightly down in Q3 timeframe. But still, feel very comfortable with the double-digit growth for that business as we look forward, Ross.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: And I guess as my follow-up, one for you Peter, you guys have done a great job on the balance sheet management, you're confident that you're going to exit this year at your 2x levered targets, versus that 1 85 interest expense that I think you guided to for the full year this year, any sort of at least directional help on what you would expect your priorities to be for 2014 on that same metric, please?
Peter Kelly: Well, I guess a couple of things. Obviously, guiding 44 for the next quarter, I would say 4x that number would be lower than 1 85. But the direction is definitely lower, Ross, with -- in the middle of looking at our 2014 forecast. So it's difficult to say at this point exactly how much lower. We have one big chunk of debt we're really interested in, the 9 3/4, but it's, the breakage cost on that is just so, so high, it doesn't make sense right now. I'm sure we'll go after that early in 2014 and that help us on the interest comp result.
Operator: The next question comes from Harlan Sur.
Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: As you mentioned, another leg to the margin improvement was to be able to monetize the broad IP portfolio. I think your target is to generate about $10 million per quarter in recurring revenue starting in Q4. I know these negotiations can be tough. So how confident is the team around being able to note secure and close some of these licensing deals in or before the fourth quarter of this year, and then to drive that sustainable run rate on a go forward basis?
Richard L. Clemmer: Well, Harlan, as you and I both know, there's no guarantees associated with that, because that's up to a negotiation process associated with it. I think the fact is, is that we've been investing in this area, and driving this for an extended period of time. We have Wall Streets in place, taking place. So we are very optimistic about the ability to drive the income from the intellectual property side. But to be fair, things can happen with core systems, et cetera. But I think we have all of the actions laid out to be able to accomplish that, and we just have to be sure that we follow through, and we're able to execute within the boundaries of the core systems and the negotiations with the third parties to be able to support that, but we're very confident, associated with it.
Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And then, on the Automotive side, you mentioned the launch of a new entertainment-focused program with a new customer. Is this focused around your car radio, software-defined radio, Telematics product offerings? And how much proliferation are you getting with this new customer across their portfolio?
Richard L. Clemmer: So it's broad-based. I think it's as we've said before, we now are the technology provider of choice for 27 of the 28, near the high-end car radios associated with it. So I would say that our technology has really become the technology solution of choice in those mid and high end car radios. And this is really the ramp-up of 2 or 3 of those design wins that we had won, a couple of years ago, that we're seeing the shipments associated with moving forward. So we continue to make great progress in that area. But the position we have there is extremely solid, and we'll continue to grow our revenue. And it's one of the reasons that allowed us to become the #1 semiconductor supplier shipping into China in 2012, with the recent industry reports that came out.
Operator: The next question comes from Bill Stein.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: I'm hoping to dig into the prioritization of cash use once you hit 2x net leverage. We had, perhaps some indication with the new buyback authorization. It would seem that buyback at around these levels would perhaps be more accretive than even taking out the 9 3/4, can you give us an update in that area of the business, please?
Peter Kelly: Well, I think, what we said is, once we get to 2x trailing 12-month EBITDA, we'll review our options and do whatever is best for our shareholders. I mean, clearly, we believe that the current stock price were significantly undervalued. So Rick might shoot me for saying this, but I think if we get to the end of the year and our stock price is still $33, my guess, is it would make a lot more sense for shareholders to buy back stock than continue paying down debt. But I think we need to get there first, and then decide what we do.
Richard L. Clemmer: Yes, I think it's very clear that we have our goal to be able to achieve the low 2x annualized EBITDA from a debt position. And then what we've said is, is we're going to do whatever we believe is in the best interest of our shareholders in driving additional shareholder value.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: And then 1 follow-up if I can, again on the ID segment. I'm going to go there as well. I think there's been some pretty widely discussed growth opportunities in the U.S. for chip and PIN, relative to the EMV initiative. Do you still see that? What's perhaps, what's your visibility into demand driven by that initiative?
Richard L. Clemmer: We still have discussions, and are supporting that process. I know that the credit card companies had set specific metrics or they will raise the fees that they charge, if there's not the PIN and chip implementation. So I think the key factor that takes effect is, if you look at the implementation in Europe with the PIN chip, the fraud rates are in order of magnitude below what they are in the U.S., where there's just the magnetic strip associated with it. So I think there's going to be -- continue to be an effort, probably the most near term will be associated with Canada, but pretty rapidly followed by North America. So we continue to see an opportunity, that's out over the next few years, not the next few quarters, to be quite fair, associated with it. But it's still a strong growth opportunity associated with our ID business.
Operator: The next question comes from Vijay Rakesh.
Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Just a question on the 4Q guidance, you said operating margin expanding nicely by 400 bps. Do you expect to see that improvement come about 50-50 from gross margins and OpEx?
Peter Kelly: Well, I didn't say. And to be honest, I didn't really -- I'm not into guiding the fourth quarter. What I'm saying is that, we expect we'll deliver 26% EBIT. But I don't want to get into how much is revenue, how much is margin and how much is OpEx at this point in time, we normally only give you a 1 quarter view.
Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: On the license side, I know you're expecting a pick up there, is that something you'll break out, going forward? And how does the pipeline there look, I mean, I should look at 24 game [indiscernible] expect to see, expect to add more guys on the licensing side?
Peter Kelly: We've not disclosed that. And I guess, we've not decided what we will do at this point.
Richard L. Clemmer: Yes, I mean our -- what we've said is, is it should be able to create basically 100 bps of our margin enhancement, and we feel pretty good about the ability to be able to accomplish that for Q4 as well as 2014.
Jeff Palmer: So we will take one last caller, please.
Operator: The next question comes from Mark Lipacis.
Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Most broad-based suppliers saw increase in days at their distributors, and I was wondering if you could help us reconcile while yours -- while you saw yours, sound like yours went down?
Peter Kelly: I think it's because our revenue has grown faster than our competition, basically.
Richard L. Clemmer: I think [indiscernible] because our dollars were flat quarter-to-quarter, our reduction from 2.4 to 2.2 months of inventory was basically as a result of the numerator increasing. So they weren't able to put inventory in place at a sufficient run rate to be able to maintain inventory levels that we think would be appropriate.
Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Fair enough, and could you talk about lead times to your customers, what they did during the quarter?
Richard L. Clemmer: So you know it's really mixed, to be fair. Because a lead time is, it's hard to have a blanket lead time associated with it, with lead times that vary across the board. I would say that we did see some areas where lead times edged up a little bit. But not anything that would be a significant material change.
Jeff Palmer: Thank you. Well, I think that will be the end of the call today. I'd like to pass it over to Rick in case there's any closing remarks you'd like to make, Rick?
Richard L. Clemmer: Yes. Thanks a lot for your interest. We're very pleased with the performance that we delivered in Q2. The ability to continue to drive double-digit growth in revenue and make good, solid bottom-line profits. And with our HPMS business now performing within our operating income model that we've established, it gives us the confidence and the ability to point to actual results to demonstrate the value of the strategy that we put in place. As we look forward, we continue to be very optimistic about continuing to drive significant EPS growth and outgrowing market from a top line revenue. So thanks a lot for your interest, and we appreciate your support.
Peter Kelly: Thank you very much, everyone.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This includes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Good day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the NXP Semiconductors First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shequana, and I will be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Jeff Palmer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.
Jeff Palmer: Thank you, Shequana, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the NXP Semiconductors First Quarter 2013 earnings call. With me on the call today is Rick Clemmer, NXP's President and CEO; and Peter Kelly, our CFO. If you've not obtained a copy of our first quarter 2013 earnings press release, it can be found in our company website under the Investor Relations section at nxp.com. Additionally, we have posted a supplemental earnings summary presentation and a document of our historical financials to assist in your modeling efforts. Both of these documents and including today's press release will reflect our recently announced product reclassification. This call is being recorded and will be available for replay from our corporate website. Please be reminded that this call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause NXP's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the macroeconomic impact on the specific end markets in which we operate, the sale of new and existing products and our expectations for financial results for the second quarter 2013. Please be reminded that NXP undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements. For a full disclosure on forward-looking statements, please refer to our press release. Additionally, during our call today, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the impact of purchase price accounting, restructuring, stock-based compensation impairment and other charges that are driven primarily by discrete events that management does not consider to be directly related to NXP's underlying core operating performance. Pursuant to Regulation G, NXP has provided reconciliations on the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our first quarter 2013 press release, which will be furnished to the SEC on Form 6-K and is available on NXP's website in the Investor Relations section at nxp.com. Before we begin the call today, I'd like to highlight our attendance at the following upcoming conferences. We'll be attending the Jefferies 2013 Global TMT Conference on May 17 in New York City.

We'll also be attending Barclay's 2013 Global TMT Conference on May 22 in New York City and the BofA Merrill Lynch Global TMT Conference on June 4 in San Francisco. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Rick.
Richard L. Clemmer: Thanks, Jeff, and welcome to our earnings call today. We are again quite pleased with the revenue performance we had in Q1, following our strong performance in 2002. Our product revenue was $1.06 billion, a 15% increase from a year ago, while being down 2% sequentially and at the top end of the guidance we issued. Total NXP revenue during the quarter was $1.09 billion, a 3% sequential decline, an 11% increase from the comparable year ago period. Overall, our first quarter profit was better than we expected with a clear contribution coming from the release of a legal provision after a favorable decision and an outstanding legal dispute. Looking at the market, overall, our macro view is similar to what we discussed with you in January. We are yet to see an economic rebound but only spots of order recovery and the lack of the confirmed sustained recovery, combining with the computing market showing secular weakness. The market environment is a factor in driving weakness in the profitability of our Standard Products segment. However, our strong market positions in HPMS, in Identification, Automotive, basestations, as well as company-specific design wins in mobility supports our belief that we should again outgrow the market in 2013 with improved profitability. Looking at the results for the first quarter of 2013, we can clearly see this trend demonstrated. The positives include the revenue performance of our HPMS segment, which delivered a stronger-than-expected quarter, primarily driven by Identification and some OEM order recovery in Automotive. Additionally, we have had the positive settlement in our legal dispute, which resulted in onetime benefit of $43 million. The challenge in the quarter was clearly our Standard Products segment, which had a lackluster quarter in revenue, as we had projected, but much worse-than-expected profitability. Turning now to our segment performance. HPMS revenue was $776 million, a 20% increase versus the same period a year ago, although a 1% decline versus the prior quarter and 2 percentage points above our original expectations. The continued performance in this focus area of our business is clearly encouraging. Our identification business continues to perform very well, with new areas contributing to the growth. Revenue was $300 million, up 3% sequentially and up 60% year-on-year. This was above our original expectations for the quarter, driven by our strength in contactless banking in developing countries, but is also a reflection of NXP's overall leadership and the dynamic growth opportunity the security market offers. Within our core ID business, revenue was up nearly 4%, driven by the continued strong demand for contactless banking products in Asia, offset by slight declines in the transportation in eGovernment, while tax and labor trends were flattish. Core ID represents approximately 70% -- 75% of overall ID. Within emerging ID, revenue was up nearly 3%, driven by flattish sales of mobile transaction products, offset by early revenue from authentication products. During the quarter, we announced our next-generation of secure elements, the SmartMX2, the industry's first secure microcontroller to be awarded the common criteria EAL-6 security designation by the German BSI. The SmartMX2 builds on our industry-leading chip platform, the SmartMX, of which we have shipped over 1 billion devices to date. The SmartMX2 adds the physically uncloneable function, or PUF, which uses an innovative way of safeguarding individual chips from data theft by using the unique fingerprint inherent in every semiconductor device to protect its encryption key, thus making it very hard to clone or reverse engineer and compromise security of the device. Now turning to our Automotive business. Revenue was $230 million, up 1% sequentially and flat versus the year-ago period. This was somewhat better than our original expectations, reflecting improved OEM order rates. During the quarter, we achieved several milestones within our auto group. First, we signed a strategic collaboration with Delphi, a partner of our auto group for over 20 years. As part of this agreement, Delphi demonstrated its long-term commitment to NXP by selecting our SAF775x family, the industry's first single-chip RF CMOS multi-tuner car radio IC and NXP's AM/FM background tuner. Additionally, Delphi continues to be at the forefront of using NXP's software-defined radio for digital reception, such as the SAF36XX family. Secondly, during the quarter, we achieved the 100-million-unit shipment milestone for our TEF66XX auto radio tuner family, which is now on low IF AM/FM single tuner with optional integrated RDS support. Of note, JVC KENWOOD, a leading car radio OEM and the very first customer to start mass production with this project, has taken shipment of 30 million units. Lastly, we signed a joint collaborative agreement with Cisco Systems to invest in Cohda Wireless, a leading specialist in wireless communication for automotive safety applications. This agreement is recognition by Cisco of our leadership in the emerging market for car-to-car and car-to-infrastructure communications. NXP and Cohda Wireless have built a market-ready, flexible, wireless communications solution for onboard units based on Cohda's existing advance radio and NXP's market-proven, software-defined radio technology. This makes it a key element to connect to Cisco's vision of ubiquitous and highly secure Internet of everything. Now turning to our Industrial & Infrastructure business. Revenue was $153 million, seasonally down 6% sequentially but up 6% versus the prior year. This was in line with our expectations of no real increased demand from the basestation OEMs. Additionally, we're excited with the design win opportunities we are seeing for our audio amplifier business. Portable & Computing business, which now excludes revenue from GPL, which has more of the characteristics of our Standard Products segment revenue was $93 million, down 12% sequentially, but up 9% from the year-ago period, in line with our original expectations. The decline in our mobile design wins is below our original expectations, but we do anticipate a rebound combined with the new MCU opportunity to reaccelerate growth in the second half of the year. Turning to our Standard Products segment. Revenue was $279 million, down 3% sequentially and up 2% versus the year-ago period. This was slightly worse than our original expectations, and we believe a reflection of the overall weak environment. In this area, overall market pricing is aggressive and remains a challenge for the segment. Turning now to our distribution channel performance. Total NXP sales into and out of distribution were flat on a sequential basis. On hand inventory in the channel was essentially unchanged on a dollar basis. And we continue to operate the channel at 2.4 months of supply on hand, consistent with the levels we've been running for some time. Although there clearly are different levels of inventory by different businesses. In summary, despite unacceptable performance in our Standard Products segment, we had good results for the first quarter with our HPMS segment, performing better than expected. We believe our HPMS segment business will continue to demonstrate revenue strength and improved profitability through the year. And getting Standard Products profitability back on track is clearly a focus priority. Now I'll turn the call over to Peter to discuss the quarterly financials in more detail.
Peter Kelly: Thanks, Rick, and good morning to everyone on today's call. Before I start, I'd like to mention that we recently announced that we have changed our segment reporting, and that we'll also be excluding stock-based comp from our non-GAAP reporting as we move forward. We made the segment reporting changes to better reflect the underlying trends in our business, our gross -- sorry, General Purpose Logic business line clearly has more in common, both from a gross margin and a go-to-market strategy with our Standard Products business than with our HPMS business. And our software business is used in support of our mobile business. Clearly, the GPL move is the much bigger change of the 2. Now we've also decided to exclude stock-based comp from our non-GAAP numbers. We'll continue to give you full visibility on the impact of this, but believe this change will give you a better view of the underlying performance of our business, as well as make this more directly comparable with key peers. Finally, as this is a transition quarter, I will try to bridge between the old reporting and the new reporting to ensure you have the opportunity to understand what is happening. And I'll also try and anticipate some of the more obvious questions. Hopefully, I'm not confused anymore, and I apologize in advance if I appear to be spoonfeeding obvious data. Overall, we delivered a good quarter, reflecting better top line revenue trends than originally expected. We delivered non-GAAP earnings of $0.72, continue to pay down debt, as well as completing 2 debt transactions, which convert at about $1 billion of floating rate secured debt to fixed rate unsecured debt. And now turning to the specifics of the quarter. Top line revenue was $1.085 billion, down 3% versus the fourth quarter, but at the top end of our guidance. We generated $537 million in non-GAAP gross profit of 49.5% non-GAAP gross margin. During the quarter, an ongoing legal dispute was resolved in our favor, which resulted in a $43.5 million net benefit to cost of goods. Excluding the onetime benefit, non-GAAP gross profit was 45.5%, which was below our target due to several items in our Standard Products segment, which I'll discuss in a moment. Total operating expenses was $289 million or about $2.5 million better than our original guidance, excluding $16 million in stock option expense, including in operating expenses. This resulted in non-GAAP operating profit of $255 million or 23.5%. So let me turn to the segment performance. Within our HPMS segment, revenue was $776 million, down 1% versus the prior period, but approximately $14 million better than our target. HPMS non-GAAP gross profit was $465 million or 59.9%. Our non-GAAP operating profit was $229 million or 29.5%, 520 basis points higher sequentially. Excluding the $43.5 million one-off onetime legal dispute, HPMS non-GAAP gross profit would've been 54.3%, 20 basis points lower than the prior quarter. In our Standard Products segment, which is now the combination of our General Purpose Logic and discrete businesses, revenue was $279 million, down 3% sequentially and approximately $8 million below our target. Standard Products segment non-GAAP gross profit was $73 million, or 26.2%, about $18 million or 6.5 -- sorry, 650 basis points below our target. While revenue in the Logic business was a bit lower than expected, gross profit fall-through was essentially as we expected. Within our Standard Products business, about half the impact of gross margin was due to poor product mix and a tougher pricing environment. The remaining shortfall was due to poor operational performance, with lower absorption than planned and a slower ramp up in our factories, following the quality issues reported in Q4 and a slower return to work in our factories, following the Chinese New Year. We are diligently working to address the issues within our control but do not expect an immediate improvement in the business. Standard Products segment non-GAAP operating profit was $28 million or 10%. Interest expense was $49 million, slightly better than expected. Noncontrolling interest was $13 million, in line with our guidance, and cash taxes were $7 million or $2 million, better than expected. Taken together, our non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.72, of which about $0.17 was due to the legal dispute benefit and about $0.07 was stock-based compensation. Net of these items, earnings per share was $0.49 per share, which was in line with the midpoint of our guidance. Now I'd like to turn to the changes in our cash and debt. Our total debt to the end of the first quarter was $3.44 billion, down $52 million from the fourth quarter. During the quarter, we completed 2 $500 million unsecured note transactions using the proceeds to pay -- to repay $962 million in secured floating rate term loans. Both of the new bonds carry fixed interest of 5.75% and are due in 2021 and 2023 respectively. While the refinancing actions do not materially change our expense outlook, they do derisk and extend our debt maturity profile. And we continue to see interest expense in the $195 million range this year and are committed to our deleveraging programs. Cash at the end of the quarter was $595 million down $22 million sequentially. We exited the quarter with net debt of $2.8 billion on a trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA of $1.2 billion, resulting in a net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio of 2.4x. You will note that we bought back 1.1 million shares at a cost of $35 million. I want to assure you that we're still very much focused on paying down our debt, but to the extent that we receive proceeds from the exercise options, we will use these receipts to offset any dilution. You will also note that our overall non-GAAP fully diluted share count increased from 254 million for the fourth quarter to 257.8 million shares for the first quarter. This reflects the almost 25% increase in the average share price of NXP from Q4 to Q1. Turning to our working capital metrics. Days of inventory were 111, an increase of 7 days. Receivable days were 39, up 1 day, while payable days was 78, down 4 days, resulting in a cash conversion cycle of 72 days, up 12 days from the prior quarter and reflecting seasonably lower revenue in Q1 and planned revenue growth in Q2. Cash flow from operations was $119 million, and net CapEx was $39 million, resulting in a $80 million -- resulting in $80 million of free cash flow or approximately 7% free cash flow margin. Now I'd like to provide our outlook for the second quarter. Influencing our outlook is strong demand due to company-specific design wins in multiple areas of our HPMS business. We currently anticipate product revenue to be in the range of up 6% to up 12% sequentially. At the midpoint of this range, of 9% sequentially, we anticipate the following trends, all on a percentage point basis. Within our HPMS segment, we expect Identification revenue to be up in the low double-digit range. Within our Automotive business, we expect revenue to be up in the single-digit range. Within Infrastructure & Industrial business, we expect revenues to be up in the low teens range. And we anticipate in our Portable & Computing business to be up about 10%. Within our Standard Products segment, we anticipate low- to mid-single digit sequential growth. We anticipate the combination of manufacturing and Corporate and Other to be around $26 million. And taken together, total NXP revenues should be in the range of approximately $1.15 billion to $1.21 billion, or $1.179 billion at the midpoint, up about 9% sequentially. We expect non-GAAP gross profit to be about 46%. We expect operating expenses to increase by about $10 million and to be about $300 million, plus or minus $5 million as we plan to accelerate certain development investments within ID to continue to reinforce our market leadership position. Taken together, our guidance should into a non-GAAP operating profit in the range of $237 million to $258 million. Interest expense on our debt should be approximately $48 million, cash taxes roughly $12 million and noncontrolling interest expense should be about $17 million. Stock-based compensation should be about $20 million, which is excluded from our guidance. Diluted share count should be about 259 million shares, depending on share price fluctuations. Taken together, this translates into earnings per share of $0.62 to $0.70, or $0.66 per share at the midpoint of our guidance range. Clearly, our profit and EPS guidance is below where we would've liked it to be, given our improvement in the sequential revenue growth. We are very comfortable with the performance of our HPMS business, but our Standard Products business is at a tough quarter. And we believe, at this point, it's responsible not to forecast the snapback in Q2. Finally, I'm sure you'll be wondering what the status is of our goal of exiting 2013 at 25% EBIT. Clearly, I don't want to give guidance for Q4. However, I would like to say the following. Firstly, the exclusion of stock-based comp is not part of our plan to get to 25%. Without stock-based compensation, the comparable number is 26%. Secondly, our HPMS business is clearly on track with what we've discussed in the recent past. I believe that our Standard Products team can get their profitability back on track during 2013, so we feel no reason to back off our goal. I'd like to now turn it back over to your questions. Jeff?
Jeff Palmer: Shequana, could we poll for Q&A please?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes on the line of John Pitzer, representing Credit Suisse.
John W. Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Peter, I'm sorry if I missed this, but did you tell us how much General Purpose Logic revenue got reclassified into Standard Products was about? $80 million to $85 million?
Peter Kelly: Yes, probably John, [ph] yes.
John W. Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And then in that bucket, can you help us understand a little bit better about what forces, you think, are driving such a weak pricing environment? And if -- could you help us understand how the gross margins you expect to trend sequentially in Standard Products in the June quarter? And then I have a follow-up.
Peter Kelly: Yes. So the -- what we're assuming is basically our gross margins in Standard -- the Standard Products segment will be about flat as we go from Q1 into Q2. So clearly, a tough quarter, but we had assumed that it would improve by about 300 basis points, and clearly it didn't. So the gap from where we expected it to be in Q1 was about $18 million. Now half of that was, let's say, market driven, and half, it was an internal issue. So the bit that was market driven, clearly, Standard Products has seen some impact from what's going on in the computing industry, in particular. But also, I had a pretty weak mix of products. Although we got there on revenue in terms of what we said, the actual mix of product that they shipped was much weaker than we originally planned. And they're just -- they're just not seen a very strong underlying -- let's call it, underlying semiconductor market at the moment. In terms of the issues we had internally, they were really around couple of things. I mentioned that we had a quality problem in one of our back ends during Q4. As we try to, or as we ramped our production back up in Q1, we decided to be quite conservative in how we brought our factory up and err on the side of caution. So the yields are not as good as we would like them to be. And the output's not as good as we'd like it to be. But we thought it's more important to ship our usual export levels of quality than make a compromise there. And do you think I can get that -- or we can get that back on track in the second half of 2013. But I just -- given what we said on the last call, I just thought it was -- it made more sense to be conservative and make sure we do have the opportunity to get it back on track without forecast and a big leap in performance.
John W. Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Guys, as my as follow-up, Rick, clearly for the last 3 or 4 quarters, you guys have been significantly outgrowing the industry, benefiting from some sort of -- from some company-specific product cycles. I'm kind of curious, as you think about the June guidance and the balance of the year, if you could give us some help understanding what inning you think we're in for some of those key products cycles, specifically, authentication, the microcontroller sensor hub and the emerging ID NFC business?
Richard L. Clemmer: Yes. We continue to believe that we can continue to outgrow the market by at least 50%. So we haven't backed off that at all. And I think, clearly, our performance over the last few quarters demonstrates that capability. And at least with what we've seen on guidance for the -- for Q2, it looks like we feel pretty good about continuing to be at that 50% greater than the industry. If you look at where we're at, a wide range of growth. I mean, clearly, on the microcontroller, on the sensor hub, that won't start shipping until midyear, so there's nothing in there. So it's kind of -- we're up to bat. I wouldn't call it an inning yet. But we're -- we feel good about the opportunity, but, clearly, no shipments yet whatsoever. In our ID business, our ID business continues to have strong double-digit growth. We continue to feel very good about that. One of the things that really gives us the strength is the diversity of our portfolio. While we may have some things that are slowing somewhat relative to the design wins or whatever, we have other items where we see a strong rebound or a strong growth coming in, which helps drive the overall double-digit growth consistently in our security business and really put us in a good solid position. So one of the key areas is authentication that we've talked about. It's kind of in the first inning. Have a really critical design win that's going through an internal ramp up with a service provider, so that they can confirm the actual benefits and capability. And then if we're successful with that, as we certainly believe we can be, represents a significant opportunity for us. In addition to that, we're seeing some real momentum in some of the device authentication beyond just the cybersecurity authentication to the cloud. So we feel good about the authentication side, but we're clearly in early innings. Maybe first inning, second inning, looking at it. In the case of NFC, we're probably in the second or third inning, something like that. I mean, clearly, the strength of the 100 million plus units we shipped in 2012 and continuing to move into 2013, we feel good about with what is it now, up to 200?
Peter Kelly: 150.
Richard L. Clemmer: 150 different handsets and tablets that have designed in our NFC product, and we continue to see continued momentum associated with that. And especially as we talk about the secure element and the opportunity it brings to the market, combined with the strong intellectual property portfolio that we had associated with NFC. So we're still, clearly, in early innings. When you start talking about the future, like in the 2015 timeframe, most of the analysts now are talking about half the smartphones being NFC-enabled by that point in time, so a lot of growth opportunities there. And really all of that combines and comes together to give us the comfort associated with the double-digit growth associated with our ID business. But we should also reflect on the fact that the most recent quarter was a 60% annual growth versus a year ago, so clearly, strong growth associated with that. And then, clearly, the opportunity in basestations, if the service providers ever get around to really expanding their quality of service where there isn't so many dropped calls, we think that it will continue to expand the CapEx investment. And with our design win, market share associated with 3G and LTE, it should put us in an excellent position associated with revenue increases associated with that as well, John.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis, representing Barclays.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Rick, your comments on the kind of overall market in I&I were fairly tempered, but obviously, that's where the strongest growth is. So can you just talk about the drivers that you're seeing into June there?
Richard L. Clemmer: Yes, so one of the things that we have found is in addition to being totally unpredictable with the basestation OEMs, it becomes fairly seasonal. And so we clearly have a seasonal uptick in I&I associated with the basestations' shipments. We also have some significant design wins in our LNAs, in our small-signal business, in different design wins that we'll be ramping. While it's not such a large dollar item, we have won a number of significant design wins that continues to position us well. And then the ramp up of our mobile audio processor, where we have a number of design wins, including -- I don't know that we can talk about the specifics of those, but, really, a solid design wins, where the fundamental quality of sound is being recognized in those specific handsets, facilitated our Maximus [ph] processor associated with it. So that's really what drives the growth associated with I&I. And it comes as much as anything from just the seasonal basis associated with the basestation OEMs.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division: And then the answer to prior question, it sounded like authentication's still in the early stages. Obviously, you're weathering a share loss -- a well-known share loss there fairly well. Can you talk about between core ID and emerging, where are you seeing the stronger tailwind into June? And as far as whether you can comment on your kind of -- the growth of core ID, which I think gets overlooked but has been a pretty strong part of your business.
Richard L. Clemmer: I think we clearly just talked about, for the most recent quarter, and our core ID business grew 4% sequentially, while emerging market grew at kind of 3%, so they both -- on a sequential basis. So they both had a pretty reasonable growth associated with a given seasonal -- seasonally weak Q1 period. And we expect to see double-digit growth for Q2. That's facilitated by a broad array of the portfolio associated with ID. And we still feel very good about that growth and the opportunity to continue to contribute to the overall growth of our High Performance Mixed Signal segment.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie, representing Raymond James.
Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: I suppose you guys could give a little bit more color on some of the comments you made in your prepared remarks, released in the press release, about taking necessary actions in the Standard Products business and also on the R&D acceleration. So I guess on the Standard Products, I mean, it sounds like basically you just try to be careful about ramping the quality issues, but is it more than that? And then on the R&D, what sort of impact should we think about for that R&D acceleration you talked about as we look out to Q3, Q4? Should we have seen some sort of dollar change or percentage of revenue change?
Peter Kelly: I think on the -- sorry, it's Peter Kelly. On the factories, it's -- in our Standard Products business, we have 2 really big back ends, so we don't source our product from multiple areas. One -- if one of the sites is off, it has quite a big impact. It's really related to how fast we can bring the yields back up. And we have a lot of people working very, very diligently in order to do that. But -- and it's the usual kind of things that you would do to do that. So it's really, really focused about how we -- not how we improve our yields to a whole new level, how do we bring our yields back to what we're used to them running about. So that's really on the manufacturing issues for Standard Products. In terms of R&D, I don't really want to get into forecasting Q3, Q4 R&D. In terms of the model, we'd expect our -- I think what we said in the past is we'd expect our SG&A to run about roughly 12%, maybe 11.5% in our R&D to run 13.5% or 14%. So we have a top OpEx of around 25%, which is where we're trying to get to.
Richard L. Clemmer: So if you really look at that in ID, what we're doing is we're pulling in some of the investment increases that we've planned later in the year to be able to ensure that we can protect the leadership technology position that we have and secure the technology advantages to be able to continue to go drive, continue design win improvements. And we're not talking about tens of millions of dollars on the quarter -- on that quarterly increase, but we're talking about clearly a step up of OpEx that will have an impact on our operating income on a single-quarter basis. But it won't really drive any increase in OpEx out in the second half of the year as we're just pulling it in as opposed to continuing to increase it. And if I could just add on, on the Standard Products, basically, we just got to get back to the basics of the business. Our combination of our operational performance, which in our back ends was not good this year, especially with the ramp up after the Lunar New Year coming back and some of the quality issues, we've got to ensure that we can get those fixed and be able to move forward. And the market environment, specifically in that area, has been clearly weaker than we would have anticipated, not to dissimilar to what we saw last year in the first quarter of the year where we've been some more of a moderation through the rest of the year. But our focus is how we get back on a reasonable profitability and drive the operating income of this business back more towards the entitlement [ph] ranges that what we believe it can perform at.
Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Okay, great. And just in terms of the core ID business, can you give any color on rollouts of programs for, say, government ID? Obviously, you had it in Indonesia win. Where are we for that and how quickly might sort of any big Chinese program turn for you?
Richard L. Clemmer: So I think it's not just on the eGovernment side. I mean, the eGov part specifically has its puts and takes on a quarterly basis. We clearly won a couple of significant countries in the most recent quarter, but we always do. So that's not really anything that's specific. Clearly, the area that we're seeing the most significant opportunity in near term, which helps us and really is the reason, again, that I mentioned, the strength of the portfolio, is in the rollout of contactless banking in China and the relationship we have with a number of different institutions to be able to facilitate that. We're basically -- they're skipping some of the intermediate steps of -- that other countries have gone through on the banking and moving to this contactless banking in a very strong position, and basically being able to facilitate with our technology and drive a much easier use with a much more secured basis.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Caso, representing Susquehanna Financial Group.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: I just wondered if you could just give a little more perspective on the Standard Products business right now with respect to the underperformance there from a revenue standpoint. Is there anything in particular that you could point to there? Again, as you look at perhaps this time last year, I think the business was performing a little bit better at this point in the calendar. Is this -- have somewhat to do with what's happening in the PC market right now? Do you see that kind of an overall proxy for what's going on in the market overall? And then as a follow-on to that, what do you typically see in terms of seasonality for that business? In other words, just should there be a natural tailwind as we go into the back half of the year?
Richard L. Clemmer: So I think the one thing that's clearly different in that business is the computing segment. When you really get down to it, there's probably a higher share of product mix in that business and the rest of our business that goes in the computing space. And clearly, the headwinds in computing that are -- had been very clearly stated creates some headwinds. We set an objective, a strategic objective, 1.5 years ago or so, to really change more towards the infrastructure and automotive side, as we have very strong automotive position in that business, but -- and we have the design wins. And interestingly enough, it is design wins when we start talking about Standard Products and Automotive to be able to facilitate that. But they have -- there's still quite a long period of time from when you win the design win to the ramp up associated with that revenue. But in the near term, the most significant thing has been the weakness on the computing market, and not dissimilar to what we saw in first quarter of 2012, very significant price pressure associated with the business. If we look at what happened in the rest of 2012, we saw more of a moderation of the pricing environment in the -- in quarter 2, through quarter 4. The question is, will we see that same kind of moderation in 2013 as well? And we think that part of that depends on clearly the economic underpinnings are the general economic environment, which we still have not seen a truly robust recovery across the board. If you look at own seasonality, the Standard Products business is typically pretty weak in Q1 and then we see improvements throughout the year. And then Q4, it's kind of flattish to roll off slightly from the Q3 range. But Q3 is typically clearly a better quarter for us, but it has a little bit of a -- it's not quite as much as the rest of our business just because of the Automotive share of Standard Products as well.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Right. Okay, that's good color. And just with respect to the distribution channel, I think you talked about a sell-in and sell-through was about flat in the first quarter. What are you anticipating to happen in the second quarter with the distribution channel? And specifically, are there any signs of restocking going on in the distribution channel, given the low levels of inventory right now?
Richard L. Clemmer: Well, so I think we have to be careful about low levels of inventory. Our inventories remained at 2.4 months consistently with I think one exception over the last 5 or 6 quarters. So our inventory levels have not changed significantly. The one thing that has changed is the mix. So we have some business like Automotive where our inventory has gone down in the distribution channel in the most recent quarter, while we have other areas like ID and high-performance RF, where there actually been a little bit of increase in channel inventory in preparation of design wins that they've won in those shipments beginning to take place in Q2. So I think clearly, we're optimistic about Q2. I think it's always an arm wrestling with our distribution channel partners. We'd like to see them carry more inventory, more like moving towards 3 months of inventory, and they'd like to be less focused on their turns-and-earns basis. But I think the key factor is, is looking at the total. And the fact is that we've been at 2.4 months of inventory for, as I recall, like 6 out of last 7 quarters or so. So we don't see a significant change, although we see some significant changes by products within that overall mix. But clearly, we see orders improving associated with distribution, and we're quite optimistic about Q2, obviously, consistent with the guidance that we set associated with the 6% to 12% product revenue increase.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Covello, representing Goldman Sachs.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: If you guys have a terrific HPMS business, it's growing faster than it appears, it's got good margins. The story in the multiple on your stock though is being held by the issues in Standard Products, not just this quarter but over -- intermittently, over the last 18 months or so. Obviously, you believe you can fix those issues. You're reiterating the 25% EBITDA targets for the year. Is there a point at which if you can't fix those issues, as you go through the remainder of 2013, you would consider exiting the Standard Products business to taking the cash for that, paying down the debt and being left with a very high growth, high-margin HPMS business?
Richard L. Clemmer: Well, Jim, we've been very specific on our Standard Products business that our focus is on High Performance Mixed Signal, it's not the strategic part of our business. I guess with the change with GPL, it's still only 25% or so of our total revenue associated with it. I think that we have talked about the relationships that it brings. And specifically in Automotive, in fact, we were just notified this week that we won a quality award from one of our largest Automotive customers, again, in Standard Products. So it does have a positive aspect associated with it, but it's clearly not a strategic business for us. But frankly, we're quite confident that we can fix it. And we think that we should fix it, and then we'll decide how we move forward over the longer term. But there's -- we don't think that it hinders our overall financial performance going forward in any way, and we clearly believe that the operating income objectives that we've set for exiting this year at 25% before the change, or as Peter said, even reflecting the share equity cost at around 26% is not a changed at all with that process, Jim. So we feel like that it's just basic blocking and tackling that we've got to take care of. We had a number of operational issues in the quarter and a number of plants with quality and labor issues that we have to work our way through. But the bottom line is, is that we have to get those fixed and get back on track, which we feel very comfortable that we will be able to accomplish.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Thoughtful perspective. For my follow-up, on the Portable & Computing business, I think the guidance there is stronger than the market would've expected, given well-documented weakness at one customer that you had. Are you gaining share at some customers that might offset their own issues? Or you're getting shares outside of those customers? Or did you take the kind of pain from the issues that customer is having in the first quarter, as that business was down about 12% or so? Could you give us a little prospectively on your ability to guide up there?
Richard L. Clemmer: Well, we feel pretty comfortable about the guidance that we have associated with it. It's a combination of things, it's not all into any individual customer associated with it. What we did say is, clearly, the revenue expectations we would've had 3, 4 quarters ago are higher than what we have achieved in Q1 or frankly even our guidance in Q2. But we feel very good about the relationship with those customers that are focused in, that are waiting in that area. And think we can continue to drive that business going forward. And there will always be quarterly bumps along the way, but on a sustained basis, we feel very comfortable with the position that we have with design winds and the customer support for those key customers in that area.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore, representing Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Just to follow-up on that last one, does the guidance of -- I think, you said low double-digit growth in the Portable & Computing area, include the benefit of the beginning of the sensor hub/MCU business? Or is that still more in the second half of the year?
Richard L. Clemmer: There might be some early initial shipments, Ross, but it's not a significant factor associated with the guidance. But there'll be only early shipments, a little bit like we had on the interface product kind of in the second quarter of last year, but it's not really a significant factor in the guidance.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Got you. And then for my follow-up, more on to the margin side of things. If I'm doing my math correctly with your flat Standard Product gross margin in the second quarter, it seems like x the gain you had in the first quarter that the HPMS gross margin is also relatively flat, may be even slightly down sequentially. Can you just talk about with the puts and takes are for the HPMS gross margin as we look into the second quarter?
Peter Kelly: I think the -- or maybe my math is wrong, but I think the HPMS gross margin is up a little bit, Ross, but not a lot, okay. I think we have lots -- you have lots of moving parts going on in there. So it's -- I mean, I don't think there's anything special going on in gross margin from Q1 to Q2 in HPMS. I think that fundamental issue for the company is if Standard Products was forecasting where -- sorry, if Standard Products was performing where we wanted it to be. It would probably be 150, maybe 180 basis points higher on gross margin and operating margin than we've currently got in the forecast, and we'd be looking at something more like 47.5 as a whole -- company as a whole, and I think people feel very comfortable. So I think our HPMS margins are pretty much on track I'd say.
Richard L. Clemmer: Yes, I guess that you always, Ross, have a mix on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Clearly, some of the ramp up on the contactless banking isn't necessarily as profitable as some of the rest of our security business, so there's always puts and takes. I think the bottom line operating income performance in HPMS clearly demonstrates the capability that we have and puts us on a pretty good track to be able to exit the year at the objective that we've established.
Operator: Your next question comes of the line of David Phipps, representing Citi.
David Phipps: On some of the capital allocation issues, to accelerate your move towards investment grade, would you consider paying down debt a little bit more rapidly to encourage the agencies at the same time that you're buying back stock?
Peter Kelly: Well, in the stock buybacks, there were early buyback stock to the extent that we get receipts from stock option, except for people exercising their stock option, so it's pretty small amount of money. We do plan to use basically all of our free cash to pay down debt in the coming year. There's no change on that.
David Phipps: And there were used -- but you have some drawings on the revolver, would we expect to see those repaid by the end of the quarter?
Peter Kelly: Yes, we kind of moved the revolver around as our -- as we see fit. There's not a lot of point in -- there's almost -- you make nothing on the deposits, so we try and keep our revolver as low as possible here. So the big thing coming up is just over $0.25 billion debt due in late summer this year. And that's the kind of next chunk of debt that we need to go or we need to go after, and we're planning to pay that then.
Richard L. Clemmer: I think you should look at the progress that we've made on our debt-to-EBITDA basis. We continue to improve that through a combination of improved EBITDA, but also through the reduced net debt. And Peter has talked about that fact that we'll continue to generate cash and focus on paying down our debt. But it's a number of quarters that you can count on one hand that we'll be in the position where we'll have our net debt that's down at the 2x annualized EBITDA basis. But as far as what the credit agencies do relative to ratings, they have to set that on their own pace.
Operator: Your next question comes of the line of Vikar Arajay (sic) [Vivek Arya], representing Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Rick, I think it's good to see the Auto segment starting to grow again. How should we think about it conceptually for the year, given some of the sluggish data points around European and China auto sales? And if you could remind us of your relative geographic exposure?
Richard L. Clemmer: Well, I think our -- in Automotive specifically, our geography exposure is pretty well consistent with the Automotive industry. And it's really hard for us to track, because when we ship a product, we don't know who that end market is that they're actually going to consume it based on a number of our customers. I think it's probably worthwhile to point out that the strength of the OEM orders that we saw in Automotive were clearly in Korea and in Japan and China, and we didn't see any real improvement in Europe and in North America. So our strength in Automotive was clearly in Asia, and that's where we saw the improvement associated with it. But -- and we've always said that we would anticipate the growth in Automotive segment this year to be in the developing countries and not in North America and Europe associated with it. And I think we don't see anything that changes that at all, although it is good to see a strength in OEM order rates in Automotive in total.
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: And as a follow-up, Peter, I wanted to revisit this gross margin issue in HPMS. I think your sales were up 20% year-on-year and HPMS gross margins were roughly flattish, but operating margins were up almost 500 basis points. So is it time to rethink the expectation you have set around what the gross margin and operating margin target should be, longer-term for this segment? Is it a mix issue that more of the growth has been driven by OEMs, more consumer products, so we should have different expectations in terms of gross margin and operating margins for this segment?
Peter Kelly: I think the expectation that in terms of 26% OI is a reasonable one. We clearly need to increase or improve our gross margins by -- we think by about 300 basis points. Obviously, the Standard Products issue is has caused us a slight bump. And we need to take OpEx down a little bit. But I think the -- it's reasonable to focus on, on certainly as the first step an operating income of 26% there. I think once we get there, then we can talk about changing the target, but I'd be uncomfortable trying to increase the target before that. I guess one other thing I was just looking as well, I'd like to apologize to Ross, I was look at operating margin when I answered Ross' question. So HPMS margin, if you do the math on our guidance, would be down a little bit. And as Rick mentioned, that's really a mix issue and reflects the larger chunk of our business coming from contactless banking in Q2. So sorry about that, Ross.
Richard L. Clemmer: And you know, I think the mix of gross margin and operating income is interesting, but I don't think we're really wanting to change our overall model because we think, for the long term, it's still -- it's in effect. And the key is for us to be able to run at the 26% operating income on a sustained basis exiting the year, and be in a position where we can continue to deliver on that with above the industry growth rates, which drives a very compelling earnings improvement going forward.
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: All right. And just one last question, Rick. On the emerging ID business, NFC was a key part of growth last year and there were some notable design wins away especially at Samsung, but you're still sounding relatively confident about the business of CRM. Wondering why that is, given that mode of the NFC radio part, is being integrated in combos, especially at Samsung. So the number of design wins you mentioned in smartphones, is it in customers other than Samsung? Is it still within Samsung? And even if you cannot be customer-specific, I'm just curious how you're confident about growing the NFC business this year, given the changes? And how NFC is being adopted by different smartphone customers?
Richard L. Clemmer: Well, so I think is worthwhile to point out that we still have design wins across the board at all major customers associated with it that are using NFC. So I don't think we -- we're certainly not backing off of our -- the strength of technology and leadership position that we have. What we've always said is, eventually, there'll be an integration on the radio. And our objective is to be sure that we can provide the secure element associated with it. And we clearly see that playing out, although it's played out at a little bit slower rate than what we had expected several years ago. So we clearly see that, but really the strength of our security businesses is the breath of our portfolio and the strong technical leadership position that we have as a company that can continue to bring some unique capabilities to all of our customers to provide security in a fashion that few semiconductor companies are in a position to be able to accomplish. And so, that strength of that portfolio is really what drives our ID business and the confidence we have in double-digit growth and the strength that we continue to see where we have outperformed clearly and can continue to be in a strong leadership position going forward.
Operator: Your next question comes of the line of Will Stern (sic) [Will Stein], representing SunTrust.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: It's Will Stein from SunTrust. First, I'm wondering if you can comment on capital allocation plan post 2x net leverage, it's a point that I think you've mentioned in the past. Do you still expect to get there by the end of this year? And remind us about your intended use of cash flow following that time?
Richard L. Clemmer: Well, we've been very specific that we're going to look at what's in the best interest of shareholders when we get below 2x the annualized EBITDA on net debt. So we'll look at that at that point in time. Our clear focus is on how we continue to reduce the debt over the next 3, 4, 5 quarters to be in a position to be sure that we get to that 2x annualized EBITDA. But as far as going beyond that, yes, it's premature for us to say. We want to look at it and what drives the best return for our shareholders at that point in time. But clearly, there is no lack of focus in being able to continue to pay down our debt in the next few quarters.
Peter Kelly: Yes. I think Rick's comment in that we'll do what's ever in the best interest of our shareholders, is one that's worth emphasizing. We spent a lot of time talking to our shareholders, and Jeff mentioned all the conferences we're going to be at in the next couple of months. But we -- when we get to that point, we will listen to our owners, so people like yourself, and we'll decide what's the best thing for the shareholders. So there's lots of different options, but in the meantime, we need to focus on paying down the debt.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: That's helpful. And if I can just ask another question about Automotive. I think historically, the company's strength has been in radios, and you highlighted a few customers in that part of -- that part of Automotive. And you also talked about a new relationship, you have co-funding a company with Cisco. Can you talk about when you see car-to-car and car-to-infrastructure demand ramping and becoming a noticeable contributor to that end market?
Richard L. Clemmer: So you know that's out several years, that's not something that we can really drive a specific growth commitment associated with. The key for us is to be in a position to continue to be a technology leader associated with it. And I think the relationship that we announced with Cohda, as well as Cisco, continues to confirm the strength of that position. There are field trials that are going on today on car-to-car and car-to-x communications. The ability to drive that and maybe some of the innovation to be able to facilitate aftermarket implementations may drive that sooner than it would be on just a individual car basis. But clearly, the discussions that we have with Automotive companies on some of their high-end cars, they're talking about that in -- out a few years. But as anything that's a really new emerging technology in automotive industry, it takes a long time, a number of years, for it to develop into a significant revenue growth. And the one thing I'd like to point out, you're right, we are the leader in car infotainment, specifically associated with our radios. But on our safety and comfort business, we have a very strong leadership position in the remote keyless entry where basically every car that's manufactured in the world, with exception of Toyota, uses our technology and a few models of Volkswagen. So that gives us a clear strength as well as the in-vehicle networking associated with it and some of the Lighting areas. So we have a number of different areas where we're uniquely positioned in a strong leadership position outside of just the car radio itself.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Rasheet (sic) [Vijay Rakesh], representing Sterne Agee.
Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: I just had one question here. If you look at the operating margin, obviously, 21% here for June. But as you look at exiting the year at 25%, 26%, what are the levers you are seeing? Is that more on the -- you see the gross margin side or is it OpEx? If you can give some more color on how you see the nice snap back on the second half?
Peter Kelly: Okay. So it's a couple of things. One is I'm absolutely not going to give guidance for Q4. But from what we've talked about in the past is we need to improve our gross margins by about 300 basis points and our OpEx by about 200 basis points. So our OpEx, we took a big charge in Q4 and we're diligently implementing that plan, so I have a high degree of confidence on OpEx. And gross margin relates to 3 general areas: One is, it relates to our wafer costs; the second relates to kind of basic blocking and tackling around yield and design; and third area related to we expect by towards the end of the year to be able to get a more reliable and consistent IP revenue stream, which is something we've been working on for the past few years, actually. So nothing changed there. The only fly in the ointment at the moment is our Standard Products performance. As we've described, we think we can get that back on track for the second half of the year.
Jeff Palmer: Thank you. Well, thank you, everyone, for your interest in the company today, and we look forward to speaking with you at another time. Rick, would you have some closing remarks you'd like to make?
Richard L. Clemmer: Yes. Thanks, Jeff. We continue to be focused on improving our overall profitability, delivering improved earnings, outgrowing the market in revenue and maximizing shareholder value. We are confident that we will execute the plan, although we will accelerate some investments in ID that had been planned for later in the year to ensure continued technology leadership. We are also very focused in taking the necessary actions to improve the performance of Standard Products segments, which has clearly been disappointing. Our strategy continues to be focused on providing unique and differentiated product solutions to enable our customers' success, which over the long term, will allow NXP to continue to outpace the cyclical growth of the overall semiconductor market and deliver superior profitability with strong EPS growth. Thank you very much.
Jeff Palmer: Thank you very much for your interest. Take care.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect, and have a great day.

Operator:  Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Fourth Quarter 2012 NXP Semiconductors NV Earnings Conference Call. My name is Alex, and I will be your coordinator today. I would now like to turn the representation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Jeff Palmer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.
Jeff Palmer: Thank you, Alex and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the NXP Semiconductors' fourth quarter and full year 2012 Earnings Call. With me on the call today is Rick Clemmer, NXP's President and CEO; Peter Kelly, our CFO will be available during the Q&A portion of the call today. If you've not obtained a copy of our fourth quarter 2012 earnings press release, it can be found at our company website under the Investor Relations section at nxp.com. Additionally, we have posted a supplemental earnings summary presentation and a document of our historical financials to assist in your modeling efforts. This call is being recorded, and will be available for replay from our corporate website. Please be reminded that this call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause NXP's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the macroeconomic impact on the specific end-markets in which we operate, the sale of new and existing products and our expectations for financial results for the fourth quarter of 2013. Please be reminded that NXP undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements. For a full disclosure on forward-looking statements, please refer to our press release. Additionally, during our call today, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the impact of purchase price accounting, restructuring, impairment and other charges that are driven primarily by discrete events that management does not consider to be directly related to NXP's underlying core operating performance. Pursuant to Regulation G, NXP has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our fourth quarter 2012 earnings press release, which will be furnished to the SEC on Form 6-K, and is available on NXP's website in the Investor Relations section at nxp.com. Before we begin the call today, I'd like to highlight our attendance at the upcoming Goldman Sachs TMT Investor Conference on February 12th, in San Francisco. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Rick.
Rick Clemmer: Thanks, Jeff, and welcome everyone to our earnings call today. As this is our fourth quarter and full year report I would like to first spend a few moments highlighting our full year results. Overall, we're quite proud of our results, despite a difficult environment. We focused on delivering on our commitments while also acknowledging we have areas we can further improve. On the positive side, the highlights include; first, we delivered strong revenue growth, product revenue at $4.1 billion was up 7% year-on-year, against an overall semiconductor market which most analysts have projected to decline by several points. Our product revenue performance was due to continued traction within our High Performance Mixed Signal segment which actually grew a strong 13% to $3.28 billion versus 2011. Within HPMS, we saw robust growth within our ID business, which was up 41% year-on-year to $986 million. To help put this in context as of the end of 2012, ID business is on a run rate of over $1.1 billion a year, as compared to the time of the IPO, when it was a run rate of about $600 million, during two short years the team has nearly doubled this uniquely focused business on industry leading security competence. Also in our High Performance Mixed Signal segment, our Portable & Computing business grew 14% year-on-year to $753 million as a result of specific design wins in the mobility market. Second, we improved our profitability, from a non-gap profitability perspective HPMS gross margin - gross profit improved over 6% year-on-year, while HPMS operating profit improved 17% versus 2011. Third, we generate nearly half of billion in free cash flow, which we define as operating cash flow less net CapEx. For the full year free cash flow was $473 million or approximately 11% of total revenue. Lastly we reduced our gross debt and associated interest expenses. For the full year our gross debt declined 8% year-on-year, and we took actions throughout the year to further de-risk our very reasonable maturity profile. The combination of these actions resulted in a reduction of over interest expense, by over $40 million versus 2011. While we are proud of the positive highlights during 2012, we did face challenges as well. The most significant challenge in 2012 was an uncertain economic and demand environment. It was particularly true in our most - more economically sensitive businesses, and particularly we experienced real headwinds in our automotive, industrial, infrastructure and Standard Products business. While our automotive business grew 1% versus 2011, to $939 million with weakness in the European area offset by very favorable results in North America and Asia. In our industrial and infrastructure business, revenue declined 2% to $604 million versus the prior year primarily as a result of weak demand throughout most of the year for high performance RF devices primarily aimed at the base station market even though design win momentum continues to be strong. And within our Standard Products segment revenue declined to $832 million a decline of 10% year-on-year reflective of the weak demand trends throughout the year. Second, we still have work to do on our longer term overall margin targets. While Peter provided a roadmap of actions at our Analyst Day in September to improve margin by the end of 2013, our full year gross margin for 2012 was down a 160 basis points and operating margin declined to 130 basis points. This was primarily as a result of weaker industry demand, a poor pricing environment and lower factory utilization within our Standard Products segment, but clearly we are focused on improving this. As a result of both our successes and the challenges we experienced during 2012, NXP management team is determined that we need to improve our expense structure in certain areas of our business. Result is an emphasis on continuing to improve our support processes, a de-emphasis of certain investments and the reduction of the associated expenses. But we will accelerate investments in other areas of the business, which have a higher probability of success; Peter will provide additional details during his prepared remarks. Now I'd like to review the specific results for the most recent quarter. Overall the results for the 4th quarter came in the higher end of our guidance. Product revenue was $1.07 billion a decline of 4% sequentially, just above the midpoint of our expectations. In that 24% from the year ago period total NXP revenue was $1.12 billion of 5% sequentially decline and up 20% from the year ago period. Turning now to our segment performance, High Performance Mixed Signal revenue was $868 million a 4% sequential decline and up 32% from the year ago period. Within our ID business revenue was $290 million up over 5% sequentially above our flat expectations. This was 87% growth from the fourth quarter 2011. Order trends within core ID were above our original expectations, up 1% sequentially and representing about three fourths of the total ID revenue. Within core ID the Banking and Tags & Label product lines were up in the quarter while eGov, Automatic Fare Collection and infrastructure declined sequentially. I should highlight that our core ID product line showed very strong 56% year-on-year growth in fourth quarter, a reflection of our continued leadership in this strategic area. Within our emerging ID business, which includes mobile transactions and authentication revenue was up 20% sequentially and represented about 25% of the overall ID group revenue during the quarter. As compared to 2011, our emerging ID has increased by over 3x during the quarter nearly all of the emerging ID growth was due to a combination of NFC and secure elements from mobile transaction solutions, which as of the - in the fourth quarter is on an annualized run rate of over $280 million per year. Moving now to our Portable & Computing business revenue was $195 million down 12% sequentially slightly worse than our original expectations but still up 42% from the year ago period. During the quarter, we experienced weak demand across the whole P&C portfolio with about half of sequential revenue decline seen in logic about the quarter of the decline in the MCUs and the remainder within interface products. About 40% of the revenue decline was due to key designs in the mobility space. We view this as a combination of natural seasonal trends after a strong ramp in Q3 ahead of the holiday shopping season, combined with normal effects post the launch of new products. We see these trends in the mobility space continuing into the first quarter. In spite of the weaker trends in the mobility market we are very encouraged by the design opportunities, we are pursuing with both current as well as new customers. Turning to infrastructure and industrial revenue was $156 million down about 5% sequentially better than our original expectations and revenue was actually up 5% versus the year ago period. During the fourth quarter about two thirds of the revenue decline was due to seasonal weakness in the front end tuner business and the remainder due to anticipated weakness in our notebook power supply business. We did however, experienced some encouraging initial shipments of our [MacSmith] audio amplifier product into smartphone applications and we're seeing positive performance feedback and interest from other handset OEMs. Within our Auto business revenue was $227 million down 5% in line with our original expectations but up 4% versus the fourth quarter of 2011. From a product perspective we experience weak sequential demand for entertainment and in-vehicle networking products while keyless door entry and censor products were both up modestly in the quarter. Finally, turning to our standard product business revenue was $198 million down 7% in line with our original expectations and flat versus the year ago period. As we've mentioned in the past given the broad market exposure for our Standard Products business it is reflective of the underlying economic trends in the markets we serve. Until, such time as our customers have improved clarity about end market demand, we would expect our standard product business to place continued headwinds. Turning, now to our distribution channel performance total sales and the distribution channel declined 6% with sales out of distribution down only about 1%. Total distribution sales represented slightly less than 50% of the total product sales fairly consistent with our long-term trends. We continue to manage distribution inventory within our targeted range with total months remaining at 2.4 flat versus both the prior quarter and the year ago period, absolute dollars of inventory in a channel declined by about 1% on a sequential basis. From a geographic shipment perspective, Europe, Middle East and Africa were incrementally better than in the prior quarter while sales into Japan were flat sequentially. Sales into the other major markets especially in China and Americas were down but generally in line with overall trends and businesses previously highlighted. All geographies except for Japan demonstrated show a strong year-on-year growth but our business in China was up nearly 50% versus the fourth quarter of 2011. In summary, the results for the fourth quarter were incrementally better than we had originally anticipated especially in our HPMS business segment. We believe the attraction we have gained with numerous major customers' position us well into 2013 and beyond. Specific, many of the customers who helped to fuel our growth in 2011 have awarded NXP [follow-on] programs which should enable the company to deliver continued share gains. We do need to increase our execution focus specifically in areas of cost and expense management, but we believe we have programs and actions in place, which should enable NXP to deliver continued positive results. We believe if we are successful our actions will result in a very good bottom line earnings growth. I would like to turn the call over to Peter to discuss the financials in more detail of the quarter.
Peter Kelly:  Thank you, Rick and good morning to everyone on today's call. As Rick has already covered the full year highlights as well as the drivers of the revenue during the quarter, I will move directly to the highlights of the P&L. Overall, despite the tough economic environment it was a good quarter and better than our original expectations. Total revenue, non-GAAP gross profit, operating profit and net income were all slightly better than the midpoint of our guidance resulting in non-GAAP earnings per share or $0.50. As we've discussed previously it's our strategic intent to exit 2013 on an operating margin of 25%. We've also said that in order to achieve this goal we need to improve our gross margin performance and reduce our SG&A as a percent of revenue. Before I turn to the operating results for the fourth quarter I'd like to highlight three actions we are undertaking to position the Company to achieve this goal. As highlighted in the press release we are implementing a number of programs that will reduce our SG&A to a level of 12% of revenue by the end of 2013. These programs are primarily focused in the area of G&A support functions. Secondly, we took steps to make our R&D more effective by reducing support costs and refocusing our resources towards more high value programs, while still maintaining our R&D at the 14% of revenue level. Lastly, we continue to manage our internal manufacturing costs. We plan to consolidate our MOS process technologies into our Dutch 8-inch fab and out of our German fab. In total, as a result of this overall plan, we booked $98 million provision in the fourth quarter of which $55 million is in SG&A, $23 million is in R&D and $20 million is in cost of goods sold. We expect the $98 million charge will result in a cash outflow of $64 million in 2013 with the balance in 2014 and '15. To be clear we did not take this action lightly well because of the current economic environment, but rather we took these actions to strategically position NXP for long-term growth, especially in those areas where we continue to see strong traction with major customers. Now turning to the quarterly results; fourth quarter revenues were $1.12 billion, $23 million above the midpoint of our guidance. We generated $514 million in non-GAAP gross profit slightly above the midpoint of our guidance and reported a non-GAAP gross margin of 46.1%, 20 basis points below our results in the previous quarter. Now, let me turn to the operating segments. Within the HPMS segment revenue was $868 million down about 4% over the previous quarter with non-GAAP gross margin of 52.4% 80 basis points above the third quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin was 22.6% of revenue, a decline of 50 basis points primarily as a result of lower seasonal revenue. Within our standard product segment revenue was $198 million down 7% sequentially with non-GAAP gross margin of 28.3%, a 600 basis point decline versus the third quarter. About half of the decline is attributable to lower sales and the associated under utilization impacts. Of the remainder the largest part was due to a quality issue in our assembly and test sites, which has since been addressed and should be non-recurring into the first quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin was 10.1% a 540 basis point decline as a result of the previous items as operating expenses were essentially flat quarter-on-quarter. Total operating expenses were $308 million, down $3 million on a sequential basis and just above of the midpoint of our guidance range. From a total operating profit perspective, non-GAAP operating profit was $209 million and represents an 18.7% operating margin. Interest expense was $55 million, at the higher end of our expectations as a result of the timing of refinancing actions taken during the quarter. These actions include the successful tender and retirement of $500 million of our 2018, 9.75% Senior Secured Notes. Additionally, during the quarter, we put in place $500 million term loan due 2020, non-controlling interests was $18 million and our cash taxes were $10 million. Taken together this was essentially in line with our expectations. This resulted in total NXP non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.50, $0.03 better than the midpoint of our guidance and was over the double the $0.24 from the same period a year ago. Included in our non-GAAP net income was $16 million of stock based compensation or about $0.06 per share. Now I would like to turn to the changes in our cash and debt. Our total net debt at the end of Q3 was $2.88 billion flat versus the previous quarter as we executed the refinancing of the $500 million of the 2018 debt. Cash at the end of the fourth quarter was $617 million, a sequential decline of $85 million as a result of debt reduction activities. We exited the quarter with a trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.04 billion and our ratio of net debt to trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA at the end of Q4 was 2.8 times. Turning to working capital metrics; days of inventory was 104 days an increase of 7 days and most of this increase related to a service level agreements for major customers and to the continuing pre-build of inventory for the factories that we'll close at the end of the year. Days receivable was 38 days, an increase of one day sequentially, while days payable were 82 days, an increase of three. Taken together our cash conversion cycle was 60 days versus the 54 days in the prior quarter. Cash flow from operations was $164 million, as a result of good operating performance. Net CapEx investment during the quarter was $45 million, resulting in a positive free cash flow of $119 million or 11% of revenue. Now I would like to provide our outlook for Q1. Historically, our first quarter is seasonally our weakest period. This trend combined by what we view as a continued weak business climate is influencing our outlook. We currently anticipate product revenue will be in a range of down 1% to down 4% sequentially. At the midpoint we expect product revenue to be down about 2% in Q1 reflecting the following trends in the business. On a percentage point basis, Automotive is expected to experience seasonal declines and should be down in a low single-digit range sequentially. In identification, after five straight quarters of significant growth, we expect a modest sequential reduction into the first quarter. This should translate to a decline in the low single-digit range. Portable & Computing is expected to be down about 10% primarily due to the typical seasonal weakness of shipments. You would expect this macro weakness impacting the broad-based general purpose logic and microcontroller business. Infrastructure and Industrial is expected to perform better than historical seasonal norms, but will still decline in the low single-digit range. Standard Products is expected to improve incrementally into the first quarter and is expected to be up in the low single-digit range. We anticipate revenue from the combination of our Manufacturing segment and the corporate and other to be approximately $24 million. Normally, I do not discuss our Manufacturing segment much, but thought of quick comment in light of the guidance will be helpful. We remind everyone on this segment; it primarily represents the combination of revenue, which our joint-venture fab in Singapore SSMC sells to TSMC. In addition, to Manufacturing services revenue for our divested entities. The service revenue portion has declined as anticipated to a level where it only contribute of few million dollars a quarter, and may at some point go to zero, however the SSMC portion will never go to zero but it will fluctuate depending on the loading by TSMC and the number of work days in a quarter. During Q1 the quarter-on-quarter fluctuation is a result of SSMC implementing its tri-annual maintenance program. We would anticipate this segment would run at about a normalized run rate of $30 million to $35 million per quarter with essentially no impact on our overall operating margins. Taken together, total NXP revenue should be in the range of $1.051 billion to $1.082 billion or about $1.067 billion at the midpoint. Additional inputs to will help you tune your models are as follows; Net debt is expected to reduce from $2.9 billion to $2.8 billion. We anticipate non-GAAP gross profit to be in the range of approximately $497 million to $511 million, we anticipate operating expense in Q1 to be in a range of approximately $305 million to $310 million taken together this should translate into a non-GAAP operating profit in the range about $193 million to $202 million. Net interest expense should be about $50 million. Cash tax expense should be approximately $9 million and non-controlling interests should be about $13 million. Stock-based compensation is expected to be about $18 million, or about $0.07 per share, and I would remind you that is included in our non-GAAP results. Average diluted share count should be about 255 million shares and taken together, our guidance implies non-GAAP earnings per share in a range of $0.47 to $0.51 per share, or approximately $0.49 per share at the midpoint of our guidance range. Finally, earlier today we announced plans to issue an unsecured bond for $500 million. We're very excited about this as it representing into the step and our desire to become investment grade and reduce our overall long-term cost of capital. I'd now like to turn to your questions. Jeff?
Jeff Palmer: Thanks, Peter. Alex, could we poll for Q&A?
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: Yeah, good morning guys or afternoon I guess your time. And I appreciate all the detail in the press release always very helpful. But my first question just had to do with the Q1 guide can you talk a little bit about in ID of the trends in emerging versus core. You also seemed to be guiding overall about in line with normal seasonal with no sort of impact from potentially a cyclical uplift in the semi industry. I was wondering if you could comment on the cyclical side of things? And then lastly, on the Standard Products side is the up Q1 a reflection of catch up from some of the quality issues you had in Q4 or should I think about that as being in the lead indicator that [orders] growth in HPMS given that most of Standard Products is distribution and selling?
Peter Kelly:  Let me do the Standard Products question first, I guess the move from Q4 to Q1, it's a relatively small jump from a revenue perspective, we're just talking about a few million dollars there really. I don't think that indicates anything in terms of a major change in the economic downturn.
Rick Clemmer: So, John, your question about ID specifically, the interesting thing about our ID business, and you know, from a security perspective it's interesting portfolio of number of different businesses with different things happening at any one time, as we've talked about on the government side and even some of the banking side it's much more project oriented than economic oriented. And so, the strength that we've had with in Q4 where we saw such strong strength from a year ago we're assuming that that will taper off somewhat in Q1 and frankly there are some parts of the portfolio that we have a problem just filling all of the requirements associated with it. So that's reflected and what we talk about with our guidance for Q1 for the ID business as well. So, I think as far as the general economic environment we're still a little bit conscious about the general economy. Clearly, there's some indications of improvement that are taking place, but not sufficient for us to feel like that we want to count on a robust economic improvement in our projections or guidance associated with it. And we clearly don't see orders on a strong uptick, we see clearly a slight improvement associated with it, but not something that would give us a strong enough position to feel like that Q1 will be significantly stronger. I think that we do still feel pretty good about the general environment and we think that clearly Q1 will be the bottom and we'll be moving up from there. So I think that is a positive associated with it, but still with somewhat anemic economic environment. Even though with the recent results on the U.S. economy but even that having a significant share of that that's focused on housing market which really doesn't have a lot to do with our business in itself.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: Rick, and then as my follow-up just thinking about gross for the balance of '13, I mean clearly last year you guys outperformed the industry as emerging ID, accelerated in product cycle wins and PMC also accelerated. As you think about the components about growth this year I know you've got the sensor hub expected sometime mid-year to begin to ramp. But what other areas should we be looking at either by product cycle or by end market where you feel the highest level of confidence about growth?
Rick Clemmer: I think we feel very comfortable that we'll outgrow the market by at least another 50% in 2013. I think, we want to get out of talking about specific programs as much as we can and talk about general indications associated with it. But as we talk about LTE and base stations it clearly will contribute to our growth in 2013 by some of the strong design wins we have. Our automotive business, we expect to continue to see an improvement associated with the general environment. So there's a lot of areas that are going to contribute to the double-digit growth that we're expecting our ID business for 2013. So, all of that added together is what give us the comfort to be pretty specific about being able to outgrow the industry by at least 50% in 2013.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: Great, thanks guys. Congratulations.
Rick Clemmer: Thanks a lot, John.
Peter Kelly:  Thanks, John.
Operator:  Our next question is coming from C. J. Muse from Barclays.
C. J. Muse - Barclays Capital: Good after noon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question on gross margin, your guide for Q1 despite seasonal down tick is a gross margin level that surpasses any number that you printed in 2012. So curious what's driving that is that mix is that a pickup in utilization on the Standard Products. How should we think about that and how should we think about the trajectory through the remainder of the year?
Peter Kelly:  We'd like to say - I would say two things. One is in Q4 specifically our Standard Products business was hit by some one-off costs. So, that will help the Standard Products business in Q1. Mix is certainly a factor, we've also talked about some of the issues that we've had in 2012 as we ramp some of these big designs. And I think in terms of the trajectory, what we talked about is we really would like to exit 2013 at the 25% operating level and in order to do that we need to move our gross margins up to about the 50% level by the time we exit the year.
Rick Clemmer: But, CJ as we've talked about that's a clear priority and focus for us is how we continue to improve our margins and where we're spending a reasonable amount of time from a management team perspective. We feel very comfortable with our growth opportunities and now we've got to be sure that we drive the kind of margin growth and the right kind of operating income improvements that we think exist.
C. J. Muse - Barclays Capital: That's helpful. And as my follow up, you talked about headwind from auto, infrastructure and Standard Products in 2012 at lease relative to the other two businesses that really shined. I am curious today, where do you expect the most improvement, the most growth, where are the green shoots that are cyclically or led by a design win momentum that you know you have in your back pocket today, that could really drive that 50% of performance or greater in 2013?
Rick Clemmer: Well, clearly our ID business we had said we expect double digit growth again in 2013, so it will it will continue to contribute to a strong growth position. Our INI business from the ramp up the base stations for LTE and China we think it represents a significant opportunity while it varies a lot quarter-by-quarter we see those design wins materializing with the shipments of base stations so that we feel comfortable on the year-on-year basis. And in general automotive terms we had record shipments in North America and China in our automotive shipments for last couple of quarters. So continue to see that what's kind of a stabilization of some of the other regions of the world clearly presents an opportunity to being more in line with overall semiconductor growth then it certainly represented in 2012. And then Standard Products, we expect that to continue to be fairly link to what's happening in the general economic environment, although we do expect that there's the opportunity for some growth in China. You know as we talked about near on the strong growth that we had in our shipments in China represent a significant opportunity and clearly that's an area for us in 2013 in Standard Products that we would be helpful, we'll demonstrate some growth.
Peter Kelly: We shouldn't also forget, Rick, that the design wins and new opportunities we have in PMC will continue to ramp up from midyear onwards.
Rick Clemmer: They will 
C. J. Muse - Barclays Capital: Very helpful, guys, thank you.
Rick Clemmer: Thanks, C. J.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America: Thanks for taking my question. I think you just mentioned mix as one of the factors that impacted HPMS gross margins in 2012. But as we look at 2013 it appears as if mix is not really likely to change, because ID and your Portable & Computing business are expected to be the faster growers in your business. So is that an accurate understanding and appears, can you help us understand how you will improve gross margins and HPMS.
Peter Kelly: Yeah, I think what I actually said Vivek, was the growth of the mobile designs wins has affected our margin there's a number - I guess I was referencing some discussions on earlier calls, but what's happened is we were forced to ramp some of these products very very quickly. So we didn't necessarily get the best pricing from our foundry partners. We ended up in putting in PE structures and manufacturing structures that were not optimal. And we've been working pretty diligently on clearing those up. So it's from that perspective, we really had some headwinds in 2012, that have not helped us, clearly we have some other product ramps that are going to help us in 2013, as well. But from a mix perspective this is not going to be a huge switch in our mix a way towards very higher margin products that will just make this all easy to look.
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch: Thanks, Peter, that's very helpful. And one question on NFC, I understand it's not a big product of business, but nevertheless it's still a very prominent part of your business. So Broadcom on their call spoke about gaining double digit share I think Qualcomm was also a little bit vocal about their NFC potential. So how are you seeing that competitive situation develop this year as you look at your pipeline of design wins and engagements? Thank you.
Rick Clemmer: Yeah, so it's interesting because in some ways it actually helps the NFC market to have more suppliers in the market. You know clearly we want to continue to maintain our leadership position, but with the growth of the opportunity in the significant increase of smartphones that will have NFC included with those we think it still represents a good growth opportunity for us. As far competition, we've always known we'd have competition, we always knew that ultimately when you've got to be, NFC got to be a significant share of the market at we had see some risk of integration into the overall connectivity chip and as that takes place then we want to be sure we're focused on the secure element to be able to provide the bulletproof security that's really required associated with having NFC implemented in a fashion where the consumer feels comfortable associated with it. So, yeah we know we're going to have more competition, yeah it doesn't surprise me at all that some of our competitors are talking about strong market share growth because the market is growing, so rapidly it still represents a opportunities for growth for us even if some of our competitors do actually gain share associated with it.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America: Okay. Thank you, Rick.
Rick Clemmer: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jim Covello, Goldman Sachs. Go ahead please.
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: Great, thank you so much for taking my question I appreciate it. Rick you mentioned that your sell in to distribution was down 6% and the sell out there was minus 1%. What does your guidance assume about that dynamic going forward? Do you assume balance or do assume continued just the liquidation or draw down?
Rick Clemmer: It's an arm wrestling that goes on with each distributor, each quarter, and we're planning on it being fairly normalized, Jim. We want to be sure that we maintain our inventory levels around 2.4, some of the big guys would like to take that down closer to two months of inventory, as they are focused on their turns and earns, but our view is the margins that they get is based on not only the customer service but maintaining some of that inventory in place. So we would like to keep it in the 2.4, 2.5 months of inventory. But our plan really for our guidance for Q1 is predicated or based on that continuing it roughly at the same level associated with it.
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: Okay, great that's helpful. And then for my follow-up you mentioned you saw some improvement in orders. When did that improvement start and has it continued through the January?
Rick Clemmer: Well I think the, as we tried to say Jim and I just want to be very clear about it. We don't think it's like momentous improvement in orders.
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: Right.
Rick Clemmer: I know some of our peers are talking about you know they have seen improvement in orders and clearly we've seen you know order improve where, as we track it on a weekly basis we've seen more weeks that are better than worse. So but as far as being able to draw a trend from it I think we still are not counting on a huge uptick in orders associated with the outlook. We still see a rather anemic economic environment and we are not counting on clearly through the Q1 timeframe seeing a robust improvement associated with it. I think that we do see enough indicators that we feel comfortable that Q1 is truly the bottom and we feel pretty good about some of the opportunities for growth coming out of the Q1 timeframe. But, it's not like we see a definite robust turnaround in order rates that gives us a great deal of confidence it's just more of the general indicators and what we see from customers specifically associated with the design wins we have in place and being able to support those.
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: That's really helpful. Thanks so much I appreciate it.
Rick Clemmer: Thanks Jim.
Peter Kelly: Great, thanks, Jim.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Go ahead please.
Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley: Great, thank you. I wonder if you could talk about your inventory level, where you think that goes and where the factory utilization goes in the next couple of quarters.
Peter Kelly: So, factory utilization in the current quarter was 85, in Q4 it was 85%. We don't guide going forward but a little bit of color. We've seen in the - and this is a trend that we've seen over the past six months or so. Our IC factories are running pretty full and we're underutilized in our Standard Products factories and I guess I don't see any big change in that in the very, very short term. Inventory, we have seen inventory pickup over the past few quarters, so we're now at 107 days. One of the big items in there I have about $50 million of inventory which is I related to the closure of our ICN4 and ICN6, so that's to facilitate the closure and transfer of products into ICN8. And given we've been limited in terms of our 0.14 capacity over the past couple of quarters we've not really been able to build the buffer inventory that some of our larger customers would like us. So we're continuing to focus on that. I don't think you're going to see much of a change in terms of the number of days, but I'm pretty confident in our working capital control. I think, we understand what we did in inventory, our receivables are just excellent and our payables are extremely well managed.
Rick Clemmer: And you really have to take into account the factory shutdown and the inventory built to support that when you think about our inventory levels.
Peter Kelly: Yes, the $50 million.
Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley: That's very helpful, thank you very much.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Chris Caso, from Susquehanna Financial Group.
Chris Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group: Hi, thank you. I'm just following on to some of your earlier comments with respect to Q1 potentially bottoming here. What do you guys typically think about seasonality going forward as you look into Q2, Q3 obviously, it's early days now, but what are the puts and takes and what would you guys consider normal?
Rick Clemmer: You know the interesting thing is when you look at it historically, Q1 is usually our worst seasonal quarter. What we usually see is a little bit of down tick from Q4 and Q1, then we see a pretty robust growth in Q2, growth in Q3 and then see a little of roll off in Q4 and then further roll off again in Q1. So, it follows with those typical seasonal patterns that we see, although to be fair seasonal patterns are hard to determine by some of the economic environment we've seen over the last couple of years. But I think based on what we see from our customers and the indications associated with it, it gives us really confidence that we will in fact see the pickup in Q2 that we would expect on a seasonal basis and so we feel good about that.
Chris Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group: All right, great. And just following up on gross margins as well and with respect to your goals of improving that as we go through the year, could you work on it, talk about the timing of that obviously, part of that would be improving some of the factory loadings in Standard Products, I assume, could you give us, perhaps quantify some metrics on as the revenues grows, what we should expect with regard to gross margins as we model that through the year, how much falls through as the revenue improves?
Rick Clemmer: We're not really going to get into those kind of forward looking statements, I guess as far as we want to go as we're expecting by the time we exit the year, we want to get to about 50% on gross margin.
Chris Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group: All right, great. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from William Stein from Sun Trust. Go ahead please.
William Stein - SunTrust: Great, thanks for taking my question. If we take a step back and look at the capital structure and the use of cash, clearly, you've been primarily focused on paying down the debt and spending a bit to realign the cost structure, but if you get close to your margin targets as we exit the year and if see just a little bit of growth, it seems like you're going to hit your two times net lever target that you've discussed in the past, can you remind us about how the change in cash use priority will, what might unfold there?
William Stein - SunTrust: Well what we've said specifically as we're very focused on continuing to reduce our debt until we get down to the metrics of investment grade and at the time we get down to the metrics of investment grade, we'll look at it from a shareholder perspective and depending on where our stock price is, the equity value and opportunities that may exist in the market what creates the most shareholder value associated with it. If our interest rates continue where they are than there is clearly an opportunity to continue to pay down our debt and drive pretty significant leverage associated with that, but we'll continue to act in the best interests of shareholders about what would drive the most value after we get to metric associated with investment grade.
Peter Kelly: Yeah and our stock was still at $30 I guess we'd be big time buyers of our stock as well.
William Stein - SunTrust: That's helpful and as a follow-up if I can, you spoke about a refocus of the R&D afford and part of the expenditure or the expense recognized in the quarter was to realign R&D a bit, can you elaborate a little bit on the changes there please?
Peter Kelly: Yeah, yeah sure, we expect to run about 14% of our revenue in R&D. We think R&D is absolutely the critical part of the company, you know if we don't have the right products as there is no way to go. Having said that, these things with our R&D which we can improve, so we can be more effective in our support of R&D and our IT cost for example and some of the back office support, but also we have different types of resource that we're constantly looking at some of it seems like moving away from say some hardware engineers in the west towards software engineers in India, other parts of it are looking at, you know we are constantly look at our portfolio and term various projects so that we can create more investment for our more successful product lines. So it is that kind of thing, there is no, you know, there is nothing really, really big.
Rick Clemmer: Clearly we'll be increasing our R&D investment in areas where we think it drives a much higher level of probability. So it's more about tuning than anything else in R&D. The primary focus of the investments we'll be doing are improving our back office processes to be sure we've world class you know kind of non-customer phrasing expenses where we want to be sure that we're driving industry leading levels associated with it and this is really just taking that step to be able to facilitate them.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank: Hi guys, congrats on the solid results. First question is on the OpEx side of the things. With the new restructuring plan that you are putting into place Peter, I know you gave the percentages, but can you talk a little bit about that 305 to 310 range that you are guiding for the first quarter and how we should expect OpEx to trend on an absolute dollar basis through the year given this restructuring?
Peter Kelly: Well, I guess first I am going to say I am not going to give guidance for the rest of the year other than the fact that I want to get to 12% of revenue for SG&A by the time we exit 2013. So I am not really going to go into any more detail than that. I think what I would say though is we know how to manage OpEx and the plan that we do have is again really around support costs. So it's not planned to impact our customer facing teams, it's really expected to impact the support groups throughout the organization and obviously I understand its painful for them individually. But, you know we have come down to I'd rather spend less on finance and more on sales, I would rather spend less in IT and more on sales, and I would rather spend less on either support functions and that's really what we're doing Ross. I mean, again no big significant items. I guess the one thing that is difficult in Western Europe it just takes more time to work with the various works councils and unions and come up with an appropriate solution, so that is a bit more challenging then what we would normally expect to do in the U.S. or maybe out in Asia.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank: Thanks, then I guess my second question changing over to the interest expense side of the things. Given what you did in the fourth quarter and paying down some debt and today's announcement with another $500 million coming. How should we think about that 210 interest expense guidance that was the midpoint of your 2013 guidance before. It seems like you are already running below the midpoint of that range obviously any shot that you can update that for us?
Peter Kelly: Gosh, you're so tough, Ross. Yes, I will - probably $195 million to $200 million will be for the full year.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank: Great, thank you.
Peter Kelly: Thank you.
Rick Clemmer: Thanks, Ross.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh, from Sterne Agee. Go ahead please.
Vijay Rakesh - Sterne Agee: Hi guys, looks like you guys brought your interest expense down to $50 million a quarter and I saw you guys put up this press release on a debt offering. Just wanted to get some more thoughts around what you are going to do with it, how do you see that for the rest of the year of interest expense etcetera?
Peter Kelly: Well, interest expense we'd expect for the full year to be about $195 million to $200 million. We think we have a very, very solid balance sheet, but we will be opportunistic and to the extent that there is opportunities to address our debt we will do it.
Vijay Rakesh - Sterne Agee: Go it. And on the auto side, obviously 2012 was pretty good how do you see 2013 in terms of new products new customers that you're adding how do you see that growth above market in 2013.
Rick Clemmer: I am sorry. Ask the question again, Vijay?
Vijay Rakesh - Sterne Agee: On the automotive side how do you see 2013 in terms of new markets and new products, where do you expect to get the traction on automotive side in 2013?
Rick Clemmer: So if you look at our automotive business we still have some ramp up taking place with the second largest north America automotive manufacture on the remote keyless entry, but primarily growth that will take place associated with our automotive business will be in the care infotainment side in the development countries associated with the more in Asia and China in 2013. We expect with the overall car production to be flat 2% growth with actually Asia representing fairly healthy growth and may be Europe slightly down. So obviously the participation in automotive comes from additional platforms that were designed into in infotainment that's ramping now and we will continue ramp through of remainder of this year and then the growth that takes place in those developing countries in automotive.
Vijay Rakesh - Sterne Agee: Great. And last question on the fab side, obviously you're doing some good actions consolidating the fabs, there, how many fabs are down to now as you look at 2013 and how do if you were to take a stab at how do you see that going forward in 2014?
Rick Clemmer: The way to think about it really is in the Netherlands that we have 3 fabs in 2013 and 2014 that will be one fab. That will go from 4 to 6 and 8 into an 8" fab. And other than that we don't have any plans to eliminate any fabs the consolidation of MOS Technologies from the German fab to the Dutch fab is more of a these is a profit opportunity really and allows us to optimize both the German fab and on the Dutch fab.
Vijay Rakesh - Sterne Agee: Got it, thanks. Good job guys.
Rick Clemmer: Thanks. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Nitin Kumar from BNP Paribas. Go ahead, please.
Nitin Kumar - BNP Paribas: Good morning, guys. And congratulations, solid quarter. Quick question, you've been a little bit more retrospect in your macro outlook than some of the other guys in the industry but you're still looking at a pretty decent growth especially, thinking about your long-term margin goals can you help us understand like how much of that is coming from revenue growth and how much from just your cost reduction that you're talking about?
Peter Kelly: What I've said in the past is that the model that we have looked at I guess most recently is that industry might, our (inaudible) in the industry might grow about 2-3% in 2013 and we would think maybe we'd grow up to double that. So we achieve then, that gives me more enough revenue growth to hit the right number by the end of the year. And after that its focusing on the various cost reductions and margin improvements that we have in the plan.
Rick Clemmer: In addition to that, by the end of the year we would expect to have some monetization from our IP portfolio that would contribute towards to 25% operating income as well. Especially in areas of technology that are emerging where we have a very strong patent portfolio position.
Nitin Kumar - BNP Paribas: Okay great. And just a housekeeping question on Automotive. Can you give a geographic breakdown between the different regions in terms of your sales?
Rick Clemmer: It's impossible for us to do that, we can tell where we ship the product to but, Continental or Bosch may ship - product that we ship into - Europe into china Asia and all over the world and product that we ship into China and they may ship into Japan and other regions, so it really -- that is not so meaningful about our shipment and it's very difficult for us to track associated with it.
Nitin Kumar - BNP Paribas: Great, fair. Thank you.
Rick Clemmer: Thanks, Nitin. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Philip Scholte from Rabobank. Go ahead, please.
Philip Scholte - Rabobank: Yes, good morning, or afternoon. Regarding the IP licensing you just mentioned, can you quantify that little bit more and also in terms of timing when that will impact your margins. And my second question will be on your reiteration of the 25% EBIT margin target, does that include any significant recovery in the Standard Products because I mean you're obviously quite cautious on the economy so I would expect that in terms of utilization you wouldn't expect any improvement there, so does that assumes a flat environment for Standard Products?
Rick Clemmer: No. Our Standard Products business we'll have to improve the margins from the performance in Q4, we did have some one-shot items et cetera, but we fully expects Standard Products' margins to improve even without a robust economic environment improvement. So, the 25% definitely counts on Standard Products getting back into the operating model of 18% to 23% operating income margins that we have for that business.
Philip Scholte - Rabobank: (Inaudible)
Rick Clemmer: On the intellectual property income, we've been involved in this process for some time as you monetize our intellectual property, I've done this in previous companies before it takes a long time you have to go, search patents you have to actually follow law suits, go through that process. We're actually in process with at least - law suits with at least one other company at this point in time. And we'll see how that develops, but we would like to see something that would be contributing maybe as much as a 100 basis points to operating income by the end of the year associated with IP, and we actually have some IP income that takes place to today.
Philip Scholte - Rabobank: Right. All right. Thank you.
Peter Kelly: Thank you.
Rick Clemmer: Thank you.
Jeff Palmer: Alex we'll take one last caller if there's any more questions in the queue? 
Operator: We have no further questions in the queue at this time.
Jeff Palmer: Great. Well with that I think we'll end the call today. Thank you very much for all your time, Rick, did you want to make some closing remarks.
Rick Clemmer: Sure, thanks a lot for your support as well as you continued interest in NXP. In summary, we feel very good about our results in 2012 and believe that they demonstrate measurable success in executing our long-term strategy. The full year product revenue growth of over 7% despite an anemic economic environment, clearly indicates the share gains that we have specially in our HPMS market were we saw revenue growth of 13%, combined with 17% increase in our High Performance Mixed Signal operating income. Clearly, we believe that with the current economic environment as well as the seasonal patterns Q1 represents the bottom of the semiconductor cycle for us. And we expect to see good growth beyond Q1. And will help us continue to have strong cash flow generation over and above the $0.5 billion or so of pre-operating cash flow that we were able to generate in 2012. With all of that we think that we'll continue to be able to drive bottom line results that will continue to demonstrate strong improved performance. Thank you very much.
Peter Kelly: Thank you very much for your interest.
Operator: Thank you for joining today's conference call. This concludes your presentation. You may now disconnect good day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Third Quarter 2012 NXP Semiconductors NV Earnings Conference Call. My name is Sonia, and I will be your coordinator for today. I would now like to turn the representation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Jeff Palmer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.
Jeff Palmer: Thank you, Sonia and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the NXP Semiconductors' Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. With me on the call today is Rick Clemmer, NXP's President and CEO; and Peter Kelly, our CFO. If you've not obtained a copy of our third quarter 2012 earnings press release, it can be found at our company website under the Investor Relations section at nxp.com. Additionally, we will have posted a supplemental earnings summary presentation and an excel document of our historical financials to assist in your modeling efforts. This call is being recorded, and will be available for replay from our corporate website. Please be reminded that this call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause NXP's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the macroeconomic impact on the specific end-markets in which we operate, the sale of new and existing products and our expectations for financial results for the fourth quarter of 2012. Please be reminded that NXP undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statement. For a full disclosure on forward-looking statements, please refer to our press release. Additionally, during our call today, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the impact of purchase price accounting, restructuring, impairment and other charges that are driven primarily by discrete events that management does not consider to be directly related to NXP's underlying core operating performance. Pursuant to Regulation G, NXP has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our third quarter 2012 earnings press release, which will be furnished to the SEC on Form 6-K, and is available on NXP's website in the Investor Relations section at nxp.com. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Rick.
Richard L. Clemmer: Thanks, Jeff, and welcome everyone to our earnings call today. As is our practice, I will address revenue trends in our various markets and channels with Peter providing more color on profitability and other financial metrics. Looking at the third quarter, we are very pleased with our performance. Overall, the quarter developed basically in line with our expectations, even with the deteriorating economic environment, with the product revenue coming in at $1.11 billion. This represents a sequential increase of 9%, in line with the midpoint of our tightened guidance range. Total NXP revenue was $1.17 billion, a 7% sequential increase, in line with our guidance. Furthermore, our third quarter results mark an inflection point in year-on-year growth comparisons as product revenue increased nearly 15% versus the year ago period, confirming the growth we have been highlighting. Our performance during the quarter was a clear reflection of the company's specific growth of opportunities we have previously identified coming to fruition. We are optimistic about the contributions of these specific opportunities, including ID and our mobile design wins which were responsible for the bulk of this sequential growth, but we see the uncertain macro environment is creating real headwinds for the more cyclical portions of our business. Taken together, the overall growth of the company may be impacted over the next couple of quarters, notwithstanding the contributions from key high-volume design wins. Irrespective of the macro environment, our strategy continues to be focused on providing unique and differentiated product solutions to our customers which over the longer term period, should enable NXP to outpace the cyclical growth of the overall semiconductor market. Turning now to our segment performance. HPMS revenue was $901 million, a 12% sequential increase and up 24% from the year ago period. Within our ID business, revenue was $275 million, up 18% sequentially and up 72% from the third quarter of 2011, clearly better than our original expectations. We continued to experience healthy order trends across most of the portfolio, with our core ID business growing 14% on a sequential basis and representing about 75% of the total ID revenue. Within the core ID, automatic fare collection, infrastructure and tags and labels were all up in the quarter, while our bank card business experienced strong double-digit growth as it trend towards contactless bank cards continue to accelerate. Within our eGovernment product line, sales were off slightly on a sequential basis, consistent with our expectations after the strong trends during the first half of 2012. During the third quarter, our next-generation SmartMX2 secure element platform was awarded the industry's first common criteria EAL 6+ security certification by the German BSI. This is clearly a significant event as the intellectual property and capabilities embedded in our smart MX platforms are at the core of why NXP is the trusted the global leader in identification and security technology. To date, we have shipped over 1 billion SmartMX-based products into the marketplace with 86 countries leveraging our products for its ePassport solutions. Turning to our emerging ID business, which includes mobile transactions and authentication, revenue was up 30% sequentially and represented about 25% of the overall ID group revenue. Nearly all of the emerging ID growth in the quarter was due to NFC-based mobile transactions. Our design win momentum in mobile transaction continues to build as we continue to be tracking over 200 design opportunities, with roughly half of those programs in mass production. Furthermore, during the quarter we achieved 100 million unit shipment milestone for our industry-leading PN5444 NFC controller. Demand for this product is being driven not only by handset OEMs but also by consumer product manufacturers who are adopting NFC to enable short-range secure media-sharing solutions in a wide variety of products. The ID group continues to excel with a solid outlook even in the tough environment. Now moving to our Portable & Computing end-market, revenue was $220 million, up 24% sequentially, and 31% up from a year ago period as our success in the mobility space comes to fruition. During the second quarter, we experienced strong sequential growth due to the ramp in previously discussed design wins with demand for both high-speed interface solutions and logic devices as new mobility programs we have previously highlighted began to achieve their full ramp. The sale of MCU products were down slightly in the quarter, more reflection of the weaker demand within the broad industrial market. Turning to the Infrastructure & Industrial, revenue was $165 million, up about 13% sequentially, essentially in line with our expectations, while revenue was up about 1% versus the year ago period. During the third quarter, growth was driven primarily by an improvement in demand for our high-performance RF product sold to basestation OEMs. Both lightning drivers and silicon tuners were up modestly with our #1 leadership TV Tuner business at 9% of GreenChip power solutions were flat sequentially, a reflection of the challenging Notebook PC market environment. Within our Automotive business, revenue was $239 million, down 2%, slightly below our original expectations, but in line with the historically seasonality for Automotive business. Versus the third quarter of 2011, revenue was up 7% primarily due to share gains in OEM-based auto entertainment in keyless entry portion of the portfolio. From the product perspective, we experienced good sequential demand for entertainment products with in-vehicle networking and fixtures[ph] flattish with keyless door entry products declined modestly in the quarter after stronger trends in the first half year. We experienced very good trends with U.S. and major Asian suppliers while we achieved new -- where we achieved new record sales levels. This was offset by a weaker trend with European OEMs particularly in the mid to low-end of the market as well as some impact from exchange rates. Finally, turning to Standard Products business, revenue was $213 million, down 3% sequentially, that was slightly below our original expectations. Versus the year ago period, our Standard Products business was down 13% as the broad-based market has continued to weaken throughout the year, even with some partial offset in new trust product areas. Turning now to our distribution channel performance, total NXP sales into and out of distribution were aligned and were both up 4% from the prior quarter. Total distribution sales represented slightly less than 50% of total product sales, fairly consistent with long-term trends. We continue to tightly manage distribution inventory within our target range, with total months of supply on hand remaining at 2.4 months, basically flat with the prior quarter. Absolute dollars of inventory in the channel were up about 6% on a sequential basis as we position specific products to service certain high-volume programs by distribution. Due to the uncertain macro environment and our distribution partners being the primary channel to service the smaller, broader-based customers, we anticipate a more conservative bookings environment over the next quarter or so. From a geographic perspective, demand profile was similar to last quarter. All regions with exception of EMEA were up, with a particular double-digit strength coming from both the China and South Korean markets, a direct reflection of our success with the key mobile handset customers as well as contact with banking customers in China. In EMEA region, which accounts for about a quarter of our product revenue, we experienced weakness across the entire product portfolio, with the worst performance seen in the more broad-based exposed business like Standard Products into the lesser degree Identification and Automotive. In summary, the third quarter was a very good quarter for NXP. Many of the programs in mobile space we have worked diligently on are paying dividends, and we believe there's more to come when additional programs ramp up in mid 2013. Our focus will be to manage these areas of the business within our direct control, especially in light of the clearly weakened macro environment. Specifically, we are focused on managing our costs, driving cash generation and managing our debt. We believe if we are successful, our actions will result in a very good bottom line earnings growth. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Peter to discuss the financial details of the quarter.
Peter Kelly: Thank you, Rick, and good morning to everyone on today's call. As Rick has already covered the drivers of the revenue during the quarter, I'll move directly to the highlights of the P&L. Overall, it was a strong quarter. Revenue improved 7% sequentially, non-GAAP net income improved over 25% sequentially and net debt was reduced by just over $100 million. Subsequent to quarter end, we retired $202 million of our 2013 debt and late yesterday, announced that we have improved our liquidity by expanding our revolving credit facility to $805 million. We also announced that we intend to tender for up to $500 million of our 2018 9 3/4 senior secured debt. For the third quarter, revenue was $1.17 billion, in line with the midpoint of our guidance. We generated $542 million in non-GAAP gross profit, an increase of just over 7% sequentially. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 46.3%, slightly better than the previous quarter. Now let me turn to the operating segments. Within the HPMS segment, revenue was $901 million, up over 12% on the previous quarter. And operating margin was 23% of revenue, which at $208 million, was up over 18% sequentially. Non-GAAP gross profit was $465 million, an increase of nearly 9% sequentially. This represented 51.6% of revenue, a 170 basis point decline on the previous quarter driven by the relative mix of our volume drivers, as I discussed on our recent analyst day. Within our Standard Products segments, revenue was $213 million, down nearly 3% sequentially. And operating margin was 15.5%, which at $33 million, represents a 3% sequential improvement. Non-GAAP gross profit was $73 million, a 9% improvement over the prior period. Total operating expense was $311 million, up $8 million on a sequential basis and in line with the midpoint of our guidance range. From a total operating profit perspective, non-GAAP operating profit was $232 million, an increase of nearly 14% on a sequential basis and represents a 19.8% operating margin. Interest expense was $65 million, a little better than expected as we've paid down $50 million of our 2013 Super Priority Notes early in the quarter. And our noncontrolling interest was $16 million, a little higher than expected as a result of improved performance in our SSMC joint venture. Taken together, total NXP non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.56, in line with the midpoint of our guidance. I would note that included in our non-GAAP net income was $12 million of stock-based compensation or about $0.05 per share. Now, I would like to turn to the changes in our cash and debt. Cash at the end of the third quarter was $702 million, a sequential decline of $135 million, as a result of debt reduction actions. Our total gross debt improved by $237 million in the quarter down to the level of $3.58 billion. So overall, our total net debt at the end of Q3 was $2.88 billion, an improvement of $102 million versus the previous quarter. On September 7, we called $202 million of our 2013 Super Priority Notes with an effective call date of October 8. We have since retired these notes. We exited the quarter with a trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA of $989 million, and our ratio of net debt to trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA at the end of Q3 was $2.9 million. Turning to working capital metrics, days of inventory were 97 days, a decline of 9 days. Days receivable were 37 days, a decline of 1 day sequentially, while days payable was 79 days, a decline of 7 days. Taken together, our cash conversion cycle improved to 54 days from 57 days in the prior quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we increased the size of our revolver to EUR 620 million or approximately $805 million, and along with our excellent working capital management and the cash in our balance sheet, I believe we now have very strong liquidity. Cash flow from operations was $192 million, a result of strong revenue growth, improved operating profitability and positive working capital metrics. Net CapEx investment during the quarter was $92 million, resulting in positive free cash flow of $100 million. As you no doubt have now realized, our Treasurer and I have been busy during this past quarter and will continue to work on our liquidity and debt. And I continue to expect to reduce on that debt as our performance drops cash through to the bottom line. And largely as a result of our most recent actions, we now expect interest charges in 2013 to be in the range of $200 million to $220 million. Now, I would like to provide our outlook for Q4. As Rick mentioned, our view of the macro environment has clearly deteriorated since our last update. While we are very encouraged by the progress in ramping up several key design wins in multiple areas of our business, the weak demand environment is having an impact on the most cyclically oriented portions of our business. As we've said in past updates, our philosophy we guidance is to provide our stakeholders with the latest and most accurate view we have on potential business outcomes during the quarter. In this environment, it is an even more challenging undertaking. With these views as a backdrop for the fourth quarter, we currently anticipate product revenue will be in a range of down 3% to down 9% sequentially. At the midpoint, we expect product revenue to be down about 6% sequentially, reflecting the following trends in the business. On a percentage point basis, Automotive is expected to continue to be challenged by the macro environment and should be down about mid single-digit sequentially. Identification continues to demonstrate strength and is expected to be flat sequentially. Portable & Computing is expected to be down about 10% -- to be down about 10% sequentially, primarily due to macro weakness impacting the broad-based General Purpose Logic and Microcontroller business, offset by continued performance of key mobile design wins. Infrastructure & Industrial is expected to show seasonable -- seasonal declines and be down in the upper single-digit rates. Standard Products will continue to be impacted by the macroeconomic environment and is expected to be down in the upper single-digit range. We anticipate revenue from the combination of our Manufacturing segments and the Corporates and Other segment to be approximately $45 million. Taken together, total NXP revenue should be in the range of $1.059 billion to $1.126 billion or about $1.093 billion at the midpoint. Additional inputs to help you tune your models are as follows: net debt will be about flat quarter-on-quarter as we use the expected cash generated from operations to fund the redemption costs associated with the tender offer of the 2018 senior secured notes. We anticipate non-GAAP gross profit to be in a range of approximately $491 million to $524 million. We anticipate operating expense in Q4 to be in a range of approximately $305 million to $309 million. If taken together, this should translate into a non-GAAP operating profit in the range of about $187 million to $216 million. Net interest expense should be $53 million or $56 million, depending on the results of our tender. Cash tax expense should be approximately $11 million and noncontrolling interests should be about $17 million. Stock-based compensation is expected to be about $16 million, or about $0.06 per share, which is included in our non-GAAP results. Average diluted share count should be about 253.3 million shares and taken together, our guidance implies non-GAAP earnings per share in a range of $0.41 to $0.53 per share, or approximately $0.47 per share at the midpoint of our guidance range. Now we'd like to turn to your questions. Jeff?
Jeff Palmer: Sonia, could you please poll for questions, please?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of John Pitzer, Credit Suisse.
John W. Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I guess my first question for Rick, relative to the ID business, and the Portable & Computing business, could you just give us a little bit of breakdown of the buckets within that and how you see growth going into the calendar fourth quarter. I guess specifically, I'd be interested on the PNC side. How much do you -- what percent is core today versus kind of some of these new products that are ramping?
Richard L. Clemmer: Well, John, I think when you look at it, as we talk about the growth that we have in the business in Q3, of the 9%, there's maybe a percent or so that is kind of reflected in our I&I business associated with the basestations. But really, the bulk of growth comes from the combination of the growth of our ID business and mobile transactions which is roughly half of that 8%. And then significant design wins that we've talked about on the interface and switch site associated with Portable & Computing, which is roughly the other half associated with it. As we look at those, that ramp was a very significant ramp in Q3 and obviously was a significant contributor to the growth that we had with high-performance mixed signal being up 24% on a year-over-year basis. If we look at moving into Q4, we would expect that ramp is basically taking place. And so it'll be -- those specific programs will be relatively flat in Q4. And with our typical seasonal pattern, combined with the really anemic economic environment, more specifically in China for us, we see an outlook that will be down in the rest of our business driving the total reduction, that Peter talked about, of 3% to 9% for Q4 on a sequential basis, which by the way, will still be up over 25% from a year ago basis.
John W. Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And my follow up maybe for Peter. Peter I know Standard Products is a relatively small part of the business, but the model didn't work as I would have expected in Q3. On the plus side you guys did a much better job on gross margins. I'm kind of curious if that was mixed or if these are kind of structural cost changes that can go forward and I was a little bit surprised that the gross margin benefits didn't necessarily translate that out the operating lines. If you could just help me understand the Standard Products business a little bit better, that'll be helpful.
Peter Kelly: I guess there is -- I guess, a potential structural issue, if you like, John, in the sense that -- Standard Products at the moment, from a utilization perspective, is running quite weak. So the fixed costs tend to be quite high. So I think the biggest impact in Standard Products right now is, it comes in 2 areas: one, the macroeconomic environment is pretty weak, so pricing is tough, not -- certainly not any worse than we've seen in the previous quarter. But the loadings on their fabs is quite anemic at the moment. So until we see a turnaround, I don't think you're going to see a big fall through in the Standard Products here.
Richard L. Clemmer: Yes. So, John, maybe I could just add a little more color to that. There's -- some of the really low-end products that are very marginal, even gross margin, that we actually didn't participate in. We walked away from those orders. We did not want to continue to participate in that. So some of the aggressive price competition, primarily led by some of the Chinese manufacturers, we actually did not participate in as we've really tried to focus on our thrust areas. And even Standard Products, really, again are more focused on our smartphone customers where they really need more increased DSP protection etc. So that was one of the factors. We are doing a little bit on the R&D side. Not very significant dollar-wise. Investing in linear, really in the Standard Products base because of the inherent technology that we have in the significant market opportunity that we see associated with that. So we're investing in trying to be sure that we can get that business back within the target models that we believe that we can operate in. And It's just a contribution of how we get there, but clearly, we walked away from a reasonable amount of the true low-end business based on the aggressive price competition that we continue to see in that space.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of James Covello, Goldman Sachs.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: First question, you guys have had some terrific wins in high-profile, in the interface segment of your business. I guess a couple of questions around that. First, how comfortable do you feel about the IP around your interface products, such that no one could come in and sort of replicate that? I know there's been some noise around that in the market. Secondly, how do you kind of handicap the pluses and minuses of retaining some of the high-profile design wins you've had in future generations of products that you've already won versus, on the upside, the opportunity to pick up new products, maybe with some of those same customers with this technology?
Richard L. Clemmer: Thanks, Jim. I think that this really is a clear demonstration of our technical capability. I think, from our overall position, we believe that our IP is clearly adequately protested -- protected as we have a very strong IP portfolio and we clearly will utilize that to be sure that we protect our product position associated with it. So we're not significantly concerned about someone coming in. We think that our IP position, which we will be prepared to use to our fullest extent to protect our product's capability, will put us in a great position associated with it. Clearly for us, the opportunity has rolled us out to more and more successful smartphone and tablet customers and ability to drive the fundamental capability. So proving that technology and really being a significant player in the smartphone and tablet space, really puts us in a different position to be able to drive some of the volume and the increase in demand.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then if I could ask a follow up on the debt. I understand the comment about the forecast for 2013 interest expense being between $200 million and $220 million. It looks like that would assume no additional repayment of debt over the course of 2013, given essentially that's close to the run rate that we're on, exiting the fourth quarter. And so, are there things that you could do that aren't on those assumptions? Or is the idea that you've kind of done what you can, for the time being, on the paydown of incremental debt?
Peter Kelly: No. I mean, I think there's -- while we have the level of debt that we have, there's always more we can do. That just happens to be my best view right now.
Richard L. Clemmer: But clearly, our priority is continuing to pay down the debt. And we're going to generate a reasonable amount of cash as we move forward over the next few quarters and we'll continue to use that to focus on how we continue to reduce our debt.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya, Bank of America, Merrill Lynch.
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: It's interesting that I think because of the mix in HPMS this quarter, there's been some pressure on gross margins, but operating margins have actually grown quite nicely. Is that the new trend rate where gross margin perhaps stay below the targets but operating margins are ready to hit the targets? Or was that just a function of mix during this particular quarter?
Richard L. Clemmer: No. That's what we've talked about at the analyst day. It's what we expect to continue to see. We have not backed off of our gross margin target -- models. But as we talked about was some of the new higher-volume design wins that are not necessarily at the highest levels of gross margin, but deliver a very good bottom line. We expect to see some of that transition taking place, but very confident that we can make the improvements in operating income. Peter?
Peter Kelly: Yes. I know, I think, what I said in the Analyst Day is that I believe we can see a very clear track to get into our operating margin model relatively quickly. Gross margin, given the profile and the mix of our business at the moment, is a little bit more challenging. But, yes, absolutely, you should continue to see good performance from an operating margin perspective. And we do need to continue to work on gross margin.
Richard L. Clemmer: And it was not a one quarter phenomena.
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Right. And I think, Rick, you also mentioned in your prepared comments that the conditions could stay tough for a couple of quarters. Was that a general macro comment? Or was there anything specific to NXPI that you see? And I guess within that, if you could remind us what Q1 seasonality looks like.
Richard L. Clemmer: So I think it's really more of a reflection of the anemic economic environment we see. Clearly, China is very critical to us as a company, with as much of our business that flows into greater China, as it does. And so what we've seen, is we've definitely seen a slowdown take place in the market in China as more in line with the rest of the world. There's some discussion that after the elections, and then a few months after that, when they begin to provide the economic stimulus, we could see an improvement of the environment in China. But it's not something that we have a divine perspective of. I mean, we've really been talking about this for 3 or 4 quarters, an anemic economic environment. And we saw about a 3 or 4-month period of time where, clearly, China improved. It's not the case today. With that fundamental anemic economic environment, we're not optimistic about a real growth in the fundamental business, with the exception of the ramp up of these more specific design wins that we've talked about. But if you look at -- seasonally -- our seasonal pattern, which is hard to really talk about seasonal basis in the semiconductor business with the inherent of fundamental cyclicality, but we're typically down in Q4, as we talked about, and down in Q1 on a sequential basis, then with a really strong rebound in Q2 and Q3 before we then roll off slightly in Q4 and down in Q1. So that's kind of our typical seasonal pattern. But I'm not sure that there's anything that's very typical seasonal in the semiconductor business.
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: All right. And one last one, if I may. If macro conditions remained sluggish, as they are, should we expect to see bigger drawdowns from the distribution on -- or essentially more destocking in the China. I think mentioned selling them -- sell out for roughly the same, around 4% sequential growth in Q3?
Richard L. Clemmer: To be fair, that's always a challenge with our distribution partners. They would like to be sure that they reduce their inventory to the absolute lowest level possible. We'd like to be sure that they maintain adequate inventory to be able to supply our customer base. If you'd look at us, track us over the last year or so, we had been in the range of 2.4 to 2.7 months of inventory for the last 5 or 6 quarters. So we're clearly at the bottom end of the range that we've been in over this period of time and would not want to see those inventory levels go down significantly from where they are today. But -- and we think anything from 2 to 3 months of inventory is actually a very reasonable basis associated with it. So we feel comfortable that we're at the right level of inventory. That may not be the case in every different product area. You have to look at the absolute details associated with it, but we would not expect to -- we would not want to see a significant reduction associated with the distie inventories. But that's always a challenge in working with our partners associated with their turns and earns programs.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore, Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Just a question first, I think, for Peter on the gross margin side of things. Given your revenue guidance and what it sounds like being some conservatism on the inventory side of things, I'm a little surprised that the gross margins is holding in as well as it is in fourth quarter. Can you walk us through the puts and takes of your guidance?
Peter Kelly: The biggest impact we have on our gross margin at the moment, Ross, is really mix. We go from -- as we go from Q2 to Q3, the fall through is a little bit more -- a little bit higher than we would like, but actually where we expected it to be. So we're probably about $12 million short and that was, as I've said, that was driven primarily by mix. As we go into Q4, you see the fall through is only -- even as we reduced, the fall through is about 45%, which maybe is a little bit better than you expected. But it really is driven by mix. So there's nothing big from a cost perspective or a cost reduction perspective that is driving that number.
Richard L. Clemmer: So if I could just add one thing, Ross, if you really think about the gross margins, one of the key factors associated with that is factor utilization. And in our IC wafer fabs, we continue to be in a pretty good factor utilization, 92%, 91% plus. And so that continued strength of the factor utilization on the IC space continues to give us some ground basis, give us some foundation associated with our gross margins in HPMS. So I think that's really the key factor associated with it for us.
Peter Kelly: To be honest, Ross, we would -- as you know, our challenge at the moment is to continue to improve our gross margin. But it's going to be a while before you see us at the level that we'd like to see it at.
Richard L. Clemmer: And to be specific, I was talking about HPMS. Clearly in Standard Products, we're operating at lower factor utilization and it's clearly one of the pressures that we do have on gross margin, Ross.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: If the HPMS side, specifically, if the utilization sounds like it's staying pretty flat in the fourth quarter, what are your expectations on inventory? And I guess I'm a little surprised that you'd keep the utilization that high, given your macro commentary.
Peter Kelly: Well, I think you have to think about our manufacturing strategy, Ross. We don't actually build everything internally in the -- from an HPMS perspective. So for example, quite a lot of our ID revenue now is built in external factories and quite a portion of our P&C revenue is built in external factories. And they are both areas that are doing relatively well.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: I guess one final quick one, then. On your new product areas, I know new product ramps don't typically have seasonal, and seasonality these days is a difficult topic to begin with. But how should we think about those sorts of seasons -- those markets acting seasonally, considering that many of them are very consumer-oriented?
Richard L. Clemmer: Yes, I think we'll follow the normal smartphone and tablet seasonal patterns, Ross. You should think about it that way. We clearly ramped very aggressively in Q3. So we're kind of at the runway on the first 2 design wins at the -- in Q3. And so as we said, we'd expect that to be relatively flat for Q4, but then -- following kind of the seasonal patterns. And then with, really, the next major design win ramping, kind of middle of 2013. Although some smaller design wins that we'll actually have beginning to ramp between now and then, but not really as significant in moving the needle on the overall growth.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of CJ Muse, Barclays.
Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I guess, first question on gross margin. I guess, if you look at the wins that you have in ID and Computing and you look at your hybrid outsource strategy, how should we think about the uplift there as those wins come to fruition and you see greater magnitude there in the model in calendar '13? Is that something we should see starting kind of first half? Or is that more of a second half story?
Richard L. Clemmer: I'm not sure, CJ, I understood correctly. I guess the -- on some of these high-volume design wins, clearly they won't be the same profitability levels as kind of the fundamental rest of our business, but will drive more incremental growth. So we haven't talked about the specifics associated with those. But clearly not at the same levels. But a big chunk of that has clearly ramped in the Q3 results associated with it. So as far as any balancing associated with that, we've seen that in the Q3 results. It won't be a big factor, swinging one way or the other, as we go forward on a sequential basis from that Q3 base.
Peter Kelly: Yes. I think what I said in the Analyst Day is we see a path to exiting 2013 on an operating margin level of 25%. One of the challenges for us will be to continue to improve our gross margin percent. But the next milestone for us is to achieve a gross margin with a 5 in front of it. And that's something we're working diligently towards. But I think it'll be a while before you see that.
Richard L. Clemmer: For the total bottom line.
Peter Kelly: For the total bottom line, yes.
Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division: That's helpful. And I guess as a follow up, can you walk through some of the trends that you're seeing particularly on the industrial and auto side? And what you can share in terms of your thoughts of who -- if and when we'll see a recovery there?
Richard L. Clemmer: Well, industrial, I think you should talk about them separately, frankly. I think the industrial side, we're seeing just the overall impact of the absolutely poor or anemic economic environment across the board. And you tell me when the economy's going to improve, and I'll tell you that's when industrial area is going to improve. I am hopeful that as China gets through their government change and they begin to implement some of the programs that early next year we could see an improvement associated within marketplace in China. But that's a hope, as I said. In Automotive, clearly Automotive, there's some pressure, but we just talked about -- we had record shipments in Q3 in both North America and China. So I think that really talks about our portfolio and where we are and it's really going to be dependent upon the number of cars manufacturer, with clearly the projections on the number of units manufactured next year kind of slipping down a little bit. Kind of flat to low single-digit, with the kind of the expectations, which I think we're a little -- a few points higher than that maybe 3 or 4 months ago. So I clearly think that we see a reduced outlook, but not a precipitous decline associated with the automotive market.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Chris Caso, Susquehanna Financial Group.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: I just wondered if you could address some of the earlier comments on gross margins? And just to be clear, the margin targets that you set out for the end of 2013, the 50% operating margin -- I'm sorry 50% gross margin, 25% operating margin, are those still achievable in light of the current macro conditions or do we think we need to wait a little bit before we achieve those?
Peter Kelly: Well, I mean, just to be clear. We said 25% operating margin exiting the full year if the macroeconomic environment doesn't deteriorate, right? I didn't actually say when we get to the 50% on gross margin. So I'd like to continue to maintain that wiggle room. The reality is, if the macroeconomic environment continues to decline the way we've seen it in the last couple of months, yes, I think it would be a challenge. But...
Richard L. Clemmer: But if it doesn't worsen from here...
Peter Kelly: We'll be okay.
Richard L. Clemmer: We still feel very confident that we can outgrow the semiconductor market for 2013. And so the real question is, how bad does the overall economic environment get?
Peter Kelly: Yes.
Richard L. Clemmer: If it doesn't deteriorate significantly from here, then probably we're in that range. But if the economic environment were to continue to deteriorate, and some of the world's economies moved into a true recession, then clearly that would have an impact associated with it. But I don't think we've seen a precipitous enough decline in the economic environment that we would see any major change.
Peter Kelly: Yes. And clearly, we've demonstrated now that we can outgrow the general market. And there's no reason that we should let that one continue.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: All right. That's fair enough. My crystal ball on that isn't any better than yours. As a follow up, if maybe you could address the PC market, that's one of the areas where we've seen some others see some larger than normal declines here in the fourth quarter. Could you talk about -- and I guess as I look at your Portable & Computing business, it's still down year-over-year despite the handset design wins. Could you address that and sort of where we are with that? What's your exposure and what your outlook is for that part of the market?
Richard L. Clemmer: Actually, we should clarify. If you look at our P&C business, we're up 31% from a year ago in Q3. And if we're flat, it'll still be strong increase year-over-year in Q4. So I think we are experiencing the growth from those design wins that allows us to have that kind of fundamental growth on a year-over-year basis is significantly associated with it. If you look at the absolute PC, because PC -- when we talk about Portable & Computing, we're actually talking about more on smartphones and tablets as opposed to specifically PC side. But we do have products that go in PCs. Some of our interface products, some of our standard products and some of our logic products that do go into PCs. But really probably the most significant area with the concentration into the network PC business is our GreenChip basis, on the power supplies associated with that. And as we talked about, that business was flat for us in Q3. So we're not expecting to see a huge decline. But again, it's more focused on the notebook side. And what we've really found out is, is that some of the inventory gyrations associated with that space has more of an impact than just the fundamental PC demand, to be honest. But it's not a significant factor in our overall business, other than kind of the standard products and logic and discretes and some of the interface parts that we ship into the PC market itself.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Joe Moore, Morgan Stanley.
Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: You mentioned in the Industrial business at the high-performance RF sold to basestations were strong. Can you just give a little more color on that? How much of that is sort of your product cycle design wins versus strength in the market?
Richard L. Clemmer: It's really only associated with our design wins. If you look at -- as we move forward in 3G and LTE, we have a significant share of the design wins. It's kind of most of the key customers have decided that our technology is kind of the technology of choice associated with it. So as the industry basestation deployment moves more towards to LTE and 3G, clearly we will have a much larger share than we did in the 2G and 2.5G markets where we had a relatively low market share. But those design wins have been years into fruition as we've worked on them. And now we see that taking place specifically in the Q3 results. But what we found in the basestation market is, is it is probably one of the more volatile in the quarter-by-quarter basis of any segment of our business. So having those design wins is really the first step associated with it. And then how we manage the supply chain associated with the volatility in orders, or lack thereof, of basestation deployment throughout the infrastructure, is frankly probably one of the more significant challenges. But we've made excellent progress in the high-performance RF. And I think that we're the true leader in technology on the 3G and LTE basestations.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh, Sterne Agee.
Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: I think you've managed your costs pretty well and the hybrid model has been helping gross margins also. Can you talk about what other initiatives you have in moving the operating margin goal from 18% to 25%?
Peter Kelly: I'm sorry, the line wasn't very good there, could you just repeat your question?
Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: I said you managed your cost pretty nicely here. And the hybrid model is helping your gross margins, but can you talk about what initiatives you have in moving the operating margin from 18% to 25%?
Richard L. Clemmer: What can we do.
Peter Kelly: There's a number of things we can do. But one of the things that really helps us is, as we grow with these specific design wins, how we grow -- and in how we grow with our ID business in particular, there are businesses where we've -- we get relatively weaker gross margin than our normal entitlement. But the volume could resolve fixed costs in a much better way. So the pull through that we get is pretty substantial, actually.
Richard L. Clemmer: Yes, I think it's probably worth pointing out that with the very anemic economic environment that we see, we're being very selective with some of our investments. Clearly we're -- we continue to step up our investments in our ID business and focus on the smartphones and tablets space. But in a lot of the other areas, we're basically pushing out some of the increased investments until we see a more robust economic environment where we feel like we have the capability to make those investments. So I think that's really a factor for us, is being very focused and very selective on our R&D investments. And clearly, we want to be sure that on the SG&A side, we move towards best-in-class from overall semiconductor performance viewpoint.
Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Got it. And one last question. When you look at your interest payments, it's already running at that $200 million, $220 million level for next year. I think there was a previous question to that. Any idea what cash flow you -- any reason why you're not going to start to look at some of these payments -- paydowns again later next year or middle next year?
Peter Kelly: You guys are tough. So only a quarter ago, I was saying $240 million to $260 million. So I thought you'd be pretty pleased with $200 million to $220 million. But, yes, as we generate the cash, I will absolutely look at what we do with that. And we're extremely committed to paying down our debt. So...
Richard L. Clemmer: And we actually have some debt that comes due in 2013 that we'll pay down from just our operating cash flow.
Peter Kelly: Yes. Right.
Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Got it. And what is the cap rates for next year? Did you give that out, yet?
Peter Kelly: What we typically talk about is 5% of revenue through the cycle.
Richard L. Clemmer: Thanks, Vijay.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Gareth Jenkins, UBS.
Gareth Jenkins - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I just wanted to -- question on the MCU market to the trends you're seeing there, particularly emulation to the 32-bit versus 8-bit. I think you cited at your Analyst Day that 8-bit was expected to be down around 14%, I just wonder if you've seen any further deterioration on that? And any further acceleration in the 32-bit or recover, I should say? And then secondly, I just wonder if you could give a sense of book-to-bill, basically, on the major areas as we head into the quarter, what the booking is looking like, and how that's moving.
Richard L. Clemmer: So first off on the microcontroller side, we talked about 32-bit being weak in the -- at 32-bit for serving 32-bit ARM base, serving the industrial market actually being weak in Q3 still. So I think that's probably -- it is weak and until the general economic environment improves, we would not expect to see a robust recovery associated with the 32-bit ARM base microcontroller business. And I'm specific about that because a significant portion of our ID business obviously is secure microcontrollers as well. So I'm just trying to be specific about the 32-bit ARM based microcontrollers for the industrial space. And I'm sorry, I forgot what the second part of your question was?
Peter Kelly: Book-to-bill.
Gareth Jenkins - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Book-to-bill.
Richard L. Clemmer: You know, Gareth, we don't provide a book-to-bill number on our call. Primarily because our business has very different patterns across different end-markets. So really if we give you a number, it's really not very insightful. And that it might actually cause you to draw the wrong conclusion. So we really -- it's not our metric that we provide on our earnings call. The one thing that we should say is, is that orders have been weak for the -- for Q3, I think we've said that. And they continue to be weak. We feel comfortable with the guidance that we've said for the Q4 timeframe. But clearly orders are weak and we have to be sure that we continue to perform to be able to execute the revenue guidance that we've laid out for Q4.
Gareth Jenkins - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: And just as a follow up, I mean you've talked kind of at length about inventories and your own inventories and the disties inventories but have you any sense of the OEM inventory levels? I mean it feels like there's still a fair bit of inventory sitting at the OEMs , in both autos and industrial. But have you got any sense of that?
Richard L. Clemmer: Autos, I think when it comes down to many factors. There's inventory levels that head throughout the value chain. I understand that there are some cases where there's inventory of high-end cars in certain regions. So clearly that will be a factor and have to be worked down. I think that as we look at flat to 1 or 2 percentage point increase in overall automotive shipments in 2013, that comprehends the expectation associated with normalizing the inventory in Automotive space. In Industrial space, everybody has a theory about where inventories are. I don't really believe that with the industry -- that all of our end customers, the way they are today, that there's a huge amount of inventory because a lot of our customers are on a pull basis and I just don't believe that they have a significant ramp up of inventory in place. I see a lot of the press, but we certainly have no specifics that would confirm that.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur, JP Morgan.
Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: On the ramp -- it's good to see the ramp of your first 2 high-speed interface products with your smartphone customer, and it sounds like, Rick, you're still on track to ramping your third interface product kind of middle of next year. I guess, my first question is, is NXP sole sourced on all 3 of these products?
Richard L. Clemmer: Well so, Harlan, first off, we should be specific. The first 2 design wins, one of those is a very sophisticated interface part and other one is a simple switch that is in it. So I just want to be clear associated with it. If you look at the design win that we talked about that will ramp in mid 2013, it's actually a microcontroller associated with it, with unique applications associated with it. But we think that we're in a very solid position. Our customers have various sources of supply. We think that we're in a very good position associated with these. And we'll continue to move forward in supporting all of our customers with the deployment of this technology.
Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Great. And then as it relates to your RF -- your high-power RF -- power amplifiers grew quite nicely in the third quarter. Just wondering what's embedded in your guidance for those particular products in your outlook for the fourth quarter?
Richard L. Clemmer: Well, we don't expect to see the -- with the current expectations from customers, we wouldn't see that growth. We'd see -- as we talked about earlier, that particular segment is very choppy associated with it. And we don't break down the specific guidance on our high performance RF but the -- we're, I guess the real question is, is when will the ramp up of basestations take place on 3G and LTE? I continue to believe that the fundamental requirements of data processing are going to drive a further increase in demand in basestations. And as that takes place, we feel very comfortable with the design wins that we have we'll be in a leadership position of ramp up of revenue. But it's going to continue to be choppy and we're certainly not planning on any growth and maybe a slight decline in Q4 associated with basestations.
Peter Kelly: Yes. Just to add to Rick's comments there. When we talk about our guidance from Q2 to Q3, we mentioned that the increase in basestations was probably because we think some of our customers have gotten pretty lean in terms of their inventory, so they needed to restock a little. So you do see those swings that Rick talked about. And yes, Q4 will definitely not be as strong as Q3 for the base stations.
Richard L. Clemmer: But going into 2013, we're very optimistic as the -- as 3G and LTE basestations ramp, it will be in a great position, Harlan.
Jeff Palmer: Sonia, we'll take one more call, please.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Philip Scholte, Rabobank Bank.
Philip Scholte - Rabobank Equity Research: Given your comments on your macroeconomic view, are there other any additional measures you are taking directly to protect margin in terms of cost savings, closing down specific parts of fabs? Anything in that respect?
Richard L. Clemmer: Well, we announced the -- a couple of quarters ago that we're going to take our 3 fabs and 9 meg [ph] in the Netherlands and move that over an extended period of time into one 8-inch facility to continue to drop further cost reductions associated with that. So we continue to work on that and work towards that. We'll always be working on our factory loadings and ensuring that we drive our cost reductions associated with it. But that's kind of the fundamental requirement in the semiconductor industry. And we'll continue to work on programs. As I said, we're very focused on being sure that we move to top-tier SG&A performance. And clearly, that's an area that we'll continue to work as well.
Philip Scholte - Rabobank Equity Research: Right. And maybe as a follow up, do you provide a geographical breakdown of the Automotive part?
Richard L. Clemmer: We do not. The real problem with that is, is as we ship to our customers, we're not sure where they actually deploy that. Because they actually move product around. So anything that we would tell you on a regional basis, we think would be misleading. But it is important to realize that we had record shipments into North America and China in the Q3 timeframe in our Automotive business.
Operator: Thank you, I would now like to hand the call over to Mr. Clemmer for closing remarks.
Richard L. Clemmer: Thank you, operator. So we thank you for your continued interest in NXP. In summary, we believe that our Q3 results demonstrated measurable success in executing our long-term strategy. Specifically, achieving product revenue growth of 9% in this overall economic environment, clearly better growth than our peers, really confirms the strategy that we've put in place and have been discussing with you. We delivered improved operational performance resulting in a 25% sequential improvement in net income. And then the resulting $100 million of free cash flow generation clearly continues to drive our focus on deleveraging our balance sheet and continuing to reduce our debt with the repayment of $200 million of high coupon Super Priority Notes. With the fundamental anemic economic environment continuing to challenge sustained revenue growth, we think that our progress in new areas of engagement, position NXP in a positive fashion that will support better than industry performance. Thank you so much.
Peter Kelly: Thank you, everyone. And we'll speak to you in the future. Thank you, operator.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Good day.

Please be reminded that NXP undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements. For a full disclosure on forward-looking statements, please refer to our press release. Additionally, during our call today, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the impact of purchase price accounting, restructuring, impairment and other charge -- charges that are driven primarily by discrete events that management does not consider to be directly related to NXP's underlying core operating performance. Pursuant to Regulation G, NXP has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our second quarter 2012 earnings press release, which will be furnished to the SEC on Form 6-K, and available on NXP's website in the Investor Relations section at nxp.com. Before we begin today, I would like to highlight that we have changed 2 of the 4 end markets we will report within our HPMS segments. We have defined the new end markets as portable and computing and infrastructure and industrial. These 2 new end markets replace what were previously known as Wireless Infrastructure, Lighting and Industrial, as well as the end market known as mobile, consumer and computing. Included in the supplemental presentation on our IR website, we have provided a bridge and an explanation of what specific products are reflected in each new end market definition. There has been no changes to the automotive and identification end market definitions. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Rick.
Richard L. Clemmer: Thanks, Jeff and welcome, everyone, to our earnings call today. As is our practice, I will address revenue trends in our various markets and channels with Peter Kelly now providing more color on profitability and other financial metrics. We are very pleased with our performance in the second quarter as we delivered product revenue of $1.02 billion, up 12% sequentially above the high end of our original guidance. NXP revenue was $1.09 billion, up nearly 12% sequentially, also above the upper end of our guidance range. We experienced growth in every one of our target end markets, a positive indication that company specific opportunities we have previously addressed are coming to fruition. We acknowledge the macro environment has clearly weakened, however, we see our growth in the intermediate term as less dependent on the cyclical industry rebound and more a function of unique company-specific design wins. From a segment perspective, HPMS revenue was $803 million, a 13% sequential increase and $30 million above the midpoint of our guidance. As Jeff commented, we have changed 2 of our end market definitions within HPMS to better reflect our strategic focus in the mobile computing and specialized industrial areas. My comments today will reflect these new definitions. Overall, we experienced solid growth in all of our HPMS segment end markets and in most cases delivered performance above our guidance. Within our automotive business, revenue was $244 million, up nearly 7% above the high end of our expectations with record levels set in North America and China markets. From a product perspective, we experienced strong sequential demand for entertainment and sensor products, with keyless door entry products in line with our expectations while in-vehicle networking declined modestly in the quarter principally due to softening demand from European automotive OEMs. However, we continue to see luxury brands driving resilient demand and trends in North America and Japan strengthened during the quarter, albeit with increasing chatter of weakening demand for mass-market vehicles in Europe, Middle East and Africa. We believe we gained share during the second quarter against an automotive semi [ph] market which we anticipate will reflect flat overall growth. Furthermore, we are beginning to see our efforts outside of our core automotive business beginning to pick up some steam. As an example, we were awarded designs for our new interior ambient LED lighting product, which combine our LED lighting driver and in-vehicle networking technology into a flexible lighting solution. Within our ID business, revenue was $234 million, up 25% sequentially, about $9 million better than our original expectations. We experienced robust order trends across most of the portfolio with our core ID business growing about 12% on a sequential basis and representing approximately 80% of the total ID revenue. Within our core ID franchise, automatic fare collection, banking and tags and labels were all up robustly in the quarter, while our eGov product line was flattish sequentially but within our original expectations. Within our emerging ID business, which includes mobile transactions and authentication, revenue was $50 million, up $27 million sequentially. Our mobile transaction design win momentum continues to build not only in shipments but also with approximately 200 unique handset and tablet design wins awarded. Of these projects, roughly 40% are either in production or moving toward production over the few quarters. The unique leadership position that NXP has in security solutions is driven by the broad ecosystem, including applications, software and antenna knowledge. Moving now to our newly defined Portable & Computing or as the P&C end market revenue, we were up $179 million, up 14% sequentially. As we highlighted last quarter, we brought Dave French, a 30-year industry veteran, including being the previous CEO of Cirrus Logic, to lead the new P&C group. Within P&C we have brought together our 32-bit ARM MCU products, our high-speed interface solutions and our general-purpose logic products into a single focus group. We took this step because our customers consistently seek synergies across the portfolio, which has led to several significant design wins in the smartphone and tablet market, an end market which we have historically not participated in. From a sizing perspective, over the trailing 4 quarters, the MCU and high-speed interface product lines are roughly similar in size and each contributes just under 1/3 to the overall revenue of the P&C group with the remainder being the logic product line. During the second quarter, we experienced strong sequential growth due to demand for both MCU and high-speed interfaces additions, while revenue from logic was flattish. Turning to the newly defined Infrastructure & Industrial, or the I&I end market, revenue was $146 million, up about 7% sequentially. From a product offering perspective, this group is focused on High Performance RF or HPRF products, power and lighting solutions, silicon front-end tuners, as well as new emerging low-power RF solutions for the health care and consumer markets. From a sizing perspective, HPRF is the largest single business in the group, representing about half the revenue over the last 4 quarters. The HPRF product portfolio is predominantly focused on cellular base stations including power amplifiers and small signal L&A devices, both areas where we continue to gain share in 3G and LTE base stations. Additionally, we have a solid presence in the broadcast, aerospace and defense markets for radar systems. During the second quarter, HPRF solutions for base stations were down slightly consistent with overall base station market, with other HPRF products down mid-single digits. Moving to the silicon front-end tuner product line, this represents about 1/4 of the group revenue over the last 4 quarters. This in a scenario that NXP is a market share leader with a relative market share of nearly 2x our nearest competitor. During the quarter, the front-end tuner business was up roughly in line with the overall I&I growth rate of 7%. Lastly, the remainder of I&I is made up of our power, lighting and emerging product solutions, which grew strongly on a sequential basis, primarily due to power and lighting solutions and offer an opportunity for well above industry growth if we can successfully execute our strategy. Finally, turning to Standard Products business, revenue was $219 million, up about 8%, essentially in line with our guidance although the environment was clearly much more challenging. From a channel perspective, sales into distribution increased by approximately 14% as our distribution partners supported new design programs ramping into production. Resales out of distribution were up about 3% from the prior quarter. We continue to manage distribution inventory within our target range with total months of supply on hand at being flat at 2.4 months this quarter. Absolute dollars of inventory in the channel were up slightly on a sequential basis. Our distribution partners continue to be fairly conservative on future demand based on the ongoing anemic growth in the world's economies. From a geographic perspective, all regions with the exception of EMEA were up, with the particular strength coming from the combination of China and South Asia-Pacific end markets. In the EMEA region, which accounts for about 1/4 of our product revenue, the weakness predominantly affected our automotive business, but we did see some slowdown in our ID and I&I groups as well. Before I turn the call over to Peter, I would like to address the #1 question we get asked by investors and analysts. Specifically, what are the key growth drivers that give us the confidence that we can outgrow our peer group? We look at the incremental revenue over the last 4 quarters, assuming we achieve the midpoint of our Q3 guidance, the key areas which have and should continue to drive our outperformance are as follows: First, our ID business is key, both the core and emerging products, markets where we held a strong lead in all our focused areas. This will be driven by increased demand to contactless banking products as the U.S. and China both begin to roll out new upgrades, new eGovernment tenders and infrastructure upgrade programs. Layered on top of our core business is the recent accelerated ramp of most mobile transactions and the future rollout of new authentication programs in our emerging ID business. Taken together, this should contribute roughly 2/3 of our incremental revenue through the third quarter. Secondly, we have discussed 3 design opportunities in the tablet and smartphone space, all outside of NXP, which contribute strong growth. We have discussed a high-speed aggregation interface device, which has just begun production, a product authentication device, which includes a load control switch and a companion authentication device. This should enter production for us in the fall of 2012. And finally, an MCU-based system control design, which should enter production in the spring of 2013. Each of these designs should contribute roughly $200 million to $250 million of incremental revenue over a 3-year design life. While we are in the very early stage in the cycle in these opportunities and they should contribute roughly 1/3 of our incremental revenue through the third quarter. Thirdly, we have discussed our auto franchise, which should be a good contributor to growth in an annualized basis versus 2011. In the automotive semiconductor market, we hold strong market shares in our focused areas, which should continued growth due to OEM design for keyless door entry and entertainment systems. Additionally, we have opportunities grow into new adjacencies, including the area of solid-state lighting, but note, new auto designs take longer to provide incremental growth. Regardless, through the third quarter we anticipate our automotive business contribute approximately 10% of our incremental growth. Above and beyond the previously noted opportunities, we see the incremental growth in our HPRF and standard product portfolios. Taken together, we see our growth as clearly a function of company-specific designs. We continue to believe the combination of our unique product portfolio, applications knowledge and laser focus on customer requirements should enable NXP to grow in excess of the overall semiconductor industry. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Peter to discuss the financial details of the quarter.
Peter Kelly: Thank you, Rick and good morning to everyone on today's call. As Rick has already covered the drivers of the revenue during the quarter, I will move directly to the highlights of the P&L. In the second quarter, revenue was $1.09 billion, an increase of 12% sequentially and $23 million above the upper end of our guidance. We generated $505 million in non-GAAP gross profit, nearly a 17% increase sequentially and $6 million above the midpoint of our guidance. Non-GAAP gross margin was 46.2%, a 190 basis point sequential improvement from Q1, slightly below the midpoint of our guidance range on a percentage point basis, impacted by a weaker-than-expected recovery in our Standard Products segment and stronger shipments than planned in the ramp of high-volume design wins. Non-GAAP gross profit increased by $72 million quarter-on-quarter of which about 2/3 was from the pull-through on the additional revenue and about 1/3 from the improvement in fab utilization of 13 points from Q4 to Q1. Turning to the operating segments. Within the HPMS segment, non-GAAP gross profit was $428 million or 53.3% of revenue, a 180 basis point improvement versus the prior quarter due to the items previously discussed. Within our Standard Products segment, non-GAAP gross profit was $67 million or 30.6% of revenue, a 140 basis points sequential improvement. Although an improvement quarter-on-quarter, it was less than expected and we continue to see this part of our business impacted and continuing to be impacted by the general lack of recovery in the industry. Total operating expenses were $303 million, up $10 million on a sequential basis and in line with the midpoint of our guidance. From an operating profit perspective, total NXP non-GAAP operating profit was $204 million, an increase of nearly 45% on a sequential basis and represents for the quarter an 18.6% operating margin. Interest expense was $70 million, essentially in line with our expectations and our noncontrolling interest was $16 million, a result of improving utilization rates at SSMC. Taken together, total NXP non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.45, $0.05 better than the midpoint of our guidance, of which about $0.02 was due to better than anticipated cash taxes. Now I would like to turn to changes in our cash and debt. Cash at the end of the second quarter was $837 million, a sequential increase of $55 million. During the quarter, we experienced several cash movements which I would like to highlight. First, SSMC, our consolidated joint venture fab with TSMC, declared and paid a $100 million special dividend to shareholders. Due to the consolidation of SSMC financials into NXP, we made a payment of $39 million to TSMC. Secondly, we paid $45 million to Dover Corporation in the final settlement following failure to meet certain contractual performance covenants. Lastly, we received $59 million relating to the settlement of an outstanding legal claim. Total debt was $3.82 billion, a sequential increase of $10 million, primarily due to currency translation effects of our debt. Our total net debt at the end of Q2 was $2.98 billion, a decline of $865 million from the year-ago period and a reduction of $65 million versus the previous quarter. We exited the quarter with a trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA of $974 million. And our ratio of net debt to trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA was 3.1. Turning to working capital metrics. Days of inventory were 106 days, an increase of 4 days. Days receivable were 38 days, flat sequentially, while days payable were 86, up 10 days sequentially, reflecting the growth of material costs to support increased sales. Taken together, our cash conversion cycle improved to 57 days from 64 days in the prior quarter. Cash flow from operations was $269 million, a result of growing revenues and improved profitability, supported by positive working capital metrics and the positive impact of currency translation effects on our debt. Net CapEx investment during the quarter was $73 million, and resulted in a positive free cash flow of $196 million or 18% free cash flow model [indiscernible]. During the quarter, we spent $37 million on share repurchases under our existing program to offset future equity dilution. Now I would like to provide our outlook for Q3. As Rick mentioned, we believe our performance over the medium term is a function of our success with key customers and less related or -- less related to or anticipating a semiconductor cycle rebound. We acknowledge the challenging macro environment, which we are not immune to. Furthermore, as many of our new opportunities are in high-volume, consumer-focused mobile applications, we anticipate our gross margin will likely grow more slowly than originally envisaged as these programs drive an increasing part of our revenue growth. However, we believe through good expense control, our model can deliver positive operating leverage, resulting in strong operating margins and positive cash flow. With these views as the backdrop, we currently anticipate product revenue will increase in a range of 6% to 12% sequentially. At the midpoint, we expect product revenue to be up about 9% sequentially -- about 9% sequentially in Q3 to $1.11 billion, reflecting the following trends in our business. Automotive is expected to be about flat consistent with normal seasonality and reflecting a more challenging environment in Europe. Identification is expected to be up about 10% sequentially, predominantly driven by banking and mobile transactions. Portable & Computing is expected to be up over 20% sequentially as the new high-speed interfaces and logic programs Rick discussed earlier, are expected to accelerate. Infrastructure & Industrial is expected to grow in the low teens on a percentage point basis as we are seeing a positive improvement in demand for our HPRF products from base station customers. Standard Products is expected to be about flat with the impact of the general macroeconomic environment. We anticipate revenue from the combination of our manufacturing, corporate and other segments to be approximately $60 million. Taken together, total NXP revenue should be up in a range of 4% to 10% sequentially. Additional input that will help you tune your models are as follows: We anticipate non-GAAP gross profit to be in the range of approximately $526 million to $567 million, driven by higher revenue, improvements in factory utilization and tempered by the margin profile of certain high-volume programs as previously discussed; we anticipate operating expense in Q3 to be in a range of approximately $310 million to $315 million with a sequential increase primarily due to investments in new programs. Over the medium term, we anticipate our operating expenses should track roughly in a range of 1/3 to 1/2 the rate of our revenue growth. Taken together, this should translate into a non-GAAP operating profit in the range of about $217 million to $253 million. Net interest expense should be around $68 million. Cash tax expense should be approximately $9 million to $12 million or about $11 million at the midpoint. Noncontrolling interests should be about $14 million, plus or minus $2 million. Average diluted share count should be about 254 million shares. Taken together, our guidance implies non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.50 to $0.62 per share or approximately $0.56 per share at the midpoint of our guidance range. Now we'd like to turn to your questions. Jeff?
Jeff Palmer: Shequanna, could you please poll for questions?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse representing Barclays.
Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I guess first question on the gross margin side, can you walk us through when we should see the benefit from the falloff of these new designs, as well as improvement for Standard Products? And what the time line looks like, assuming business stays at current levels, where we can achieve that 48%, 49% gross margins?
Richard L. Clemmer: Yes. So CJ, I think clearly the headwinds in the Standard Products is creating some issues specifically on Standard Products' gross margin and having clearly an overall impact on our total. I think the easiest thing to say is we're still committed to the models that we put in place. We still think that we have the opportunity to move forward with that. On an operating margin basis, we feel very comfortable that we'll be able to move to 25%-plus operating income associated with it. But with some of these higher volumes -- the success, the real success we've had on some of these new design wins as they ramp up, they won't have the same kind of gross margin profile as our -- as much of our core business. It's much lower volume and runs through different channels to the market. So there will be some influence on our overall gross margin performance associated with that, but we don't expect it to have any impact whatsoever on our operating income basis and believe that the inherent increased value driven by the upside revenue at a very nice profitability creates a significant opportunity. But clearly, we are not changing our model perspective on gross margins and all and it just creates a little bit of a transitionary basis that give us a little more of a challenge on gross margins per se in the near term. Peter do you have anything else you want to add?
Peter Kelly: No, I think that's a -- I think that's a good summary of it.
Richard L. Clemmer: C.J. do you have a follow-up?
Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Yes, that's helpful. And as a follow-up, I was hoping you could walk through what typical seasonality looks like in Q4. I'm particularly interested in the ID side where -- whether or not we see any budget flush or whatnot?
Richard L. Clemmer: Our Q4 is typically seasonally down a little bit after a strong Q3 on a seasonal basis. So I think that's probably the best way to say it now. This year with overall uncertainty in the overall world's economies and how all that plays out, it clearly could be somewhat different one way or the other and the continued ramp up of these new design wins we talk about will have somewhat of a tapering effect. But clearly, our seasonal pattern would be that we would be down in the Q4 time frame.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Covello representing Goldman Sachs.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: It's Jim Schneider for Jim Covello. Just a follow-up on the margin side. You talked about some of the impacts of mix are affecting the near term results. From here, are there any more structural things that you anticipate you could do on the cost side to heave back towards that 54% low end of the target range? Or is it basically just mid-room [indiscernible] by mix from here?
Richard L. Clemmer: No. I think there are clearly some things we'll do, Jim. We talked about the fact that we have 6-inch -- a 4 and a 6-inch facility in the Netherlands that over the next couple of years we'll be consolidating into our 8-inch facility there as we go through the customer requalifications and the transition associated with that. That's not something that will happen near term, but it's a process that's underway as we build the bridge inventory to be able to do that and clearly, will have some impact in the near-term on our inventory levels, but will give us some significant cost savings as we actually implement that. I think for us, it's really about how we continue to make progress towards our models and I think that the thing we feel good about is the continued progress, albeit that it's probably not at the rate that we would absolutely have liked based on the headwinds that we have in Standard Products, as well as the mix implications of some of the new product design wins. They give us a pretty strong top line growth.
Peter Kelly: I was just going to add one thing really, I mean, it's -- what we're talking about is a slowing in the overall growth of our margin. As we mentioned, it's the impact of these high volume design wins. But the good side of the high volume design wins is it does gives us the ability to go after more cost reduction. It just takes a little bit longer to show fruit. So there is another positive to this.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Understand. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up on the end market commentary. You talked about the Industrial & Infrastructure area being up in the low teens which seems substantially better than most of your peers have already reported. You talked about some of the strength in base stations that you're seeing. Is that a broad market increase or is that just a matter of specific design wins you have ramping in this quarter?
Richard L. Clemmer: I think it's more of the design win side. I think when you look at 3G and LTE, we've talked about the -- we believe we have a very strong position and clearly, when you think about the revenue ramp associated with base station it's going to be more likely to be in the 3G and LTE areas. So I think that's a contributing factor and it's somewhat driven by customer by customer basis depending on where the inventory levels are, et cetera. So as we talked about before, the HPRF area is one that swings around quite significantly over a period of time based on the customer demands and how successful they are with their new design wins associated with it. But in the current time frame, at least, we see the requirements and expectations from customers that drive that stronger basis in the near term. But I think it's more of customer-specific than a broad increasing end market associated with it, Jim.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer representing Credit Suisse.
John W. Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: A couple of questions on revenue and a couple of questions on gross margins. On the revenue front, Rick, can you help me understand if you were to kind of differentiate between the core business and new product opportunities. Are you essentially guiding the core business flat for the September quarter and all the growth is coming from new products? I thought that I understood that until I got the guidance for the Infrastructure & Industrial business.
Richard L. Clemmer: So I would say that if you had to break down our range, the 6% to 12% which is clearly, we think a very positive momentum. It's probably something like 0% to 4% that's kind of in our core business, something like that, with the remainder of it coming from the incremental design wins and the ramp up associated with our ID business to try to put it perspective, John.
John W. Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And then my second question, guys, just on gross margins, the headwind in Standard Products. Is that pricing headwind or volume headwind or both? And then when you think about the mix in the High Performance Mixed Signal, any sense now relative to how you think mix is going to play out, at what revenue level on a quarterly run rate basis you need to be to kind of hit the target margins that you have out there?
Richard L. Clemmer: So on both of those -- so if you look at the Standard Products, I think it's a combination of volume and pricing. I mean, clearly the pricing environment, when you are kind of in this lull or slow-ish period compared to a year ago, you see a more aggressive pricing environment. And we've talked about that we saw early in the year as much price decline as we typically see on an annual basis. So I think we see that pricing impact in Standard Products but as much as anything else, it's probably the economic environment. Now there was just a report this morning talking about a positive associated with the economic environment in China, which could bode well for going forward. But clearly, we don't see that in the near-term relative to the demand in Standard Products. And I think relative gross margin, I don't think it's as much about the actual revenue volume that we're at to be able to drive that. I think we have to go through a little bit of this transition. We have to get Standard Products back within the model range that we would like for them to participate in and we have to get through kind of this transitionary period with some of these new design wins that are a little bit lower gross margin but actually pretty strong on the operating income level, because it doesn't require the same level of R&D or sales and marketing investment associated with it. So I think when we look at it, we're clearly focused on ensuring that we're adding shareholder value with the strong revenue growth contributing on the bottom line operating income that may require a little bit of tempering for a period of time associated with just our specific gross margin model, but give us still the ability to move towards our operating income levels on a timely fashion.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya representing Bank of America.
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Rick, first, very strong growth and very positive message, very different from what we are hearing from the rest of the ecosystem. I'm wondering how are you getting the comfort that there is no overbid in the channel anywhere. For instance, your Standard Products sales were up, I believe 8%, but [indiscernible] sales were up 3%. So just how are you getting the comfort? How are you putting the safeguards in place to make sure there is no overbid?
Richard L. Clemmer: Well so I guess, you're talking about more on Standard Products than on an across the board basis. In Standard Products I think the key factor for us is even though we're in a tough market environment, our focus in Standard Products is to move to some of the new areas, our thrust areas with ESD protection, where some of the new smartphones and tablets may require 10 to 12 or 13 ESD circuits where a typical feature phone in the past would only require one ESD circuit. So clearly, one of the things that has driven the near-term growth is some of the ramp-up associated with the ESD protection into some of those key customers on the smartphones and tablet area. And then that kind of normalizes out a little bit as we go forward. And clearly, with the very uncertain economic environment we're somewhat more cautious relative to the outlook of our Standard Products going forward. But we clearly do not believe that there's any significant inventory build whatsoever in our Standard Products area and we think that we continue to operate within the range we would like to. We would like for our Standard Products inventory level to be a little bit above the overall company basis just because of the actual individual price point associated with it, but we don't see any increased -- significant increase to inventory levels in the channel in Standard Products at all.
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Got it. You mentioned mobile as a key growth area in smartphones and tablets. I'm curious, is your NFC product capable of supporting all mobile operating systems, Android, Windows and iOS? Or is it focused on Android only?
Richard L. Clemmer: We publicly announced it. It will support Windows and it does support Android as we spent a lot of time talking about. With the 200 handsets and tablets -- smartphones and tablets that we've won the design win associated with it, I think that kind of speaks for itself.
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Got it. And just one last one for Peter. First, welcome, and second, with your background on the operational side, I'm wondering what kind of changes and improvements should we expect to see over the next several quarters?
Peter Kelly: I'm sorry, changes in the company? Could you just be a little bit clearer?
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Yes. Any change in strategy? Any change in focus? Any change on the financial side in terms of deleveraging targets, et cetera?
Peter Kelly: No. I think one of the good things is I've come from within the company and the strategy we have for the company overall is one that's decided by the leadership team. So I've been very involved in the last year as have the other team members in defining and agreeing to our strategy. So I'm kind of pretty comfortable where we are really. So no, I don't have any big plans to change anything.
Richard L. Clemmer: Just to continue to improve performance.
Peter Kelly: Yes, yes.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line Chris Caso representing Susquehanna Financial.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: I just wonder if you could go over some of the comments on distribution again. And it sounded like last quarter that the distribution inventory was up a bit in dollars anticipating some of these design wins you talked about now and it looks like sell-in was up greater than sell-through again. To what extent -- as we look forward, what should we expect the distributor inventories to do over the next couple of quarters? Should we expect those to come down as some of these design wins do start to sell-out through distribution?
Richard L. Clemmer: I think, we feel like our distribution inventory levels are well within the range we'd like to operate in and on the months-of-inventory basis was flat from the Q1 time frame. So while there could be some sell-out with the actual shipments of some of the new design wins associated with it, if the economic environment were to create a little more stability, then I think there would be an inclination on the part of our distribution partners to put a little more inventory in place. So I don't know that we would expect to see any decrease whatsoever in the distribution inventory levels going forward, but it's not like we expect to see a significant increase either. We think that they're operating at what we believe to be normal range and no indications of any kind of problem areas at all.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: As a follow-up, could you talk a bit about where your fab utilization is right now and as I guess as we look forward, what the impact on lead times right now. I think you said the lead times were increased a little bit last quarter. Well, could you give us an update on that?
Peter Kelly: So the fab utilization in Q2 was 92%, which is up from up 84% in Q1. And I guess in terms of lead time, 92% the fabs are running pretty effectively and an increasing part of our wafer production is coming from external fabs as we go through the year.
Richard L. Clemmer: So I think our lead times vary greatly from product to product. So while in Standard Products, we could have fairly short lead times based on being able to ship from inventory, in some of the cases associated with our ID business, we actually are trying to edge out all the capacity we can, because one of the things that provided the Q2 ability to perform above our guidance was the fact that we're able to squeeze some additional output out of our manufacturing facilities where we're capacity limited in the case of our ID business. They gave us that upside. So it's really focused on the individual product capability and the capacity that's in place. And lead times in some of our Standard Products would actually be quite short in the current environment while clearly in the case of our ID business, it's more of booked out and it's about how we squeeze out additional capacity either through our foundry partners or from our internal manufacturing facilities.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh representing Sterne Agee.
Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Just looking at your gross margins again. Sorry to beat a dead horse, but is that leverage -- if you can get more leverage on the gross margin line by tweaking your Standard Products portfolio?
Richard L. Clemmer: I'm sorry. Ask the question again. I -- it wasn't so clear, the connection.
Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: I'm just wondering, trying to get your margins up, is there more leverage if you go slow on the Standard Products side, because obviously that has a lower margin mix too, right?
Richard L. Clemmer: It does. I think the key for us in Standard Products is keeping our factories loaded. Now as we've talked about, this is not a strategic business for us. It's about generating cash and providing us the scale with our distribution partners where the combination of our Standard Products and HPMS business allows us to be the second-largest semiconductor company through the distribution channel and gets us the scale on a manufacturing volume where we produced well over 70 billion units a year based on the combination of the 2. So the Standard Products provides that cash and the capability, but clearly we need to improve their performance so they begin to move back within the range that we have established associated with it and that's a priority for us in Standard Products, is how we do that. But we clearly -- there's a trade-off associated with loading the facilities versus the pricing environment at which you can sell that product. And that's what they're very focused on how they maximize associated with it.
Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Got it. I agree. I think good growth there. I think just last question here. What are time lines on how you're paying down the debt here over the next 4 or 6 quarters?
Peter Kelly: Well, we don't talk specifically about what we plan with the individual part of the debt. But I guess the comment I would make is, in terms of our interest payments, we'd look to exit the year with about $65 million in a quarter. So we'd see next year as in the range of $240 million to $260 million. So clearly, we have funds to pay down the debt.
Richard L. Clemmer: And I think probably the key thing is if you look at the last 12 months we've actually reduced the debt by about $865 million.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Franklin Jarman representing Goldman Sachs.
Franklin Jarman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I guess the first question I had was just with regards to your capacity utilization trending a little bit above 90% now, how should we think about capital spending plans going forward?
Richard L. Clemmer: Well, we'd said that we would spend about 5% over a cycle and so we might be up a point in areas in periods of time where we're capacity constrained such as we are today in our ID business. So clearly, it's very important that we make the right kind of investments to be able to support our customers where we have the unique sole source position associated with that. So I would assume that we might spend as much as 6% this year associated with that, but it's still in line with the 5% over the overall cycle associated with it. It's not like that you'll see us jump up to double digit percentage. But clearly, we might spend a percentage up now versus a percentage below that 5% overall range in periods of time where we don't have that requirement for the investment in capacity.
Franklin Jarman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: That's great. And just as a follow-up, given the cash that we saw deployed towards share repurchase, can you just talk about your commitment to achieving the 2x net leverage target that you've talked about in the past? How are you thinking about the ultimate timing here? We've seen net leverage sort of flat. Obviously, you've made a lot of improvements here at this point but can you talk a little bit about the longer-term goal towards 2x?
Richard L. Clemmer: We clearly have the top priority for the company to get below 2x leverage and we would expect that to be measured in quarters, not years. That doesn't mean that every dollar that we generate will absolutely go to that. There'll be trade-offs associated with it. Where we have a requirement for some future equity to be able to deliver the best return for our shareholders, we may actually repurchase some stock at minimal levels such as what we talked about in this case. But there is -- let there no confusion. Our top priority is on continuing to drive our debt down until we get below the 2x basis.
Peter Kelly: Yes, I think -- and obviously, the other really great thing is as we increase our revenue and profitability, as our actuals for this last quarter, our guidance for the next quarter demonstrates, that makes it easier and easier to pay the debt down. It obviously gives us a better EBITDA line as well.
Franklin Jarman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And I know you guys don't want to talk about exactly how you're going to go after the 2013 maturities, but could I think of that as potentially being addressed with cash on hand rather than being refinanced?
Peter Kelly: Well, I definitely have to pay it off next year. So I guess I'd say that.
Richard L. Clemmer: And we don't see any problem in just breaking the cash to be able to meet that requirement, I guess, is the only way we can answer that. But we're not going to be specific with our strategic financing decisions in advance.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur representing JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Back in April, the team was of the view that the Standard Products segment could get gross margins back in the range of kind of low to mid-30s within the next 1 to 2 quarters. I know you had 31% in Q2, so the team is making nice progress there. But it sounds like things are a little bit more challenging here in the third quarter. Just wanted to find out what are your expectations for ASP declines, utilizations and gross margins for the segment in Q3?
Richard L. Clemmer: Well I think the best way to kind of summarize all of that, Harlan, is we would not expect to see a significant decline associated with those. We edged up a little bit in Q2, and we think we'll continue to edge up. It's extremely difficult to drive that profit improvement in the current environment but that's the clear objective and the organization is pretty focused on driving that.
Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Great. And then on your base station products, the team has always had solid traction with the China equipment OEMs like ZTE and Huawei. And I know that you've also won some share at guys like Ericsson. So maybe can you just talk about which set of customers are driving the growth in the third quarter and what end market geographies do you think are driving the higher CapEx spend?
Richard L. Clemmer: It's very customer specific and probably inappropriate for us to comment on the specifics by customer, but I think it's pretty much across the board when you look at it. There's some uptick and it may be simply that they had some inventory replenishment that they had to do in their supply chain. But also I think there are some end product design wins that they've been successful at that's driving that. But I would pretty much say that it's across the board at different levels of mix, et cetera. So it's not like it's on a region-by-region basis.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Jake Kimberly, representing Morgan Stanley. [Technical Difficulty] We have a follow-up question from the line of John Pitzer representing Credit Suisse.
John W. Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I thought I'd chime in with a gross margin question because there hasn't been enough of them yet. But when you kind of break apart the revenue stream between HPMS and Standard Products, Rick, I just want to make sure I understand, is it the Standard Products where you see the most headwinds? And when you think about the HPMS product line, you guys have historically talked about a 58% to 63% type gross margin target. I take it since you're sort of endorsing the total gross margin target that HPMS is still on track. Do you get there more quickly than you would getting to kind of your target margin in Standard Products?
Richard L. Clemmer: So John, I think we'd try to talk about that a little bit. I think we'll -- near term, we'll have little bit of pressure on moving absolutely to the target gross margin in HPMS with some of the new high-volume design wins. It won't have the same inherent gross margin characteristics as our normal ongoing business. So we're not backing off of those targets that we put in place. But on the interim basis, if we can drive these higher-volume design wins that drive more significant bottom line operating income level then we're clearly going to be focused on taking advantage of that. Our Standard Products is much more what I would say market sensitive. And clearly we're -- I was pleased that the team made some progress in Q2, but we clearly have more progress that we need to make and it's a high priority of the team and how we drive that. And frankly, the revenue growth in Standard Products is not that important to us. It's about how we balance off the utilization of capacity and support our customers with these new unique design wins on, like, ESD protection but not really be too caught up on the high-volume ultra low-cost products that might drive lower gross margins. So we're trying to balance that off so that we can begin to move closer and closer to the target model but clearly with headwinds from a market environment in Standard Products. But in the case of HPMS, it's more just the mix basis associated with these higher-volume design wins that won't have the same inherent gross margin characteristics but will be bringing us operating income.
John W. Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And then Rick, as a follow-up, how much below kind of the average HPMS gross margin are these new product wins? And typically at any point in a new product ramp, there's an efficiencies. Is that the case with these new products? And will you see incremental improvement in gross margin over the next couple of quarters as you ramp to more volume in the new product design wins?
Richard L. Clemmer: Yes.
John W. Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And then how much below sort of the average HPMS are these new business opportunities?
Richard L. Clemmer: John, I don't think we're prepared to talk about the specifics associated with that. But you and I both know that with the higher-volume design wins that they're associated with, smartphones and tablets, you won't run the same inherent 58% to 63% gross margin of a typical High Performance Mixed Signal portfolio focused on automotive industrial space.
Operator: At this time, there are no further audio questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Clemmer for closing remarks.
Richard L. Clemmer: Well, thanks a lot for joining us this quarter. Again, we were very pleased with the performance in Q2 with the ability to drive revenue growth at 12%. We think clearly shows the fruition of the strategy that we put in place and actually confirms the ability to execute on that even with the anemic macro environment. We look forward to seeing the continued ramp up of those NXP-specific design wins. And clearly, the improved operational performance that allowed us to drive more than a 2x increase in sequential improvement in EPS is something that we're very pleased about as a company, all resulting in a robust cash flow generation of $269 million for the quarter. And just one last comment in closing. As we said, this is kind of Kalle's swan song with us. We really appreciate his contribution that he's made over the life of NXP and want to wish him the best as he moves through a different kind of chip industry out of the semiconductor business. So good luck, Kalle. We wish you well.
Karl-Henrik Sundstroem: Thank you very much. Thank you.
Jeff Palmer: Operator, thank you very much and thank you, everyone, for your interest in NXP. One last point. We are holding our annual analyst day in New York City on September 13. We hope to see you there and thank you, again.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect and have a great day.

===== 2012 Q1  (2012-04-26 00:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to NXP Semiconductors First Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. My name is Caris, and I will be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today, Mr. Jeff Palmer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir. 
Jeff Palmer: Thank you, Caris, and good afternoon, everyone.
 Welcome to the NXP Semiconductors First Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. With me on the call today is Rick Clemmer, NXP's President and CEO; Karlie Sundström, our CFO; and Peter Kelly, our Head of Operations and our newly-appointed CFO who will over from Karlie upon his departure. 
 If you've not obtained the copy of our first quarter 2012 earnings press release, it can be found at our company website under the Investor Relation section at nxp.com. Additionally, we have posted a supplemental earnings summary presentation and an Excel document of our historical financials to assist in your modeling efforts. This call is being recorded and will be available for replay from our corporate website.
 Please be reminded that this call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause NXP's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the macroeconomic impact on the specific end markets in which we operate, the sale of new and existing products and our expectations for financial results for the second quarter of 2012. Please be reminded that NXP undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements. For a full disclosure on forward-looking statements, please refer to our press release. 
 Additionally, during our call today, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the impact of purchase price accounting, restructuring, impairment and other charges that are driven primarily by discrete events that management does not consider to be directly related to NXP's underlying core operating performance.
 Pursuant to Regulation G, NXP has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our first quarter 2012 earnings press release, which will be furnished to the SEC on Form 6-K, and is available on NXP's website in the Investor Relations section at nxp.com.
 Now I'd like to turn the call over to Rick. 
Richard Clemmer: Thanks, Jeff, and welcome, everyone, to our earnings call today. Before I review the results for the first quarter, I'd like to highlight several changes to NXP management team which we announced since our last earnings call. 
 First, it is unfortunate we had to announce the departure of Karlie, who is returning to Sweden. I want to personally thank Karlie for his focus and dedication these last 4 years in helping revitalize and help put NXP on the path to long-term success. Without his tireless efforts, valued insights, financial skills and camaraderie, we may not have gotten the company to where it is today. 
 Moving into the CFO role is Peter Kelly, who has been a member of NXP management team, helping guide the success of our operations organization for over a year. Peter brings over 25 years of relevant financial, operational and technology expertise to the role of CFO. We believe that given the close working relationship between Karlie and Peter, as well as my extended experience with Peter, we anticipate little to no disruption in executing and achieving our financial goals. Additionally, Karlie will continue through the end of July and will assist Peter in the orderly transition. 
 Secondly, we were pleased to announce Dave French has joined NXP in the role of Executive Vice President and General Manager for the newly-created Portable and Computing business unit. Dave brings over 30 years of semiconductor experience. He is well-respected industry veteran who we believe will drive the new business unit and help to continue to refine our customer focus, especially with technology companies which are geographically based in North America. 
 Now I'd like to turn to our results for the first quarter. As is our practice, I will address revenue trends in our various markets and channels, with Karlie providing more color on profitability and the other financial metrics. 
 We are very pleased with our performance in the first quarter as we deliver product revenue of $912 million, up over 6% sequentially and at the high end of our guidance. Total NXP revenue was $978 million, up 5% sequentially and near the upper end of our original guidance range as well. 
 We believe that NXP is in the early stages of a positive cyclical rebound, but more importantly, we are beginning to see tangible acceleration of company-specific design wins, driven by the material adoption of NXP technology. This has resulted in a rebound in order rates with many of our customers and across nearly all our product lines. 
 From a segment perspective, HPMS revenue was $710 million, $17 million above the midpoint of our guidance. Within nearly every one of our focus in market -- end markets, we experienced growth either in line or above our original expectations. 
 Within our Automotive business, revenue was $229 million, up about 5% as we expected. From a product perspective, the quarter for our Automotive group played out in line with our expectations. We experienced strong sequential demand for in-vehicle networking and keyless door entry products, with in-line demand for entertainment products and a slight roll off in sensor demand sequentially. 
 Within our ID business, revenue was $187 million, up 21% sequentially, about 9% better than our original expectations. We experience robust order trends across the entire portfolio with strong growth in our core markets of eGovernment, automatic fare collection and banking, due to a combination of new program launches and the resumption of demand. 
 Taken together, our core ID business grew roughly 20% on a sequential basis. As many of you learned at our recent ID seminar, we continue to believe there is a long and robust tail of growth to play out in our core ID business, due to the secular market trends driving demand across the entire core product portfolio. 
 While many investors are excited about mobile transactions, we would hope investors do not overlook our strong market position with our core markets, which continues to represent over 80% of the ID revenue. The core ID business has very high barriers to entry, with customers who value our long track record of leading investment and security solutions. 
 Within our emerging markets business driven by mobile transaction products, revenue increased by over 30% sequentially and represent the fifth straight quarter of sequential growth. Our NFC design win momentum continues to build and well over 130 unique handset and tablet design wins, with roughly 1/3 of these entering into production in the next couple of quarters.  
 Moving to our Wireless, Lighting and Industrial business, revenue was $121 million, essentially flat on the sequential basis, about 7% below our original expectations. The biggest shortfall was worse than expected demand for our High Performance RF products for the cellular base-station market. We did this as a temporary pause, consistent with other participants in the wireless infrastructure market. We did experience a positive rebound in demand for MCU products that are slightly below our original expectations. Lastly, demand for our Lighting driver products was better than our expectations, but is relatively a small influence in the group's revenue. 
 Turning to our Mobile Consumer and Computing business, revenue was $173 million, up 5%, and about 7% better than we'd originally planned. We experienced very robust improvement in demand for our interface and logic products and several key programs are preparing to enter into production. Additionally, we experienced improved demand for our GreenChip products as the global PC supply chain recovered from the disruptions due to the Thai flooding. Sales of silicon tuners returned to more normal levels after the seasonal strength experienced in the fourth quarter. 
 Finally, turning to our Standard Products business. Revenue was $202 million, up 2% and about 3% better than anticipated. From a channel perspective, we experienced better-than-anticipated demand in the distribution channel, primarily due to demand for logic and interface products. This is due to the previously mentioned key programs which are getting ready to launch into production and will be serviced through our worldwide distribution channel. We saw sells into distribution increased by approximately 9%, as our distribution partners got prepared for anticipating Q2 increased demand,
 while resells out of distribution were up roughly 2% from the prior quarter. Total months of supply on hand at our distribution partners was flat at about 2.4 months, although there remain a typical mix across the portfolio with inventory levels lower in some businesses and higher in others. Absolute dollars of inventory in the channel were essentially flat on a sequential basis. Overall, we do not believe the distribution partners have fully replenished their inventory levels outside of the key programs I previously mentioned. 
 Looking forward, we are encouraged that our efforts over the last few years are delivering tangible results as demonstrated by a combination of our first quarter results and our outlook for the second quarter. We continue to believe the combination of our unique product portfolio, applications knowledge and laser focus on customer requirements should enable NXP to grow in excess of overall semiconductor industry. 
 Now I'd like to turn the call over to Karlie to discuss financial details of the quarter. 
Karl-Henrik Sundström: Thank you, Rick, and good afternoon to everyone on today's call. As Rick has already covered the drivers of the revenue during the quarter, I will move directly to the highlights of the P&L. 
 During Q1, revenue was $978 million, mainly upper end of our original guidance. We generated $433 million in non-GAAP gross profit, $11 million higher sequentially and slightly above the midpoint of our guidance. This resulted in a non-GAAP gross margin of 44.3%, a 110 basis points sequential decline from Q4, which we think represent the worst of the margin compression we should experience. 
 Let me help bridge the changes to gross profit versus the prior quarter. First, we realized a positive impact to gross profit of approximately $24 million due to higher sales on a sequential basis. Secondly, we experienced about $18 million negative impact due to lower factory utilization. As we have said on past calls, in our cost accounting system, the effect of the under or over absorption of fixed costs are recognized essentially one quarter later, which is our average manufacturing cycle time. The impact of the over or under absorption equates to $10 million to $15 million for every 5 points change in utilization. During Q4, our average utilization was 71%, 8 points lower than in Q3. 
 Lastly, the remaining $4 million in sequential positive impact to gross profit in Q1 is due to the reconciliation on nonrecurring items from Q4. The discrete items are non-repeatable items, which were recognized in Q4 and need to be removed in the calculation to correctly bridge the quarter-to-quarter change in gross profit. 
 Turning to the operating segments, within the HPMS segment, non-GAAP gross profit of $366 million, a gross margin of 51.5%, a 90 basis point decline versus the prior quarter due to the items previously discussed. Within our Standard Products segment, non-GAAP gross profit was $59 million or 29.2% of revenue, a 720 basis point sequential decline. 
 Three items contributed to decline in Standard Product gross profits. First, competitive pricing pressure and a worse than anticipated product mix. Second, a package issue, which limited production of certain products during the quarter. Lastly, the impact of lower factory utilization as described previously during the quarter. 
 Total operating expenses were $293 million, up $16 million on a sequential basis. This was about $4 million above our original guidance as we made a decision to increase investments to take advantage on new customer programs we have ramping in our identification business. 
 From an operating profit perspective, total NXP non-GAAP operating profit was $141 million or 14.4%, slightly above the midpoint of our guidance. Interest expense was $76 million, in line with our expectation, and noncontrolling interest was $13 million, a result of improving utilization rates at SSMC. Taken together, total NXP non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.19. 
 Now I would like to turn to the changes in our cash and debt. Cash at the end of Q1 was $782 million, a sequential increase of $39 million. Total debt was $3.83 billion, a sequential increase of $30 million. During the quarter, we completed a $475 million term loan due 2019. We used the combination of the proceeds from the near-term loan plus $330 million of our revolving credit facility to redeem all of our outstanding 2015 debt, enabling us to continue to de-risk our debt maturity profile. The increase in the total debt at the end of Q1 was due to the combination of exchange effects on our euro-denominated debt and financing costs associated with the new term loan and the repayment of 2015 debt. 
 Our total net debt at the end of Q1 was $3.05 billion, a decline of $707 million from the year ago period. We exited the quarter with a trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA of $1.01 billion, an 8% decline versus the year ago period, reflecting the impact of the downturn in the second half of 2011. Taken together, our ratio net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was 3x. 
 Turning to working capital metrics. Days sales of inventory is 102 days, down 2 days, with inventory on a dollar basis essentially flat sequentially. Days receivables were 38 days, down 5 days sequentially, as we improved collections on improving safe churns [ph] throughout the quarter. Days payables was 76, down 1 day sequentially. Taken together, our cash conversion cycle improved to 64 days from 71 days in the prior quarter. 
 Cash flow from operations of $97 million, a result of improving sales, positive working capital metrics and offset by the impact of currency fluctuation on our euro-denominated debt. Net CapEx investments during the quarter was $39 million resulting in a positive free cash flow of $58 million.
 Now I would like to provide our outlook for Q2. As Rick mentioned, we believe we are on the cusp of a solid recovery, due to both improving macro trends, but more importantly, a result of company-specific design wins that have been beginning to play out in our favor. Furthermore, we have experienced very good booking trends since the beginning of the year, which gives us the confidence that we are in the beginning phases of a positive upswing in our business. With these views as a back drop, we currently anticipate product revenue to be in the range of 7% to up 11% sequentially. 
 At the midpoint, we expect product revenue to be up about 9% sequentially in Q2, reflecting the following trends in the business. Automotive is expected to be up in the low single-digit percentage point range; Identification is expected to be up in the high teens percentage point range; Wireless, Lighting and Industrial is expected to be up in the high single-digits percentage point range; Mobile, Consumer and Computing are expected to be up in the mid-single-digit percentage points range; Standard Products is expected to be up in the high single-digit percentage points. We anticipate revenue from the combination of our manufacturing, corporate and other segments to be approximately $59 million. Taken together, total NXP revenue should be up in the range of 6% to 10%. 
 Additional input to help tune your models are as follows: We anticipate non-GAAP gross profit to be in the range of approximately $490 million to $509 million, driven by both higher revenue and improved factory utilization. We anticipate operating expenses in Q2 to be in the range of approximately $300 million to $308 million. The sequential increase is due to a combination of investment in new programs, planned annual merit increases and re-accrual of certain expenses, including bonuses. About half of this sequential increase is due to investment in new programs. 
 In addition, we plan to continue to make strategic investments in new customer programs which will help fuel continued growth. Taken together, this should translate into a non-GAAP operating profit of about $199 million (sic) [$191 million] to $202 million. 
 Net interest expenses should be around $71 million, cash tax expense should be approximately $10 million at the low end of our guidance and about $8 million at the high end, and noncontrolling interest should be about $14 million, plus minus $1 million as utilization of SSMC improves. Average diluted share count should be around 254 million shares. Taken together, our guidance implies non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.38 to $0.43 per share, or approximately $0.40 per share at the midpoint of our guidance range. 
 Now, I would like to turn to your questions. Jeff? 
Jeff Palmer: Operator, could you poll for questions? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] 
Karl-Henrik Sundström: Unless you want to make sure that the EBIT in our guidance is $191 million to $202 million. Some people might have wrote $199 million. It's $191 million to $202 million. 
Operator: And your first question comes from the line of John Pitzer of Crédit Suisse. 
John Pitzer: Quick question guys. When you look at the $50 million of incremental revenue in the March quarter, Rick, can you help me understand how would you characterize as sort of what percent came from the cyclical recovery sort of versus new products? And then when you look out to the June quarter and the sequential revenue growth, again, help us kind of gauge what's new product growth versus kind of the cycle coming back? 
Richard Clemmer: Yes, so I wouldn't say that a lot of our growth in Q1 was really from an improved cyclicality associated with it. If you look at the growth in Q1 revenue, clearly, the strength in our ID business was associated with this. We said some new design wins, as well as the return of orders in some of the other areas. So our ID business clearly had a strong growth associated with that. Our Automotive business, which was up kind of 5% mid-single digit was really partially driven by the flood impacts in Q4 that gave us a low compare relative to the growth. So the growth that we had was not really a lot cyclical. There's probably some contribution associated with improved market environment. It's hard to call out specifics, but maybe 1/3 of it or so. But it was really associated with the new projects, as well as the return of some of the designs associated with our ID business, and then we compare that we had in our Automotive business, as well as the return of some of the business in our microcontroller space as well. When we look at Q2, John, clearly, there's a contribution -- an early contribution from some of the new design wins, but that's relatively small. This is really driven by the same kind of things that we talked about in Q1. Our ID business, clearly, being double-digit growth, associated with Q2 continuing to see more of a robust environment in the Automotive space as well. And then in a combination of our WILI and MCC seeing a combination of return of orders from distribution as we talked about, expected deliveries associated with distribution, as well as some of the early design wins that we've talked about. So while there's some rebound in the basic general semiconductor environment driven by the economic cycle, most of it is driven to company-specific programs that really drive the robust growth that we've seen in Q1 and really project for Q2. 
John Pitzer: And then, Rick, I know you guys have taking great pains to convince us that there's more to the ID business than NFC, but I'm kind of curious, as you think about the NFC ramp, you talked about sort of the 1/3 of your unique design wins potentially ramping over the next couple of quarters. Can you size where that is it a percent of business today and is that a contributor to the June quarter, or do you think it's more for a second half story? 
Richard Clemmer: It's clearly a contributor to the growth that we see but not the only thing that's driving the growth in our ID business. In fact, as we said in Q1, while the -- I think we talked about electronic payments basically being up around 30% and our overall ID business still being around 20% in Q1, so that kind of gives you the perspective. So I think our -- and the payments is clearly driven by our NFC participation at the current time, combined with the secure element that goes with that. So if you look at it, the growth in the NFC solution, including the secure element and the radio in Q1 was about 50% faster than the core ID business. And I think that's not a bad assumption going forward for the next quarter or so either, John. 
John Pitzer: I think as my last question, just around Standard Products. For most of your public life, pricing in that environment was better than you guys expected. You called out pricing as being more of an issue in the March quarter. I'm just kind of curious, is this specific to where we are in the cycle or do you think this is now the new norm in the business? And as we think about target margins, gross margins for that business, do we need to recalibrate that or not? 
Richard Clemmer: Not at all, John. I think we feel like this is kind of a one quarter anomaly. If we look at the pricing environment associated with it, we saw as much quarterly price reduction in Q1 as we would typically see on an annual basis roughly. So clearly, that combined with some of the manufacturing issues that we had in the back end, et cetera, drove the gross margin deterioration, but we would not expect it to be a new norm and it's really to be anomaly for the one quarter basis. 
Karl-Henrik Sundström: So John, we believe that we will go in to the model, the financial model within a quarter or 2. 
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Jim Covello of Goldman Sachs. 
James Covello: I guess the June quarter margins are really reflecting terrific leverage in the model. Could you give us some sort of idea about where margins could go based on utilization rates, and I mean, is the right assumption that utilization rates plus mix are the 2 main drivers of margins going forward? And then assuming a constant mix, how much of an increase in utilization would drive how much of an increase in margins? 
Karl-Henrik Sundström: As we have said all the time, it is like it worked down especially in Q4 and Q1. So based on 5 percentage points shift in utilization, we will get a $10 million to $15 million benefit in the following quarter. And that's what you see, that's what's driving up the margin in the guidance that we have provided today. And we don't give a forecast of the margins going forward into Q2, but as you see, it's driving up right now. 
Richard Clemmer: If I could just add to Karlie's point, as we said before, there's nothing structurally different in our business that wouldn't allow us to get to utilization back up where we were in the first half of last year. So given the algorithm that Karlie has given you, you can kind of do the calculation where gross profit can get to. 
James Covello: And then Karlie, I think you -- I believe you have said average utilization in the March quarter was 71%. Any estimate -- how would we -- how would you think about modeling that from where we are to back where it was? Is that a pretty linear relationship? 
Karl-Henrik Sundström: So we had 71% in Q4 which is moving to -- moved to 84% in Q1 2012. 
Richard Clemmer: But, Jim, remember the 71% was really what was reflected in the financials with the one quarter delay associated with the impact. So clearly, that transition from 71% to 84% is going to have a significant improvement in our gross margins that will be reflected in the Q2 quarter, as we said in the projection. 
James Covello: Right, right. And then final question for me, as your utilization rates go from the 71% to the 84%, you're experiencing lead time changes in any of the key product areas? 
Peter Kelly: Jim, it's Peter Kelly. Yes, lead times have increased a little, but they're pretty manageable at the moment. Certainly, a lot less than they were a year ago. 
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Barclays. 
Christopher Muse: If I could follow up on Jim's gross margin question. You're guiding roughly 100 bps below your prior peak in 2011, yet utilization rate, that is arguably 15 points below where you were then. So curious, where can we go here in the coming quarters as utilization rises? I know you've talked about the 5-point shift $10 million to $15 million. Can that continue, so roughly $45 million if we get back up to the high 90s utilization? 
Peter Kelly: Yes, we did. Sorry, it's Peter Kelly. If we get back up to the high 90s utilization, we think we have a fairly robust model and certainly, that utilization gives us better margin. 
Richard Clemmer: Yes, going from the floor or the trough at 71%, so if you add up to the high 90s, that's more like at probably a 25% or so. So for every 5, $10 million to $15 million, that roughly approximate 1% to 1.5% sort of gross margin. 
Christopher Muse: Okay, that's helpful. And as a follow-up, I know you guys refinanced your debt in the last month or so, and my understanding is roughly $25 million annual savings. So curious when we see that reflecting into the model? Can you provide a little help there? 
Karl-Henrik Sundström: Part of it is already reflected in my guidance because we have $76 million in interest expenses in Q1 and the guidance I having, it's $71 million in Q2, which is basically the $280 million annualized and we believe we're going to be between $270 million and $280 million leaving this year in run rate. 
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. 
Vivek Arya: Again, you do -- not to beat this horse on gross margin, but I think you've addressed the utilization aspect. I wanted to understand the mix aspects also within the different segments of HPMS. How should we think about the roadmap? And HPMS gross margins from here to, I think, longer-term targets are closer to 60%. What role does mix play when we look at some of the higher growth segments of HPMS, like Identification and Automotive? 
Richard Clemmer: So I think when you look at it, clearly, we still believe that our model that we've set in place for 58%, 60% or so gross margin is still intact for HPMS products. And so, we think as we get our factory utilization back up where the factories who are truly humming, then we see the opportunity to begin to move into that level. I think that when you look at some of the new design wins that are focused when areas of high-volume smartphones, et cetera, we may not be at the absolute 60%-plus gross margin. So we might see a slight trailing off of those margins, but with the significant growth opportunity that it drives on the top line we'll still be very generously rewarded in our financial results. So it's really not a mix issue as much as it is, just the performance issue associated with our manufacturing operations and ensuring that the factory utilization levels get back up to the same levels that we were able to demonstrate in the Q1 and Q2 time frame for 2011. 
Vivek Arya: Got it. And then, Rick, one on the Automotive segment, you've clearly seen some pickup. But when I look at end market demand, that continues to do extremely well. You think you are catching up to end market demand? Should we expect a better second half on the Automotive side? 
Richard Clemmer: I think that we had -- if you look at Automotive, there hasn't been anything normal in the last 4 or 5 quarters. First off, we started with the tsunami and didn't really have an impact at the time that it occurred and we really saw the impact on revenue in the Q3 time frame as they aligned their supply chain which drove the Automotive business down slightly. And then following on to that were the Thai floods in Q4 having a tempering effect associated with the revenue as well. So we saw the improvement in Q1 and then we expect to see the growth again in Q2 associated with that. So yes, I think we feel very good about our Automotive business. We continue to win significant new design wins, although those clearly are out a couple of years, they aren't going to generate revenue in the near term in Automotive space. And we think that we'll clearly be in a position where we'll go faster than the automotive semiconductor market. 
Vivek Arya: Got it. And just one last one. I know that the last few quarters are not exactly been seasonal because of various disruption in the market, but how should we think about Q3, Q4 just seasonal trends depending on your different segments? 
Richard Clemmer: Our Q3 is usually a pretty good quarter for us. We usually trail off a little bit in Q4 and I don't know why we wouldn't expect some kind of seasonality that would follow in a similar pattern to this year. 
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis with Jefferies. 
Mark Lipacis: Manufacturing lead times to customers did -- I may have missed this, Peter, but did you say that there was any change as in those lead times to your own customers as you've gone from 71% to 84% utilization? And I was wondering at what level of utilization do your own lead times start to stretch out a little bit? 
Peter Kelly: Well, I guess I'd answer it in a couple of ways. One, the lead times have increased a little less than I said though, they're still well below what they were a year ago. In terms of our utilization, we have a tiered manufacturing model, so we use 3 sources of supply, our internal supply, external supply and our JVs, so we can support significantly higher revenues with that model than if we just owned our manufacturing. So I wouldn't focus totally on just what we build internally. 
Richard Clemmer: And, Mark, you had to be a little careful with lead times as well because we take into account our capacity. We actually have some capacity constraint in some specific areas. So we clearly have seen a little bit of movement associated with that, but we're trying to keep those more in a normal range, but it also depends on what we can commit to customers relative to the capacity constraints we have as well. 
Mark Lipacis: I understand. That's helpful. I don't know if I heard this, did you quantify the channel inventories and where they -- or if you can't quantify them, could you just give a sense of where they are within the normal historical range? Have they completely... 
Richard Clemmer: Yes, we said that in distribution, it's about 2.4 months, which is consistent with where it was last quarter. And we actually had -- we shipped in a little bit higher than they shipped out as they prepared for some of their expected improved deliveries in the Q2 time frame. But the actual dollar level of inventories was approximately the same. 
Mark Lipacis: Fair enough. Last question, OpEx growth, going forward, I guess we were modeling a slight increase going forward on a dollar basis. They came up a little bit more, I guess, than we expected. Does that mean that we continue to model off of the higher base or should we take some of that back? 
Karl-Henrik Sundström: No. So in the guidance, I gave that we're going to between $300 million and $308 million for Q2. Part of that, around half of that increase from the $293  million is actually customer-specific programs that we invest to achieve our growth, and half of it is basically an annual merit increases and their re-accrual bonuses. And the reason is that we we're very -- as I've said in my remarks that the reason why we came up approximately $4 million higher end of guidance was basically that we invested in some special programs in the Identification area and because we wanted the fuel the grow. Because Identification came in a lot higher in sales than we anticipated. They grow 21% sequentially. 
Mark Lipacis: I understand. I guess I was referring to the back half of the year. Is that -- do we still continue to think about OpEx growing steadily through the back half of the year? 
Karl-Henrik Sundström: Yes, it will grow but it will grow slower than sales, and that's the way we work now. And it will be growth and I said like 3 to 6 or something like that per quarter, but then you have to take into consideration what we think the sales is going to be, so we will guide carefully quarter-by-quarter going forward. 
Richard Clemmer: And we have to be a little careful that as we have sell upsides, obviously, there's sales bonuses and bonuses that go along with that, which has a very good return associated with it, Mark. 
Jeff Palmer: If I could add one thing, Mark, this is Jeff, is there's settlement is also [ph] if you compare our view of the future today versus last quarter, we have a better view in terms of a richer design pipe. We see better opportunities ahead of us even when we saw a short 90 days ago, Mark. And so we're going to continue to invest to take advantage of those design opportunities. 
Karl-Henrik Sundström: And as I've said, we manage our OpEx very carefully, and you saw that during the second half of last year when we didn't have sales, we took out OpEx. And now we see sales coming back and we will invest when we find it appropriate. 
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Sanjay Devgan with Morgan Stanley. 
Sanjay Devgan: I just had a question specific to the Wireless Infrastructure business. A lot of chatter are that business being particularly weak. A few folks have commented that it's coming back. I was wondering if you could give us some color or more granularity as to what you're seeing by geography? And also anything you can give us by area interface would be really appreciated. And also how you kind of project that business going forward into the back half of the year? 
Richard Clemmer: It clearly was weaker than we had planned. As we said in the script in Q2 is certainly not coming back as strongly as we would originally have anticipated or like to. We, I guess, we perceive the increase associated with it will be pushed out to kind of the second half of the year, with maybe some of the LTE increase happening a little earlier than the other 3G increases taking place. But it's clearly not the strongest segment in our portfolio, and the increased environment or improved environment we think is kind of being pushed back to the second half of the year. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] 
Jeff Palmer: Well, operator, if there is no additional questions at this time, I supposed we'll bring the call to a close. Rick, would you like to make any closing remarks today? 
Richard Clemmer: Yes. Thanks, Jeff. So thanks a lot for your interest and attention on NXP. We think that the growth of over 6% in Q1, with the opportunity to see product revenue growth of 7% to 11% in Q2 clearly begins to demonstrate what we've been talking about for some time on the design wins and the fact that it will drive our top line growth at a faster rate than overall semiconductor industry. And then that combined with the improved factory utilization that we see taking our gross margins up and being able to drive significant bottom line improvement. And we look forward to your continued participation, and thank you very much for joining us today. 
Jeff Palmer: Great. Thank you, everyone, and we'll speak to you on our next call. Thank you. 
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day.
